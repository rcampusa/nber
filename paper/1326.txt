                  The Lucas Critique and the Volcker Deflation

                                      ABSTRACT




         This paper examines, in light of the Lucas Critique, the behavior of the

Phillips curve and of the term structure of interest rates after October

1 979.


         It   starts with an informal account of the policy change and then

discusses how we might expect these two relations to shift after such a

change.

         It finds little evidence of a direct effect of the policy change on the

Phillips curve, at least until 1982. It finds substantial evidence of a

direct effect on term structure.

                             by Olivjer J. Blanchard*



      Robert Lucas warned us in 1976 [1976] that our econometric models were, by

 their very design, likely to perform poorly in the face of policy regime changes.

 The US econorny has in the last four years experienced precisely such a change,

 namely a change in monetary policy. Now is therefore a good time to study how

 two of the central macroeconometric equations, the Phillips curve and the term

structure of interest rates, have fared during that period.

     The paper has four sections. The first is an informal account of the policy

change and of its effects. The second discusses how we might expect the Phillips

curve and the term structure equations to shift in the face of such a policy

change. The third and fourth are empirical examinations of the behavior of pre-

1979 Phillips curves and term structure equations in the last four years.



I. A brief description of events.

     In October 1979, the Fed announced a change in monetary policy.

Technically, the change was only in operating procedures, a shift from interest

rate to money stock targeting; target growth ranges for the monetary aggregates

were left unchanged.1 This technical change was however intended to be both a

signal of the Fed's commitment and a prerequisite to lower money growth and

lower inflation.

     In retrospect, there is little doubt that this commitment was a serious one.

Assessing the reality of the change was however much more difficult in the period

following October 1979. Faced with what it perceived to be autonomous velocity

shifts, the Fed chose partial accommodation, leading to large and erratic

fluctuations in monetary aggregates.2 As a result, the policy change was neither

instantaneously perceived nor instantaneously believed. Direct evidence on the

beliefs of financial markets suggests the following:3 From October 1979 to

December 1980, there was considerable doubt as to whether the Fed was committed

to the reduction of inflation; in particular, doubts were fueled, in the spring

and summer of 1980, by a decrease in short—term nominal rates in the face of the

first recession. This decrease was interpreted by many as showing the

unwillingness of the Fed to accept the recession.     Doubts seem to have

disappeared in the first half of 1981, due partly to the election of a new

administration and partly to the Fed's policy of high interest rates. The

increase in interest rates in June 1981, in the face of a second recession, seems
                                              markets' beliefs. Direct evidence on
to have been decisive in shifting financial

the beliefs of labor market participants is sparse;
                                                        there is little to suggest

                                                 into account in labor contract
that the change in policy was explicitly taken

negotiations, apart from its effects through unemployment.
                                                       description of the effects of
     This paper is not the place to give a thorough

the policy change. We just note that, largely as a result of the change,
                                         under 5% in 1982, most of the gains being
inflation declined from 10% in 1979 to

achieved in 1982. At the same time unemployment rose from 5.8% in 1979 to just

under 10% in 1982.
                                                                         3



      To summarize, although there was a definite policy change, it was not

 immediately believed by all agents. Direct, informal evidence suggests that it

took more than a year to fully change the beliefs of financial markets, perhaps

more than that to change those of labor markets. Thus, in the next section, we

address the question of how the economic structure might evolve in response to

such a policy change.



II. The effects of a policy change.

     The monetary mechanism embodied in the econometric models is an intricate

one, going from real money balances to short nominal rates, to long rates and

asset prices, to the components of aggregate demand and finally to unemployment

and price movements. I focus on two of the links for which expectations are

usually believed to play an important role; the first is the relation between

short and long nominal rates, or "term structure" relation, the second is the

relation between inflation and unemployment, or "Phillips curve" relation.

     Let's think of nominal money growth as following a stationary process around

a positive mean and of the policy change as a decrease in this meán. How will

the two estimated equations perform after the change? More precisely, will the

estimated Phillips curve, given unemployment, under— or overpredict inflation?

Will the estimated term structure relation, given the short rate, under— or

overpredict the long rate?5

     Consider first the Phillips curve. Most recent macroeconomic models,

whether of the imperfect information or contracting varieties, have the same

qualitative implication: estimated Phillips curves, that is, estimated relations

between inflation and unemployment, will overpredict the effects of a fully
                                                        If, as in the original
anticipated movement in money growth on unemployment.
                                                                            4



 model by Lucas, there are no predetermined elements affecting the behavior of

 prices and wages, and if the policy change is instantaneously believed, inflation

 will decrease with little movement in unemployment. The Phillips curve will

 therefore, given unemployment, consistently overpredict inflation. If however,

 prices and wages depend on past decisions or anticipations, the trade—off becomes

 more favorable as time passes and as decisions or anticipations formed before the

 policy change play less and less of a role. The quality of the Phillips curve

 forecasts may then deteriorate only slowly. The same is true if agents do not

instantaneously believe the change in policy but slowly revise their beliefs as

they observe lower average money growth. In the limiting case where agents do

not believe the policy change at all, they do not change the way they form

expectations and the quality of the Phillips curve forecasts may remain the same

as before the change.

     Turning to the term structure, what happens is more ambiguous. Assume that

the movement of short and long rates is determined by the expectations

hypothesis, so that the long rate is approximately a weighted average of current

and expected future short rates. As in general, expected future rates move less

than current rates, long rates move in the same direction as, but by less than

short rates; this is what is captured by empirical term structure equations.

Suppose now that there is little predetermination in prices and that the policy

change is believed by both labor and financial markets; then although real money

balances may be temporarily lower and the short-term nominal rate higher,

anticipations are of lower inflation, of lower nominal rates in the future. The

long—term nominal rate might well decline as the short rate increases; the

estimated term structure will, given the short rate, overpredict the long rate.

Suppose, on the other hand, that prices and wages are largely predetermined or
                                                                                              5




 that labor markets are less convinced of the existence of a policy change than

 financial markets. Financial markets will anticipate inflation to decrease only

 slowly, real money balances to be lower for a sustained period of time. They

will anticipate nominal rates to remain high for a long period of time: long

rates may increase by nearly as much as short rates. The estimated term

structure will, given the short rate, underpredict the long rate. To summarize,

whether the term structure under— or overpredicts long rates depends on the speed

at which financial markets expect inflation to decline after the policy change.



III. The Phillips curve during 1979—1983.

        We choose to concentrate on the Phillips curve of the DRI model, as

specified and estimated in 1978. It is representative of other wage-price

Phillips curves. We have also examined the wage—wage Phillips curve specified by

Gorge Perry [197816; the results were similar and are not reported here.

        The DRI Phillips curve is specified as:7
                        •          •e
          =
               0

                                                                                          •
where         denotes wage inflation, with w being the BLS earnings index: p_1 denotes
                                                                                  •

lagged inflation, with p being the implicit price deflator; e denotes "expected
inflation", expressed as a geometric distributed lag of past inflation, with

decay coefficient .15; u is the unemployment rate for married males. The unit

period is the quarter.

     The upper half of Table 1 gives the results of estimation as years are added

to the sample. There is extremely little change in the coefficients until 1982,

thus no apparent direct —               credibility     —   effects   of the policy change. There is,

from '82 on, some evidence of an increase of a1 compared to a, that is a

decrease in the mean lag effect of price inflation on wage

regression, some evidence of a larger effect of unemployment on wage inflation:

this is more likely due to the very high unemployment rate in 1983 than to direct

policy—change effects. The impression of stability is confirmed by the subsample

stability tests reported in the last column. 8

       The lower half of Table 1 gives one period ahead forecast errors using

actual values of the right hand side variables, and the equation estimated over

1964—2 to 1979—3. The errors are small until the end of 1981: there is again no

noticeable effect of the policy change. The errors are however consistently

negative from 1981—4 on: actual inflation is less than predicted; three of these

forecast errors, including two in 1983, are more than twice the standard error of

the regression (Forecast errors, using the Perry-type wage-wage equations, are

also consistently negative from 1981—4 on.) This might indicate a potential,

though belated effect of the policy change.

       Overall, there is no evidence of a major shift in the Phillips curve. This

in no way implies that the above relation is a correctly specified, structural
                                                                      unemployment, has not

                                                           This may be due either to unchanged

                                           to expectations playing little role in the
ways of forming expectations, or

 where the long—term rate RL is the yield on AAA bonds; the short—term rate      is

 the three month rate on prime commercial paper, fT is the rate of CPI inflation

and V is an index of variability of the short rate, measured as an 8—quarter

moving variance of R5. The distributed lag structures are third degree

polynomials.

     The upper half of Table 2 gives the results of estimation as years are added

to the sample.   (The first line gives the results of estimation over the original

sample period.) There is, except in the last year, no clear change in the

coefficients; there is however a rapid deterioration of fit. The standard error

of the residual increases from 25 to 45 basis points. Subsample stability tests,

reported in the last column, show each of the years to be significantly different

from previous ones.

     The lower half of Table 2 gives one period ahead forecast errors, usin'

actual values of the right hand side variables and the equations estimated over

1954—4 to 1979—2. From 1980—1 to 1982—3, forecast errors are large and positive.

Although forecast errors from 1982-1 on may be ascribed to unexpectedly large

prospects of fiscal deficits, those from 1980—1 to 1981—4 are likely due to the

change in monetary policy. Thus expectations appear to have changed and the term

structure is very much subject to the Lucas critique. The fact that forecast

                                              financial markets slowly believed the
errors are positive suggests that, although

policy change, they did not expect inflation to slow down rapidly, did not expect

labor markets to react to the policy change.   This is consistent with the

evidence on the Phillips curve presented above.
