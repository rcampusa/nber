                                           ABSTRACT

       In the setting of "affine" jump-diffusion state processes, this paper provides an analytical
treatment of a class of transforms, including various Laplace and Fourier transforms as special cases,
that allow an analytical treatment of a range of valuation and econometric problems. Example
applications include fixed-income pricing models, with a role for intensity-based models of default,
as well as a wide range of option-pricing applications. An illustrative example examines the
implications of stochastic volatility and jumps for option valuation. This example highlights the
impact on option 'smirks' of the joint distribution ofjumps in volatility and jumps in the underlying
asset price, through both amplitude as well as jump timing.

 1 Introduction
In valuing financial securities in an arbitrage-free environment, one inevitably
faces a trade-off between the analytical and computational tractability of
pricing and estimation, and the complexity of the probability model for the
state vector X. In the light of this trade-off, academics and practitioners
alike have found it convenient to impose sufficient structure on the condi-
tional distribution of X to give closed- or nearly closed-form expressions for
securities prices. An assumption that has proved to be particularly fruitful
in developing tractable, dynamic asset pricing models is that X follows an
 affine jump-diffusion (AJD), which is, roughly speaking, a jump-diffusion
process for which the drift vector, "instantaneous" covariance matrix, and
jump intensities all have affine dependence on the state vector. Prominent
among AJD models in the term-structure literature are the Gaussian and
square-root diffusion models of Vasicek [1977] and Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross
[1985]. In the case of option pricing, there is a substantial literature building
on the particular affine stochastic-volatility model for currency and equity
prices proposed by Heston [1993].
    This paper synthesizes and significantly extends the extant literature on
affine asset pricing models by deriving a closed-form expression for an "ex-
tended transform" of an AJD process X, and then showing that this trans-
form leads to analytically tractable pricing relations for a wide variety of
valuation problems. More precisely, fixing the current date t and a future
payoff date T, suppose that the stochastic "discount rate" R(X), for com-
puting present values of future cash flows, is an affine function of X. Also,
consider the generalized terminal payoff function (vo + v1 XT) euX(T) of XT,
where v0 is scalar and the n elements of each of the v1 and u are scalars.
These scalars may be real, or more generally, complex. We derive a closed-
form expression for the transform


            E (exp (_ 1T R(X8, s) ds) (v0 + v1 XT) eT),                    (1.1)

where E denotes expectation conditioned on the history of X up to t. Then,
using this transform, we show that the tractability offered by extant, special-
ized affine pricing models extends to the entire family of AJDs. Additionally,
by selectively choosing the payoff (v0+v1 .XT) e'(T), we significantly extend
the set of pricing problems (security payoffs) that can be tractably addressed

                                       2
with X following an AJD. To motivate the usefulness of our extended trans-
form in theoretical and empirical analyses of affine models, we briefly outline
three applications.

1.1 Affine, Defaultable Term Structure Models
There is a large literature on the term structure of default-free bond yields
that presumes that the state vector underlying interest rate movements fol-
lows an AJD (see, e.g., Dai and Singleton [1999] and the references therein).
Assuming that the instantaneous riskless short-term rate Tt is an affine func-
tion of an n-dimensional AJD process X (that is Tt = Po + ,oi X) ]Duffie
and Kan [1996] show that the (T — t)-period zero-coupon bond price,


                               E (exp (JT))                                            (1.2)

is known in closed form, where expectations are computed under the risk-
neutral measure.1
    Recently, considerable attention has been focused on extending these
models to allow for the possibility of default in order to price corporate
bonds and other credit-sensitive instruments.2 To illustrate the new pricing
issues that may arise with the possibility of default, suppose that default
is governed by a stochastic intensity A and that, upon default, the holder
recovers a constant fraction w of face value. Then, from results in Lando
[1998], the price of a (T — t)-period zero-coupon bond is given under techni-
cal integrability conditions by

                       + A8) ds)) + w f E
E (exp (_ f(rs                                      (s exp ( f8( + A) du)) ds.
                                                                                       (1.3)
The first term in (1.3) is the value of a claim that pays $1 contingent on
survival to maturity T, while the second term is the value of the claim that
pays w at date s should the issuer default at that date, and nothing otherwise.
    Both the first term and, for each s, the expectation in the second term
can be computed in closed form using our extended transform. Specifically,
   1The entire class of affine term structure models is obtained as the special case of (1.1)
found by setting R = r, u = 0, vo = 1, and v1 = 0.
   2See, for example, Jarrow, Lando, and Turnbull [1997] and Duffie and Singleton [1999].

                                             3
assuming that both rt and       are affine in an AJD process X, the first
expectation in (1.3) is the special case of (1.1) that is obtained by letting
R(X, t) = Tt + )t, u = 0, v0 1 and v1 = 0. Similarly, each expectation in
(1.3) of the form E (A8 exp (— f8 r, + )' du)) is obtained as a special case
of (1.1) by setting u = 0, R(X, t) = Tt + At, and v0 + v1 X = A. Thus,
using our extended transform, the pricing of defaultable zero-coupon bonds
with constant fractional recovery of par reduces to the computation of a
one-dimensional integral of a known function. Similar reasoning can be used
to derive closed-form expressions for zero prices in environments where the
default arrival intensity is affine in X, and there is "gapping" risk associated
with unpredictable transitions to different credit categories (see Lando [1998]
for the case of w = 0).
    A different application of the extended transform is pursued by Piazzesi
[1998] who extends the AJD model in order to treat term-structure models
with releases of macro-economic information and with central-bank interest-
rate targeting. She considers jumps at both random and at deterministic
times, and allows for an intensity process and interest-rate process that have
linear-quadratic dependence on the underlying state vector, extending the
basic results of this paper.

1.2 Estimation of Affine Asset Pricing Models
Another useful implication of (1.1) is that, by setting R = 0, v0 =     1,and
v1 = 0, we obtain a closed-form expression for the conditional characteristic
function of XT given X, defined by           X, t, T) E (eT X) . Because
knowledge of is equivalent to knowledge of the joint conditional density
function of XT, this result is useful in estimation and all other applications
involving the transition densities of an AJD.
    For instance, Singleton [1998] exploits knowledge of to derive maximum
likelihood estimators for AJDS based on the conditional density of X1 given
X, obtained by Fourier inversion of

          f(Xt+iXt;7) —
                            (2ir)
                               N
                                 fa e_1(u,Xt,t,t + 1) du.                 (1.4)

Das [1998] exploits (1.4) for the specific case of a Poisson-Gaussian AJD to
compute method-of-moments estimators of a model of interest rates.
   Method-of-moments estimators can also be constructed directly in terms

                                      4
of the conditional characteristic function. By definition, t satisfies
                         PJ [c+' — (u, X, t, t + 1)] = 0,                              (1.5)
so any measurable function of X is orthogonal to the "error" (emflXt+1
c5(u,Xt,t,t + 1)). Singleton [1998] uses this fact, together with the known
functional form of to construct generalized method-of-moments estimators
of the parameters governing AJDs and, more generally, the parameters of
asset pricing models in which the state follows an AJD. These estimators are
computationally tractable and, in some cases, achieve the same asymptotic
efficiency as the maximum likelihood estimator.3

1.3 Affine Option Pricing Models
In an influential paper in the option-pricing literature, Heston [1993] showed
that the risk-neutral exercise probabilities appearing in the call option pricing
formulas for bonds, currencies, and equities can be computed by Fourier in-
version of the conditional characteristic function, which he showed is known
in closed form for his particular affine, stochastic volatility model. Build-
ing on this insight,4 a variety of option-pricing models have been developed
for state vectors having at most a single jump type (in the asset return),
and whose behavior between jumps is that of a Gaussian or "square-root"
diffusion .
    Knowing the extended transform (1.1) in closed-form, we can extend this
option pricing literature to the case of general multi-dimensional AJD pro-
cesses with much richer dynamic inter-relations among the state variables
and much richer jump distributions. For example, we provide an analyti-
cally tractable method for ricing derivatives with payoffs at a future time
T of the form (e(T) — c) , where c is a constant strike price, b E R', X
    3Liu and Pan [1997] and Liu [1997] propose alternative estimation strategies that exploit
the special structure of affine diffusion models.
    4Among the many recent papers examining option prices for the case of state variables
following square-root diffusions are Bakshi, Cao, and Chen [1997], Bakshi and Madan
[1999], Bates [1996], Bates [1997], Chen and Scott [1993], Chernov and Ghysels [1998],
Pan [1998], Scott [1996], and Scott [1997], among others.
    5More precisely, the short-term interest rate has been assumed to be an affine function of
independent square-root diffusions and, in the case of equity and currency option pricing,
spot-market returns have been assumed to follow stochastic-volatility models in which
volatility processes are independent "square-root" diffusions that may be correlated with
the spot-market return shock.

                                             5
is an AJD, and y max(y, 0). This leads directly to pricing formulas for
plain-vanilla options on currencies and equities, quanto options (such as an
option on a common stock or bond struck in a different currency), options on
zero-coupon bonds, caps, floors, chooser options, and other related deriva-
tives. Furthermore, we can price payoffs of the form (b X(T) — c)+ and
          X(T) and this allows us to price "slope-of-the-yield-curve" options
and certain Asian options.6
    In order to visualize our approach to option pricing, consider the price
p at date 0 of a call option with payoff (edX(T) —          at date T, for given
de   11  and strike c, where X is an n-dimensional AJD, with a short-term
interest-rate process that is itself affine in X. For any real number y and any
a and b in , let Ca,b(Y) denote the price of a security that pays ea(T) at
time T in the event that b X(T) < y. As the call option is in the money
when —d• X(T) < — lnc, and in that case pays e(X(T) — ceOX(T), we have
the option priced at
                         p Gd,_d(—lnc) — cGo,_d(—lnc).                                (1.6)

Thus, it is enough to be able to compute the Fourier transform a,b(•) of
Ga,b() (treated as a measure), defined by
                                            +
                             ga,b(z)      f e1 dGa,b(Y),
for then well-known Fourier-inversion methods can be used to compute terms
of the form Ca,b(Y) in (1.6).
    There are many cases in which the Fourier transform ca,b(.) of Ga,b() can
be computed explicitly. We extend the range of solutions for the transform
a,b() from those already in the literature to include the entire class of
AJDs by noting that ga,b(z) is given by (1.1), for the complex coefficient
vector u = a + izb, with v0 = 1 and v1 = 0. This, because of the affine
structure, implies under regularity conditions, that
                                ca,b(z)   = e0)0)X(0),                                (1.7)
    6j a complementary analysis of derivative security valuation, Bakshi and Madan [1999]
show that knowledge of the special case of (1.1) with v0 +v1 •XT = 1 is sufficient to recover
the prices of standard call options, but they do not provide explicit guidance as to how to
compute this transform. Their applications to Asian and other options presumes that the
state vector follows square-root or Heston-like stochastic-volatility models for which the
relevant transforms had already been known in closed form.

                                             6
where and 3 solve known, complex-valued ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) with boundary conditions at T determined by z. In some cases,
these ODEs have explicit solutions. These include independent square-root
diffusion models for the short-rate process, as in Chen and Scott [1995],
and the stochastic-volatility models of asset prices studied by Bates [1997]
and Bakshi, Cao, and Chen [1997]. Using our ODE-based approach, we
derive other explicit examples, for instance stochastic-volatility models with
correlated jumps in both returns and volatility. In other cases, one can
easily solve the ODEs for c and / numerically, even for high-dimensional
applications.
    Similar transform analysis provides a price for an option with a payoff
of the form (d. XT — c), again for the general AJD setting. For this case,
we provide in Appendix E an equally tractable method for computing the
Fourier transform of Ga,b,d( ), where Ga,b,d(y) is the price of a security that
pays e(T)a . X(T) at T in the event that b . X(T) < y. This transform
is again of the form (1.1), now with v1 = a. Given this transform, we can
invert to obtain Ga,b,d(y) and the option price p' given by
                       = Ga,_a,o(   ln c) — c G0,_a(   ln c).              (1.8)
As shown in Appendix E, these results can be used to price slope-of-the-
yield-curve options and certain Asian options.
    Our motivation for studying the general AJD setting is largely empirical.
The AJD model takes the elements of the drift vector, "instantaneous" covari-
ance matrix, and jump measure of X to be affine functions of X. This allows
for conditional variances that depend on all of the state variables (unlike the
Gaussian model), and for a variety of patterns of cross-correlations among
the elements of the state vector (unlike the case of independent square-root
diffusions). Dai and Singleton [1999], for instance, found that both time-
varying conditional variances and negatively correlated state variables were
essential ingredients to explaining the historical behavior of term structures
of U.S. interest rates.
    Furthermore, for the case of equity options, Bates [1997] and Bakshi, Cao,
and Chen [1997] found that their affine stochastic-volatility models did not
fully explain historical changes in the volatility smiles implied by S&P500
index options. Within the affine family of models, one potential explanation
for their findings is that they unnecessarily restricted the correlations between
the state variables driving returns and volatility. Using the classification

                                       7
scheme for affine models found in Dai and Singleton [1999], one may nest
these previous stochastic-volatility specifications within an AJD model with
the same number of state variables that allows for potentially much richer
correlation among the return and volatility factors.
    The empirical studies of Bates [1997] and Bakshi, Cao, and Chen [19971
also motivate, in part, our focus on multivariate jump processes. They con-
cluded that their stochastic-volatility models (with jumps in spot-market
returns only) do not allow for a degree of volatility of volatility sufficient
to explain the substantial "smirk" in the implied volatilities of index option
prices. Both papers conjectured that jumps in volatility, as well as in returns,
may be necessary to explain option-volatility smirks. Our AJD setting allows
for correlated jumps in both volatility and price. Jumps may be correlated
because their amplitudes are drawn from correlated distributions, or because
of correlation in the jump times. (The jump times may be simultaneous, or
have correlated stochastic arrival intensities.)
    In order to illustrate our approach, we provide an example of the pricing
of plain-vanilla calls on the S&P500 index. A cross-section of option prices
for a given day are used to calibrate AJDs with simultaneous jumps in both
returns and volatility. Then we compare the implied-volatility smiles to those
observed in the market on the chosen day. In this manner we provide some
preliminary evidence on the potential role of jumps in volatility for resolving
the volatility puzzles identified by Bates [1997] and Bakshi, Cao, and Chen
[1997].
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews
the class of affine jump-diffusions, and shows how to compute some relevant
transforms, and how to invert them. Section 3 presents our basic option-
pricing results. The example of the pricing of plain-vanilla calls on the
S&P500 index is presented in Section 4. Additional appendices provide
various technical results and extensions.


2 Transform Analysis for AJD State-Vectors
This section presents the AJD state-process model and the basic transform
calculations that will later be useful in option pricing. Technical details are
presened in Appendix A.




                                       8
2.1 The Affine Jump-Diffusion
We fix a probability space (Q, .T, P) and an information filtration7 (F), and
suppose that X is a Markov process in some state space D C R', solving the
stochastic differential equation

                        dX = t(X) dt          + a(Xt) dW + dZ,             (2.1)
where W     isa Standard Brownian motion in R; p: D —* R, u : D —÷ I><,
and Z is a pure jump process whose jumps have a fixed probability dis-
tribution i on R'2 and arrive with intensity {A(X) : t > O}, for some
A : D —+ [0, oo). For notational convenience, we assume that X0 is "known"
(has a trivial distribution). Appendices provide additional technical details,
as well as generalizations to multiple jump-types with different arrival inten-
sities, and to time-dependent (ii, a, A, v).
    We impose an "afline" structure on j, aaT, and A, in that all of these are
assumed to be affine. In order for X to be well defined, there are joint restric-
tions on (D, i, a, A, v). These restrictions are discussed in Duffie and Kan
[1996] and JDai and Singleton [1999], and are reviewed briefly in Appendix A.

2.2 Transforms
First, we show that the Fourier transform of X and of certain related random
variables is known in closed form up to the solution of an ODE. Then, we
show how the distribution of X and the prices of options can be recovered
by inverting this transform. Throughout this section, we specialize to the
case of v0 = 1 and v1 = 0 in (1.1), and put our treatment of the extended
transform in Appendix E.
   We fix an affine discount-rate function R: D —* R. The affine dependence
of j, aaT, A, and R are determined by coefficients (K, H, 1, p) defined by:
   • p(x) = K0 + K1x, for K = (K0, K1) E            R x R><.
   • (a(x)a(x)') (H0) + (H1) x, for H = (H0, H1) E W><' x
   • A(x) = to + 11 a, for 1 = (1,l) ER x R.
   •R(x)_—po+p1•x,forp=(po,p1)ERxR.
  7For   technical details, see Appendix A.


                                              9
   For c e Cr', the set of n-tuples of complex numbers, we let 9(c) =
    exp (c. z) dv(z) whenever the integral is well defined. This "jump trans-
form" determines the jump-size distribution. The subsequent analysis sug-
gests a practical advantage of choosing jump distributions with an explicitly
known or easily computed jump transform 0.
    The "coefficients" (K, H, 1, 0) of X completely determine its distribution,
given an initial condition X(O). A "characteristic" x = (K, H, 1,0, p) cap-
tures both the distribution of X as well as the effects of any discounting, and
determines a transform       :CxDx            x 1l —# C of XT conditional on
.F, when well defined at t T, by

      u,X,t,T) = EX (exp (
                                       JTR(x)d)        eT) ),             (2.2)

where EX denotes expectation under the distribution of X determined by x.
Here, '/" differs from the familiar (conditional) characteristic function of the
distribution of XT because of the discounting at rate R(X).
    The key insight underlying our applications is that, under technical reg-
ularity conditions given in Appendix B, Proposition 1,

                                 x, t, T) =   et(t)x,                     (2.3)

where 3 and satisfy the complex-valued ODEs8

                    = P1- K'/3 -                            - 1),

with boundary conditions /3(T) = u and c(T) = 0. The ODE (2.4)-(2.5) is
easily conjectured from an application of Ito's Formula to the candidate form

   Anticipating the application to option pricing, for each given (d, c, T) E

conditions in Appendix B, Proposition 3) the "expected present value"

      C (d, c, T, x) = EX             R(X8) ds) (edX(T) —                 (2.6)
                            (exp ( 1T                     c)+).
  8Here, cTH1c denotes the vector in C' with k-th element     c(Hl)kc.

We have

  C (d, c, T, x) = EX
                         (exp (_    fT R(X8) ds) (edX(T) — c) 1d.X(T)>1fl())
                 = Gd,_d (_ ln(c); X0, T, x) — CGO,_d (— ln(c); X0, T, x).       (2.7)

where, given some (x,T,a,b) ED x [O,oo) x R >< R, Ca,b( ;x,T,x) R —*

   Ga,b(y; X0, T, x) = EX                                                        (2.8)
                               (exp ( fT R(X3) ds) eax(T) lb.X(T)<9).
    The Fourier-Stjeltjes transform Ca,b( ; Xo, T, x) of Ga,b( X0, T,               jf
well defined, is given by

    Ga,b(v; X0, T, x)

                                 + ivb, X0, 0, T).
    We may now extend the Levy inversion formula9 (from the typical case
of a proper cumulative distribution function) to obtain, under a technical
integrability condition given in Appendix C, Proposition 2,

Ga,b(y; Xo, T, x)   =   (a, X0, 0, T)   —
                                            1

                                                f   Tm [/X(a + ivb,X0, 0, T)e"]

                                                                                 (2.9)
where Im(c) denotes the imaginary part of c E C. For R = 0, this gives the
probability distribution function of b XT. The associated transition density
of X is obtained by differentiation of Ga,ô. More generally, this provides the
transition function of X with "killing" at rate'° R. Piazzesi [1998] extends
this analysis to allow a limited degree of quadratic dependence of the short
rate on the state vector.
   9See, for example, Gil-Pelaez [1951] and Williams [1991] for a treatment of the Levy
inversion formula.
  10A negative R is sometimes called a "creation" rate in Markov-process theory.

3 Option Pricing Theory
This section applies our basic transform analysis to the pricing of options.
In all cases, we assume that the price process S of the asset underlying the
option is of the exponential-affine form St = et))(t)X(t). This is the case
for many applications in affine settings, including underlying assets that are
equities, currencies, and zero-coupon bonds.
    Two traditional formulations" of the asset-pricing problem are:

   1. Model the "risk-neutral" behavior of X under an equivalent martingale
      measure Q. That is, take X to be an affine jump-diffusion underwith
                                                                        Q
      given characteristic XQ• Then apply (2.7) and (2.9).
   2. Model the behavior of X as an affine jump-diffusion under the actual
      (that is, the "data-generating") measure P. If one then supposes that
      the state-price density (also known as the "pricing kernel" or "marginal-
      rate-of-substitution" process) is an exponential-affine form in X, then
      X is also an affine jump-diffusion under Q, and one can either:

       (a) calculate, as in Appendix D, the implied equivalent martingale
           measure Q and associated characteristic XQ of X under Q, and
           proceed as in the first alternative above, or
       (b) simply apply the definition of the state-price density, which deter-
            mines the price of an option directly in terms of Gab, computed
            using our transform analysis. This alternative is sketched in Sec-
            tion 3.2 below.

Of course the two approaches are consistent, and indeed the second formu-
lation implies the first, as indicated. The second approach is more complete,
and would be indicated for empirical time-series applications, for which the
  "A popular variant developed in a Gaussian setting by Jamshidian [1989]. In a setting
in which X is an affine jump-diffusion under the equivalent martingale measure Q, one
normalizes the underlying exponential-affine asset price by the price of a zero-coupon bond
maturing on the option expiration date T. Then, in the new numeraire, the short-rate
process is of course zero, and there is a new equivalent martingale measure Q(T), often
called the "forward measure," under which prices are exponential affine. Application
of Girsanov's Theorem uncovers new affine behavior for the underlying state process X
under Q(T), and one can proceed as before. The change-of-measure calculations for this
approach can be found in Appendix D.

                                           12
 "actual" distribution of the state process X as well as the parameters deter-
mining risk-premia must be specified and estimated, as in Pan [1998].
    Applications of these approaches to call-option pricing are briefly sketched
in the next two sub-sections. Other derivative pricing applications are pro-
vided in Section 3.3.

3.1 Risk-Neutral Pricing
Here, we take Q to be an equivalent martingale measure associated with
a short-term interest rate process defined by R(X) = Po + P, X,. This
means that the market value at time t of any contingent claim that pays an
-FT-measurable random variable V at time T is, by definition,


                     E (exp (_fTR(xS)ds) v                                      (3.1)

where, under Q, the state vector X is assumed to be an AJD with coefficients
(Kg, H', i'2, O). The relevant characteristic for risk-neutral pricing is then
   = (Kg, H, i, gQ, p). It need not be the case that markets are complete.
The existence of some equivalent martingale measure and the absence of
arbitrage are in any case essentially equivalent properties, under technical
conditions, as pointed out by Harrison and Kreps [1979]. For recent technical
conditions, see for example Delbaen and Schachermayer [1994].
   We let S denote the price process for the security underlying the option,
and suppose for simplicity'2 that ln St =     X,an element of the state vector
x = (x(),... , X(')). Other components of the state process X may jointly
specify the arrival intensity ofjumps, the behavior of stochastic volatility, the
behavior of other asset returns, interest-rate behavior, and so on. The given
asset is assumed to have a dividend-yield process {((X) t O} defined by

                                                                                (3.2)

for given q0 e R and q1 E R. For example, if the asset is a foreign currency,
then ((Xi) is the foreign short-term interest rate.
  '2The general case of S = exp(at + b1 . X) can be similarly treated. Possibly after
some innocuous affine change of variables in the state vector, possibly involving time
dependencies in the characteristic x, we can always reduce to the assumed case.



                                         13
   Because Q is an equivalent martingale measure, the coefficients K
((K), (Kf2)1) determining'3 the "risk-neutral" drift of = in S are given
by

                       (K) = Po - q0 -                 l
                                                     - (OQ((i)) -1)                  (3.3)

                       (K) p, - q, -                 - l (9(€(i)) -1),               (3.4)

where E(i) E R has 1 as its i-th component, and any other component equal
to 0.
    Unless other security price processes are specified, the risk-neutral char-
acteristic XQ is otherwise unrestricted by arbitrage considerations. There
are analogous no-arbitrage restrictions on      for each additional specified
security price process of the form ebX'(t).
    By the definition of an equivalent martingale measure and the results of
Section 2.2, a plain-vanilla European call option with expiration time T and
strike c has a price p at time 0 which, under the regularity in Appendix B,
is given by (2.7) to be

        p = GE(i),_f() (— ln(c); Xo, T, XQ) — c Go,_() (— ln(c); X0, T, XQ).        (3.5)
This extends Heston [1993], Bates [1996], Scott [1997], Bates [1997], Bakshi
and Madan [1999], and Bakshi, Cao, and Chen [1997].

3.2 State-Price Density
Suppose the state vector X is an affine jump-diffusion with coefficients (K, H, 1, )
under      the actual (data-generating) measure P. Let be an T)-adapted
      '3Under (3.3)-(3.4), we have

        S — S0   = J S[R(X) — C(X)] dtt+J Sua(Xu)TdW
                 +
                     O'(u<t
                              s_ (exp(x — i) _ft0 s (GQ(f(i)) — 1) (l +          ,
where W      is an (Tt)-standard Brownian motion in ll under Q. As the sum of the last
3 terms is a local Q-martingale, this indeed implies consistency with the definition of an
equivalent martingale measure. (Here, X(t) = X(t) — X(t—) denotes the jump of X at
t.)

                                               14
"state-price density," defined by the property that the market value at time
t of any security that pays an JT-measurable random variable V at time T
is given by

                            E(V(T)
We assume that _ ea() (t)X(t) for some bounded measurable a : [0, oc) —f
R and b: [0, x) —÷ R'. Without loss of generality, we take it that (0) = 1.
    Suppose the price of a given underlying security at time T is edX(T),
for some d e   ll.By the definition of a state-price density, a plain-vanilla
European call option struck at c with exercise date T has a price at time 0
of
                     p = E [ea(T)+b(T)x(T)(ed T) —   c)]
This leaves the option price

   p ea(T)Gb(T)+d,_d(_ in c; X0, T, x°)   ceHGb(T),_d(_ in c; X0, T, x°)
where  x° (K, H, 1, 0, 0). (One notes that the short-rate process plays no
role beyond that already captured by the state-price density.)
    As mentioned at the beginning of this section, and detailed in Appendix E,
an alternative is to translate the option-pricing problem to a "risk-neutral"
setting.

3.3 Other Option-Pricing Applications
This section develops as illustrative examples several additional applications
to option pricing. For convenience, we adopt the risk-neutral pricing formu-
lation. That is, we suppose that the short rate is given by R(X), where R
is affine, and X is an affine jump-diffusion under an equivalent martingale
measure Q. The associated characteristic       is fixed. While we treat the
case of call options, put options can be treated by the same method, or by
put-call parity.

3.3.1 Bond Derivatives
Consider a call option, struck at c with exercise date T, on a zero-coupon
bond maturing at time s > T. Let A(T, s) denote the time-T market price



                                     15
of the underlying bond. From Duffie and Kan [1996], under the regularity
conditions given in Appendix B,

                   A(T,s) exp(c(T,s,O) +/3(T,s,O) .XT),
where    3(T,s,O) and   c(T,s,O) are defined by (B.3) and (B.4). At time T,
the   option pays


             (A(T, s) —   c)         (eT80)+T80)T)        —
                                                                                (3.6)
                               =     eT,8,O) (e1Ts0)X(T) — e_Ts0)c)+      .     (3.7)

The value of the bond option can therefore be obtained from (2.7) and (2.9).
The same approach applies to caps and floors, which are simply portfolios of
zero-coupon bond options with payment in arrears, as reviewed in Appendix
G. This extends the results of Chen and Scott [19951 and Scott [1996].
Chacko and Das [19981 work out the valuation of asian interest-rate options
for a large class of affine models. They provide numerical examples based on
a multi-factor Cox-Ingersoll-Ross state vector.

3.3.2 Quantos
Consider a quanto of exercise date T and strike c on an underlying as-
set with price process S = exp(X()). The time-T payoff of the quanto is
(STM(XT) — c)+, where M(x) = em.x for some m E R. The quanto scaling
M(XT) could, for example, be the price at time T of a given asset, or the
exchange rate between two currencies. The initial market value of the quanto
option is then

       Gm+E(i),_c(i) (— ln(c);   ,   T, XQ) — c Go,_() (— ln(c);   , ).
                                                                   T,
An alternative form of the quanto option pays M(XT)(ST —                c) at T, and
has the price

         Gm+c(i),_f(i) (— ln(c); x, T, XQ) — c Gm,_f(j) (— ln(c); X, T, XQ).

3.3.3 Foreign Bond Options
Let exp(X()) be a foreign-exchange rate, R(X) be the domestic short in-
terest rate, and ((X) be the foreign short rate, for affine (. Consider a

                                             16
foreign zero-coupon bond maturing at time s, whose payoff at maturity, in
domestic currency, is therefore exp(X()). The risk-neutral characteristic XQ
is restricted by (3.3)-(3.4). From Proposition 1 in Appendix B, the domestic
price at time t of the foreign bond is

                   A1(t, s) = exp((t, s, E(i)) + (t, s,             . Xi).

We now consider an option on this bond with exercise date T < s and domes-
tic strike price c on the foreign s-year zero-coupon bond, paying (Af(T, s) —
c)+ at time T, in domestic currency. The initial market value of this option
can therefore be obtained as for a domestic bond option.

3.3.4 Chooser Options
Let        exp(X()) and           exp(X(3)) be two security price processes.
An exchange, or "chooser," option with exercise date T, pays max(S, Sw).
Depending on their respective dividend payout rates, the risk-neutral char-
acteristic   is restricted by (3.3)-(3.4), applied to both i and j. The initial
market value of this option is

                 (0; x, T, XQ) + G€(),o(0, x, T, XQ) — Gf(j),f(j)_E() (0; x, T, XQ).



4 A "Double-Jump" Illustrative Model
As an illustration of the methodology, this section provides explicit trans-
forms for a 2-dimensional affine jump-diffusion model. We suppose that S
is the price process, strictly positive, of a security that pays dividends at a
constant proportional rate (, and we let Y = ln(S). The state process is
X (Y, V)T, where V is the volatility process.
    We suppose for simplicity that the short rate is a constant r, and that
there exists an equivalent martingale measure Q under which'4

 d () = (r                      2) dt +            (] /i2) dW + dZ,                    (4.1)
  '4Unless otherwise stated, the distributional properties of (Y, V) described in this section
are in a 'risk-neutral" sense, that is, under Q.

                                             17
where w is an (.Tt)-standard Brownian motion under Q in R2, and Z is
a pure jump process in         with constant mean jump-arrival rate ), whose
bivariate jump-size distribution v has the transform 0. A flexible range of
distributions of jumps can be explored through the specification of 0. The
risk-neutral coefficient restriction (3.3) is satisfied if and only ifTi 0(1,0)—i.
    Before we move on to special examples, we lay out the formulation for
option pricing as a straightforward application of earlier results in the pa-
per. At time t, the transform15 of the log-price state variable YT can be
calculated using the ODE approach in (2.5) as:

            (u, (y, v), t, T) = exp ((T — t, n) + uy + (T — t, u)u),                        (4.2)

where, letting b = au — i,           a = u(i — u), and16 -y = .../b2 + aa, we have
                       =            a (1 — e_T)
                                                                                            (43)
                             27     (7+ b) (1— e_)'
              a(T,u) o(,u) —A(1 +u) +f0(u,(t,n))dt,                                         (4.4)

where'7

       u) = —r + (r —        )uT — kv (7+           b + ln [i —           b(1
                                                                                   —




and where the term f O(u, /3(t, u)) dt depends on the specific formulation of
bivariate jump transform 0(., •).

4.1      A Concrete Example
As a concrete example, consider the jump transform 9 defined by

                O(ci, c2) =        (O(ci) + VOV(c) + cOc(c                c2)),             (4.5)
  15That is, '(u, (y, v), t, T) = /'X((u, 0)', (y, v)', t, T), where x is the characteristic under
Q of X associated with the short rate defined by (P0, P1) = (r, 0).
  16To be more precise, 'y = y2Ih/2exp (iar(Y2)) where y2 = b2 + aa. Note that for
any z E C, arg(z) is defined such that z = jzexp(iarg(z)), with —r < arg(z) < ir.
  17For any z E C, ln(z) = in z + i arg(z).

                      O (ci,c2) =

                                        1—          — PJ/Ic,vCl

What we incorporate in this example is in fact three types of jumps:
   • Jumps in Y, with arrival intensity ) and normally distributed jump
       size with mean ji, and variance
   • Jumps in V, with arrival intensity ) and exponentially distributed
     jump size with mean ,
   • Simultaneous correlated jumps in Y and 1, with arrival intensity ,\c
     The marginal distribution of the jump size in V is exponential with
     mean p. Conditional on a realization, say zr,, of the jump size in V,
     the jump size in Y is normally distributed with mean p + PJZV, and
       variance

     In Bakshi, Cao, and Chen [1997] and Bates [1997], the SVJ-Y model,
defined by AU =       = 0, was studied using cross sections of options data to
fit the "volatility smirk." They find that allowing for negative jumps in Y is
useful insofar as it increases the skewness of the distribution of YT, but that
this does not generate the level of skewness implied by the volatility smirk
observed in market data. They call for a model with jumps in volatility.
Using this concrete "double-jump" example (4.5), we can address this issue,
and provide some insights into what a richer specification of jumps may
imply.
   Before leaving this section to explore the implications ofjumps for "volatil-
ity smiles," we provide explicit option pricing through the transform formula
(4.2), by exploiting the bivariate jump transform 0 specified in (4.5). We
have

   fO(u,/3(t,u))dt=' (AYfY(u,y) + A7v(u ) + Acfc(u,y)),

4.2 Jump Impact on "Volatility Smiles"
As an illustration of the implications of jumps for the volatility smirk, we
first select three special cases of the "double-jump" example just specified,
SV: Stochastic volatility model with no jumps, obtained by letting \ = 0.
SVJ-Y: Stochastic volatility model with jumps in price only, obtained by
      letting )'       0, and ) =      = 0.

SVJJ: Stochastic volatility with simultaneous and correlated jumps in price
     and volatility, obtained by letting ) 0 and ) = = 0.
In order to choose plausible values for the parameters governing these three
special cases, we calibrated these three benchmark models to the actual
"market-implied" smiles on November 2, 1993, plotted in Figure 1.18 For
each model, calibration was done by minimizing (by choice of the unrestricted
parameters) the mean-squared pricing error (MSE), defined as the simple av-
erage of the squared differences between the observed and the modeled option
prices across all strikes and maturities. The risk-free rate r is assumed to be
3.19%, and the dividend yield ( is assumed to be zero.
   '8The options data are downloaded from the home page of Yacine Ait-Sahalia. There
is a total of 87 options with maturities (times to exercise date) ranging from 17 days to
318 days, and strikes prices ranging from 0.74 to 1.17 times the underlying futures price.

    Table 1 displays the calibrated parameters of the models. Interestingly,
for this particular day, we see that adding a jump in volatility to the SVJ-
 Y model, leading to the model SVJJ model, causes a substantial decline
in the level of the parameter a determining the volatility of the diffusion
component of volatility. Thus, the volatility puzzle identified by Bates and
Bakshi, Cao, and Chen, namely that the volatility of volatility in the diffusion
component of V seems too high, is potentially explained by allowing for
jumps in volatility. At the same time, the return jump variance declines
to approximately zero as we replace the SVJ- Y model with the SVJJ model.
A consequence of this is that the jump sizes of Y and of V are nearly perfectly
anti-correlated. This jump distribution reinforces the negative skew typically

found in estimation of the SVmodel for these data,'9 as jumps down in return
are associated with simultaneous jumps up in volatility.
    In order to gain additional insight into the relative fit of the models to the
option data used in our calibration, Figures 2 and 3 show the volatility smiles
for the shortest (17-day) and longest (318-day) maturity options. For both
maturities, there is a notable improvement of fit with the inclusion of jumps.
Furthermore, the addition of a jump in volatility leads to a more pronounced
smirk at both maturities and one that, based on the relative values of the
  '91n addition to the "calibration" results in the literature, see the time-series results of
Chernov and Ghysels [1998} and Pan [1998]. For related work, see Poteshman [1998] and

             volatility on the sample day. The risk-free rate is assumed
             to be fixed at r = 3.19%, and the dividend yield at (= 0.
             From "risk neutrality," 71 = 8(1,0)   —   1.




MSE in Table 1, produces a better overall fit on this day.
    Next, we go beyond this fitting exercise, and study how the introduction
of a volatility jump component to the SV and SVJ-Y models might affect
the "volatility smile," and how correlation between jumps in Y and V affects
the "volatility smirk." We investigate the following three additional special
cases:

  1. The SVJ-V model: We extend the fitted SVmodel by letting AV = 0.1
     and )'     = 0. We measure the degree of contribution of the jump
     component of volatility by the fraction i/(a V0+)               )
                                                            of the initial
      instantaneous variance of the volatility process V that is due to the
     jump component. By varying            the mean of the volatility jumps,
      three levels of this volatility "jumpiness" fraction are considered: 0,
     15%, and 30%. For each case, the time-U instantaneous drift, variance,
     and correlation are fixed to those implied by the fitted SV model by
     varying a, 17, and .

SVJJ is the Stochastic Volatility Model with Simultaneous and Correlated Jumps in Re-
turns and Volatility. Model parameters were calibrated with options data of November 2,
1993.



   2. The SVJ- Y- V model: We extend the fitted SVJ- Y model by letting
         = ÀY AC = 0, and ÀY be fixed as given in Table 1. Again, the
      volatility "jumpiness" is measured by the fraction of the instantaneous
      variance of V that is due to the jump component. Three jumpiness
      levels, 0, 15%, and 30% are again considered. For each case, the in-
      stantaneous drift, variance, and correlation are matched to the fitted
        SVJ- Y model.

  3. Finally, we modify the fitted SVJJ model by varying the correlation
     between simultaneous jumps in Y and V. Five levels of correlation are
     considered: —1.0, —0.5, 0, 0.5, and 1.0. For each case, the means and
     variances of jumps in V and Y are calibrated to the fitted SVJJ model.

4.3 Multi-factor Volatility Specifications
Though our focus in this section has been on jump distributions, we are
also interested in multi-factor models of the diffusion component of stochas-
tic volatility. Bates [1997] has emphasized the potential importance of more
than one volatility factor for explaining the "term structure" of return volatil-
ities, and included two, independent volatility factors in his model. Similarly,
the empirical analysis in Gallant, Hsu, and Tauchen [1998] of a non-affine,
3-factor model of asset returns, with two of the three state coordinates ded-
icated to volatility behavior, suggests that more than one volatility factor
improves the goodness of fit for S&P500 returns.
   Our transform analysis applies directly to any affine formulation of multi-
factor stochastic volatility models, including Bates' model. Here, we also
propose an examination of multi-factor volatility models in which there is a
"long-term" stochastic trend component V in volatility. For example, we

   A one-factor volatility model, such as the SV model, may well over-
simplify the term structure of volatility. In particular, the (SV) model
has an auto-correlation of returns (over successive periods of length z) of
exp(—icz), which decreases exponentially with Li. This exponential decay
is in direct constrast to a common empirical finding of a "long memory"
in volatility. (See, for example, Bollerslev and Mikkelsen [1996] for findings

a more flexible volatility structure. The auto-correlation of z-period returns

model to be,

Appendices
A The Affine Jump-Diffusion
This appendix summarizes technical details for the basic AiD model, allow-
ing for time-dependent coefficients.
    We fix (, F, P), a complete probability space, and (F)0<<, a filtration
of sub-a-fields of F satisfying the usual conditions.2° We suppose that there
is a strong Markov process X, with (Xi, t) in some D C R x [0, oc) for all
  20For technical definitions, see Protter [1990].

where   W is an ()-adapted Standard Brownian motion in                       p: D —+ R,
a : D —÷            where D is a subset of R x [O,) to be defined; Z is a
pure jump process whose jump-counting process N has a stochastic intensity
{.\(X, t) : t > O}, for some ).. : D —* [0, oo), and whose jump-size distribution
is Vt, a probability distribution on II depending only on t. It is assumed
that, for each t, {x : (x, t) E D} contains an open subset of R.
   We can equally well characterize the behavior of X in terms of the in-
finitesimal generator V of its transition semigroup, defined by

      Vf(x, t)     ft(x, t) + f(x, t)(x, t) + tr [f(x, t)a(x, t)a(x, t)T]
                   + (x,t)        f   [f(x + z,t) - f(x,t)] dvt(z),                  (A.2)

for sufficiently regular f : D —* R. The generator V is defined by the
property that, for any f in its domain, {f(Xt, t) — f Vf(X, s) ds : t > 0} is
a martingale. (See Ethier and Kurtz [1986] for details.) In Appendix F, we
consider more general jump behavior.
   We impose an "affine" structure on i, aaT, and \, in that

                               t(T, t) = K0(t) + K,(t) x                             (A.3)

                     a(x, t)a(x, t)T = H0(t) +        H(t) xk                        (A.4)

where for each t 0, Ko(t) is n >< 1, K1(t) is n x n, Ho(t) is n x ii and
symmetric, H1 (t) is a tensor2' of dimension n x n x ii, with symmetric
H(c)(t) (for k = 1, . , ii), 10(t) is a scalar, and l,(t) is n x 1. The time-
dependent coefficients K = (K0, K1), H = (H0, H,), and 1            (lo, 1) are
bounded continuous functions on [0, oo). We further assume that, for each
 21Let H be an n x n x n tensor, fix its third index to k, the tensor is reduced to an n x n
matrix H(') with elements, H = H(i,j, k).

t > 0, f )(X, s) ds < oo P-as. This type of "affine jump-diffusion" pro-
cess is introduced in Duffie and Ran [1996] for purposes of term-structure
modeling.
   We know that a(x, t) must be well defined for all (x, t) in D; indeed one
can define regularity conditions on t, a, A, and ii such that a solution X
exists for D = {(x, t) a(z, t)a(x, t)T is positive semi-definite}. See Duffie
and Ran [1996] and Dai and Singleton [1999] for additional details. The
conditions would include the requirement that for any (x, t) E D, we have
(x + z, t) E D for all z in the support of Vt.
   Letting C denote the set of n-tuples of complex numbers, we let O(c, t) =
    exp (c. z) di-'t(z), for any c E Ctm such that the integral is well defined.
This "jump transform" 9 determines the probability distribution of each jump
measure Vt. We assume that 9 is measurable.

where R(x,t) = po(t) +pi(t) •x, for bounded measurable Po : [0,T] —* Rand
p: [0, T] —+ Rtm. The characteristic x = (K, H, 1, 9, p) determines i. 1vVith

and where, for any c E 02,

Proposition 1 (Transform of X): Suppose (K, H, 1,9, p) is well-behaved
at (u, T). Then W is a martingale, and the transform of X defined by (B.1)

Because {W,, (O(b(t), t) — 1): t > 0} is an (Ft)-predictable process, and the

D Change of Measure
This appendix provides the impact of a change of measure defined by a
density process or a state-price-density process that is of the exponential-
affine form in an affine jump-diffusion state process X.
    Fixing T > 0, suppose, under the measure P, that a given characteristic
x (K, H, 1, 0, p) is well-behaved at (b, T) for some b e R''. Let

then define an equivalent probability measure Q by     = CT/o.

of measure that arises from a normalization associated with .

Proof:        Let

Lemma 2, below, shows that          is a P-local martingale. It follows that
w    is a Q-local martingale. Because 10t a(X8, s)/3(s, T, b) ds is a continuous
finite-variation process, {W, W39] = [W', T4f]t = 6(i,j) t, where (.) is the
kronecker delta. By Levy's Theorem, w is a standard Brownian motion in
R' under Q.
   Next, we let

                    M =N—f          O((s, T, b))(X8, s) ds,       t > U.      (D.7)

Lemma 3, below, shows that eM is a P-local martingale. It follows that
M is a Q-local martingale. By the martingale characterization of inten-
sity,26 we conclude that, under Q, N is a counting process with the intensity
{A(X,t) : t o} defined by )(x,t)                  l(t) + 1(t) x.
   Using the fact that, under Q, T4' is a standard Brownian and the jump
counting process N has intensity {AQ(X, t) : t > o}, we may mimic the
proof of Proposition 1, and obtain (D.5) replacing in the proof of Lemma 1

the Integration Theorem (y) in Brémaud [1981], we can show that J is a
P-local martingale. I
      For the remainder of this appendix, we denote Q by Q(b), emphasizing
the role of bin defining the change of probability measure given by (Dl). We
let (b) = (KQ(b), HQ(b), 1Q(b), 9Q(b), p) denote the associated characteristic.
The previous result shows in effect that, under Q(b), the state vector X is
still an affine jump-diffusion whose characteristics can be computed in terms
of the characteristics of X under the measure P. This result provides us
with an alternative approach to option pricing. We suppose that Q(O) is
an equivalent martingale measure. The price F (X0, a, d, c, T) of an option
                    +
paying (ea+dXT — c) at T is given by

 F (X0, a, d, c, T) = E° (exp (
                                            1T R(XS, s) ds) (eT —
                    = eaEo)

                                     (exp (_ f R(X8, s) ds) ld.XTln(c)_a).
Provided the characteristic (K, H, 1, 9, p) is well-behaved at (d, T) and (0, T),
we may introduce the equivalent probability measure Q(d), and write
F (X0, a, d, c, T) = ea exp (c(0, T, d) + 3(0, T, d) . X0)           (ld.XT>lfl(c)_a)

Let x(') (KQ(d),         1Q(d) 0Q(d), 0) and x(°) = (KQ(°),          Q(O), 0)
be defined by (D.2)-(D.4) for b = d and b = 0. We suppose that x(') and

Under additional technical conditions, we can show that

where '/" is given by (B.2), and where B and A satisfy the linear ordinary
differential equations

Definition El:       (K, H, 1,0, p) is "extended" well-behaved at (v, u, T), if
there is a unique solution X to (A.1) for 0 < t < T, if (B.3)-(B.4) are solved
uniquely by and , if (E.3)-(E.4) are solved uniquely by B and A, and if
the above conditions (i)-(iii) are satisfied.

Proposition 5 ("Extended" Transform of X):           Suppose x = (K, H, 1, 0, p)
is extended well-behaved at (v, u, T). Then 1 is a martingale, and the trans-
form of X defined by (El) is thus given by (E.2).
In principle, the extended transform can be computed by differentiation of
the transform , just as moments can be computed from a moment generating
function. In practice, this may involve solving the same ODEs (E.3)-(E.4).
    For fixed a E W, b E R, and d e         we next define G,o,d( X0, T, x)
by

   Now, anticipating the calculation of option prices, we consider, for given
cE Rand b E RTh.

                                                T

                                (exp (_ f       R(X, s) ds) (b. XT — c)+).        (E.7)

We immediately obtain

     C (Xe, b, c, T) = EX
                                /     /T              s) ds) (b XT — c) lb.Xy>

                       = Cb,b,o (—c; X0, T, x) — c G0,_ (—c; X0, T, x)            (E.8)


                                                39
where Ga,b is given by (2.9) and Ca,b,O is given by (E.6).
   With this calculation, we could price a slope-of-the-yield-curve option, as
yields in an AJD setting are themselves affine. Under the assumption of a
deterministic short rate and dividend-yield process, that is, Pi = q1 0, we
may also use this approach to price an asian option. For the latter, struck at
c, at the expiration date T, the option pays (+            dt --     where
                                                                 c),
is the price process of the underlying asset. If Q is an equivalent martingale
measure, we must have
                 dX = (R(X, t) — ((Xe, t)) X dt +
where M is a Q-martingale. For any 0 < t < T, let Y = X ds. For
short rate Po, we can let E5 = (P0, 0) and ,Ei = (0, 0)
                                                                j
                                                           0, and see that
X = (X, Y) is an (n+ 1)-dimensional affine jump diffusion with characteristic
  =
      (k, i, T, , ) that can be easily derived from using the fact that d =
x(z) dt. We may then use (E.8) and obtain the initial market value of the
option as
                                (o,€(m+1,Tc,T).

F Extension to Multiple Jumps
We may easily relax the jump behavior of X to accomodate m types of
jumps, with jump type i having jump-conditional distributn v at time t,
again depending only on t, and stochastic intensity {.A(X,t) : t 0}, for
i E {1,.., , m}, where A : D —* R is defined by
                          )j(X, t)    1(t) + l(t) .
for bounded measurable 1        ((1, if), . . . , (lv', if). The jump transforms
o (0',... , 0) are defined by 0(c, t) =             exp (c. z) di4(z), c e C'.
    We can also characterize the behavior of X with multiple jumps in terms
of the infinitesimal generator V of its transition semigroup, with

      Vf(x, t) = ft(x, t) + f(x, t)(x, t) +   tr [f(x, t)u(, t)a(x, t)T]
                                     [f(x+z,t)-f(x,t)] dv(z),              (Fl)
                    i=1


                                       40
for sufficiently regular f D —+ R.
    In this general setting, Propositions 1, 2, and 3 apply after replacing the
                                                            m
last terms in the right-hand sides of (B.5) and (B.6) with      11(t) (0 (c, t) — 1)
        m
and j1 10(t) (0 (c, t) — 1), respectively.
    This can be extended to the case of an infinite number of jump types by
allowing for a general Levy jump measure that is affine in the state vector.

G Cap Pricing
A cap is a loan with face value, say 1, at a variable interest rate that is capped
at some level . At time t, let r, 2, . . ., nr be the fixed dates for future
interest payments. At each fixed date kr, the p-capped interest payment, or
 "caplet," is given by (1((k — 1), k) — , where 7((k — l)T, kT) is the
i-year floating interest rate at time (k — 1)r, defined by


                  1+r((k—1)r,kr)) =A((k—1)T,kT).
The market value at time 0 of the caplet paying at date k can be expressed
as
                        /—       rkr
Caplet(k) E exp (
                       \'
                              / R(X, u) du)I r (((k — 1), kT) —
                             Jo
                                 (k—1)r                          1
                                                                                 +

     (1+rf)E [ex (_f                      R(Xuu)du) (1+T —A((k— 1)Y,kT)) ]
Hence, the pricing of the k-th caplet is equivalent to the pricing of an in-
(k — 1)-for-r put struck at 1/(1 +        which can be readily obtained by
using Proposition 3 and put-call parity as Caplet(k) (1 + r)(k), where

     (k) = F (x0,                         (k   —
                                                          — A(0, kr) +
                             1                     i)r)
where F (X0, a, d, c, T) is the price of a claim to (e(X(T) — c)+ paid at T,
and where 5 c((k — 1)r, k, 0) and /3 = 13((k — 1), kr, 0).
