1         Introduction
Wage inequality in the U.S. has increased dramatically since the 1970s (e.g. Juhn,
Murphy and Pierce, 1993; Katz and Murphy, 1992). For most of the period, this also
meant an increase in the return to observed skills.           The standard theory of human
capital implies that higher returns to skills should encourage investments in human
capital. Many observers (e.g. Topel, 1997) have concluded that we do actually observe
faster skill accumulation, and this increase in the supply of skills should eventually
mitigate the increase in inequality.
        Rising wage and income inequality a¤ects not only the returns to education, but also
the resources that families have available to …nance education. Family income might
matter for education decisions because of credit constraints, or because education is not
a pure investment good. The change in the structure of wages during the 1980s, which
reduced the wages of less skilled workers, may have made it harder for children from
these families to attend college, despite the higher returns.1 In fact, while there was
a large increase in the college enrollment rates for children from richer families during
the 1980s, there was a much smaller increase for children from the poorest backgrounds
(McPherson and Schapiro, 1991, Ellwood and Kane, 1999, and Table 1 below).
        In this paper, we exploit the changes in the distribution of family income that have
taken place over the past 30 years to estimate the e¤ect of parental resources on college
education. Our strategy exploits the fact that families at the bottom of the income dis-
tribution were much poorer in the 1990s than they were in the 1970s, while the opposite
is true for families in the top quartile of the distribution.         This approach is attrac-
tive since it exploits variations in family income caused by changes in the U.S. income
distribution, which are unlikely to be correlated with other (observed and unobserved)
characteristics a¤ecting education choices. Our estimates suggest large e¤ects of family
income on enrollments. For example, we …nd that a 10 percent increase in family in-
come is associated with a 1.4 percentage point increase in the probability of attending
a four-year college.
        Although there are numerous studies investigating the impact of family resources on
    1
    See also Acemoglu and Pischke (1999) for the argument that a higher return to human capital may
reduce investments in training in the presence of labor market imperfections.




                                                1
education outcomes, whether income truly matters is still a hotly debated issue.2 Most
studies in this area just relate schooling outcomes to family income in OLS equations.
However, in OLS regressions, family income may be proxying for family characteristics
a¤ecting “the education production function” (Lang and Ruud, 1986). In fact, many
studies …nd that including parents’ education and controls for type of school attended
previously or test scores substantially reduce the e¤ect of the family income on children’s
education (e.g. Cameron and Heckman, 1999, Ellwood and Kane, 1998, or Cameron
and Taber, 2000).        Nevertheless, such estimates of the income elasticity of education
may be seriously biased downwards. First, there are substantial measurement errors
and transitory movements in incomes measured at a point in time, attenuating the
e¤ect of income on education.          This attenuation bias will be worse if other variables
correlated with permanent income, like parents’ education or the type of secondary
school chosen, are included as controls. As a result, the estimate of the income e¤ect may
be substantially understated. Second, , test scores and previous schooling experience are
likely to be endogenous and also a¤ected by family income, so their inclusion may lead
to biased estimates.       In fact, our strategy which does not su¤er from these problems
leads to substantially larger estimates of the e¤ect of parents’ resources on children’s
education.
      Our strategy is more closely related to studies exploiting exogenous variation in
parents’ income. The negative income tax experiments provide the only experimental
study of the e¤ect of income on schooling, but they confound the e¤ect of income with
changes in marginal tax rates a¤ecting the decisions of youths to work (see e.g. Venti,
1984). A few recent studies have made other attempts to address the possibility that
income may also be correlated with unobserved factors which predict schooling outcomes
of the child. Duncan et al. (1998) use sibling di¤erences arguing that family income
varies while other family characteristics remain the same. Shea (2000) uses industry
and union wage di¤erentials and income changes due to job displacement as instruments
for family income and argues that these proxy “luck.” He …nds no e¤ects of parental
resources on education, but his estimates are quite imprecise. Both of Shea’s instruments
are also not entirely convincing, since they are likely correlated with parental attitudes
towards education.3 Mayer (1997) uses a variety of approaches to argue that unobserved

      Du‡o (2000) exploits the expansion of old-age pensions in South Africa to analyze the e¤ect of

                                                  2
family characteristics a¤ecting education are relatively unimportant. She uses variation
in income induced by state welfare rules, compares the impact of di¤erent sources of
income, and compares the e¤ect of income before and after a child’s education takes
place. Using her estimates, she also tries to assess whether changes in income inequality
predict the enrollment patterns for children from di¤erent income groups over time. This
comes closest to our strategy of using changes in income inequality as an instrument for
family income.


2     A Simple Model of Schooling With Credit Con-
      straints
We now outline a simple model of investment in schooling based on Becker and Tomes
(1986).4 Our objective is to obtain a simple estimating framework for our empirical work.
The economy lasts two periods. In period 1, an individual (parent) works, consumes
c, saves s, decides whether to send their o¤spring to college, e = 0 or 1, and then dies
at the end of the period. The cost of schooling for family i is exp(µ i ). We assume
that the distribution of µi is Gq (µ), where q denotes the income (ability) quartile of the
family, so that in the empirical work below we can allow for di¤erent distributions of
unobserved characteristics across households in di¤erent parts of the income (ability)
distribution. The fact that there is a distribution of education costs captures that there
is heterogeneity among children or among the attitudes of families towards education.
Skilled individuals (those with education) receive a wage ws and an unskilled worker
receives wu .
    All families have utility given as:


                                            ln c + ¯ ln c^                                         (1)

where c^ is the consumption of the o¤spring. ¯ is a parameter that measures how impor-
tant future (o¤spring’s) consumption is relative to current consumption.
family resources on child health. She …nds positive e¤ect of resources on health, though given the
di¤erences in the level of development across South Africa and the U.S., it is not clear whether these
results can be generalized to the U.S. context.
   4
     This model is also related to the large macroeconomic literature on credit constraints. See, among
others, Galor and Zeira (1993), Benabou (1996), Durlauf (1996), and Fernandez and Rogerson (1996) on
the e¤ect of credit constraints on human capital investments, and Acemoglu (1997) on the interaction
between credit and labor market imperfections in determining human capital investments.

                                                  3
   Consider a family with income y.      In the absence of credit market problems, this
family would simply maximize net present discounted value of income. We assume no
discounting, which implies that this family should invest in education as long as

                                  µ · µ ´ ln [ws ¡ wu ] :                              (2)

The important point is that, because education is a pure investment good, income does
not matter. If µ is very high, but still less than µ, then the family will borrow pledging
the future earnings of their o¤spring in order to achieve consumption smoothing.
   Instead, here, we assume that all families face credit market problems, and cannot
borrow pledging the future income of their o¤spring.        More formally, the problem of
parent i is to maximize (1) by choosing c, c^, s, and e subject to:

                                  c + exp(µi )e + s · yi                               (3)
                                  c^ = s + wu + (ws ¡ wu )e
                                  s¸0

The …rst condition is the budget constraint for the family. The second determines the
consumption of the child, and the …nal one is the “credit constraint”. This constraint
implies that investment in education comes at the cost of consumption smoothing (low
consumption in the …rst period, and high consumption in the second period).
   If the level of income is high enough, so that parents would like to leave positive
bequests (s > 0) to their o¤spring, credit market problems will not matter in the max-
imization problem in (3) (Becker and Tomes, 1986).          Such a family already has high
enough income, and consumption smoothing would mean transferring resources to their
o¤spring. They will do so using the most e¢cient combination of human capital invest-
ment and monetary bequests. The condition guaranteeing that we are in the positive
bequest region is
                                                ³ ´
                           y ¸ y ´ ws + exp µ = 2ws ¡ wu :

In this case, income is high enough that even at the maximum cost of education (con-
sistent with optimal investment in skills), parents would leave positive bequests.
   Hence among families with income y ¸ y, the fraction investing in education is
                                  ³ ´
                               Gr µ = Gr (ln [ws ¡ wu ]) ;                             (4)

                                            4
where Gr is the distribution of education costs among “rich” (unconstrained) families.
The main point to note is that the fraction investing depends only on skilled–unskilled
wage premium, and not on income.
    Next, consider a “poor” family with income y < wu , and suppose that it does not
invest in schooling. Then their lifetime utility will be U (e = 0) = ln y + ¯ ln wu , since
in the …rst period, they consume the income y, and in the second period, their o¤spring
consumes the unskilled earnings, wu . If, in contrast, they send their child to school, they
obtain utility U(e = 1) = ln(y ¡ exp(µi )) + ¯ ln ws . Now, their …rst period consumption
is y ¡ exp (µi ), but their o¤spring obtains consumption ws .
    Comparison of these two expressions implies that there is a cuto¤ level of ability, µ¤ ,
such that only poor parents with children who have ability µ · µ¤ invest in schooling,
with                              " µ             ¶¯ #
                            ¤        ws ¡ wu
                            µ ´ ln y                     ¼ ln y + ¯ ln r
                                        ws
where r ´ (ws ¡ wu )=wu is the college premium. Therefore, the fraction of poor families
investing in education is
                                Gp (µ¤ ) ¼ Gp (ln y + ¯ ln r) ;                                     (5)

where Gp is the distribution of education costs among poor families. Unlike in eq. (4),
the fraction now depends not only on the college premium, but also on family income.


3      Empirical Strategy
The above model is easily translated into a simple linear estimating equation.                    If we
could identify in the data who the unconstrained and the constrained families were, we
should run equations of the following form:

       For unconstrained families :     sijt = ± r + ± j + ± t + ®r rjt + "ijt
         For constrained families :     sijt = ± p + ± j + ± t + ®p rjt + ¯ p ln yiqjt + "ijt ;

where i denotes individual family, j denotes region, and t denotes time. sijt is a 0-
1 variable which denotes whether the individual in question attends college. "ijt is an
individual speci…c error term. These expressions follow from our theoretical model above,
and allow both the e¤ect of the college premium and family income to di¤er across rich
and poor households.

                                              5
   Since we do not observe which families are constrained, we think of a more general
model where the e¤ect of family income on enrollments varies across income quartiles.
Such a model would also allow the relationship between income quartile and enrollments
to be non-monotonic. This is useful because the poorest households may be relatively
unconstrained thanks to need based …nancial aid, while middle-class households, who
do not qualify for …nancial aid, may be constrained, especially if they wish to send their
children to private colleges. This gives us the following model

                      siqjt = ± q + ± j + ± t + ®q rjt + ¯ q ln yiqjt + "iqjt ;          (6)

where q denotes income quartile, and as before j denotes region, and t denotes time.
Expression (6) nests our model above when ¯ q = 0 for rich families, and ¯ q = ¯ > 0 for
poor families, but allows more general heterogeneous e¤ects of income and the college
premium across income quartiles.         We will also present results restricting the e¤ects
across income quartiles by setting ®q = ® and ¯ q = ¯ in order to make better use of the
limited variation in our data.
   Note that equation (6) includes main e¤ects of income quartile and time e¤ects.
The latter will capture the e¤ects of aggregate conditions like the college boom related
to the Vietnam era, changes in federal …nancial aid and the like. In addition, we have
written the relevant college premium as rjt , which implies that families look at the college
premium that applies in the region at the time of schooling. Both of these assumptions
appear reasonable: most people work in the same region as they completed schooling (see
Acemoglu and Pischke, 2000), and the existing time-series evidence suggests that current
returns, not expected future returns matter most for schooling decisions (Freeman, 1976).
In any case, we show below that the income elasticity of college enrollments is insensitive
to how we control for the e¤ect of returns to college.
   Equation (6) can be aggregated across individuals to be written in a more compact
form:
                       Sqjt = ± q + ± j + ± t + ®q rjt + ¯ q ln Yqjt + "qjt ;            (7)

where Sqjt is the fraction of students attending college among those who completed high
school (or among those in the right age bracket) in region j, income quartile q, and time
t who attend college, and ln Yqt is the log average income of family is in region j, income
quartile q, and time t.

                                                 6
    It is also useful to note that the estimation of equation (7) can be thought of as
instrumental variables (IV) estimation of

                         Sqjt = ± j + ± t + ®q rjt + ¯ q ln Yqjt + "qjt ;                (8)

using the full set of quartile-region-time interactions as the instruments for ln Yqjt . This
IV interpretation clari…es why our empirical strategy is attractive.        Family income is
likely to vary with parental ability, labor supply or other reasons. As captured in the
model, these factors may be correlated with the family’s costs (attitudes) of educating
their child, so that ln Yqjt is correlated with the error term in equation (8). Our strategy
avoids the bias that will arise from this correlation, because we are controlling for the
parents’ rank in the income distribution, which is close to a su¢cient statistic for their
unobservable characteristics. Identi…cation is then achieved from the variations in ln Yqjt
conditional on this rank. The changes in the wage structure which have taken place in the
United States during the 1970s and 1980s provide di¤erential variation in the parental
income distribution across quartiles.
    In addition to using variation in the wage structure over time, our estimation strategy
also exploits the fact that wage di¤erentials have changed di¤erently in di¤erent states
or regions. By relying completely on within region variations we can control for the
interactions of time and parental background group at the aggregate level in the college
attendance equation.     This allows us to also estimate models that control for other
factors which might have a¤ected the children of richer or poorer parents di¤erently, like
di¤erential changes in tuition costs at private and public universities, or the changes in
the availability of Pell grants and Guaranteed Student Loans.


4     Data
We study the e¤ect of family income on college attendance, using the three longitu-
dinal surveys of high school leavers sponsored by the U.S. National Center for Edu-
cation Statistics (NCES): the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class
of 1972 (NLS-72), the High School and Beyond Survey (HSB), which started with high
school seniors and sophomores in 1980, and the National Educational Longitudinal Study
(NELS), which started with a class of 8th graders in 1988. These surveys roughly span
the two decades of the 1970s and the 1980s in which returns to college …rst decreased

                                                7
and then increased.
   Each of these surveys collected information on the educational background of the
parents and on family income when the respondent was a senior in high school. Family
income at various stages during the life of a child might a¤ect its ultimate chance of
attending college (see Duncan et al., 1998) because fewer resources at a young age may
impede the cognitive development of a child. Nevertheless, income during the senior
year in high school seems to be the correct concept for our project because we want
to focus on the role of income to cover the direct and opportunity costs of attending
college. The schooling datasets record only bracketed variables for income, and there
are 10 to 18 brackets. We overcome this problem by …tting parametric Singh-Maddala
distributions to the incomes in the sample of college entrants and in the entire sample.
From these two distributions, we derive the enrollment rate for each quartile in the
income distribution and the average family income in the quartile.
   Follow-up information after leaving high school was …rst collected two years after
the respondents were in their senior year.      From this follow-up wave, we construct
measures of whether an individual ever attended any college in the interim, and whether
the individual ever attended a four-year college.    We derived information on returns
from the 1970, 1980, and 1990 Censuses by calculating the average wages of those with
exactly 16 and exactly 12 years of education (those with a college degree and a high school
degree, respectively) among workers with 1 to 5 years of experience. Our de…nition of
the return is ln(w16 =w12 )=4, which is approximately equal to the return to one year of
college.
   Table 1 gives summary statistics for our sample by family income quartiles and year.
The top panel gives the fraction of children from families of di¤erent quartiles ever
attending any college within two years of high school.      The second panel shows the
same information for attending four-year college, and the bottom panel is for family
income.    Table 2 gives similar statistics by region and year, and the variation in the
college premium across regions and time.
   A number of patterns are clearly visible from Tables 1 and 2.          There has been
little increase in the fraction of children attending four-year college between 1972 and
1982. Between 1982 and 1992, there has been a substantial increase, but this increase
is concentrated among the children in the upper two quartiles: The bottom panel in


                                            8
the table shows that family incomes have only risen for families in the top quartile
over this period, stagnated for the middle two quartiles, and fallen slightly for families
in the lowest quartile. These patterns are therefore consistent with substantial income
e¤ects on enrollments in the aggregate. It is also noteworthy that there is a much weaker
contrast across quartiles when looking at the fraction ever attending any college. This
is in line with our thinking. The di¤erence between attending any college and attending
four-year college is mostly made up by community colleges, which are very cheap, and
pose a lower opportunity cost for families from poor backgrounds since the duration
is shorter.   Therefore, in the presence of signi…cant credit market barriers a¤ecting
education choices, we would expect families to increase the rate at which they send their
children to community colleges much more than to four-year colleges over this period.
This observation also implies that there may be quite signi…cant heterogeneity in the
quality of colleges that children from poorer and richer families are attending within
these broad categories of two-year and four-year colleges.
    Table 2 reveals that there is substantial variation in the variables of interest across
the four Census regions. Both income and college enrollment rates have grown the most
in the Northeast and the least in the West. Returns have moved mostly in line during
the 1980s but there is some heterogeneity across regions in the 1970s. This illustrates
that the region variation will be quite helpful in identifying our models.


5     Results
We start in Table 3 with the regressions which do not control for quartile e¤ects. This
is equivalent to estimating (8) without instrumenting for family income. The coe¢cient
on family income in these models therefore captures both the e¤ect of income and any
other e¤ect of family background which is correlated with income.
    In this and the following tables, the …rst four columns have the fraction attending
any college in a region-income quartile-year cell as dependent variable, while the last four
columns are for the fraction attending four-year college. The discussion above suggests
that the last four columns are more important for our argument. It turns out that the
coe¢cients on family income are very stable across speci…cations. The estimate of the
e¤ect of log income on enrollments, 0.18, implies that a 10 percent increase in family
income is associated by a 1.8 percentage point increase in enrollments. This is a fairly

                                             9
large e¤ect of family income on college enrollments.
   The …rst and …fth columns do not control for time e¤ects, so they e¤ectively exploit
the national changes in family income and in the college premium to identify the e¤ects
on enrollments. These columns also show moderate e¤ects of returns of attending college.
For example, the estimate of 0.82 for log returns in column (5) implies that a 4 log point
increase in the college return, which is roughly the increase from 1980 to 1990, should
lead to a 3.3 percentage point increase in college enrollments. In the remaining columns,
we add year e¤ects. In the second and sixth columns, we drop returns to college, while
in columns (3) and (7), returns to college are included.       In all cases, the estimates
of the e¤ect of family income on college attendance is una¤ected.         Interestingly, in
columns (3) and (7), the e¤ect of college returns is estimated to be insigni…cant and
negative.   Although this result may be because families consider only the national
return in making college decisions, it sheds some doubt on the conventional wisdom that
returns to education have a major e¤ect on enrollment decisions (see also Acemoglu and
Pischke, 2000).
   Table 4 gives our main results. Here we add dummies for the income quartile. This
should control for any invariant family background e¤ects related to the rank of a family
in the income distribution and isolate the true e¤ect of family income on enrollments.
The results in columns (1) and (5), which do not control for time e¤ects, are very
similar to those in Table 3. Nevertheless, there are many other aggregate trends, which
might have a¤ected college enrollments.     Our preferred speci…cations, in columns (2)
and (6) therefore include time e¤ects and exploit only the within region variation. The
coe¢cient for family income is lower than those in column (1) and in Table 3. That
the e¤ect of family income is smaller now implies that our strategy is eliminating some
of the unobserved characteristics correlated with family income. Nevertheless, we …nd a
signi…cant e¤ect of family income for both enrollment variables, and the e¤ect is larger
for four-year college enrollment (although this di¤erence is not signi…cant). Adding
returns to college in the region in columns (3) and (7) has little e¤ect on the estimate of
the income elasticity. Interestingly, in these speci…cations the estimates on the returns
to schooling once again become insigni…cant. Finally, adding second level interactions of
income quartile, region, and time in columns (4) and (8) changes the general magnitude
of the estimates little, though, since these controls eliminate much of the variation in


                                            10
the data, the e¤ects are no longer statistically signi…cant
    We therefore conclude that there is a robust e¤ect of family income on enrollments
decisions. Our baseline estimate of 0.14 indicates an economically very signi…cant e¤ect
of family income.   It implies that family income, rather than other factors related to
family background, explain 27 percentage points of the 36 percentage point di¤erence in
the enrollment rates of children from the bottom and top quartiles in 1992. This is large
compared to other studies, which have found positive e¤ects of income. For example,
Ellwood and Kane (1999) …nd that family income explains only 9 percentage points of
the 26 percentage points enrollment di¤erence between the top and bottom quartiles in
1982 after introducing various controls.
    The framework we outlined above suggested that the e¤ects of family income might
di¤er between rich and poor families. It is possible to estimate separate e¤ects for
family income and returns by income quartile. The results of this exercise are given in
Table 5. These results are less clear-cut, mostly because the estimates become relatively
imprecise once the e¤ects are allowed to vary by income quartile. To the degree that
there are any patterns, we do not …nd that family income is most important for the
lowest income families (in fact in the case of four-year college, the opposite seems to
be true). This might indicate that even relatively rich families may not be completely
unconstrained. In addition, income may matter for reasons other than credit market
constraints, for example, because college is, to some degree, a consumption good rather
than a pure investment good. Since the estimates are imprecise, it is di¢cult to draw
…rm conclusions from the results in Table 5.


6     Summary
The income elasticity of education decisions is a key parameter for the labor and macroe-
conomics literatures.   The importance of knowing how responsive college enrollments
will be to family income may have become even more important with the increase in the
returns to schooling, which is expected to encourage greater enrollments.
    In this paper, we proposed a novel identi…cation strategy for estimating this elastic-
ity. We exploited variations in family income over time due to changes in the overall
income distribution.    We …nd reasonably robust and large income elasticities.     A 10
percent increase in family income is predicted to increase college enrollments by 1 to 1.4

                                            11
