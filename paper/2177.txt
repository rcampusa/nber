             Currency Inconvertiblity, Trade Taxes and Smuggling


                                   ABSTRACT


     In the classic analysis of smuggling importers choose the optimal mix of
legal and illegal trade, given trade taxes and the technology of detection.
This paper introduces an inconvertible currency in the framework, so that
illegal trade is valued at a rate higher than the (fixed) official exchange
rate. Sections 1 and 2 show how the smuggling ratio and the domestic price
markup for the import and export good are simultaneously determined.

     With balanced legal and illegal trade, changes in the (long-run) black
market premium are a weighted average of changes in trade taxes, whereas
changes in the smuggling ratios depend on the ratio of trade taxes. Thus, an
import tariff and an export subsidy rising at the same rate would keep
smuggling ratios constant but imply a rising black market premium (section 3
and 4).

     To determine the quantity of exports and imports, a model of the economy
is presented in section 5, featuring the production of exports and non-traded
goods and the consumption of imports and non-traded goods, as well as a
government confiscating the amounts of traded goods unsuccessfully smuggled.
Then export production may fall, and welfare may rise, if trade taxes have a
ne9ative effect on the relative price of exports and imports stronger than the
positive effect on smuggled exports and imports, which is always
welfare-reducing.

     Section 6 introduces the short-run determination of the black market
premium via portfolio balance. In this case, rising rade taxes may be
associated with a premium rising even faster if there is unreported capital
flight and conversely.

Introduction


     There has been a revival of interest in the consequences of currency

inconvertibility and the existence of black markets for foreign exchange.

Nevertheless, these widespread phenomena have been analyzed in isolation. In

particular, their relationship with trade taxes and smuggling has been largely

ignored in recent contributions. The model of Pitt (1984) hides the special

risks involved in smuggling behind an arbitrary "smuggling function". This is

recognized in the "crime-theoretic" smuggling model of Martin and Panagariya

(1984) but it does not feature a black market for foreign exchange. This

paper addresses the relationship between these two channels of illegal

activity in a framework inspired by the classic analysis of Beccaria (1764).

     Beccaria looked at a case where the probability of detection in import

smuggling was exogenously given and he showed that importers would be

indifferent between smuggling and legal trade when the tariff factor (one plus

the tariff rate) equals the inverse of the probability of success. If this

were one, for example, any tariff would induce smuggling. How much of the

tariff revenue should be devoted to increased supervision, so as to lower the

probability of success, was in fact Beccaria's main concern.

     Here we focus on the choice of the importer or exporter, but it is useful

to generalize slightly Beccaria's analysis as a motivation. Suppose the

smuggled imports have to be paid for with black market foreign exchange (which

for simplicity can be acquired at no risk), then a tariff lower than the

premium of the black market over the official market would not induce

smuggling even if the probability of success were one. The import tariff is
                                      -2-


now the upper bound for the black market premium and the indifference point

for the importer is defined by the equality of the tariff factor and the black

market premium over the probability of success. Conversely, if the black

market rate is lower than the official rate times the export tax factor, then

it will not pay to smuggle exports even if the probability of success were

one. The export tax is the lower bound of the black market premium.

Importers and exporters will therefore be indifferent between the two channels

when the ratio of trade taxes times the product of the probability of success

in import and export smuggling equals one. This may be thought of as a simple

generalization from Beccaria's formula, based on a given probability of

success in smuggling.

     If the probability of success is endogenously determined, importers and

exporters will take this into account in choosing their mix of smuggling and

legal trade. Take the case where success is a negative function of the ratio

of smuggling to legal trade. Then equating marginal revenue to marginal cost

in both activities will determine the equilibrium price and smuggling ratio

for importers and exporters, given trade taxes and the black market premium.

Indeed, the ratio of domestic to free-trade prices will be a weighted average

of trade taxes and the premium. The import price markup will lie between the

tariff factor and the premium, and the export price markup will lie between

the premium and the export tax.

     The determination of the long-run black market premium follows from the

identification of flow supply of and demand for black market foreign exchange.

When the short-run premium is given by portfolio balance, then, we can trace

the dynamics of the black market premium and analyze the relationship between
                                         —3—


smuggling and the black market for foreign exchange.

      The problem of importers and exporters is described as a choice of the

relative magnitudes of legal trade and smuggling, much like the problem of

choosing an optimal portfolio of assets. From the solutions presented in

Sections 1 and 2, a flow model of the black market for foreign exchange is

derived in Section 3 and the effect of trade taxes discussed in Section 4.

This is embedded in Section 5 in a model of the rest of the economy in the

spirit of Jones (1974). Section 6 reinterprets the flow model as the long—run

solution of a portfolio model of the Kouri (1983) variety.



1.    The Importer


      Consider a price-taking importer who chooses the amount of a good to be

imported legally (denoted by Lm) and the amount to be smuggled (denoted by

Sm)• In the first case, he must pay an ad valorem tariff (tm1) p* but obtains

the foreign exchange at the official exchange rate .      In   the second case, he

must buy the foreign exchange in the black market at a rate e and faces a

probability (1-z) of being detected, in which case the amount Sm is

confiscated. Denoting the domestic price by m' expected profits in domestic

currency are a weighted average of profits in the two states of nature:


(1)        pm = z(Pm(Lm+Sm) - eP*t
                                mmmL -   eP*S
                                           mm ]   + (1-z)(P L -P*t L -eP*S
                                                          mm mmm mm
      Now the probability of detection is an increasing function of the

smuggling activity, which can be written as the probability of success, z,

being a decreasing function of the smuggling ratio, Sm:
                                                       —4—


(2)              z =    z(s);     z' < 0


                 Sm =

                 z(0)   = 1


          If the z function is concave (z" <             0),   the probability of success in

smuggling decreases fast as some of it is undertaken and then more and more

slowly as the smuggling ratio rises so that as Sm -,                      z   —'   0.   Alternatively,

if 1'        0, z reaches zero for some value Sm* For example, if z = 1 -
                                                                          asm, then
      =   1/a.
          We write profits in terms of the import good valued at the official

exchange rate. Defining the endogenous markup of the domestic price over the

world price and the black market premium, we get:


(3)              pm =pIeP*=zS
                     m m   mm +L
                               mm-tL
                                   mm-pSm
where m =                     the price markup; and p =        e/,   the black market premium.

          First-order conditions for profit maximization can be solved for the

optimal combination of the import price markup and smuggling ratio, given the

tariff and the black market premium:



(4)
                 m
                     [1 —
                              m
                                    =     tm

(5)              m1m) =           p


where m =        -z's/z
          According to (4), the domestic price is greater than the world price in

domestic currency valued at the official rate but less than the tariff-

inclusive price (1 <                  <          This is what Pitt (1984) calls "price disparity."
                                m         tm)•
                                                 -5-


It is clear from (5), furthermore, that the z function must be such that cm <

We assume that this condition is satisfied at the optimum, which implies in the

earlier example that Sm < 1/2a.

      The second-order condition for a maximum has the sign of:


(6)          8m =


where m =
             _Z"Sm/ZI
      The condition Bm           0 is met when     < 2, which will always be true when

z"    0. We assume that this is the case. Note that Bm(O) =           2z'(O)   and that in

the linear case, Bm =

      At   the optimum, profits are zero, as can be checked by substituting (4)

and (5) into (1). Using the zero—profit condition to solve for the

equilibrium domestic price, we get:

                    tm +S   -.
(7)         pm =            eP*
                     l+zs     m


      According to (7), the domestic price markup is a weighted average of the

tariff and the premium relative to the probability of success, with the weight

on the tariff falling as the equilibrium smuggling ratio increases.

      Eliminating m from (4) and (5), we can write a version of Beccaria's

formula (Zt = 1) as:


(8)         Zt — p    =                   > 0
                          _Z'Sm(tm+Psm)

      An alternative interpretation of (8) is that it expresses the first-order

condition for the minization of m in (7), which is equivalent to the prof it—

maximization carried out earlier, as noted by Pitt (1984).

      The combination of the domestic price and the smuggling ratio consistent
                                       —6-


with maximum profit for the importer can be presented graphically as the LLm

locus given by (4) and the SSm locus given by (5). Their slopes are given by:

          d           Bs
                      mmm
          dsm 'LL —   ,2
                 m 1-zsm


                     -BR
                       mm
          dsm 'SSm — z+z'sm

     We see from (9) that the LL locus is downward sloping. A higher

smuggling ratio of imports implies a lower domestic price markup, because

otherwise profits from legal trade would rise. Conversely, (10) shows that

the SS locus is upward sloping. A higher smuggling ratio of imports implies a

higher domestic price markup, because otherwise profits from smuggling would

fall. The numerators of (9) and (10) have the inverse signs from the effect

of an increase in the smuggling ratio of imports on marginal profits from

legal trade and smuggling respectively. Denoting these by L and

   respectively in Figure 1, right panel, we see that above SSm(LLm) profits

from smuggling (legal trade) are rising and conversely. When      reaches the

value for which m = 1,   say , the   slope of the SSm curve becomes vertical.

In the linear example, this will happen at    =   3a.
     It is clear from Figure 1 that there always exists a solution -if tm > P

Note also that smuggling reduces the price markup but cannot eliminate it,

even if p = 1.

    An increase in the import tariff raises the domestic price markup and the

smuggling ratio less than proportionately. On the other hand, an increase in

the black market premium raises the domestic price of the imported good and

 lowers the smuggling ratio of imports.



2.      The Exporter


        The choice problem of the exporter can be analyzed in a similar set—up.

Assuming the same detection technology, as captured by the z function, and

indexing the variables with x, profits in domestic currency are given by

(11)         px =     zS   p*e + P* L - P (S +L )
                          xx     x xx    x x x

where t, =    1   -            the   export tax; and z =
                                                           z(s),   with the properties

indicated in (2) above.

        Defining the international terms of trade T*, we can express profits in

units of the import good as:


(12)         x = [zSp + tL -                 xx+LxflT*
where T* = P*/P*; and                    = p /P*
            x m                      x      x  x
       The first—order conditions are again solved to obtain the optimal

combination of the domestic price of exports and the share of legal exports,

given the export tax and the premium:

(13)              =   t    —
                               pz's2


(14)              =   pz(l_CX)

       The second-order condition is still given by (6) above (with 5x replacing

Sm) and, at the optimum, exporters' profits are also zero, the domestic price

being given by:
                                                —8-



                 =
(15)
                     (t+zPs)/(1+s)
       Now           again a weighted average of t< and pz, with           =
                is
                                                                               t/(1+s)
when s reaches s>. Note, however, that, as before, the elasticity will

become negative at a lower value, s•

       Eliminating ? from (16) and (17), we get:


(16)          zp -
                     t   =
                             -pz's(1+s)   > 0


       Again, (16) is simply the first-order condition for the maximization of

   in (15). Now, since p and              are both positive, we have a stronger

condition on the elasticity of the z function, namely that r < 1, where

   =            ) can    be interpreted as the ratio of the elasticity to the weight

of the export tax in (15), which is larger than one when there is export

smuggling. We assume that this condition is met at the optimum, so that

S <          where r(sx) =      0.   In the linear case   =   )'+/a   -   1.

       For the exporter, the LL locus slopes upward and the SS< locus slopes

downward, as shown in Figure 1, left panel. Once again, above LLX(SSX)

profits from legal trade (smuggling) are positive and conversely. From a

point on LLxi an increase in the smuggling ratio for exports requires a rise

in the domestic price markup, otherwise profits from legal trade would fall.

From a point on SS, a fall in the domestic price markup is required,

otherwise profits from smuggling would rise. Again, there always exists a

solution if p > 1 > t<. Depending on the equilibrium smuggling, the price

markup may be larger or smaller than one. When                > 1, the domestic price of

the export good is larger than the world price despite export taxation.

       An increase in the export tax raises the price and lowers the smuggling
                                                 —9—


ratio for exports, whereas an increase in the premium raises both.



3.     The (Flow) Determination of the Black Market Premium


       Identifying smuggled imports from many identical importers as (flow)

demand for black market foreign exchange and undetected smuggled exports from

many identical exports as (flow) supply of black market foreign exchange, the

first-order conditions can be used to determine the black market premium. We

then have from (4) and (5) that:


(17)        p =
                   tmm(sm)



where m =   z(1C);        sgn m' = sgn   B < 0
            1-z'

       Given the tariff, when the premium rises, demand for black market foreign

exchange falls. Note that m            1 as long as     < 1   and that m(0) =   1.

Similarly, from (13) and (14), we get:

            p =
(18)               txx(sx)
                    —x
where x =   1/z(1-ç      ); sgn x' =   -sgn Bx > 0.
       Note that Sx cannot be so large as to make x negative because of the

condition that        <   1.   Also x = 1 when s = 0.    Given the export tax, when

the premium rises, supply of black market foreign exchange rises (the share of

legal exports falls).

       In equilibrium, legal exports (in foreign currency) equal legal imports

(in foreign currency) and undetected smuggled exports equal total smuggled

imports. Using the definition of the terms of trade, we get
                                          -10-•



 (19)               =
                        Lm


 (20)        T*z(sx)Sx = 5m


        Dividing (20) by (19), we obtain a relationship between sm and Sx:


(21)            =
                    Z(5x)Sx

        The rise in the export smuggling ratio is always larger than the rise in

the import smuggling ratio. This is because detected smuggled exports are

confiscated before they can be exchanged for smuggled imports, so that a less

than one probability of success in export smuggling is equivalent to the real

cost of smuggling featured in Pitt (1984) and Martin and Panagariya (1984).

        Thus, when smuggling is virtually non-existent, then 5    5m but, as the

share of smuggled exports rises, we get 5m < Sx and the gap keeps growing as

Sx increases. Note that 5m must be such that Z(Sx)Sx is non-zero.

        From (17), (18), and (21), we can simultaneously determine the black

market premium, the share of smuggled exports and the share of smuggled

imports. In Figure 2, top panel, the XX locus slopes upward from t and the

MM locus slopes downward from tm They intersect at E. An increase in the

tariff increases the demand for black market foreign exchange which results in

a rise in the premium and in the smuggling ratios (SS locus in bottom panel).

An increase in the export tax increases the supply of black market foreign

exchange: the premium falls but both smuggling ratios still rise. Thus

higher trade taxes induce smuggling, but their effect on the black market

premium depends on whether they affect supply or demand. Note that the SS

schedule becomes flat when Sx =         where     >   such that Sm =
                                  5x'                                  Z(Sx)Sx

raises m(sm+k) and thus the MM locus shifts up in Figure 2. This raises p and

S (from s° to sk). In (21), though, we now have Sm =
                                                                       zs   -   k,   so that the

rates of change by hats and the (positive) elasticities of the x and m

functions by €1(i =             x,   m), we obtain the black market premium as a weighted

average of tm and t:


                p =

                       (la)tm        + at

where a = e /(c + ); c =
                         —x     x    —x     x
                            (2- )/(1—c )(1-C ); and



       Note that            >        with equality holding when Sm =        = 0.     A premium in

this limiting case requires different detection technologies for imports and

exports. Otherwise, the initial situation may be tm =
   =   ex   =   —2z'(O).
                                                                       t    = p = 1 and then



       The smuggling ratios only depend on the ratio of one plus the trade tax

rates, t =       tm/tx•      Note that changes both in the export tax and in the import

tariff have the same effect on t (when Tx = Tm = 0 initially), as required by

Lerner's symmetry theorem: dt =                (lTx)dTm    + (l+Tm)dTx• We write:


(23)            5m =    x       m

                       (c +e )(1-C

       Note that the analysis is applicable when instead of an export tax, we

have an export subsidy, as in Branson and Macedo (1986). In that case,
                                               —12-


taxes and subsidies rising at the same rate would keep t and thus Sm and

s constant but would nevertheless imply a rising black market premium from

(22).




4.      Trade Taxes and Relative Prices


        Having obtained Sm 5 and p, we obtain prices from the zero profit

conditions in (7) and (15) above. Log differentiating those, we get:



(7")
              m
                  =tm +a$t
                         m



(15")             =   t   +
                              (1—a)t

where m = PSm/(tm+PSm) and             =
                                           psz/(t+psz).
        Trade taxes have a direct (and proportional) effect on price markups

since these markups are tax-inclusive. But we see in (7") and (15") that

there is also an indirect effect through the changes in smuggling ratios

induced by changes in relative trade taxes. An increase in the import

smuggling ratio decreases the tax-exclusive import price markup, because the

lower probability of success lowers demand for black market foreign exchange

and thus requires a lower black market premium for profits not to fall.

Conversely, an increase in the export smuggling ratio increases the

tax-exclusive export price markup, because the lower probability of success

lowers supply of black market foreign exchange and thus requires a higher

black market premium for profits not to fall. On both counts, therefore,

trade taxes increase the export relative to the import markup, net of taxes.

     =        =     initially, however, it will be proportional.

5.       A Model of the Economy


         Having obtained the equilibrium values of p, S, Sm and it, we need a

model of the economy to determine total imports, exports, production,

consumption and welfare. Defining a production possibilities frontier in

terms of importables and exportables (net of enforcement costs), an homothetic

social welfare function in terms of the consumption of the two goods, setting

it equal to production plus imports and less exports respectively, and making

total imports equal to total exports at world prices yields the total amount

imported as a function of the relative price, it.                  This   exercise is carried out

in Martin and Panagariya (1984) and, for this purpose, the model of the black

market presented above could be grafted onto their model of the economy.

         We present here a slightly different model, which allows for the

existence of a non-traded good. As in Jones (1974) we assume that there is

neither domestic production of the import good nor domestic consumption of the

export good. As a consequence, the production possibilities frontier and the

social welfare function are written as:
                                                  -14-


(26)              =
                      f(Q);   ft   <0


(27)        U =
                  U(CmiCnt)

       We neglect the distributional consequences of trade taxes and assume that

revenues from detected smuggling are consumed by the government. Then

consumption equals production in the market for the non—traded good and any

decrease in export production will raise welfare via the extra consumption of

the non—traded good:


(28)              =


       Efficiency in production implies that the price of exports in terms of

non—traded goods equals the marginal rate of transformation:


(29)        q =               f"   <   0


where q =   x'nt•
       Efficiency in consumption implies that the price of imports in terms of

non—traded goods (given by q/i) is a negative function, denoted by g, of the

consumption ratio (assuming unitary income elasticities, so that the marginal

and average propensities to import are the same): eliminating q from (29) and

using the trade balance equilibrium, we obtain an equation in Lmg i, Sm and
                                                                                s:

                       =
(30)                       ng(C/f(Q)]
where Cm = Lm(l4ZSm) and               =
                                           Lm(l+sx)/T*.
       Log differentiating (30), we see that the domestic terms of trade

increases with import consumption and export production:
                                                       —15—



(30')        (?l÷c9c)Q + e9C =

where    g = _g'C/fg,           the inverse of the aggregate elasticity of substitution

in demand,            =               the inverse of the elasticity of production
                  f                                       f              ff
(similarly            for on-traded goods), and e =           -f'Q/f = i Inn.
        We note from the definitions of Cm and                        in (30) that (realized) import

demand excludes the amount confiscated by the government, whereas production

of exports includes the amount confiscated by the government. The effect of

trade taxes given Lm is thus to raise Cm and                           but the latter by more:



(31)         Cm
                          L + mmY1t

(32)         x =          L   + (fI(Ex+m)]t -


        Now substituting in (31) for Cmi                 and it       from (32), (32') and (25),
respectively, we can solve for the legal amount of imports as a function of

the international terms of trade and trade taxes:


(33)         [(i÷€) +                        =   (l÷ +fl)T*   -x  £
                                                                                           +



        The term in square brackets includes the price effect w as well as a

quantity effect. Both are negative and less than proportional if

   < (Cx+Cm). If                =
                                    Sm
                                         =   0 initially, the total effect will be one-to-one

(in absolute value).

        A deterioration in the terms of trade lowers legal imports (as well as

legal exports). When utility is Cobb-Douglas, (c9 =                         1),   they fall in

proportion.

        Using (33) in (32) and (32'), we obtain the effect of trade taxes on
                                              —16—


import consumption and export production. Leaving out the terms of trade

(T* =    0),   we have:


(31')          E(Ex+em)cm =    -[w   +            )]t

(32')          E(€x+em)Q =


where E =      (1+f)      +


        We see from (31') that import consumption falls by less than legal

imports, and from (32') that trade taxes need not depress export production

and shift resources to the production of non-traded goods. This requires a

large c9, or a small aggregate elasticity of substitution in demand.

        From (29), the relative price of exports and non-traded goods is

positively related to x• The effect of the terms of trade is given by

               Thus, if the aggregate elasticity of substitution in demand is

greater than one, then            < 1 and a terms of trade deterioration raises the

domestic price of exports relative to non-traded goods. There is no effect in

the Cobb-Douglas case. The effect of trade taxes will tend to be negative so

that the price of exports falls relative to the price of non-traded goods. We

see from (32'), however, that the effect could be positive if c is large

enough.

       Coming to the welfare effects, we differentiate (27) and choose units so

that au/acm =     1:

(34)           -dU =   am
                              C + (lam)Ct

where am =                                                                      +
               PmCm/Pntyi the share of imports in consumption; and y =
                                                                           nt
real income.

       Since a terms of trade improvement reduces x and thus increases

C while raising Lm from (33), its effect on welfare is unambiguously
                                            —17—


positive. The effect of trade taxes is ambiguous, though, because of the

ambiguity of the effect on            If    falls,    rises and so does welfare

unless Cm falls by more. We can express the condition for trade taxes to be

welfare-improving as:



(35)                  -                      >
                          (amTi+e9)(xm)/G]

       This   reduces to the condition that the term in square brackets in (32')

be positive when am =      0.   Otherwise, it is more likely to happen when   is

large and       and c are small. Thus the relative magnitude of the supply

and demand elasticities and the consumption share of imports are what

introduces this ambiguity, absent from the model of Martin and Panagariya

(1984), where tariffs are welfare-reducing because of the ex ante deficit in

the total trade balance. While, in the present model, it is also the case

that      +     < Lm + Sm allowing for the existence of a non-traded good

introduces the possibility of a positive effect, at least under the extreme

assumption that government activities are improductive and that the

authorities react passively. Instead of introducing the choice of the

government with respect to trade taxes and enforcement, however, we allow

asset stocks to determine the black market premium at each instant of time.



6.     A Portfolio Model of the Black Market for Foreign Exchange


       In the previous section, we neglected the existence of the stock demand

for foreign assets which was introduced in Macedo (1982). It can be written

as:
                                            -18-


(36)         pF = Ad


where F is the given stock of foreign assets (in foreign currency) and Ad is

the given demand for foreign assets valued at the official exchange rate.

       The stock of foreign assets changes with the unreported current account.

Denoting rates of change by dots:
             .

             F=B=(TZS-S)P
                          *     *
(37)                 x mm
       Dividing by the amounts of legal trade and assuming for the moment that

the reported trade balance is zero, we get

                   *   *
(38)         B =   PL{T       -1
                         z(s)x (p/tx]   -   m
                                                -1
                                                     (P/tm])


       Even though a rise in p raises           and therefore lowers z, the direct

effect always dominates since the elasticity is less than one, so that we can

rewrite (37) and (38) as:


(39)         F


       The sign of the first term makes the system stable and retrieves the

"acceleration hypothesis" of Kouri (1983) in the analysis of the black market

for foreign exchange:

(40)         p =   -B/F

       The premium will rise when the unreported current account is in deficit

(B <   0) and conversely. A rise in tariffs will generate a deficit (and
increase the premium as before), whereas a rise in export taxes will generate

a surplus.
                                          -19--



        Since the black market premium is determined by (36) at each moment in

time, (17) and (18) above are now solved for Sm and



(41)         5m =     _(1/m) (pt)

             -.
                           x
(42)              =   (1/c )(p-t)

        Using (41) and (42), we can rewrite (38) as:


(38')        B      pSm((cm+cx)/cxHp(1_a)tx - atm]


        Comparing to (22) above, when the premium is above the long-run value

given by the a-weighted average of trade taxes, the reported trade balance is

in surplus and conversely.

        To relax the assumption made earlier that the reported trade balance is

always zero, and therefore allow for changes in domestic money, consider the

following extension. Portfolio balance is now written as


(36')        pF =     hi


where i    = H/   is the stock of domestic money valued at the official exchange

                  rate

           and h is the given currency ratio (obtained from the asset demand

                  function).

        While domestic credit creation and a given rate of crawl for the official

exchange rate are easy to incorporate, see Macedo (1985), we neglect them in

order to identify the reported trade balance with the rate of increase of

domestic money:
                                                       —20-


                  *   *
(43)         H=B=PL -PL
                  xx mm
        Using (37) and (43) we see that the premium changes with the difference

between the normalized unreported and reported trade balances:


(44)         p =     -(B/F)    + CB/H)


        The premium will change if the unreported trade deficit is different from

the reported trade surplus weighted by the currency ratio valued at the

official exchange rate i =               F/H,     which will always be smaller than the

currency ratio relevant for portfolio choice since h = p1.

        Using now (41) and (42) to solve for relative price disparities, we get,

instead of (25):

                      *
(45)             =          + (E+E)p      +
                                              (1—E)t
                                                        —
                                                            (l+E)t

where        E. =                I   =   x,m < 1.

        Since trade is not balanced, however, we simultaneously determine Lm and

L in terms of T*, p, tms t and the reported surplus:


(46)         AL =

                        + PL (1_)t +              P*L(1I)t      -



                     = mu1b +

where             = E
             m          m

                 =                            +
                     E{1+[(1+c)e9
                                         —21—


              =   *[••
                   xx/P*L
                       mm
and        A = P*L ((1+e'+)c +

      Note that when    =   1, we get back to the original expression. An
increase in the premium will decrease legal trade and conversely. Increases

in trade taxes unambiguously reduce legal trade, and an increase in the trade

surplus      increases exports and lowers imports. A devaluation of the official

rate, by lowering the premium, will increase both exports and imports, such

that the net effect is zero. Nevertheless, the effect of the official

exchange rate on the reported trade balance should be explicitly introduced.



Conclusion


      This model can easily be extended to allow for wealth effects, along the

lines of Macedo (1985). Despite its simplicity, it captures the basic

relationship between currency inconvertibility, trade taxes and smuggling.

In particular it shows that, even when trade is balanced, the existence of a

black market premium and non-traded goods allows for the possibility of trade

taxes not reducing welfare. The model did not make the usual assumption that

there were real costs to smuggling activity, except for the possibility of

detection. It shows that the black market premium Is a weighted average of

trade taxes, thus providing current account transactions as the fundamental

determinants of the long-run free exchange rate.

      The model can also be enriched by specifying the choice of the government

with respect to the enforcement of exchange controls and the detection of tax

evasion. Most important, however, would be the explicit consideration of

monetary and exchange rate policy, which is pushed to the background by

assuming that legal trade is balanced at the prevailing official exchange

rate. Some of these extensions are in our current research agenda.
