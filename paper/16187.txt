                                               ABSTRACT

We perform an experimental study of complexity to assess its effect on trading behavior, price volatility,
liquidity, and trade efficiency. Subjects were asked to deduce the value of a particular asset from information
they were given about the composition and price of several portfolios. Following that, subjects traded
with each other anonymously in a well-defined, simple bargaining process. Portfolio problems ranged
from requiring simple analysis to more complicated computation. Complexity altered subjects' bidding
strategies, decreased liquidity, increased price volatility, and decreased trade efficiency. Female subjects
were affected more by complexity (e.g., lower trade frequency), although they achieved higher payoffs
in the complex treatment. Our analysis suggests that complexity may be a driver of volatility and liquidity
in financial markets and provides novel testable empirical predictions.

1    Introduction

Complexity bounds the ability of market participants to accurately model and value assets. Some
assets are easier to analyze (e.g. treasury bonds), whereas others have unbounded contingencies
that prevent humans from pinning down their exact values (e.g., corporate bonds with embedded
American options and credit default swaps). Indeed, for many financial assets there does not exist
closed-form analytical solutions. Moreover, as securities are serially repackaged (e.g. collateralized
debt obligations), this further complicates values and leads to higher uncertainty of assessments.
In the end, even though complexity may increase uncertainty, this is not its most salient feature:
complexity makes it difficult for market participants to forecast the essential inputs required to
value the asset in the first place.
    The purpose of this paper is to explore how complexity affects trading in a market setting.
Specifically, we address the following questions: How does complexity affect willingness-to-trade
(i.e., liquidity), price volatility, and gains from trade? Do differences in gender or educational
background exacerbate these effects? If regulators were to insist that traded assets be standardized,
what effects would such policies have in the market?
    We address these questions by studying complexity in a laboratory setting. Participants were
asked to evaluate the price of certain assets and were then given the opportunity to make trades
based on their information. They each participated in fifteen distinct periods, each of which was
composed of two stages. In the first stage, each participant was given information regarding several
portfolios composed of four assets and was asked to submit their best estimate of the value of
a particular asset included in these portfolios. Following that, in the second stage, participants
were randomly paired and were given the opportunity to trade the asset through a well-defined
bargaining process. The complexity involved in assessing the asset’s value from the portfolios
varied across rounds, and we collected information regarding frequency of trade, trading prices,
and trading surplus as a function of complexity.
    Our results show that complexity affected both the liquidity and price volatility of the assets
traded in our experimental setting. The frequency of transactions was significantly lower and
the payoff asymmetry was significantly higher when the computation required was more complex.
Importantly, though, these findings impacted the trade surplus generated in each round: making
the required computation more simple increased the trade efficiency by 11% (from 73% to 81%).
This was more pronounced when there were more bidding rounds allowed. Whereas efficiency rose
from 73% to 84% for the simple treatment when the number of rounds increased from one to three,


                                                   1
efficiency remained unimproved in the complex treatment (72% versus 73%). This implies that
while on average some participants enjoyed an advantage over their counterparts with complexity
(higher payoff asymmetry), the aggregate surplus tended to be lower.
   Complexity also made realized prices more volatile. At first blush, this might be explained by
the fact that participants tended to make more computational errors when valuing the complex
assets. However, we account for this by estimating the sellers’ and buyers’ bidding strategies as a
function of their estimates with and without complexity. While controlling for guess estimates, we
show that the bid as a function of each trader’s estimate is much flatter when the portfolio problem
is more complex. This implies that the subjects were more conservative in their bidding when faced
with complexity. Therefore, complexity affects prices through two channels: while it induces higher
estimation errors, it also causes a change in trading behavior that heightens uncertainty in realized
prices.
   Demographic factors also impacted the effect of complexity on trading behavior. We collected
information such as gender, educational background (i.e., college major), and intellect (i.e., grade
point average in college). Importantly, we showed that none of these characteristics had any effect
on the tendency for subjects to make estimation errors or on their overall earnings. This was not
the case for trading behavior, however. We found that female participants were more affected by
complexity: they exhibited greater reduction in transaction frequency, higher payoff asymmetry, a
larger bid gap for transactions that failed to occur, and higher price volatility. Females did enjoy
higher payoffs in the complex treatment, however. Educational background was also related to
the effect of complexity on trading. Participants with an economics background (as opposed to
engineering background) had a less severe drop in trading frequency, a higher payoff asymmetry,
and a lower bid gap for transactions that failed to occur. Finally, college GPA did not predict any
differences in any of the treatment groups.
   As pointed out by Brunnermeier and Oehmke (2009), asset complexity may have asset pricing
implications and may drive how assets are managed and traded. For example, during the recent
financial crisis, it is an understatement to say that many financial models failed. One of the driving
forces was the inability of key market participants to value assets that were serially securitized.
Following this, the challenge in valuing toxic assets and managing credit default swap obligations
worsened the ability of the market to right itself and avoid illiquidity spirals. Given this, it appears
of value to explore how assets are managed and traded when it is challenging, if not impossible, to
forecast key drivers of valuation.
   Admittedly, our results here are not obtained using professional traders. One might wonder how

                                                   2
the behavior of the subjects in our study would differ from people who trade complex assets for a
living. In this way, our work complements the study by Bernardo and Cornell (1997), who provide
empirical evidence that the complexity of collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO’s) causes the
variance of bids to be much larger than can be explained by estimation error alone. In comparison
to an empirical study like Bernardo and Cornell (1997), our experimental investigation does allow
us to control for confounding variables that would make real-world tests challenging: imperfect
information, hidden attributes (e.g., quality), relationships between traders, self-selection, and the
innate liquidity of assets. Our work also makes several novel predictions that might be studied in
financial markets. For example, our results imply that regulation requiring asset standardization
should decrease price volatility, increase liquidity, and generate welfare (though increased trade
surplus). Likewise, assets with more contingencies should have more price volatility than predicted
by the underlying assets used to replicate them. Testing these predictions is the subject of future
research.
   Our work adds to a growing literature on complexity in financial markets, which demonstrates
that complexity is a robust concern that is not alleviated with competition. Arora, Barak, Brun-
nermeier, and Ge (2010) show that once complexity is taken into consideration, derivatives can
actually worsen asymmetric information costs instead of decreasing them. Carlin (2009) studies
the effect of competition on complexity and shows that as the number of firms rises, each firm
adds more complexity to its prices. Carlin, Iannaccone, and Davies (2010) show that discretionary
disclosure and market transparency are minimized with perfect competition. Carlin and Manso
(2010) show that educational initiatives undertaken by a social planner to increase sophistication
may worsen the amount of complexity in the market. Given the presence of such forces, our analysis
here appears economically important and interesting.
   Finally, to our knowledge, our paper is the first to explore the effect of complexity on asset
trading. There are, however, other experimental papers that have explored various aspects of
bargaining games related to ours, which is often referred to as incomplete information sealed-bid.
Chatterjee and Samuelson (1983) theoretically analyze such a bargaining game and show that the
Nash equilibrium strategy is monotonic in bidders’ reservation values. Radner and Schotter (1989)
test this experimentally and find that subjects do use strategies that approximate monotonic,
linear bidding functions and that subjects capture a large fraction of the available trading surplus.
Schotter (1990) discusses a large set of experiments using the same bargaining mechanism while
varying different features of the environment. Bidding strategies largely remain monotonic, if not
always linear, but the efficiency of the mechanism remains intact. Our work adds to theirs in

                                                  3
several respects. Whereas Radner and Schotter (1989) and Schotter (1990) provide their subjects
with precise information about their private values, we do not. Instead, our subjects are given full
information in a form that requires computation. In some cases, this may lead subjects to have
uncertainty about their private value, which may affect their trading behavior. Indeed, as we show,
complexity can affect the linear bidding strategy, making it less responsive to changes in value
estimates. Further, as we show, while the simple treatments with three bidding rounds reproduced
the trade efficiency in Schotter (1990), complexity had an adverse affect on welfare.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe our experimental set-up.
In Section 3, we describe our data. Section 4 characterizes our results. Section 5 provides some
concluding remarks.


2    Experimental Design

Every subject in the study participated in one, and only one, experimental session. Each session was
composed of fifteen periods. At the beginning of each period, every subject was given information
about the composition and price of four portfolios. They were asked to estimate the value of a
particular asset within the portfolios, and this estimate was recorded. Following that, each subject
was allowed to trade with an anonymous partner (i.e., another subject) in a well-defined, simple
bargaining process that we specify shortly. Assets were traded in Experimental Currency Units
(ECU’s), with the exchange rate being one ECU equal to ten cents.
    The value of the particular security of interest could be solved deductively by using the principal
of no arbitrage. Specifically, the subjects received information about four baskets of securities,
labeled ‘Basket 1’ through ‘Basket 4’. Each basket contained quantities of four securities, labeled
‘Security A’ through ‘Security D’. Subjects were given information such as the number of units of
each security in each basket and the price of each basket. Figure 1 provides an example of a typical
problem that a subject might face.
    Given the information provided, the problems faced by the subject were either Simple or Com-
plex. Simple portfolio problems could often be solved by inspection, or with minimal computation.
Complex problems required more effort and ingenuity. However, no matter how challenging the
problem, the information was sufficient to determine the price of the traded security with certainty.
Each subject was given three minutes to estimate the asset’s value, i.e., assess the value of security
D. We divided the fifteen periods in the session into three sets of five periods, with each set either
containing simple or complex problems. We made sure that every fifteen-period session included


                                                   4
at least one set of Simple and one set Complex periods, so that we could study within-subject
variation in trading behavior. In each period, subjects were asked to submit their best estimates
of the fundamental value of the security in question. Subjects whose guess fell within one unit of
their true private value received an additional five ECUs.1
    Following this, each subject participated in a simple and intuitive bargaining game. They
were assigned the role of buyer or seller, and were randomly paired with another subject with the
opposite role. Subjects were allowed to trade anonymously over either one or three bargaining
rounds, which was chosen randomly. For any bargaining round, the subjects were given thirty
seconds to simultaneously submit bids. If either trading partner failed to do so, the bidding round
terminated. If the bid submitted by the buyer (weakly) exceeded that submitted by the seller, a
transaction occurred in which the buyer paid the seller the average value of the bids. The payoff
from a trade for the buyer was equal to their true value of the security minus the traded price.
Likewise, the payoff from a trade for the seller was equal to the transaction price minus their true
value of the security. In periods with one bargaining round, if no transaction took place, no more
bargaining was allowed. In periods with three bargaining rounds, if a bargaining round did not
result in a transaction, subjects were notified that no transaction occurred but were not informed
of each others’ bids. If a transaction did not occur by the end of the three bargaining rounds,
subjects forfeited any value from trade.
    The following is a timeline of what information the subjects had during each session. First,
before each subject began the study, they were given full instructions regarding the protocol. We
confirmed understanding of the instructions by giving each subject a formal quiz to test their
proficiency regarding the protocol. Following that, at the time that subjects were given each
portfolio problem, they were also assigned a role of seller or buyer, and were told whether there
would be one or three bargaining rounds in the trading game. During each session, we did not
allow subjects to communicate with each other. Information collected from subjects and trade
between them occurred anonymously via a computer terminal, utilizing a standard z-tree program
(Fischbacher, 2003).2 Finally, it is important to note that both buyers and sellers were provided
with the same set of securities with the only difference being the price of the baskets. The value
of the buyer’s baskets was set so that the true value of security D was higher than for the seller.
That difference was randomly chosen from a uniform distribution ranging from zero to twenty.

     The first two sessions were conducted without explicitly rewarding subjects for accurate guesses. However, we
find no difference in subjects’ errors between the first two sessions and the remaining sessions.

    At the end of each period, subjects were informed whether a trade had occurred and the value
of Security D to them. At the end of the experiment, subjects received a detailed account of their
ECU earnings in each period, and their total pay, which was remitted in U.S. dollars.


3     Data

The data was collected over the course of five independent sessions at the McCombs School of
Business, at the University of Texas at Austin . Sessions typically lasted just over an hour and the
average pay was $15 (including the $5 show-up fee), with a standard deviation of $4.30.
    Table 1 describes the data collected. Sessions varied in the total number of subjects (due to
variation in enrollment) and the number and order of Simple and Complex periods. However, the
total number of periods in each condition is roughly the same: 242 in the Simple treatment and
272 in the Complex treatment. In total, 70 subjects participated in the experiment with no subject
attending more than one session.
    At the end of each session, subjects completed a short demographics survey. In our sample,
the majority of subjects were male (61 of 70), majored in economics (47 of 70), and were at an
advanced stage of their school work (47 were third or higher year). The mean (self-reported) GPA
was 3.48.
    We did not apply any filtering to the data. The only observations that were dropped from
the analysis were those in which one or both subjects did not submit a bid during a given round.
This happened in 33 rounds (14 of which occurred in the Simple condition and 19 occurred in the
Complex condition) of the 804 total rounds of the experiment.


4     Analysis
4.1   Session Level Results

We start by providing simple session-level descriptive statistics. Panel A of Table 2 confirms that
periods designed to be complex were perceived differently by subjects than periods designed to
be simple. In this table, we report for each session the average, across subjects and periods, of
the variables discussed below. The last column of Table 2 reports the p-values from a t-test of
mean differences between the two conditions (Simple vs. Complex). This test makes the most
conservative use of the data as it treats all observations collected in a given session and treatment
condition as a single observation. This is intended to capture any correlations across periods and
subjects.

                                                 6
   Recall that at the beginning of each period, subjects were asked to guess the value of the
security. We compare these estimates with the actual value of the security to assess how estimation
errors varied with treatments. First, we find that complexity leads to more estimation errors: the
frequency in which subjects correctly guess the value of the asset decreased from 72% in the Simple
treatment to 31% in the Complex treatment. Likewise, the average guess error increased from
2.38 in the Simple treatment to 7.55 in the Complex treatment. Finally, we observe a difference
in bid errors, not just estimation errors. While it is hard to determine what an optimal strategy
might be, it is clear that buyers cannot benefit from submitting bids that exceed their private value
estimates. Likewise, sellers cannot benefit from submitting bids that are lower than their private
value estimates. Indeed, bids violating these condition are relatively rare in both treatments.
However, we find that the frequency of bid errors was higher in the Complex treatment compared
with the Simple treatment (22% vs. 14%). As the mean test at the session level results suggest, these
differences are all statistically significant at the 10% level. Payoffs from trading were somewhat
higher in the Simple treatment (3.98 vs. 3.58 ECUs) but this difference was not statistically
different.

4.2    Within-Subject Treatment Effect

Three broad questions that we addressed were:

  (i) Does complexity affect liquidity and efficiency, i.e., the creation of surplus?

 (ii) Does complexity affect the division of surplus?

(iii) Does complexity affect price volatility?

   To analyze these questions, we created the following dependent variables:

  (i) Liquidity

         • Frequency of Transaction: the fraction of period ended with a transaction (0, 1).

         • Bid Gap: the bid deviation between the two players (in the last round of bidding) when
             final bids did not result in transactions. This can be thought of an additional measure
             of market liquidity (in addition to the frequency of transactions).

         • Number of Rounds Used: the number of rounds used in a period conditional on
             there being three possible rounds of bidding.



                                                   7
 (ii) Efficiency

         • Efficiency: the fraction of total surplus available from trade that is captured by both
           parties together.

(iii) Division

         • Payoff Asymmetry: the surplus deviation from trading between the two players. This
           measure captures the payoff uncertainty involved in transacting in the market.

 (iv) Volatility

         • Price Volatility: the volatility of normalized transaction prices (across groups and
           periods). Normalized transaction prices are obtained by subtracting the mid-point of
           subjects’ private values from the traded price.

   Panel B of Table 2 demonstrates the treatment effect on these dependent variables. We find
that complexity decreased the frequency of transactions by about 6%, increased payoff asymmetry
by 40%, increased the bid gap by 20%, and increased price volatility by 38%. These differences are
economically large and statistically different from zero at the 10% significance level.
   Most striking, maybe, is the substantial reduction in efficiency. In the Simple treatment, the
average efficiency was 81%, which is consistent with the efficiency level found in previous experi-
ments that used this bargaining mechanism (e.g., Schotter, 1990). In contrast, the efficiency in the
Complex treatment was 73%. This difference is both economically and statistically significant. It
is important to note that prior literature found the level of efficiency to be a robust feature of the
bargaining institution that is studied here, and not the environment. Schotter (1990), on page 222,
states that: “These results substantiate the claim that the mechanism appears to be robust not
only to the parameters of the environment but also to the manner in which people behave under it
given these parameters”. The observed reduction in efficiency we observe as result of introducing
complexity is therefore significant.
   Our main empirical approach in the paper was to utilize the within-subject design of the exper-
iment while making conservative use of the data. Since our focus was on the main treatment effect,
we treated every subject as a unit of observation, averaging the dependent variable (e.g., frequency
of transaction) within each of the conditions and taking the difference between the two averages.
That is, each observation in the tests that we performed is the difference in the level of the depen-
dent variable across the two treatments for a given subject. Under the null, this difference should


                                                  8
be zero. This approach has a few advantages. First, it controls for the idiosyncratic attributes of
each subject’s individual behavior as it is netted out when taking differences. Second, it controls for
the correlation in behavior across periods for a given subject by measuring the dependent variable
as the average across all periods.
   We regressed the difference in each of the measures on a constant and a set of subject charac-
teristics. Table 3 presents the results, separated into three panels. Consistent with the session-level
summary statistics, we found that complexity lowered the frequency of transactions, increased pay-
off asymmetry, increased the bid gap, and increased the traded price volatility. We did not find
that complexity effected the number of rounds used in a period or the payoffs. The last result may
appear surprising at first, but becomes more intuitive when considering the random variables that
impacted the payoff realizations. The payoff in a given period depends on whether a transaction
took place, the level of surplus (i.e., the difference between the buyer’s and seller’s true values), and
the split of that surplus. Given that the total surplus was randomly drawn for each period and did
not depend on the subjects’ decisions, payoffs would be a noisy proxy for transaction frequency.
Given that payoff asymmetry increased with complexity, the variance of payoffs would go up with
complexity.
   Table 3 also relates the treatment effect to subject characteristics. Specifically, we ask whether
the magnitude of the treatment effect is related to subjects’ number of years in school, GPA, gender,
and major. To reduce the risk of over-fitting, we did not run the regressions with one characteristic
at a time. If we did so, the ratio of independent variables to observations would become very low.
   The two characteristics that emerged as being significantly related to the treatment effect, across
a number of measures, were gender and college major. The results suggest that female subjects
were more affected by the treatment compared with male subjects, as measured by transaction
frequency, payoff asymmetry, and price volatility. At the same time, female subjects appeared to
obtain higher payoffs in the Complex treatment (compared with the Simple treatment), while male
subjects appeared to earn lower payoffs in the Complex treatment. In contrast, economics majors
were affected less by complexity, as compared to non-economics majors (primarily engineering
majors), as measured by the number of rounds used and by price volatility. However, economics
majors earned less in the Complex condition compared with the Simple condition.
   To check whether these differential treatment effects were driven by a latent relationship between
subject characteristics and their overall performance in the experiment, we regressed the various
measures of errors and payoffs on the same set of characteristics. For example, it may be the
case that economics students were less prone to making mistakes in the experiment, and that the

                                                   9
Complex treatment simply loads on this tendency. As we can see from Table 4, this was not the
case: none of the characteristics, including gender and major, were significantly related to measures
of errors or payoffs.

4.3   Bidding Strategies

To better understand what is driving these aggregate results, we studied the subjects’ bidding
strategies. Prior literature (e.g., Radner and Schotter, 1989; Schotter, 1990) suggests that subjects’
bids are approximately linear in their private value. Of course, the shape of the function depends on
each subject’s role in the bargaining game (buyer or seller) and the number bargaining rounds (one
or three) . Our primary focus here is to test whether this function is different across treatments.
   We separated periods in which there was only one possible bargaining round from periods in
which there were three; clearly, a subject’s strategy in round one may differ based on the ability to
engage in subsequent bargaining. We further distinguish between bids of buyers and sellers.
   For each subset of observations, we estimated the following regression:

          Bidi,t = β0 + β1 × Guessi,t + β2 × Complexi + β3 × Guessi,t × Complexi + ǫi,t           (1)

where Guessi,t is subject’s i’s guess of the security value in period i, Complexi is a dummy repre-
senting the treatment in period i such that it is equal to one if the condition is Complex (and zero
otherwise).
   Table 5 presents the estimation results, when using robust regressions to control for outliers,
and Figure 2 depicts the bid functions of buyers and sellers in the Simple and Complex condition
in one-round periods. First, it is clear that the bids were generally increasing in the subjects’
guesses of the security’s value. Second, the buyers’ and sellers’ bidding functions appeared to be
somewhat different. Recall that the parameters of our experiment were such that unconditionally
(before receiving information about the baskets), sellers’ private values of the traded security were
uniformly distributed between one and twenty, while buyers’ private values of the traded security
were uniformly distributed between two and forty. The figures also suggest that the bid function
was different across the treatment conditions. In the Complex treatment, the bidding function
appeared to be flatter compared with the Simple condition.
   The first two columns in Table 5 use data from periods in which there was only one bargaining
round, and the last two columns use data from the first round in periods where three bargaining
rounds were available. We find that the linear bidding function describes the data very well – the
coefficient on subjects’ guesses is positive and statistically different from zero across all columns.

                                                 10
In addition, the explanatory power of the model is quite high, with R2 s ranging from around 19.5%
to 68.5%. In addition, we find a strong treatment effect. In all columns, the bid function is less
responsive to the subjects’ own guess of the value in the Complex condition, compared with the
Simple condition. Finally, consistent with one’s intuition, we find that subjects’ bid functions
are less aggressive when they have more negotiation rounds. That is, seller’s private value guess
coefficient in the three round periods is 0.57, down from 0.74 in the one round periods. Likewise,
buyers’ private value guess coefficient in the three round periods is 0.61, down from 0.69 in the
one round periods. At the same time, the effect of complexity on the bid function appears to be
similar.    3



4.4      Multi-round Periods

We now turn to look at subjects’ strategies in periods with multiple bargaining rounds. As we
saw from Table 5, the first round of bidding in these periods was characterized by less aggressive
bidding by both buyers and sellers as compared with the case when only one round of bidding was
available. One would expect subjects to improve their bids after each round of failed bargaining.
To test that, we create two measures:

      • Bid Change: current minus previous bid for sellers, and previous minus current bid for
        buyers. This quantity is positive when buyers and sellers improve their bids’ competitiveness.

      • Bid Improvement: is a dummy variable taking the value of one if the current bid is weakly
        more competitive than the prior bid and zero otherwise.

      In Table 6 we ask whether there is evidence that subjects made their bids more competitive
across rounds of bargaining. In the first two columns, the dependent variable is Bid Change and
we use standard regressions. In the next two columns, the dependent variable is Bid Improvement
and we use probit regressions. The results suggest that subjects indeed improved their bid in at
least 63% of rounds, and that the average improvement size was 1.5 ECUs. Without controlling
for differential change in behavior over periods for the two treatment conditions, we find that the
cross-round improvement for subjects in the Simple and Complex treatments were similar. However,
when we interact the period number with the treatment dummy, we find that initially subjects in
the Simple treatment were much more prone to increase their bids’ competitiveness than subjects
in the Complex treatment. At the same time, there was some evidence that the competitiveness of
the bids in the Complex treatment improved over time.

      These results are robust to the inclusion of subject fixed-effects or subject errors.


                                                             11
    Another interesting finding was the difference in efficiency across periods with one and three
rounds of bargaining. The improvement was significantly more pronounced in the Simple treatment,
where average efficiency went from 73% in one-round periods to 84% in three-round periods – a
full eleven percentage point increase. However, efficiency increased only marginally in the Complex
treatment, rising from 72% in one-round periods to 73% in three-round periods.
    Our findings suggest that subjects’ strategies were substantially affected by complexity. This
result is consistent with Schotter (1990), who finds that changes in prior distributions of private
values altered subjects’ bid strategies. However, he points out that while subjects’ strategies are
affected by changes in the environment, the overall efficiency does not. Interestingly, the average
efficiency across a large set of experiments and conditions was around 80%, identical to the efficiency
we observe in the Simple condition (81%). However, the efficiency in the Complex condition was
substantially lower at 73%.

4.5   Learning and Declining Effort

One possible concern with the external validity of our experimental results are the issues of learning
during the experiment or tiring out. In short, one may worry that the results obtained in the labo-
ratory reflect lack of experience with the task and that upon repetition, subjects would substantial
alter their behavior. Alternatively, it might be possible that subjects might become apathetic or
bored during the experiment, thereby making more errors as the fifteen periods elapsed.
    These are valid concerns and we consider whether learning or tiring out during the course of
the experiment was a significant factor. To that end, we analyzed the variation of the some key
measures across the different stages of the experiment. Since the treatment condition varied with
periods, we separated the data by condition. Table 7 presents the results. Looking at various error
measures, subjects’ payoffs and the frequency of transactions do not vary monotonically with period
number during the experiment. The only measure that appeared to be significantly higher during
the first set of periods (1-5) was the average guess error in the Complex treatment. Therefore,
while subjects might learn or alternatively tire out during the experiment, this does not appear to
be a first order concern.


5     Concluding Remarks

Complexity of financial markets has become a fact of life. Based on recent events in financial
markets, it is now clear that financial models can fail and that market participants are not all-



                                                  12
knowing. Previous crashes and crises have also verified this, but our profession appears to be more
receptive to investigating the effects of complexity on markets at the present time.
   In this paper, we study the effects of complexity on trading behavior in an experimental market
setting. We show that complexity leads to lower liquidity, higher price volatility, and a loss in trade
efficiency. Strikingly, this appears to be separate from the estimation errors made by the study
participants. For example, considering subjects of varied demographic characteristics, estimation
error did not vary among them. However, trading behavior did: females were affected more and
people with an economics background were affected less.
   Our results tend to support the policy implication that standardization of assets may improve
welfare, making assets more liquid and less volatile. Admittedly, though, our work is merely a
first step toward studying this problem and the potential value of this policy. Indeed, traders in
real markets have experience in dealing with such phenomena and may differ in their response to
complexity. Whether the findings we demonstrate generalize to real settings remains an open, but
important question, and is the subject of future research.

The table reports the average level of various measures across the two treatment conditions (Simple and Complex),
and sessions. Panel A focuses on measures of complexity: the fraction of periods in which subjects provided an exact
guess of their private value, the average guess error, the fraction of rounds in which buyers (sellers) submitted bids
that were higher (lower) then their estimated private values. Panel B focuses on the main dependent variables: the
average fraction of surplus captured by both subjects, the fraction of periods resulting in a transaction, the average
payoff asymmetry (across the two subjects), the average bid gap (in rounds that did not result in a transaction), the
average number of rounds used before a transaction took place, and the adjusted price volatility. The final column
reports the p-values from a mean equality test across treatments, treating each session as an observation.

The table reports regression results of differences in the observed level of the dependent variables for each subject,
across the two treatment conditions, on a constant and a number of subject characteristics. The dependent variables
are the change in transaction frequency, the change in payoff asymmetry, the change in bid gap, the change in
the number of rounds used to reach a transaction, the change in payoffs, and the change in price volatility. The
independent variables are the school year of the subject, the overall GPA, gender (equals one for female), and major
(equals one for economics). Each subject is treated as an observation.

The table reports the average level of the dependent variables (across periods and rounds) for each subject on a
number of demographic data. The dependent variables include the fraction of periods in which subjects provided an
exact guess of their private value, the average guess error, the fraction of rounds in which buyers (sellers) submitted
bids that were higher (lower) then their estimated private values, the fraction of periods resulting in a transaction,
the average payoff asymmetry (across the two subjects), the average bid gap (in rounds that did not result in a
transaction), the average number of rounds used before a transaction took place, and the average payoffs. The
independent variables include the gender (equals one for a female), major (equals one for economics), school year,
and GPA.

                                   Table 6: Bid Change Across Rounds
We regress the bid change across rounds of negotiation (columns 1 and 2) and a dummy for bid improvement (columns
3 and 4) on the treatment dummy, number of periods, and their interaction. Bid change equals to round t minus
round t − 1 bid for buyers and round t − 1 minus round t bid for sellers. The Bid Improvement dummy equals one if
the bid change is weakly positive, and zero otherwise. In columns 1 and 2 we use OLS regressions and in columns 3
and 4 we use probit regressions.
