A Tale of Two Labor Markets: Intergenerational Occupational Mobility in Britain and the U.S. Since
1850

                                           ABSTRACT

The U.S. both tolerates more inequality than Europe and believes its economic mobility is greater
than Europe's. These attitudes and beliefs help account for differences in the magnitude of
redistribution through taxation and social welfare spending. In fact, the U.S. and Europe had roughly
equal rates of inter-generational occupational mobility in the late twentieth century. We extend this
comparison into the late nineteenth century using longitudinal data on 23,000 nationally-
representative British and U.S. fathers and sons. The U.S. was substantially more mobile then Britain
through 1900, so in the experience of those who created the U.S. welfare state in the 1930s, the U.S.
had indeed been "exceptional." The margin by which U.S. mobility exceeded British mobility was
erased by the 1950s, as U.S. mobility fell compared to its nineteenth century levels.

                                             Introduction

        [W]e have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course,
        language. Oscar Wilde, The Canterville Ghost (1887).

        The economies of Britain and the U.S. have had much in common over the two centuries

since the American Revolution: their legal traditions and property rights systems, sources of labor,

capital, and technology, political ties and alliances in two world wars, and – Wilde’s quip

notwithstanding – language and culture are the most obvious. One significant respect in which they

have differed, however, is the progressivity of their taxation and the scale of their social welfare

spending, at least through the late 1970s. Policies in the U.S. reflect a belief that high rates of

economic mobility leave little need for substantial redistribution by the state. Public opinion surveys

are consistent with these priorities and a belief in high rates of mobility: Americans are less

concerned by inequality and are less willing to support redistribution than Europeans regardless of

their position in the income distribution. (Alesina, Di Tella, and MacCulloch, 2001)

        Since the 1970s, new large, nationally-representative longitudinal datasets for a variety of

industrialized countries have made possible systematic cross-country mobility comparisons that call

into question the assumptions regarding mobility that seem to underlie U.S. redistributive policies.

The U.S. today exhibits no more income mobility or occupational mobility across generations than

similarly developed countries (Solon, 2002; Solon, 1999; Erickson and Goldthorpe, 1992), though

U.S. policies for the last 75 years have been predicated on American “exceptionalism” to the

mobility patterns seen across a broad set of nations. Piketty (1995) provides a model of “dynastic

learning” in which two economies can, as a result of differences in mobility in the past, settle upon




                                                     1
and retain very different redistributive regimes even after their mobility patterns have converged.2

The question we address is whether we can identify, for Britain and the U.S., those historical

differences in mobility, particularly intergenerational occupational mobility.

         Commentators throughout the nineteenth century suggested that the U.S. was indeed

“exceptional” in the occupational mobility experienced by its population (as well as in its geographic

mobility). Using nationally-representative data for Britain and the U.S. that follows 23,000 pairs of

fathers and sons from the beginning of the 1850s to the beginning of the 1880s, we offer the first

detailed comparisons of the mobility regimes experienced by these two countries in the generation

before they constructed their respective welfare states. In the process, we also offer a new

perspective on the very different histories of labor relations and political activity by workers in

Britain and the U.S. that past scholars (e.g. Turner in the 1890s; Sombart in the early 1900s;

Thernstrom in the 1970s) have attributed to different amounts of economic opportunity and

mobility by individual workers. Can we actually observe sufficiently large differences to explain these

differences in labor radicalism?

         Britain was chosen as the country to which to compare the U.S. experience because of the

availability of comparable data (described below). But this is also a particularly illuminating

comparison because of the large number of characteristics these two economies have shared since

the middle of the nineteenth century when U.S. industrialization got underway. Intergenerational



         2
            Piketty contends that “The multiplicity of steady states explains at the same time why different
countries can remain in different redistributive equilibria, although the underlying structural parameters of
mobility are essentially the same. This is particularly likely if a country exhibited for some time in the past a
significan tly differen t experie nce of soc ial mob ility before jo ining the ‘comm on’ patte rn. The ‘c anonica l’
applicatio n is the U nited St ates, wh ose ninet eenth ce ntury m obility and class struc ture diffe red signific antly
from tha t of Euro pe before the two countrie s [sic] conv erged in the twe ntieth ce ntury.” ( p. 554) A s we sha ll
see below, the extent of the difference in mob ility between the nineteenth century U.S. and the twentieth
century U.S. is itself a subject of some controversy and one upon which we offer new evidence below.

occupational change was adopted as the metric for mobility for reasons of convenience as well: it is

the only economic outcome that can be examined throughout the period since 1850. It is in some

ways superior to income as a measure of mobility, and in some ways inferior.3 But it is what we have,

and has already been the object of a great deal of research in sociology where methods to analyze

mobility have evolved substantially since the 1960s.

            Previous Research on 19 th Century Mobility in Britain and the U.S.

        Our primary interest is in (1) assessing the differences in mobility between Britain and the

U.S. in the second half of the nineteenth century; (2) comparing that difference to the difference

observed by the 1970s; and (3) explicitly evaluating the change in mobility within the U.S. from the

second half of the nineteenth century to the second half of the twentieth.4 There has been until now

a lack of appropriate data to undertake any of these tasks (though there has been considerable work

comparing twentieth century mobility rates across a set of developed countries, including Britain and

the U.S., in the absence of data adequate to task (1), it has not been possible to say how mobility

differences among countries have changed over long periods of time). We briefly survey the existing

literatures in these areas before proceeding to our own contribution.

        The comparison between Britain and the U.S. in the nineteenth century has been marked by

the boldest pronouncements and the weakest empirical evidence. Britain has been viewed, since the

time of de Tocqueville and Marx, as a considerably more rigid system in which family background

plays a much more significant role is determining current prospects than in the U.S. These


        3
           Björklund and Jäntti (1999, pp. 15-19) summarize some of the relative merits of income and
occupation for the measurement of intergenerational mobility, and discuss scenarios in which they provide
very different results. McMurrer et al. (1997) offer a similar discussion of the relative advantages of different
measu res of interg eneratio nal mo bility.

        4
          No explicit co mparison for B ritain between mobility in the sec ond half of the n ineteenth cen tury
and in the second half of the twentieth century is made because of data comparability issues discussed below.

                                                         3
differences have been attributed to a number of factors – the frontier and the rapid growth of

completely new cities in the U.S., the feudal tradition and guild and apprenticeship systems in

Britain, and the wide availability of free, public education in the U.S.5 But there has been no

consistent data with which these assertions could be directly tested. There are several studies that

have looked at both British nineteenth century mobility and U.S. nineteenth century mobility in

isolation.

         For nineteenth century Britain, Miles (1993 and 1999) and Mitch (1993) have each used

samples of marriage registrations from 1839 to 1914 to measure intergenerational occupational


         5
            In the 18 30s, de T ocque ville note d, “Am ong aristo cratic peo ples, fam ilies rema in for cent uries in
the same condition and often in the same place. . . . Among democratic peoples [e.g. in the U.S.], new families
continu ally spring from no where while ot hers disap pear to no where and all th e rest cha nge the ir comp lexion.”
Three decades later in the 1860 s, Marx saw the U.S. as mo re open and fluid than the older E uropean societies,
with their “developed formation of classes.” American classes, on the other hand, “have not yet become fixed
but continually change and interchange their elements in constant flux.” He related “this situation to the
immature character of the American working-class movement.” He characterized the U.S. as having “a
continuous conversion of wage laborers into independent self-sustaining peasants. The position of wages
laborer is for a very large part of the American people but a probational state, which they are sure to leave
within a longer or a shorter te rm.” A few yea rs after the U .S. Cens us Bur eau de clared th at the co untry’s
internal frontier no longer existed, Frederick Jackson Turner (1921, Chapter IX) described social mobility,
particula rly that in th e weste rn state, as c rucial in th e develo pmen t of Am erican de mocra cy: “Th is, at least, is
clear: Am erican de mocra cy is fund amen tally the o utcom e of the ex perience s of the A merica n people in
dealing with the West. Western democracy through the whole of its earlier period tended to the production of
a society of which the most distinctive fact was the freedom of the individual to rise under conditions of
social mobility, and whose ambition was the liberty and well-being of the masses.” In the first decades of the
early twentieth century, Werner Sombart (1906) attributed the absence of socialism in the U.S. to higher rates
of occupational mobility than in Europe. In the 1970s, Thernstrom shared Marx’s and Sombart’s belief that
nineteenth century American workers enjoyed greater opportunity for social mobility than did their European
counterparts, and that this heightened class fluidity had much to do with America’s particular environment of
class relations and labor organization:

         Ame rican wo rkers… failed to flo ck into la bor and socialist pa rties to the same ex tent as th eir
         European counterparts in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries because of the greater
         permeability of the class structure that governed their lives… The Am erican class
         system…allowed substantial privilege for the privileged and extensive opportunity for the
         underprivileged to coexist simultaneously. It is tempting to argue that…[this] explains…the
         relative absence of acute class conflict in our political history.

         Thernstrom goes on to point out that “as yet, there have not been enough quantitative studies of
mobility in the European past to m ake systematic comparison po ssible.” (Thernstrom, 1973).

                                                             4
mobility.6 At the time of registration, both bride and groom as well as bride’s father and groom’s

father were required to list their occupation. From this information, Miles calculates that between 60

and 68 percent of grooms married between 1839 and 1894 were in the same occupational class as

their fathers when the grooms married. (Miles, 1999, p. 29). Though his finding are in general quite

similar, Mitch finds evidence for slightly more mobility – 61 percent of grooms married between

1869 and 1873 were in the same class as their father, 20 percent were higher, and 19 percent lower.

The data used in both studies, however, are less than ideal.7

         For the nineteenth century U.S., a large number of studies have been completed for specific

communities in the U.S. that give us a rough sense of occupational mobility in the past. For

example, among males who remained in Boston, from 37 to 40 percent of sons ended up in the

same occupational categories as their fathers over the period 1840-89. (Thernstrom, 1973, p. 83)

Though this might in itself seem a sufficient basis on which to conclude that the nineteenth century

U.S. had greater intergenerational occupational mobility than nineteenth century Britain (total

mobility – the fraction of sons found outside their fathers’ occupational categories – was twice as

great in Boston as in Britain), the data for Boston suffers, like that from Britain, from a number of

shortcomings that prevent such simple comparisons.8


         6
          Their samples were somewhat different. They both used marriage registries, but they used different
(possibly overlapping) samples of registries.

         7
           The marriage registry data include only couples married in Anglican churches, so toward the end of
the nineteenth century, these samples are increasingly unrepresentative. By 1914, 42 percent of all marriages
took place outside the Anglican church (Vincent, 1989, p. 281). Also, the occupa tions of th e groom and his
father are recorded at the time of the groom’s marriage, so the father’s and son’s occupations are observed at
different points in th eir life cycles , with the son being conside rably you nger tha n the fath er. If it were possible
to observe the father’s and son’s occupations holding age constant, a different picture of intergenerational
mobility might emerge. Specifically, we might expect to observe a greater likelihood of mobility as the son
gained years and experience in the labor m arket.
         8
          The principal difficulty with historical estimates for the U.S. is that they were most often
constructed by observing a single com munity over a period of decad es. The only individuals whose

                                                            5
         Two additional difficulties apart from the inconsistencies in the collection of the data and

biases introduced by the source materials are: (1) the possibility that differences between the British

and U.S. occupational structures account for much of the difference in total mobility; and (2) the

possibility that even in the absence of these differences in occupational distributions, the imprecision

of the mobility measure employed would obscure more fundamental differences or similarities in

mobility. The measures of mobility provided in our analysis overcome these difficulties.

         One study offers a long-run perspective on intergenerational occupational mobility within

Britain: Miles (1999) attempts to reconcile his findings of increasing fluidity over the nineteenth and

early twentieth centuries with work by Erickson and Goldthorpe (1992), among others, who discern

no trend in intergenerational mobility from the 1940s to the 1970s. Differences in the data for the

two eras (Miles used marriage registers and Erickson and Goldthorpe relied on survey data with a

retrospective question on the occupation of the respondent’s father when the respondent was 14

years of age) diminish the reliability of this comparison.

         Only two studies have attempted to assess how intergenerational mobility changed between

the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the U.S. In a re-analysis of several city-specific studies

from the nineteenth century and together with the Occupational Change in a Generation (OCG)

cohorts for the twentieth, Grusky (1987) concluded that there was significant immobility in the


occupational mobility could be observed were those who remained in the community. It would be surprising
if the movers and stayers did not have systematically different patterns of occupational mobility, given the
positive and often substantial costs of migration. Occupational mobility measured using marriage records
suffers from the sam e shortco ming a s the Britis h data: so ns’ occu pations a re exam ined at d ifferent po ints in
their careers than fathers’ occupations. The new nineteenth century data used below for the U.S. (like that for
Britain) is not limited to individuals who remained in a place for a decade or more and examines sons’ and
fathers’ oc cupatio ns at sim ilar ages, pre senting a more rep resentativ e picture of mob ility than h as previo usly
been available. Though Thernstrom asserted his findings for Boston were consistent with an “American
Pattern,” othe rs were less sangu ine regarding m obility in the ninetee nth century. S umm arizing the literature
on intergenerational mobility in the past, McMurrer et al. (1997) conclude, “Overall, the existing evidence
sugges ts that m obility w as likely no t as great a s sugge sted by p opular lite rature an d the w ritings of T ocque ville
on the op enness o f Ame rican socie ty. Mos t of the rich during e arlier period s w ere ap parently born rich.”

nineteenth century, with the non-manual/manual divide particularly difficult to cross, and an

increase in intergenerational mobility from the nineteenth century to the twentieth century.9

         The work by Guest et al. (1989) is closest to the comparison between U.S. mobility in the

nineteenth century and twentieth centuries carried out below. Comparing a sample of young males

linked from the 1880 U.S. census to the 1900 U.S. census, they find little change from the last two

decades of the nineteenth century to the end of the period covered by the second OCG cohort

(1973). Their comparison is less than entirely apt, however. Their nineteenth century data excluded

most interstate migrants, and the time between the observation of the fathers’ and sons’ occupations

was in all cases greater (by as much as a factor of two) in the nineteenth century data than in the

twentieth century data.10




         9
           Grusky concludes, “This case for ‘American Exceptionalism’ can be evaluated only by comparing
the data for Europe and America in the nineteenth century. It should be clear, however, that the present study
casts doubt on this interpretation [that current belief in high rates of mobility in the U.S. results from rates
that were indeed higher than those elsewhere in the past, though the U.S. rate some time ago converged to the
more g eneral pa ttern], sinc e the rate s of mob ility in the U nited St ates hav e increase d over th e last cent ury.”
(Grusky, 1987, p. 120) Though Grusky’s data make it possible for him to compare mobility over more than a
century, there are significant parts of the population excluded from the nineteenth century samples he
employs because they are based on the population that remained resident for a decade or more in a set of four
cities and towns ( Pough keepsie , NY; H olland, M I; Atlanta , GA; an d Bost on, MA ). These sample s necessa rily
exclude (1) anyone who migrated into or out of any of these cities during the time period examined; (2)
farmers and farm laborers living outside these cities and towns (at time when half of the civilian labor force
was employed in agriculture and most of them lived outside cities and towns); and (3) any rural residents (at a
time when more than three quarters of the U.S. population still lived in places of fewer than 2,500
inhabitants).
         10
            In their nineteenth century data, the individual’s father’s occupation was observed in 1880, and the
individual’s own occupation was observed in 1900, twenty years later. In the two OCG cohorts, the
individual’s own occupation was observed in the survey year (1962 or 1973), but the father’s occupation
reported was that for the father when the respondent was 16 years of age. Guest et al. (1989) used males from
the OCG who were 25-34 in the survey year, so they have between 9 (for 25 year olds) and 18 years (for 34
year olds ) betwe en the rep ort of their fa ther’s occ upation and the report of th eir own .

                                                            7
         The literature comparing twentieth century intergenerational mobility across developed

countries is now voluminous.11 The comparison between Britain and the U.S. undertaken by

Kerckhoff et al. (1985), like almost all international comparisons involving these two countries, uses

the Oxford Social Mobility Study (1972) for Britain and the second cohort of the OCG (1973) for

the U.S. They find “considerably more overall inter-generational and career mobility in the United

States, but . . . the major differences between the two societies are due to shifts in the distributions

of kinds of occupations.” (1985, p. 281). Erickson and Goldthorpe (1992) examine a broader set of

countries, and likewise find the U.S. and Britain roughly similar in intergenerational mobility, after

accounting for differences in the distributions of occupations across the two countries, as did

Grusky and Hauser (1984) in analyzing a set of 16 countries including Britain and the U.S.12 In

income terms, Solon (2002) and Björklund and Jäntti (1999) find similarly high rates of income

immobility across generations in Britain and the U.S., with both exhibiting considerably less mobility

from fathers to sons than Canada, Finland, and Sweden.

                                                     The Data

         We use a common methodology in constructing nineteenth century data to compare

mobility between the U.S. and Britain. For both countries we link a sample of males from the

1850/1851 census to the census taken thirty years later in 1880/1881. Our choice of Britain as a

comparison was dictated by the availability of sources making it possible to construct longitudinal

data in exactly the same manner as for the U.S. For Britain we use information on approximately

13,000 males linked from the 1851 British census to the 1881 British census, and for the U.S. on

           Treiman and Ganzenboom (2000) provide a useful survey of the entire history of comparative
research on occupational mob ility, both within and across generations.

         Contra sting view s are foun d in W ong (19 90) wh o finds gre ater mo bility in Brit ain than in the U.S .,

nearly 10,000 males linked from the 1850 to the 1880 U.S. Federal Censuses. Details on the

matching procedure, representativeness, and sensitivity tests are described in the Appendix.

        The only economic outcome available in the longitudinal data used here is self-reported

occupation. We observe the father’s occupation in 1850 (U.S.) or 1851 (Britain) and the son’s

occupation thirty years later. After collapsing hundreds of occupational titles into a reasonable set of

categories it becomes possible to construct tables that describe the transitions from fathers’

occupational categories to sons’ occupational categories. We have used four categories (white collar,

farmer, skilled and semi-skilled, and unskilled) to reduce the sparseness of the mobility tables, but

where it has been possible to use a larger number of categories, the basic qualitative results reported

below are unchanged.13

        For the twentieth century, we have employed the same data as others who have worked in

this area: the Oxford Mobility Study for Britain and the OCG (1973 cohort) for the U.S.14 In each

the respondent’s occupation at the time of the survey is taken as the son’s occupation, and the

occupation that the respondent reported his father to have had when the respondent was age 14

(Britain) or 16 (U.S.) is taken as the father’s. To prevent differences in the impact of the Great

Depression from influencing the results, males age 31-37 (whose fathers’ reported occupations

would have been in 1949-1955) were used from the British data and males age 33-39 (whose fathers’

reported occupations would have been in 1950-1956) were used from the U.S. data. This yields a

range of years between fathers’ and sons’ occupations of 17 to 23 years, and an average of roughly

20. This was done to ensure comparability with the U.S. data from the nineteenth century: though

the direct nineteenth century comparison between Britain and the U.S. will use a thirty-year interval

between fathers’ and sons’ occupations (a restriction dictated by the sources available for Britain),

the U.S. sources also allowed the creation of two twenty-year samples (one with fathers observed in

1860 and sons observed in 1880, and one with fathers observed in 1880 and sons observed in 1900).

These will be used for assessing change in mobility over time within the U.S.15

        Intergenerational occupational mobility can be assessed through the analysis of simple two

dimensional matrices, with categories for fathers’ occupations arrayed across one dimension and

categories for sons’ occupations arrayed across the other. Comparing mobility across two places or

times requires comparison of two matrices. Suppose fathers and sons can be found in either of two

jobs.16 A matrix that summarizes intergenerational mobility in location P has the form

with fathers’ occupations (1 or 2) as columns and sons’ occupations (1 or 2) as rows. The entry in

the upper left (p11) is the number of sons of job 1 fathers who themselves obtained job 1. One

simple measure of the overall mobility in P is the fraction of sons who end up in jobs different from

those of their fathers: MP=(p12+p21)/ (p11+p21+p12+p22).

twenty year interv als.

           No ordering can be im posed on the occupations. W hen we turn to analysis of the nineteenth
century data with four categories (w hite collar, farmer, skilled/semi-skilled, and unskilled), it is possible to
rank unskilled last unambiguously, but it is not clear how to rank the others relative to unskilled. There are no

        Though this measure has the virtue of simplicity as a benchmark, it also has a shortcoming

when mobility is compared across two matrices P and Q: it does not distinguish between differences

in mobility (1) arising from differences across the matrices in the distributions of fathers’ and sons’

occupations (differences in what Hauser, 1980, labels “prevalence”) and (2) arising from differences

across the matrices in the association between father’s and sons’ jobs that may occur even if the

distributions of fathers’ and sons’ occupations were identical in P and Q (differences in what

Hauser, 1980, calls “interaction”). Consider              and              for which MP=10/30 and

MQ=25/65. The marginal frequencies differ, so it is not clear whether the difference in observed

mobility M results from this difference or from something more fundamental such as differences

between P and Q in the amount of human capital necessary to achieve job 1 .

        One way to proceed is to adjust one of the matrices so it has the same marginal frequencies

as the other. Such a transformation, if achieved by multiplication of rows and columns by

appropriate constants, does not alter the underlying mobility embodied in the matrix. (Mosteller,

1968; Altham and Ferrie, 2005) If we were to multiply the first row of Q by ½ and then multiply the

second column of the resulting matrix by ½, we would produce a new matrix QN with the same

marginal frequencies as in matrix P, with an associated total mobility measure MQN. We could then

calculate the difference MP - MQN and be confident that the difference in mobility does not result

from differences in the distributions of occupations between the two locations.

        There still may be differences in mobility between P and Q, even after adjusting the marginal

frequencies and finding that MP - MQN = 0, however. The fundamental measure of association

between rows and columns in a mobility table is the cross-product ratio, which for P is p11p22/p12p21

and can be rearranged to give (p11/p12 )/(p21/p22 ), the ratio of (1) the odds that sons of job 1 fathers

get job 1 rather than job 2 to (2) the odds that sons of job 2 fathers get job 1 rather than job 2. If


                                                   11
there is perfect mobility, the cross-product ratio would be one: sons of job 1 fathers would have no

advantage in getting job1 relative to sons of job 2 fathers. The more the cross-product ratio exceeds

one, the greater the relative advantage of having a job 1 father in getting job 1. The cross-product

ratio for both P and Q is 4, so these matrices have the same underlying mobility.

        For a table with more than two rows or columns, there are several cross-products ratios, so a

summary measure of association should take account of the full set of them. One such measure has

been suggested by Altham (1970): the sum of the squares of the differences between the logs of the

cross-product ratios in tables P and Q. For two tables which each have r rows and s columns, it

measures how far the association between rows and columns in table P departs from the association

between rows and columns in table Q:




The metric d(P,Q) tells us the distance between tables P and Q.17 A simple likelihood-ratio P2

statistic G2 (Agresti, 2002, p. 140) with (r-1)(s-1) degrees of freedom can then be used to test

whether the matrix 1 with elements 2ij=log(pij/qij) is independent; if we can reject the null

hypothesis that 1 is independent, we essentially accept the hypothesis that d(P,Q) 0 so the degree

of association between rows and columns differs between table P and table Q. The statistic does not

tell us which table has the stronger association, but that can be determined by calculating d(P,I) and

d(Q,I), which use the same formula as d(P,Q) but replace one table with a matrix of ones. If

d(P,Q)>0 and d(P,I)>d(Q,I), we can safely conclude that mobility is greater in table Q (i.e. mobility



        17
           See Altham and Ferrie (2005) for a discussion of the distance measure and test statistic, and for
algorithms for their computation.

                                                       12
is closer in Q than in P to what we would observe under independence of rows and columns, in

which the occupation of a father provides no information in predicting the occupation of his son).

        Contingency tables are often dominated by elements along the main diagonal (which in the

case of mobility captures immobility or occupational inheritance). It will prove useful to calculate an

additional version of d(P,Q) that examines only the off-diagonal cells to see whether, conditional on

occupational mobility occurring between fathers and sons, the resulting patterns of mobility are

similar in P and Q. This new statistic will then test whether P and Q differ in their proximity to

“quasi-independence.” (Agresti, 2002, p. 426) For square contingency tables with r rows and

columns, this additional statistic d i(P,Q) will have the same properties as d(P,Q), but the likelihood

ratio P2 statistic G2 will have [(r-1)2-r] degrees of freedom.

        Because it is a pure function of the odds ratios in tables P and Q, d(P,Q) is invariant to the

multiplication of rows or columns in either table by arbitrary constants. As a result, d(P,Q) provides

a measure of the difference in row-column association between two tables that abstracts from

differences in marginal frequencies. Because [d(P,Q)]2 is a simple sum of the squares of log odds

ratio contrasts, it can be conveniently decomposed into its constituent elements: for an r × s table,

there will be [r(r-1)/2][s(s-1)/2] odds ratios in d(P,Q) and it will be possible to calculate how much

each contributes to [d(P,Q)]2, in the process identifying the locations in P and Q where the

differences between them are greatest.

        In analyzing how mobility differs between two tables, we will then proceed in three steps:

1. calculate total mobility for each table as the ratio of the sum of the off-diagonal elements to the
total number of observations in the table, and find the difference in total mobility between P and Q;

2. adjust one of the tables to have the same marginal frequencies as the other and re-calculate the
difference in total mobility to eliminate the influence of differences in the distribution of
occupations;



                                                    13
3. calculate d(P,Q), d i(P,Q), d(P,I), and d(Q,I) and the likelihood ratio P2 statistics G 2; if d(P,Q) 0,
calculate the full set of log odds ratio contrasts and identify those making the greatest contribution
to [d(P,Q)]2.

        This differs substantially from common practice in sociology, where the estimation of log-

linear models has dominated the empirical analysis of mobility since the 1960s.18 Log-linear analysis

decomposes the influences on the log of each entry in a contingency table into a sum of effects for

its row and column and an interaction between the row and column. Controlling for row and

column effects eliminates the effect of the distribution of fathers’ and sons’ occupations on mobility.

The remaining interaction between rows and columns captures the strength of the association

between rows and columns which in turn measures mobility, though the coefficient on the

interaction term has no meaning in itself as it is a component of a highly non-linear system. In

comparing mobility in two tables, attention is generally focused on the statistical significance of the

difference in the interaction effect rather than on its magnitude. In addition, a simple comparison of

differences in the interaction term is seldom performed without the imposition of additional

structure. For example, it might be supposed that all of the odds ratios in P differ in exactly the same

degree from all of the odds ratios in Q, or that the odds ratios can be partitioned into sets that differ

uniformly across the tables.

        This results in a bewildering number of specifications, and may account for some of the

conflicting findings even in the use of identical data sets when mobility rates are compared for

modern economies (Britain has been shown to have the same mobility as the U.S., less mobility than

the U.S., and more mobility than the U.S.). The measure of underlying mobility adopted here (1)

relies on fewer assumptions, (2) by construction, abstracts from differences in mobility arising from

differences across the tables in the distributions of occupation, (3) generates a simple, meaningful

measure of the distance between the row and column association in P and the row and column

association in Q, and (4) allows us to isolate the specific odds ratios that account for the largest part

of difference between the association in P and the association in Q.

                       Britain vs. the U.S. in the T wentieth Cen tury

        Before turning to the nineteenth century, we assess the difference in mobility between

Britain and the U.S. using the tools described in the previous section. We have used males age 31-37

in 1972 from the Oxford Mobility Study and white, native-born males age 33-39 in 1973 from the

Occupational Change in a Generation survey. These ages were chosen to avoid the influence of the

Great Depression. All cases in which the respondent reported a non-civilian occupation for himself

or his father were excluded. Table 1 provides a cross-classification of son’s occupation by father’s

occupation, and Table 2 provides summary measures of mobility for each panel in Table 1 and for

differences in mobility between the panels.

        According to the simple measure of total mobility M, young men in their thirties in 1972-73

were less likely in the U.S. than in Britain to find themselves in the occupations their fathers had in

1949-55. But this difference was largely a result of differences in the occupational structures of the

two economies. If total mobility is measured using either the British or U.S. distributions of

occupations, the gap in total mobility falls from 11.4 percentage points to 3 percentage points. If

Britain had the U.S. occupational distribution but the underlying association between rows and

columns actually seen in Britain, and the U.S. had the British occupational distribution but the

underlying association between rows and columns actually seen in the U.S., the British (53.7 percent)

would have actually had more total mobility than the U.S. (48.3 percent).

        In both Britain and the U.S., an underlying association between fathers’ and sons’

occupations apart from that induced by differences in occupational distributions was present (for

both, we can reject the null hypothesis that their association between rows and columns was the

same as we would observe under independence). The difference between them in their degrees of

association is small in magnitude (7.9), and we cannot reject at any conventional significance level

the null hypothesis that their associations are identical. This is not solely the result of strong

similarities in the tendency of sons to inherit their fathers’ occupations, as we cannot reject the null

hypothesis that association is identical even if we focus only on the off-diagonal elements in each

table. These results confirm the findings of Erickson and Goldthorpe (1992) and Kerckhoff et al.

U.S.), but substantial differences in occupational distributions obscure much larger differences. If

the U.S. had Britain’s occupational distribution, the U.S. advantage in total mobility would have been

5.5 percentage points; if Britain had the U.S. distribution, the U.S. advantage would have been 9.9

percentage points. Finally, if Britain and the U.S. had swapped occupational distributions and

retained their underlying association between fathers’ and sons’ occupations, the U.S. advantage

would have been 13 percentage points.

        These simple comparisons suggest that more fundamental measures of association between

fathers’ and sons’ occupations would reveal a weaker association (and greater mobility) in the U.S.

The second set of summary mobility measures in Table 2 shows that this was indeed the case:


                                                  18
though the association between fathers’ and sons’ occupations differed from independence in

Britain and the U.S., the magnitude of the association was twice as great in Britain as in the U.S. We

can safely reject the null hypothesis that the difference between them in their associations was

actually zero. The point estimate for d(P,Q) was 14.4, indicating a difference in mobility after

controlling for occupational distributions that was not only statistically significant but also large in a

substantive sense.

        Table 4 disaggregates [d(P,Q)]2 into its components, and calculates the contribution of each

of the [d i(P,Q)]2 that account for three quarters of [d(P,Q)]2 to the total. G2 is also reported for each

contrast, as well as the underlying odds ratios from P and Q. For example, the first entry is the

relative advantage in entering farming rather than unskilled work from having a farmer father rather

than an unskilled father. In Britain, sons of farmers were 53 times more likely to enter farming rather

than unskilled work than were the sons of unskilled workers. In the U.S., the ratio was only 4.5 to

one, so the advantage of having a farm father rather than an unskilled father in making this move

(into farming rather than unskilled work) was more than 11 times greater in Britain than in the U.S.

This odds ratio contrast alone accounts for nearly 12 percent of the difference between the

association in P and the association in Q. Of the eleven odds ratios that account for 75 percent of

the difference in association between P and Q, six display a smaller disadvantage in the U.S. in

entering farming rather than another occupation for the sons of non-farmers, indicating that an

important source of greater intergenerational mobility in the U.S. than in Britain was an easier path

to farm ownership from outside agriculture, regardless of the distribution of occupations for fathers

and sons. But the importance of farming by no means exhausts the sources of higher mobility in the

U.S. For example, in Britain, white collar sons had a 36 to one advantage in entering white collar

rather than unskilled jobs compared to the sons of unskilled workers; in the U.S., their advantage

was only 4 to one, less than an eighth of the advantage in making this transition conveyed in Britain

by having a white collar father.

Year. Frequencies (Column Percent).


        Not only is overall mobility greater in the U.S., but upward mobility also exceeds that in

Britain. Without a comparable scheme of fully ranked occupational categories for both countries, a

complete analysis of upward and downward mobility is impossible. However, some conclusions

follow from innocuous assumptions. Assuming that unskilled occupations are less desirable than all

others, Table 3 indicates that in the U.S. 81.4 percent of all sons of unskilled laborers moved up into

other occupations, while only 53.3 percent of unskilled British sons experienced upward mobility; if

the British marginal distribution of occupations is imposed on the U.S. mobility table, the U.S.


                                                  21
advantage is narrowed but not eliminated (upward mobility in the U.S. falls to 62.2 percent,

compared to 53.3 percent in Britain), while if the U.S. marginal distribution of occupations is

imposed on the British mobility table, the British disadvantage is narrowed slightly but remains large

(upward mobility in Britain rises to 58.7 percent, compared to 81.4 percent in the U.S.). Downward

mobility in the U.S. was lower than in Britain: 8.7 percent moved into unskilled labor in the U.S.

versus 13.5 percent in Britain, though this difference is reversed if either the British or U.S. marginal

distributions are used for both countries. The U.S. was not only a less static labor market than

Britain, but also a labor market with better prospects for upward movement even after accounting

for differences between its occupational structure and Britain’s. Observed downward mobility was

also less frequent in the U.S. than in Britain, but would have been slightly greater in the U.S. than in

Britain if the two countries had the same marginal distributions of occupation.

           Nineteenth Century vs. Twentieth Century Mobility in the U.S.

        The difference in mobility between Britain and the U.S. in the nineteenth century was

substantial, both before and after taking account of differences in their distributions of occupations.

We have already seen that Britain and the U.S. were indistinguishable in terms of intergenerational

occupational mobility in the third quarter of the twentieth century, after taking account of their

occupational distributions. How was this convergence in underlying mobility achieved? Did U.S.

mobility fall or did British mobility rise to U.S. levels? We cannot directly assess the change over

time in British mobility in the absence of nineteenth century longitudinal data that span twenty years,

unless we were to include the Great Depression. For the U.S. however, we have samples that span

1860-80 and 1880-1900 that are identical in their construction to the 1850-80 sample we used in the

comparison to Britain 1851-81. Males age 33-39 at the end of the 1860-80 and 1880-1900 U.S.

samples can be compared to males age 33-39 in the 1973 cohort of the OCG. These samples then


                                                   22
both span either exactly 20 years between fathers’ and sons occupations (1860 to 1880 and 1880 to

1900) or an average of 20 years between fathers’ and sons’ occupations (1949-55 to 1973). Table 5

presents the cross-classification of fathers’ and sons’ occupations for the 1860-80 data, which are

compared to the OCG data from the lower panel of Table 1. Summaries of the comparison between

them appear in the third set of contrasts in Table 2.

        Total mobility shows a 6.1 percentage point advantage for the modern data, but when it is

calculated for both tables using common marginal frequencies, the nineteenth century table has

higher total mobility, by from one (using the 1860-80 frequencies) to 6.9 percentage points (using

the 1973 frequencies). If the marginal frequencies are swapped but the underlying associations are

left unchanged, the nineteenth century U.S. had a total mobility rate 1.3 times greater than that in the

1949-73 period. The more fundamental measure of mobility, d(P,Q), also shows greater mobility (i.e.

a weaker association between fathers’ and sons’ occupations) in the nineteenth century than in the

twentieth: we can safely reject the null hypothesis that the associations are equal (G2=46.7 on 9

degrees of freedom, probability(H0: same association)< 0.0001), and the difference d(P,Q) is large in

magnitude. We cannot, however, reject the hypothesis that the associations are identical when the

diagonal elements in P and Q are excluded, suggesting that change in the likelihood of direct

inheritance of the father’s occupational status by the son was the greatest difference between these

eras, rather than more subtle change in the structure of association between one generation’s

occupation and that of the next.

        Table 6 decomposes the elements of d(P,Q) into those that account for three quarters of the

difference between mobility in the nineteenth century and mobility in the twentieth. The single

greatest difference – making up nearly 15 percent of the difference between the association in the

nineteenth century and association in the twentieth – is in the upper left four cells of the


                                                   23
contingency table. In the nineteenth century, getting a white collar rather than farm job was 11 times

more likely for the son of a white collar worker than for the son of a farmer; by the twentieth

century, the advantage of white collar sons had grown nearly eight-fold relative to farm sons in

getting white collar jobs rather than farm jobs. The second and third contrasts in Table 6 show

swings in the odds ratios of similar magnitude from the nineteenth to the twentieth centuries (the

advantage of farm sons relative to skilled and semiskilled sons in getting (1) white collar rather than

farm jobs, and (2) farm jobs rather than unskilled jobs). Of the seven substantial differences between

the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, three provide evidence of greater difficulty entering white

collar jobs (for the sons of farmers relative to sons of white collar workers, for the sons of skilled

workers relative to sons of farmers, and for sons of unskilled workers relative to sons of farmers).

        The difference between nineteenth and twentieth century mobility persists into the last two

decades of the nineteenth century. If the 1880-1900 sample is used (P) and compared to the 1973

OCG cohort (Q), substantially more mobility is again observed in the historical data than in the

more recent past. Contrast 4 in Table 2 shows these results: total mobility was greater in the past if

the nineteenth century occupational distributions are used or if the occupational distributions are

swapped and each period retains its actual association between fathers’ and sons’ occupations. The

unadjusted total mobility and total mobility using the twentieth century frequencies, however, favor

substantially greater in the past than more recently. We can safely reject the hypothesis that the

association was identical (G2=36.7 on 9 degrees of freedom, probability(H0: same association)<

0.0001). Even in the last two decades of the nineteenth century, mobility was greater than in the

1949-73 period, a difference that was both large in substance and statistically significant. High

mobility in the nineteenth century U.S. was thus not principally a consequence of the enormous

turnover in the U.S. labor force occasioned by the death of a substantial fraction of the working-age

male population in the Civil War, or of the presence of an expanding agricultural frontier – the

frontier was already “closed” by 1890, according to the U.S. Census Office.19 It is also not the result

of some peculiarity of the OCG data used for the twentieth century, as similar results are obtained

when other modern surveys are employed.20

              Economic Sources of Declining Relative Mobility in the U.S.

         The U.S. was considerably more mobile than Britain in the nineteenth century and roughly

similar in mobility in the twentieth. At least some of this convergence occurred because of declining

mobility in the U.S. (as opposed to improved mobility in Britain). Unfortunately, the foregoing

analysis sheds little light on the sources of either the U.S. advantage in the nineteenth century or its

relative decline in mobility from the nineteenth century to the twentieth. Because the metric for the


         19
           The Sup erintendent o f the Censu s reported in 18 90 that “U p to and inclu ding 188 0 the coun try

1891).

             Ferrie (forthcoming) includes comparisons between the nineteenth century data shown here and
twentieth century data from the NLS and NLSY79. In each case, the nineteenth century displays mobility that

distance in association used here focuses on odds ratios, it is not even possible to say for certain

whether the observed differences result from differences in the numerators, in the denominators, or

in both.21

         Are the differences we have observed (between the mid-nineteenth century U.S. and either

mid-nineteenth century Britain or the mid-twentieth century U.S.) simply a reflection of differences

in the size of the farm sector, i.e. so many more farmers in the mid-nineteenth century U.S. and as a

result much movement out of farming and more “mobility?” The measure of mobility we have used

already adjusts for differences in the size of the occupation groups, however. If the mid-nineteenth

century U.S. farm sector is driving the results, it must be more than the difference in the sector’s

sheer size generating differences with Britain at the same time or the U.S. 100 years later. There

must be a selectivity effect as well.

         Consider nineteenth century Britain versus the nineteenth century U.S.: Britain has already

seen almost all of its flight from agriculture by 1851, so the sons of farmer fathers are already

selected for remaining in farming (all the sons who were more loosely attached to the sector have

already left by 1851). At the same time, the sons of non-farm fathers are already selected for

remaining outside farming (all the sons eager to enter farming have already done so). In the U.S.,

this weeding out process has not taken place in the nineteenth century, so the U.S. has more

mobility both out of and into farming that gets added onto whatever the underlying amount of

             For example, the fourth contrast in Table 4 and the first in Table 6 – [(WW )/(WF)]/[(FW )/(FF)] –
is the ratio of the od ds of white co llar sons entering w hite collar jobs rather tha n farming to th e odds of farm
sons entering white collar jobs rather than farming. It is greater in nineteenth century Britain and the
twentieth century U.S. than in the nineteenth century U.S. But is this because the nineteenth century U.S. has
(1) greater ease for farm sons in attaining white collar jobs in the nineteenth century U.S. (FW 8) , (2) a
weaker attachment to farming among farm sons (FF 9), (3) easier entry by white collar sons into farming (WF
8), or (4) a weaker attachment to w hite collar jobs among sons of white collar workers (W W 9)? Or do es it
result from some com bination of these?

                                                         27
mobility would be otherwise.22 At least some of the high mobility in the nineteenth century U.S. may

then result from it being at an earlier stage of development than nineteenth century Britain or the

twentieth century U.S., so its farm sector

was relatively larger and selective exit from

farming and entry into farming were less

apparent than in Britain at the same time

or in the U.S. a century later. As late as

1850, 45 percent of U.S. workers were still

in farming, compared to 4 percent in

Britain in 1880 and 7 percent in the U.S. in

1950.

        To get at the amount of mobility         Figure 1.

after taking out the effect of selective mobility out of or into farming, we re-ran the analyses after

removing the cell Farm [father]-Farm [son] and the cells White Collar-Farm,

Skilled/Semiskilled-Farm, and Unskilled-Farm. This is preferable to leaving out the farm sector

altogether, as it still allows us to include the mobility of sons of farmers conditional on their

departure from farming. The results are

P=Britain 1851-81, Q=U.S. 1850-80

d(P,I)=15.43 (prob < 0.0001)
d(Q,I)= 9.17 (prob < 0.0001)
d(P,Q)=10.03 (prob < 0.0001)




        22
           Of course, for the story to work for the nineteenth century versus twentieth century U.S. case,
there must be no increase in the selectivity of movement out of or into farming even as late as 1900 when
farmers as a fraction of the labor force had fallen to 20% from 45% in 1850.

                                                      28
Even if we ignore the Farm-Farm immobility difference and ignore differences in entry into

farming, then, the differences in mobility still go in the same direction (the nineteenth century U.S. is

markedly more mobile than nineteenth century Britain). For the U.S. over time, the same is true as

well, though the remaining magnitudes are smaller:

P=U.S. 1860-80, Q=U.S. 1953-73

d(P,I)=8.32 (prob < 0.0001)
d(Q,I)=8.48 (prob < 0.0001)
d(P,Q)=3.48 (prob < 0.05).

         Simple differences in the selectivity of exit from or entry into farming, in any case, cannot

explain the majority of the contrasts in Tables 4 and 6.23 Other features of the nineteenth century

U.S. economy may help explain its uniquely high rates of mobility. A useful starting point for

analyzing the economic causes of differences in mobility across times or places is the formulation of

Becker and Tomes (1986) who model intergenerational mobility as an outcome generated by the

endowments transmitted directly from parents to children, and by investments made by parents

faced with several investment opportunities and possibly constrained by the operation of capital

markets from making the efficient level of investment in their children.

         As Grawe and Mulligan (2002) demonstrate, this simple model provides some testable

implications regarding spatial or temporal differences in earnings mobility.24 Ignoring capital


         23
            For example, the third contrast in Table 4 does not involve farmers. The fifth contrast in Table 4
(which is also the seventh in T able 6) – [(W F)/(W S)]/[(FF)/ (FS)] – can be higher in ninet eenth centu ry
Britain an d the tw entieth c entury U .S. than in the ninet eenth ce ntury U .S. becau se of select ivity only if exit
from farming by farm sons exceeded entry by white collar sons into farming by a greater margin in the
nineteenth century U.S. than in either nineteenth century Britain or the twentieth century U.S. If this was not
the case, differential entry into skilled and semi-skilled jobs by white collar and farm sons must also account
for some of the greater size of this contrast for the nineteenth century U.S. To see this, re-write the contrast
as [(WF)/(FF )]/[(WS)/(FS )].
         24
           Though these imp lications relate to earnings mobility, it is straightforward to map them into
occupational mobility. If there are two possible jobs and investment (by parents or the state) both raises (1)
the odds th at sons of job 1 fath ers will get job 1 rath er than job 2 and (2) the odd s that sons of job 2 fathers

                                                           29
constraints (generated by the inability of parents to borrow against the future labor earnings of

children), intergenerational earnings mobility will be higher when the ease with which ability is

transferred to children is reduced. Han and Mulligan (2001, p. 225) show that earnings mobility is

also greater when ability displays less variance. Finally, if parents are constrained in the credit

market, they will invest less in their children, whose earnings will more closely reflect ability,

reducing mobility. Where credit markets function well, or where wealth is greater so fewer parents

find the capital constraint binding, mobility will be greater than where credit markets do not

function well, or where most parents find themselves constrained by low wealth.

        We have no direct evidence on how easily abilities were transmitted from parents to children

in the nineteenth century in Britain and the U.S. or in the twentieth century U.S. But we can suppose

that the greater heterogeneity in the origins of the U.S. population compared to the British

population in the nineteenth century corresponded to greater variance in abilities in the U.S., a force

working to undermine the U.S. advantage in occupational mobility relative to Britain at this time.

Though we cannot test directly for the role of credit market constraints in generating the advantage

enjoyed by the U.S. relative to Britain in the nineteenth century and the decline in relative mobility

by the twentieth century, it is possible to see how important such impediments to investment may

have been in generating the level of mobility seen within the nineteenth century U.S.

        The 1860-80 sample provides information from the 1860 population census on the total

wealth owned by the household (the sum of real estate and personal estate). This makes is possible

to assess the role of credit constraints by examining whether mobility differs systematically by

household wealth, an indicator of the probability that a household is credit constrained. Following


will get job 1 rather than job 2, but (2) rises by more than (1), the odds ratio will fall, indicating greater
mobility. The only additional assumption necessary for the implications discussed by Grawe and Mulligan
(2002) to apply to occupational mobility as well is that all workers qualified for job 1 can obtain job 1.

                                                        30
Mazumder (2001), the 1860-80 sample was divided in half: high total wealth families (wealth $

median wealth=$1,400) and low total wealth families (wealth < median). Intergenerational

occupational mobility matrices were then constructed (P=high wealth, Q=low wealth), and the

underlying association between fathers’ and sons’ occupations was calculated along with the

difference in association between P and Q. For both types of households, mobility was different

from that expected under independence though slightly greater in high wealth households

(d(P,I)=12.65, d(Q,I)=13.25, while the G2 statistics for both are significant at 0.01. Of greater

interest is the difference in association between P and Q: d(P,Q)=6.14 (G2=21.2, prob=0.01),

confirming that mobility in the 1860s and 1870s was in fact greater among high wealth households

than among low wealth households.

        Grawe and Mulligan (2002, p. 51) suggest that “one way to investigate [the role of credit

market imperfections] is through analysis of cross-country evidence on whether countries with

greater public provision of human capital experience greater intergenerational mobility.” The U.S.

provided considerably more public education than Britain in the middle of the nineteenth century:

the primary school enrollment rate was one and a half times greater in the U.S. than in Britain.

(Easterlin, 1981, p. 7). The U.S. educational system in the second half of the nineteenth century,

though less extensive at the secondary and post-secondary levels than European systems was

considerably more egalitarian (Goldin, 1999, p. 2). To the extent that intergenerational mobility is

greater where fewer parents are constrained, superior mobility in the U.S. may well have been a

consequence of its educational system, which provided a public alternative to a private education

that was outside the reach of many families.

        The importance of free, public education provides a less satisfactory explanation for the

trend in mobility over time within the U.S., though: while enrollment rates, graduation rates, and


                                                   31
spending have increased dramatically since the nineteenth century (Goldin, 1999, pp. 52-68),

intergenerational occupational mobility has nonetheless fallen. Though the educational requirements

to advance in occupational status (or to avoid a decline in occupational status) may have risen more

rapidly than the aggregate statistics on the provision of education, there is no evidence with which to

confront this conjecture.25

         A potentially more promising avenue for explaining both the U.S. advantage in mobility

compared to Britain within the nineteenth century and the decline in relative U.S. mobility since the

nineteenth century is to consider characteristics of the U.S. economy that correspond to both of

these contrasts. The most obvious candidate is residential mobility.26 Both Schultz (1961) and Becker

(1964) suggested viewing migration as an investment. In the Becker and Tomes (1986) framework,

changes in location undertaken by the family can produce occupational mobility just as investment

by the family in the child’s human capital. After childhood, the individual himself may undertake

such investment to compensate for under-investment by a credit-constrained family or to take




         25
             Becker and Tomes (1986, p. S31) suggest with some justification that capital constraints construed
more generally fell from the nineteenth century to the twentieth in the U.S. But this, too, runs counter to the
trend of decreasing mobility from the nineteenth century to the twentieth. The model’s prediction that larger
family siz e will be a ssociated with low er investm ent per ch ild and lo wer m obility (if fert ility is exog enous) is
anothe r force w orking a gainst th e finding of relative ly greater m obility in th e ninetee nth cent ury U.S . than in
the twentieth: the total fertility rate in the U.S. fell from 5.42 in 1850 to 2.98 in 1950.

         26
             The unusually high rates of residential mobility in the nineteenth century U.S. were remarked upon
by de Tocqueville (1835) who observed that in the U.S., “millions of men are marching at once toward the
same horizon; their language, their religion, their manners differ; their object is the same. Fortune has been
promised to them somewhere in the west, and to the west they go to find it.” These patterns were observed
by him as well in places only recently settled: “I have spoken of the emigration from the older states but how
shall I describe that which takes place from the more recent ones? Fifty years have scarcely elapsed since
Ohio was founded; the greater part of its inhabitants were not born within its confines; its capital has been
built only thirty years, and its territory is still covered by an immense extent of uncultivated fields; yet already
the population of Ohio is proceeding westward, and most of the settlers who descend to the fertile prairies of
Illinois are c itizens of O hio. The se men left their first c ountry to improv e their con dition; th ey quit t heir
second to ame liorate it still m ore; fortun e awaits them ev erywh ere, but n ot happ iness.”

advantage of investment opportunities that were unavailable to the family because they did not yet

exist or were overlooked by them.

       In the British 1851-81 sample, 27 percent of sons crossed a county boundary over these

three decades, while in the U.S. 1850-80 sample, 62 percent did so.27 In fact, in the U.S., men

changed states over thirty years as often as men in Britain changed counties. Though we lack

comparable data on mobility over a span of thirty years for the twentieth century U.S., the National

Longitudinal Survey (NLS) cohorts of Older Men and Young Men provide a comparison over ten

years, the shortest span we can observe in the nineteenth century linked files. Between 1870 and

1880, 55 percent of young (20-29 years) white, native-born males changed county and 30 percent

changed state; between 1971 and 1981, only 42 percent of otherwise identical males changed county,

while only 22 percent changed state. Among older men (45-59 years) the declines in both inter-

county mobility (from 35 percent 1870-80 to 16 percent 1966-76) and inter-state mobility (from 22

percent 1870-80 to 8 percent 1966-76) were even more dramatic.

        Though mid-nineteenth century Britain was a considerably more compact economy with an

extensive transportation network, residential mobility was greater in the mid-nineteenth century U.S.

Though the U.S. experienced substantial improvements in transportation and flows of information

from the third quarter of the nineteenth century to the third quarter of the twentieth, residential

mobility rates actually fell. This suggests that the return to mobility in the 1850-80 period must have

been substantial – greater than in late nineteenth century Britain and greater than in the modern U.S.

It would be a mistake to attribute this high return directly to the presence of an open frontier in the

nineteenth century U.S., however, for two reasons: (1) both residential and occupational mobility




       27
            British counties were roughly the sam e size on average as U.S. counties.

                                                        33
remained high through 1910, fully two decades after the closing of the frontier; and (2) the frontier

was never the destination for more than a small fraction of U.S. internal migrants after 1850.

       Residential mobility may nonetheless have provided an alternative to direct investment in

human capital. Kim (1998) has shown that regional specialization in the U.S. increased through

1880, fell slightly through 1910, and then fell dramatically throughout the rest of the twentieth

century. This raises the possibility that throughout the second half of the nineteenth century,

differences in the economic activities undertaken in different places left open another route to

advancement: migration to places that were growing more rapidly than others. Some of these places

of unusual opportunity were cities that sprang up initially to provide services demanded as the

frontier expanded. For example, Chicago’s population grew ten-fold in just the twenty years after

1850, then nearly tripled over the next two decades, providing a site of substantial opportunity.

(Galenson, 1991) Though U.S. labor markets were well-integrated at the regional level by the middle

of the nineteenth century, at least within the North (Margo, 2000; Rosenbloom, 1996), differences

across smaller units of geography may have continued to present opportunities for “locational

arbitrage” that provided a route to occupational change through the start of the twentieth century.

                                            Conclusion

        Though the U.S. exhibited no more intergenerational occupational mobility in the late

twentieth century than similarly developed countries, a widely-shared belief that the U.S. is a place of

unusually easy mobility has consistently guided public policy and shaped debate regarding the

appropriate functions of the government in promoting social welfare from the 1930s to the present.

Using new longitudinal data for the nineteenth century, we have identified an era when the U.S.

mobility experience was indeed exceptional: even after controlling for differences in their

occupational structures, the U.S. had substantially more occupational mobility across generations


                                                  34
than either Britain in the three decades after 1850 or the modern U.S. Though it remains to be seen

exactly why nineteenth century U.S. mobility exceeded that in both nineteenth century Britain and

the twentieth century U.S., and when the transition to a lower mobility regime in the U.S. took place,

high U.S. intergenerational occupational mobility corresponded to high rates of residential mobility.

A fall in U.S. residential mobility after 1910 as economic activity across locations became more

homogenous may have reduced the ability of families and individuals to “invest through migration”

and foster occupational mobility across generations.

                                               Appendix

        The population censuses of Britain and the U.S. are generally regarded to be the best sources

of individual-level, nationally representative data from the nineteenth century for those countries.

However, the cross-sectional censuses do not provide the continuity over time needed to study

issues of mobility at the level of the individual. Two new sources have made it possible to create the

necessary continuity from the British and U.S. historical census records. The Genealogical Society of

Utah in conjunction with the Federation of Family History Societies has computerized the

individual-level records from the enumerators’ books of the 1881 Census of the Population of

England, Wales, and Scotland and from the 1880 U.S. Federal Population Census. These data make

it possible to search for specific individuals in the 1881 British or 1880 U.S. census. To construct the

data for this study, we searched for individuals from two other censuses: the 1851 British and the

1850 U.S. census.

        For Britain, we attempted to match all the English and Welsh born males age 25 and below

from the computerized two percent sample of the 1851 census compiled principally by Anderson,

Collins, and Stott. For the U.S. we attempted to match white males age 25 and below from the 1850

Federal Census one percent public use sample.28 We employed a common matching technique for

the British and U.S. data. Both countries’ censuses provide information that either remains

consistent between enumerations (name and birthplace) or changes predictably (age) that can be

used to identify a given individual in more than one census. The British census has more specific


        28
            The 1851 data for Britain are from a 2% Public Use Sample available as Study No. 1316 from the
U.K. Data Archive at the University of Essex (http://www.dataarchive.ac.uk). It is a stratified two percent
systematic cluster sample from the enumerators’ books. For a full description see Anderson (1987). The
complete 1881 census for Britain was obtained as Study No. 3643 from the U.K. Data Archive. The 1880
U.S. file was obtained from the North American Population Project (http://www.nappdata.org) and the 1850
U.S. 1% Public Use Sample was obtained from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series available from the
Minnesota Popu lation Center (http://ww w.ipums.org).

                                                    36
information than the U.S. census on each individual’s birthplace (parish in Britain, state in the U.S.).

In the 1880 U.S. census, respondents were asked to give the place of birth of their parents as well

(state for those whose parents were born in the U.S. and country for those whose parents were born

abroad). This question was missing entirely from the nineteenth century British census.

        For Britain, in order to be considered a true match for an individual from 1851, an individual

from 1881 had to have either the same name or a close phonetic variation thereof (for example,

Aitken and Aitkin were considered to be equivalent), a year of birth different by no more than five

years, and the same county and parish of birth. For the U.S., the individual must provide the same

state of birth for himself (and his parents if they were present in 1850) in 1850 and 1880, and the

year of birth could differ by no more than three years. The variation in birth year was allowed in

order to account for age misreporting, a fairly common phenomenon in nineteenth century societies

which lacked the systematic record keeping and where individuals often had only an approximate

idea of their age.29 None of the matching information could be missing from an individual’s record.

Also, only unique matches were considered: if an individual from the 1850/51 sample had more

than one match in the 1880/81 census, then that individual was dropped.30

        Applying this matching process to 69,785 English and Welsh males age 25 and under from

the 1851 two percent sample yielded 14,191 men observed in Britain both in 1851 and 1881, a

success rate of 20%. From a pool of 43,438 U.S. white males age 25 and under in 1850, 9,497 were

found in the 1880 U.S. census, a 22 percent success rate. For each country, the data come from two

nationally representative sources, so as long as the matching process does not skew the sample, the



        29
            The smaller margin of age reporting error for the U.S. m atching process is in response to the less
specific birthplace information. For a discussion of age enumeration in the V ictorian census, see Higgs (1986).
        30
             The same proced ure created the 1860-80 , 1880-1900, and 18 70-80 linked U.S. samp les.

                                                        37
set of matched individuals should also be representative of the two national populations that

survived 1850-80 and 1851-81. In order to assess the representativeness of the linked samples, we

compared their characteristics to those in the public use samples for the initial year (1850 or 1851)

and terminal year (1880 or 1881). Tables A-1 and A-2 present marginal effects from probit

regressions in which the dependent variable is 1 for observations from the linked sample and 0 for

observations from the public use sample.31

        In general, the matched samples represent the overall population quite well. Though several

of characteristics exert a statistically significant influence on the probability of linkage, compared to

the predicted probability the magnitude is small in each case.32 In order to reduce the impact of

these already small differences between the linked samples and the general population, we

constructed weights to produce linked samples that would duplicate the marginal frequencies of the

characteristics in the general population. (Deming and Stephan, 1940) Two sets of weights were

generated, one for the initial year and one for the terminal year. In Columns (2) and (4) of Tables A-

1 and A-2, the weights are imposed on the linked individuals, leaving them statistically

indistinguishable from the general population. Though we have used the unweighted data

throughout this paper, the results are insensitive to the imposition of these weights.




        31
           Each linked individual thus enters the regression twice: once in the linked sample and once in the
public use sample. This is done to facilitate comparison with the regressions in Columns (2) and (4) of each
table in which weights are imposed to make the linked individuals nationally-representative (rather than
merely indistinguishable from the unlinked). For the British, 8,655 individuals in the public use sample for
1851 were missing one or more of the characteristics used in the probit analysis and were dropped from the
regressions in Columns (1) and (2) of Table A-2. For the comparisons with 1880 and 1881, 25 percent
random samp les of the complete files for those years were used rather than the com plete files.
        32
            The large coefficients on the migration history variables in Column (3) of Table A-2 result from
the inability to identify the year of arrival in the U.S. for immigrants present in the U.S. in 1880 (the excluded
category in the regression).

         A final concern is whether the linkage process has resulted in too many “false positives”

(individuals who are not in fact the same person in both the initial and terminal years). For the

comparison between the U.S. and Britain in the nineteenth century, this is a difficulty if the sample

for one country has more false positives than the sample for the other. For example, more false

positives in the U.S. than in Britain will generate more “noise” in comparing the occupations of

                                                               40
fathers and sons, and lead to a spurious finding of greater occupational mobility in the U.S. than in

Britain. For the comparison over time within the U.S., it is also a problem, because the data for the

twentieth century were constructed in a way that prevented such incorrect matches (the respondent

in the OCG was asked himself to state the occupation of his father when the respondent was 16

years of age). Greater “noise” in the nineteenth century U.S. data would also produce a spurious

finding of greater mobility in the nineteenth century U.S. than in the twentieth.

        The comparison between mobility in Britain 1851-81 and in the U.S. 1850-80 was performed

again, but this time with the samples restricted to those whose surnames matched exactly and whose

age was off by no more than one year. The results were quite similar to those shown in the second

panel of Table 2:

P=Britain 1851-81, Q=U.S. 1850-80

d(P,I)=24.50 (prob < 0.0001)
d(Q,I)= 14.22 (prob < 0.0001)
d(P,Q)=15.22 (prob < 0.0001)

Though mobility in the U.S. with the more restricted sample is slightly farther from what we would

observe if the occupations of fathers and sons were independent, the difference between mobility in

the U.S. and in Britain is actually slightly greater. When the 1880-1900 U.S. sample is restricted to

those whose surname matched exactly and whose age was off by no more than a year, the nineteenth

century U.S. remained substantially more mobile than the twentieth century though the magnitude

of the difference is reduced. We again can reject the null hypothesis that the association between the

occupations of fathers and sons was identical in these two eras:

P=U.S. 1880-1900, Q=U.S. 1953-73

d(P,I)=15.90 (prob < 0.0001)
d(Q,I)=20.76 (prob < 0.0001)
d(P,Q)=6.94 (prob < 0.005).
