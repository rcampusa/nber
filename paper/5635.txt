        Studies of animal and human behavior suggest that discount functions are approximately

hyperbolic (Ainslie, 1992). I analyze an economy with complete markets which is populated by

hyperbolic consumers.     I identify two ways in which this economy can be distinguished             from an

exponential    economy.    First, hyperbolic       discounting   predicts the empirical regularity   that the

elasticity of intertemporal     substitution   is less than the inverse of the coefficient of relative risk

aversion.     Second, hyperbolic     discounting     explains many features of the policy debate about

undersaving.    The calibrated hyperbolic economy matches Bemheim’s (1994) survey data on self-

reported undersaving,     and predicts pro-savings         government    interventions   like capital-income

subsidies and penalties for early withdrawal from retirement accounts.               Hyperbolic   consumers

are willing to sacrifice 9/10 of a year’s worth of income to induce the government to implement

optimal revenue-neutral       saving incentives.

1     Introduction

Many governments          are currently    engaged in a policy debate about, savings.

This paper      contributes      to this discussion    by developing     and calibrating           a
model which explores          the role that    self-control   problems     play in eli(:it,ing

suboptimal     savings levels.

    Self-control    is an important       source of undersaving.         Individuals      report

overwhelmingly        that they save much less than they feel they should given th~’

private incentives they face (Bernheim,             1994). This kind of undersaving          can
not be explained by capital taxation          models (Charnley, 1986) or moral hazard

models     (Hubbard      et al, 1995) since these models assume            that   individuals

save optimally     conditional     on the private intent ives they face, For example, a

classical economic actor in an economy with inefficiently high capital taxation

rates might reason, “If the government          lowered the tax rate on capital I would

accumulate     more capital and I would be better off. But,, given th(’ inefi(:i[~nt,

tax environment       that, I face, my capital accumulation       plans are optimal.”         By
contrast   the sophisticated       saver in my model would report,           “R,f’gardlcss of

which tax regime the goverment            adopts,     I expect to experience      a large gap

between      my actual    saving level and my normative          saving level.” .Analysis

of this self-control     problem     provides a (luantitativ(:   framework        in whi(:h to

discuss both the normative          and positive aspects of savings policy.

    The centerpiece       of my analysis is the hyperbolic        discount    function.      R,e-

search on animal and human behavior has led psychologists                  to conclude       (see

Ainslie (1992) and Loewenstein            and Prelec (1992)) that discount          functions

are generalized hyperbolas:         events r periods away are discounted          with factor



                                               2
(1 + ar)-ylm,       with a, ~ > 0. Such discount, functions                    imply a rnonotorli-
cally falling discount rate. This discount structure                  sets up a conflict between

t oday’s preferences      and the preferences             which will be held in the future,
implying     that, preferences     are dynamically          inconsistent,.       For cxarnplc,           from

today’s perspective,     the discount rate between two far off periods, t and t+ 1,

is a long-term      low discount     rate. However, from the time t perspective,                           the
discount    rate between t and t + 1 is a short-term                   high discount           rate.     This

type of preference      “change” is reflected in many common                       experiences.            For

example,     today I may desire to quit smoking next year, but when next year

actually roles around my taste at that time will be to postpone                             any sacrifices

another    year.
    Hyperbolic      discount    functions generate          a preference structure             which is a

special case of the general class of dynamically                  inconsistent      preferences:          i. {~.,

preferences which imply a conflict between the optimal contingent                               plan from
today’s perspective      and the optimal          decision from tomorrow’s                   perspective.

Robert     Strotz   (1956) was the first economist            to study dynamically               in(’orlsis-
tent preferences.      Pollak     (1968), Peleg and Yaari (1973), Goldman                              (1980),

and Schelling       (1988) have extended         Strotz’s work, arguing that when pref-
erences are dynamically          inconsistent,    dynamic decisions should be mo(lelled

as an intra-personal      game among different temporal                  selves (i. e., today’s self

is rnodelled as a different player from tomorrow’s                   self).
    Despite the availability         of this analytic        framework,        and the substantial

body of evidence        supporting      hyperbolic        discounting,        few economists             have

studied    the implications      of hyperbolic         discount     functions. 2 Phelps ~Ild Pol-

lak (1968) analyze an inter-generational               game in which each generation                has

a discount      function    which I will argue below proves to be approxil~lat,[?ly

hyperbolic.       Zeckhauser      and Fels (1968) provide            an alt,rusim-ba.scd         micro-

foundation      for the Phelps and Pollak preferences.                 Akerlof (1991) analyzt’s
the behavior of decision-makers             who place a special premium              on effort, made

in the current, period.          Such a premium          can be interpreted          as a reflection

of hyperbolic      discounting      although     Alkerlof interprets        these preferences        as

a salience effect,. Akerlof’s analysis            is inconsistent      with the intra-personal

game approach         as his decision-makers          act myopically;           they fail to foresee
the preference       “changes”     described     above.      Loewenstein         and Prelec (1992)

also analyze the choices of myopic decision-makers                    with hyperbolic        discount

functions.      Finally, George Ainslie, a psychiatrist,            has studied the behavior of

sophisticated      hyperbolic    decision-makers        (Ainslie (1992)), although           his work

is primarily     qualitative.    My past work (Laibson              1995) and the analysis          bc-
low formalizes, quantifies,        and extends Ainslie’s analysis.              This paper focusses

on the relationship        between hyperbolic         discount functions,         undersaving,     and

savings policy.
    The paper is divided into six sections,               including     this introduction.         Sec-

tion two lays out the formal model, describing                      the specific intra-persona,l

game of interest.      Section two presents an approximately                    hyperbolic   discount

function      which includes      the standard        exponential      discount      structure     as a

special case. Sect ion three characterizes             the equilibrium          path, discusses ob-

servational     equivalence     with an exponential         economy, analyzes the relat,ion-

are not based on hyperbolic      discollnting   -- e.g., Thaler   and Shefrin    (1981), and Sch(:lling

2      An individual’s                    consumption                      problem.

I model an individual         as a composite        of autonomous        temporal    selves, follow-

ing Strotz    (1956), Pollak (1968), Peleg and Yaari (1972), Goldman                             (1980),

and Schelling (1984). These selves are indexed by their respective                            periods of

control,   (t = O, 1, 2, . . . , T), over a consumption             decision.   During its period

of control, self t observes all past consumption                 levels (CO,(:1,Cz, . . . . {:t_I), and
the current    level of human        and financial wealth W7~.(The wealth measure,

Wt, represents     the sum of current         financial wealth and the present                  value of

the stream of labor income.)          Self t chooses a consumption               level for period t,

which satisfies the restriction,

                                          o<c~<w~.                                                   (1)

Self t+ 1 then “inherits”        wealth equal to,

                                    w~+~ = R “ (w~ – c~)                                             (2)

where R is the gross real return on wealth, which is assumed                           to be fixed. q

The game continues,          with self t+l in control.          Finally, not{’ that in this game
    3An ~ar]ier “er~ion of this paper     allowed       R to be chos~n endogenously.      The r[?sults

the commitment        solution discussed    by Strotz (1956) is implicitly          ruled out;

i.e., the current     self can not commit future selves to a particular             consump-

tion path.     From the perspective        of the time zero self, commitment,            would
be optimal.      However, commitment         may not, be possible.        The capacity        to

commit depends on the contracting           environment.       If contracts    are written    at

period zero and there exist no opportunities            to write new contracts        (or spot,

markets on which to trade contractual          obligations),     then commitment,       is pos-
sible. By contrast,     if contracts   can be renegotiated      or traded in spot, markets

commitment       will not be possible.     Commitments         I make today will be r(’nr-

gotiated     by future selves who wish to undo those commitments.                   Moreover.

commitments       can be unwound using third parties.            For example,      if I give all
my assets to bank A and instruct, it, to make payments                 to me on an annu-

ity basis, my future selves can use that stream of payments                   as collateral   to

borrow from bank B, thereby undoing my initial commitment.                      With consid-
erations   like this in mind, commitment           is effectively impossible,      motivating

the absence of commitment          in the model.
    Now it only remains to specify the payoffs of the “players)’ of this game.

Player t receives payoff

                                                                                              (3)

where d and ~ are discount parameters,             and u(c) is a member of the class of

CRRA utility functions        (with relative risk aversion coefficient p E (0, m)):
                                            cl–p _ 1
                                    u(c) = ‘
                                                  l–p    “
    There are two reasons to focus on the preferences in e(luation 3. The first

motivation     is that if u is in the CRRA class and @ = 1, the model reduces to

                                              6
the familiar case of exponential            discounting           with time-additive       hornothetic

preferences.     Hence the @ # 1 case may be thought                      of as a perturbation       to

the “standard”      preferences used in macroeconomic                   models.      If we care about

robustness      we probably     want to know what, happens                    when such perturbed
preferences     are considered.

    The second motivation          is more important.               There is a large body of evi-

dence that discount, functions are closely approximated                       by generalized    hyper-

bolas: events ~ periods away are discounted                       with factor (1 + a~) ‘~/m, with
a, ~ >0.4      This observation     was first made by Chung and Herrnstein                       (1961)

in relation     to animal     behavior     experiments. s Their conclusions                 were later

shown to apply to human subjects               as well (see Ainslie (1992) for a survey).

    Hyperbolic      discount    ~unctions     imply discount, rates that               decline as the

discounted      event is moved further           away in time (Loewenstcin                 and Prelec,

1992). Events in the near future are discounted                      at a higher implicit discount,
rate then events in the distant           future.

    Given a discount        function,     ~(~), the instantaneous             discount    rate at time
~ is defined as,
                                              -f’(T)

                                                f(r)       “


Hence, an exponential          discount     function,          J’ is characterized       by a constant

discount      rate, log(~), while the generalized                hyperbolic    dis(’ount function        is

limiting case a = ~ + m.

Psychologists      and economists         ----notably         Ainslie (1975, 1986, 1992), Prelcc

(1989), and Loewenstein           and Prelec (1992)               believe that such declining dis-

count rates play an important             role in generating           problems of s{:lf-rf:glllatiilrl.
    When      O < @ < 1 the discount, structure                        in Equation          3 mimics       th[’

qualitative     property   of the hyperbolic               discount    function,    while maintaining

most, of the analytical        tractability     of the exponential               discount      function.        I

call the discount     structure     in Equation             3 “quasi-hyperbolic.”           Note that the

quasi-hyperbolic      discount      function     is a discrete          tinlt~ function       with values

{1, [Jd, @d’, @d’,...}.     Figure 1 graphs the exponential                    discount      function      (as-

suming    J = .97, ), the generalized            hyperbolic           discount     function      (assuming

a = 105, and ~ = 5 “ 103), and the quasi-hyperbolic                         discount      function      (with

P = .6 and 6 = .99). The points of the discrete-time                         quasi-hyperbolic           fllnc-
tion have been connected           to generate the smooth curve in Figure 1.
    The preferences        in Equation        3 were first analyzed by Phelps and Pollak

(1968).   However, their choice of this structure                     was motivated         in a differcut

way. Their game is one of imperfect intergenerational                        altruism,      so the player-s

are non-overlapping         generations       of a dynasty.            I assume that          t,h[>diffcr(’nt

players are temporally         distinct       selves of a single per-son.                My set-up         also

differs because I assume the horizon is finite. Phelps and Pollak assuru(: an

infinite horizon which admits a continuum                      of equilibria       (Laibson     (1994)).

3.1        Equilibrium

In this subsection,          I show that there is a unique subgame perfect equilibrium

in the finite-horizon           game.      I characterize        that equilibrium         and consider its

limiting properties          as the horizon goes to infinity.


         Proposition 1: FOR ANY FINITE-HORIZON GAME, THERE EX-
         ISTS A UNIQUE SUBGAME-PERFECT EQUILIBRIUM, THIS EQUI-
         LIBRIUM IS MARKOV PERFECT AND IS CHARACTERIZED BY
         TIME-DEPENDENT CONSUMPTION RULES WHICH ARE LINEAR
         IN WEALTH.G



       Proposition       1 is proven by applying                a backwards        indll(’tion    argument.

(All proofs are consigned to the appendix.)                       Since the unique subgame perfect

equilibrium       is a sequence of Markov strategies,                  we can write the equilibrium
strategy     of self t in a T-horizon          game as, ct (Wt, T). Proposition                1 also impli~~s

that     Ct(Wt, T) is differentiable.             Using these basic results,              it is possible     t,o

derive a generalized           Euler equation which applies in the hyperbolic                        economy.

The following development                  is heuristic.      Formal propositions          follow.

3.2       An Observational               Equivalence          Result

Equation      11 is closely related to the standard        Euler equation   in exponential

discounting       models.    Consider an economy populated by consumers                  with
                                   —
exponential      discount   factor 6. The Euler equation in this economy is:


                                    u’(c~) = RFu’(ct+l).


      Consider      the inference problem       of a misinformed    econornetrician.     ThcI

metrician     believes that she is living in the exponential          world introduced       in

this subsection.       The econometrician       uses the data available to hcr to infer ~.

econometrician      independently           observes the true p and R values),             then our

econometrician     will estimate

The second equality in the previous equation                 follows from Equation           11. The

estimated     discount     factor, ~ = .977, sharply         contrasts    with the actual onc-

period discount      factor of P6 = (.6) . (.99) = .59. The economctrician                        will

radically    misconstrue        the preferences of the actors that, she is observing

    With the exception           of my choice of@ -- which is explained             in subsection

3.3 -– I chose the parameter                values listed above on a priori grounds.             Th~:

coefficient of relative         risk aversion, p is usually estimated          to lie between           1
and 5, so I fixed p = 3. Survey respondents                   are approximately           indifferent

between reward dates in the distant future, so I fixed 6 = .99 (see Barskey et
al 1995). In a Cobb-Douglas             economy with capital share .36, capital-incornc

ratio 3, and depreciation           rate .08, the competitive       equilibrium      int crest rate

is log R. = .04. These parameter                values will be used to generate            examples

throughout     the paper.        I refer to this as the benchmark          calibration.

      For readers interested      in exploring the implications     of choosing other cali-
bration combinations,          I have included a series of tables in an appendix.          TalJlcI

1 presents values of ~ associated        with a range of calibration        choices. For all of

these calculations,         I assume that, the econometrician      can independently         con-

firm the true value of R and p. The technology              variable R is set to exp{ .04}.

Calibration         values for the preference     parameters     ~ and J are listed in the
margins of the table.          The table has three panels, corresponding              to p valu~’s

one, three, and five.

      The results of this subsection          imply that the hyperbolic       world with dis-

count parameters            @ = .6 and J = .99 is “observationally             equivalent”       to

the exponential         world with discount, factor ~ = .977. In this context              obser-
vational      equivalence     means that an econometrician         with consumption          path

data could not determine            whether     the hyperbolic    or exponential        economy
generated      that data.     The rest of the paper explores some special propcrt,ics

of the two economies that would enable an economist                 to tell them apart.


3.3        Risk aversion and intertemporal                         substitution.

So far I have assumed that the economy under study exhibits                     no variability

in interest     rates, either across time or across agents.        Let’s jettison      the latter

half of this assumption.         We can then estimate      the elasticity    of interternporal


                                                 14
substitution      (EIS) by measuring how the slope of the consumption                   path varies
as the interest      rate r varies. Note that all of this variation            is across agents.

Assume, for example, that we have a cross-section                   of countries    with differ~?ut

capital taxation        policies and hence different after-t ax ratf?s of return. 7

    In the standard            exponential    economy described       above, the elasticity        of

intertemporal        substitution      is the inverse of the coefficient           of relative   risk
aversion.      Specifically,
                                     E1~ ~ dlog (~)             1
                                                                                                 (13)
                                                   ar        = ;“
This well-known theoretical             relationship    is contradicted   weakly by the avail-

able empirical       evidence (see Hall (1988) and Carroll and Summers                     (1991) ).

Most empirical        analysis suggests that the EIS is smaller than the inverse of

the coefficient of relative risk aversion.8             The hyperbolic      economy is consis-

tent with this empirical            regularity.   Using Equation      11 to derive the EIS in

the hyperbolic       model yields:


                                                                                                 (14)


Note that       when [j = 1 the EIS is equal to ~ which is the standard                          case
described      above.     However, when ~ < 1 the one-to-one                  link bc?twc[?n the

elasticity     of substitution      and p is broken.

    7The results of this subsection would need to he modified if we identified the EIS off of
intertemporal   variation in the interest rate, particularly if that variation were characterized
by high frequency transitory shifts in the level of the interest, rate. By contrast, the results
of this subsection     would continue to hold if we identified the EIS off of intertempor-al
variation characterized     by relatively persistent changes in the level of the interest rate.
    ~This claim is somewhat controversial,          If the coefficient of relative risk aV~rS~OII is
greater than 10, then the data is consistent with the relationship  EIS = ~. However,
simple thought experiments suggest that risk aversion of that magnitude  is problematic
(Mankiw and Zeldes, 1991).


                                                  15
    The first step in evaluating              the EIS is to calculate    ~   by totally    differ-

entiating     Equation      9. Substituting       this into Equation    14 yields,

3.4       Target       Savings Rate

Phelps and Pollak (1968) analyze an economy with identical preferences                      (al-

though the actors in their economy are generations               of a dynasty     rather than
intra-personal      selves). They find that the equilibrium           savings rate is Par[’to-

dominated        by savings rates that are marginally         higher.    Specifically,   all dy-

nastic generations         would be made better        off if they would all perturb       their

savings rates up. Equivalently,         a multi-self interpretation      of these preferences

would imply that all selves would be made better off if they would all perturb

their savings rates up.
      I extend    Phelps    and Pollak’s analysis       by asking how big these upward

perturbations      should be. To do this I consider two normative            savings rates for

the hyperbolic      economy and contrast        these savings rates with th~~equilibrium

savings rate,

      For large T, the equilibrium         savings rate in the hyperbolic       economy is

                                     s*=(~–l)–A*~                                           (16)
                                               R–1

Note that income in period t is (R – 1) . ~t_ ~, and consumption                   in period t

is A*. R. ~t_l.      In this subsection,     I compare the savings rate in Equation           16

to two normative       definitions    of target savings.


        Definition I: NORMATIVE SAVINGS RATE I IS THE LIFETIME
        SAVINGS RATE TO WHICH SELF O WOULD COMMIT ITSELF AND
        ALL FUTURE         SELVES.




      Note that     choosing a lifetime savings rate is isomorphic             to choosing      a

lifetime consumption          rate A. Equation       16 implies a one-t, o-one relationship

                                                17
between savings rates and consumption           rates. Let

                                                                                      (17)


This implies that ~{ solves the following first order condition:




By definition,     normative   savings rate I is given by:

                                 S~=(R–l)–~~R                                          (19)
                                           R–1            “



      Proposition 7: NORMATIVE SAVINGSRATE I (S]) IS GREATER
      THAN THE EQUILIBRIUM SAVINGS RATE (S*). THE CONSUMP-
      TION PATH IMPLIED BY NORMATIVE SAVINGS RATE I PARETO-
      DOMINATES THE EQUILIBRIUM CONSUMPTION PATH.



Proposition      7 is formally proved in the Appendix.         However, Proposition    7 is
easy to understand      at an intuitive level. The claim, S1 > S*, follows from the
fact that hyperbolic     discount functions imply that self t is more patient about

tradeoffs between any two future periods t + ~ and t + ~ + 1 then is self t + ~.
Hence, self t wants to increase self t+~’s savings rate relative to what self t+r

would have saved in the no-commitment           equilibrium.      The Pareto-dominance

result follows from three observations.      First, if self t gets to pick a stationary

consumption       rate for itself and all future selves, than that consumption         rate

must make it at least, as well off as the constant        consumption      rate, A*, which

arises in the unique subgarne-perfect      equilibrium,       Second, future selves pr-ef(’r

the stationary     consumption    rate AI chosen by self t for the same rc?ason that,

                                           18
self t preferred it. The future selves benefit additionally      because they inherit
more wealth on the path associated           with A’ since ~~ < A“.

      Below, I consider a second normative        savings rate, which turns out to be

close in value to normative        savings rate I. Normative   savings rate II is mor(’

analytically   tractable    than normative    savings rate I and will be used in the

policy analysis contained       in section 4 of the papc?r.


        Definition II: NORMATIVE SAVINGS RATE II IS THE SAVINGS
        RATE TO WHICH SELF O WOULD COMMIT ALL FUTURE SELVES.



      Let
                    A1l = argmax~        $5 biu(~(l   – J)i-l RiU”).               (20)
                                           ‘2=1
It is straightforward      to show that Ail = 1 – (JR~-o) ~. By definition,     norma-

tive savings rate II is given by:

                                  ~11 =
                                      — (~ – 1) – ~llR                             (21)
                                            R–1



        Proposition  8: NORMATIVE SAVINGSRATE II (S1~) IS GREATER.
        THAN NORMATIVE SAVINGSRATE I (S~). IF ~~IS SUFFICIENTLY
        CLOSE TO ONE, THE CONSUMPTION PATH IMPLIED BY NOR-
        MATIVE SAVINGS RATE 11 PARETO-DOMINATES THE EQUILIB-
        RIUM CONSUMPTION PATH. IF ~ IS SUFFICIENTLY CLOSE TO
        ZERO, THE CONSUMPTION PATH lMPLIED BY NORMATIVE SAV-
        INGS RATE II DOES NOT PARETO-DOMINATE THE EQUILIBRIUM
        CONSUMPTION PATH.



      The benchmark        calibration   values imply S* = .133, S[ =         .241, and
sir    = .246. Hence, the gaps between the normative           savings rates and tht’

                                             19
actual     savings     rate are S1 – S* = .108 and SIJ – S* = .113. Proposi-
tion 7 implies that the consumption                  path associated           with normative          savings

rate I Pareto-dominates           the equilibrium             consumption            path.      Moreover,         it,

is   easy to quantitatively       confirm that for the benchmark                       calibration       values

the consumption          path associated      with normative              savings rate II also Parcto-

dominates       the equilibrium         consumption          path.      This is not surprising            given
the similar values that S~ and Srr take for the benchmark                               calibration.

      Bernheim       (1994) finds that, the median gap between U.S. baby boomf>rs’

self-reported        “target” savings rate and their “actual” savings rate is ten p[:r-

centage points. 9 This reported             savings gap matches                approximately          the sav-

ings gap predicted        to arise in the calibrated             hyperbolic          economy. The match
resulted    from the following procedure.                   First, I used a priori arguments                  to

fix 6 = .99, p = 3, and R = exp{.04}.                      Then I chose $ = .6 to generat[~ the

desired ten percentage         point (.10) difference between SE and the two norma-
tive savings rates.        Finally, note that ~ = .6 is consistent                     with experimental
evidence on one-year discount rates (see Ainslie (1992)). Table 3 num(?rically

evaluates     the three savings rates -– S*, S1, and Sir -- for a range of other
calibration     values.
     gThe actual questions that Bernheim        analyzes       are:

What percentage    of your annual         household        income     do you think      you should      save for
retirement? (“Target saving” )

What percentage        of your annual    household     income         are you now saving        for retirement?
(“Actual saving”)

These questions      were posed to 1209 randomly           selected    individuals    between    the ages of 29
and 47.

4       Public policy

In this section I propose revenue neutral policy measures that implement, the

consumption     path implied by savings rate S1l. I focus on implementation                     of

Sri because of analytical         tractability.     Little generality    is lost as a result, of

this focus, given that S~ and S’rl are almost idt?nt,ical in value over the range
of reasonable    calibration     values,

      The consumption      path associated        with S1l is expressed most naturally          in

terms of the associated        consumption        rate J‘1. This consumption      rate impli~’s,

Ct = A1lW’ and Ct+l = A~~R(l – ~~[)~.                  Hence, the slope of the consumption

path is given by,
                                      Ct+1
                                      — = R(I – A~~)                                        (22)
                                       Ct
I seek to implement        the consumption         path which 1) has slope R         (1 – A’r),

and 2) is binding with respect to the economy’s budget constraint.                     I’ll refer

to this as the normative        consumption        path.


4.1        Delays

The normative       consumption      path can be implemented            by requiring that con-

sumers     choose their consumption           level one-period     before the consumption

actually    takes place.    Under this scheme, self t would be bound                 to a con-

sumption     level Ct chosen at period t — 1. However, self t would be free to

choose any feasible consumption              level for period t + 1. This scheme would

work like a bank account that requires advance notification                  for withdrawals.

      Formally, this set-up is another intra-personal            game. The only diffcrf’ncf’

between this game and our original game is that self t chooses consumption


                                                  21
for period t + 1 instead of choosing consumption              for period t. I will refer to

this as the Advance Notification           Game.

       (UNIQUE) Asymptotic   EQUILIBRIUM CONsuMPT1ON RATE 1s




4.2        Interest    Subsidies           and Penalties

The normative       consumption       path can also be implemented        by a combinf’d

policy that     penalizes     over-consumption     and subsidizes    the rate of interest.

Any net, costs of this policy are assumed to be financed by a norl-clist(Jrti{~llary

tax. Consider the following specific scheme. The government              penalizes agents

who dissave more than Awt, where A is set by the government.                 Assume that

the penalty     is equal to p multiplied      by the amount     of excess dissaving   (i. e.,

dissaving     in excess of Awt ). Also assume that consumers            face a subsidized
interest    rate ~. > R. The government            chooses A, p, and ~, to satisfy      the
following three goals:


G1 The equilibrium           consumption     path coincides    with the normative     con-
       sumption     path.

G2 In equilibrium,          Ct = ~W’t, implying that the penalty is never invoked on

       the equilibrium       path.


G3 It is impossible         to lower p without either raising fi or violating conditions
       one and two.


                                              22
Condition      two implies,
                                      Ct+l
                                      —    = R(I             –A).
                                        Ct

Combining       this with condition     one implies,


                                 R(l – J) = R(l - A’~).


This equality expresses ~ as a function of R (and the two known parameters

R and ~~f.) To evaluate          the triplet           {J, p, ~} it, is therefore             sufficient     to

identify the new parameters           p and R.
    The generalized        Euler equation        can be used to derive t,hc values of p and

~. In the presence of a penalty and a subsidized                       interest rate the generalized

Euler equation      for period t becomes:

                                                        i—1
                                ‘-t    i act+z                 ~ _ ac~+.j
            (1 -p)u’(et)    = p ~     6 ~                                                                  (23)
                                                        H(            aw’~+j
                                                                                   ““(Ct+i)
                                                       j=l                 )]

Consider     the analogous     Euler equation              for period t + 1:




Substituting     the latter equation        into the former yit?lds:


            (1 - p)u’(c,) = JRU’(C,)
                                             [
                                                 B*+                (1 - p)
                                                                              (
                                                                              1-    *
                                                                                        W’t+l)l’25)
Note that c1 = AW, C2= A(I –A)fiW,                     *        = A, and R(1 –A) = R(l –Ail).

Proposition      10 follows by substituting                these relationships       into Equation           25

and simplifying      the resulting    expression.

    Proposition         10 implies that the interest        subsidy     is decreasing    in ~j and

decreasing     in p. As @ rises to unity, the self-control problem is mitigated                  and

the magnitude           of the required    interest    subsidy falls. As p rises the penalty

alone becomes increasingly            sufficient to solve the self-control          problcm      and

the magnitude           of the required interest subsidy falls.

    Assume that the government              chooses a penalty of. 10 (the current, penalty

which applies       to early withdrawals          from most retirement           accounts      in the

U.S.).     Then under the benchmark              calibration,      Proposition    10 implies that
to implement       the normative consumption             path the government       needs to select

an interest     rate subsidy of R – R = .015.
    This combination          of penalty and interest subsidy matches the penalty and
interest subsidy associated         with existing U.S. ret iremerrt savings inst,rum~’nt,s

like 401K’s, IRA’s, and 403 B’s.1° All of these accounts                     have an explicit      10
percent penalty for early withdrawal,               and these accounts generate an implicit

interest    subsidy of approximately           .0175 for a representative         U.S. consumer.

To see this, consider the following intertemporal                  consumption    transformation
  10Note however t,hat there are      important differences bet,ween the mechanism          pr~p~sed
in this paper and savings inst,rllments like 401 K’S. First, the hypothetical   savings schernt~s
proposed in this paper have no contribution    caps. Second, while withdrawals from 401K’S
are penalized, failures to deposit an “appropriate”     amount into the account, in the first
place do not generate a penalty. The need to elicit deposits may explain tbc popularity        of
programs in which employers match the contributions         of their employees.

which uses a tax-deferred           retirement        account, as the investm~?nt vehicle.                   A

consumer    at time t cuts consumption                by (1 —~) to fund a 401K investment,

of $1, assuming     that r is the marginal tax rate. ]1 At, the end of T years, the

consumer    withdraws      the accrued value of that investment,                         exp{ (r + n) T},

where m is the inflation         rate.       The consumer       then pays taxes of ~ cxp{ (r +

n) T}, and can therefore consume (1 —~) exp{ (r + n) T}, which has real vallle
(1 – ~) exp{rT}.      Hence, the real rate of intertemporal                      transformation        is:
                                             (1 -~)   exp{rT}
                             ;     log                              =    T.
                                         (        (1 -T)        )
By contrast,     the real rate of intertemporal             transformation           when using a non-

tax-advantaged      investment       vehicle is:

                ~log(exp{(r+fl)(l               – ~)T – TT}) = T(1 – ~) – m~.

Hence, the implicit interest subsidy is:

                            ‘F –    (T(l – T) – 7rT) = (T+7r)T.

If ~ = .25, r = .04, and n = .03 then the interest                        subsidy        associated     with

existing tax-deferred     savings instruments              like 401K’s is approximately                .0175,

close to the optimal      subsidy implied by the model, .015.

    of course,     other models explain               why governments              may want to “sub-

sidize” the after-tax      return        on savings.       For example,           Charnley       (1986) has

shown that in an infinite horizon economy the optimal                             long-run      tax rate on

capital   income is zero. ‘2 My analysis provides an additional                               reason for in-

creasing the after-tax      return on capital.             In a general model which subsumes
  11A $1 investment    into a 401K       plan   generates a tax rebate        of ~ dollars.    Hence, to fund
a $1 investment,  the consumer need only cut consumption     by (1 – ~).
  1ZAiYagari (19g,5) argues that in an economy with incomplete markets,                   Charnley’s   r~sults
are weakened.

both my arguments           and those of Charnley,           opt,imality      requires    a ne,gati~~e
long-run     tax rate on capital     income (i. e., a capital         income subsidy).              This

suggests that 401K’s insufficient y subsidize the return to capital,                      since t,hey

effectively implement        a zero tax rate on capital incornc.
      Proposition      10 has two natural        corollaries.      First,      if the government

chooses to have no interest          subsidy     (i. e., ~ = R.), then p = 1 – [j. Sec-

ond,    if the government,       chooses to have no penalty                 (i. e., p = 0), then

R – ~ = ~-l     (1 – ~)~~’~.     For the benchmark           calibration     the interest subsidy
(in the absence of a penalty)        is ~ – R = .021, Tabl[’ 4 evaluates                 the interest,

subsidy in the absence of a penalty for a range of calibration                      values.


5       Welfare           analysis

In the analysis above I have proposed two normative                  savings rates, and shown

how public policy can (and perhaps               partially      does in the U. S.) implement,

these savings rates.         In this section     I evaluate      the welfare benefits          of inl-

plementing     these policies.    In the game-theoretic           framework       adopted      in this
paper, welfare must be evaluated             from the perspective           of all s[?lves.


5.1        A welfare measure

My thought          experiment   considers     the permanent         adoption       ---- starting     at

time zero -- of one of the revenue-neutral             policies described          in the previous

section.   I will refer to this as the intervention          scenario.      Recall that all of t,he

proposed     policies implement     the AI1 savings rate. Because I assume that, the

policy begins to take effect at time zero, the equilibrium                      path which arises

in the intervention       scenario is equivalent      to the consumption             path induced

                                                26
by fixing the consumption              rate of all selves (including          self 0) to ~~~.

   Let Ut (W. [intervention)            represent         the utility of self t under the interven-

tion scenario, conditional           on time zero wealth 1$70.Let ~t(~o Ino intervt?ntion)

represent     the utility of self t under the no int[?rvention scenario, conditional

on time zero wealth              W70.Note that            under   the no intervention        scenario,       I

assume that the schemes discussed                     in the previous       section will not be im-
plemented      by private actors.            This market failure arises because the schcmcs

are vulnerable        to t bird party         arbitrage:       any consumer       who is engaged            in

one of these schemes will have an incentive to use a third party to unwind
the scheme or arbitrage             against the scheme unless the government                    ~?xplicitly

forbids such third party contracting.                 13 If the legal environment,          is set up to

prevent such arbitrage,            then I will assume that the government                   is effectively

implementing        the scheme. Define ~t such that:

              ~t (WOIno intervention)              = ~t (WO . (1 – ~t) lintervention)                     (27)

Hence,   Kt   represents        Self t’s willingness        to pay (aS a pcrcent,agc of time zero
wealth) for the intervention             policy.


      Corollary to Proposition 8: IF ~ IS SUFFICIENTLY CLOSE TO
      ONE, THEN ~t >0 FOR ALL t.




      Proposition 11: THE SEQUENCE {tit}~o IS MONOTONICALLY
      STRICTLY lNCREASING AND llmt+~ Kt = 1.
  lslf ~ ~onsumer          faces a penalty    for early    withdrawal   from a retirement     accollnt,    the
consumer may borrow from a third party to facilitate immediate        consumption                   thereby
escaping the penalty. Likewise, if a consumer has access to a subsidized interest                  rate, the
consumer may borrow from a third party to exploit the subsidy.


                                                      27
      Recall that     ~t is a measure     of self t’s welfare gains from intervention.
Proposition       11 implies that the welfare gains to self O are smaller than the

welfare gains to all future selves.          Hence, whatever     weighting   function     the

social planner uses, the welfare gains from the perspective            of the social plan-

ner are bounded        below by the welfare gains to self O. The remainder           of this

section focuses on this lower bound.


5.2       Evaluating          the lower bound.

Assume that an individual          consumes      at rate A and begins life with w(?alth

stock ~. Then the utility of self O is given by


                                                                                         (28)


Substituting      for u(”) and simplifying     yields,

                           (Aw)’-”
                                     1+                                                  (29)
                            l–p     [

This implies that ~0 is equal to:


                                                                                         (30)


      Dividing    ~. . ~   by (R – 1) . ~     standardizes    the consum[?r’s willingness

to pay by representing        it as a fraction of current income. For the benchmark

case this normalized        willingness   to pay is quite large: .90. This implies that,

consumers        are willing to forego ~ of a year’s worth of income to induce the

government        to undertake    the proposed     revenue-neutral   intervention.      Table

5 evaluates      fi   for a range of parameter      values.



                                              28
6        Conclusion

Recall the benchmark          calibration    values:    p = 3, ~~ = .6, J = .99, and

R = exp{ .04}. This paper considered            several attributes   of this “hyperbolic:”

economy. A few of these are reviewed here.



1) The slope of the consumption             path of this economy is equal to the slept’
of the consumption        path in a parallel economy with identical technology          and

identical coefficient of relative risk aversion, but with exponential         discounting

with discount      factor .977. Hence a naive econornetrician         might mistake     the

hyperbolic     economy for an exponential           economy in which consumers         have

relatively    low rate of time preference:       l-.977=.023.


2) The EIS in the hyperbolic         economy is .233<      ~ = ~. Hence, the hyperbolic

economy is consistent        with the finding that the EIS is less than the inverse

of the coefficient of relative risk aversion.


3) The savings rate in the hyperbolic           economy (S*) is .133 which is approx-
imately      11 percentage    points below the target       savings rate (Srr) which is

.246. Hence, the hyperbolic          economy is roughly consistent      with Bcrnheim’s

(1994) survey results,       which find that        there is a ten p[?rcentagc point gap

between actual savings rates and target savings rates.


4) A benevolent         government   could implement       the target consumption      path

by creating a system which penalized excess consumption               and subsidized    the

return    on capital.    Specifically, if the penalty     were p = .1(1 of the amount       of



                                               29
excess consumption,    then the interest subsidy would need to be ~ – R = .015
(assumed   to be financed with non-distortionary      taxes).


5) A benevolent    government     could implement    the target consumption      path
by ignoring    the penalty   altogether,   and creating   just an interest   subsidy:

~ – R = .021 (assumed to be financed with non-distortionary           taxes).


6) All selves would be willing to pay ~ of one year’s income (above and lJf’-
yond the non-distortionary      taxes mentioned   above) to induce the government

to implement    one of the proposed savings schemes.

Appendix:             Proofs        and Tables



    Before presenting       the proofs, it is useful to establish            some notation.              Let

Ht be the set of feasible histories           of the consumption             game at, time t. An
}LtE Ht history is a t + l-element            vector,    (W’0, CO, CI, CZ, . . . . et-I)      E    Rt.   Let,

H; represent      the set of feasible histories at time t. Let H*” ht~ the s~?t of all

feasible histories.     Let ~       : HF + [0, m)       be the map from feasible histories

to asset stocks, such that           ~(~o,   co, cl, C2,. . . . Ct–l ) = R’w~ – ~~:j R’-~(:7.

Hence, ~(ht)      is wealth available to self t after history ht. Represent                       the pure
strategy    space of self t as,




Define the joint strategy           space S s     ~~0 St. Let Sp represent                    the set of

subgame-perfect        equilibria    of the consumption         game.      Finally,        let ~J(s, t, 1)1)
represent    the continuation        payoff of self t, after history         h,t, when strategy            ,s
is played from time ~ forward.



Proof      of Proposition       1: Let s: be a point in the strategy                  space of self t

in a game with horizon T. So s,,T “. Hf~ + [O,m). Suppose that, the T-horizon

game has a unique perfect equilibrium.                  Also suppose       that this cquilibriurn

has strategies    of the form: s~(ht) = ~T_t~Tt, for all selves t E {0, 1,. ... T}.

Finally, assumeo       < ~T-~ <1 forallt        E {(),1,2,..      ., T–l}.      Let, V(A,T+l)              ~

~d~~=06tu(~~_t~t),          where ~0 = A, and the rest of the JV, sequence is built

up recursively:    ~~+1 = R(l – ~~–~)~t. It is easy to show 1~~(A, T+ 1) >0 and
VAA(A, T+l)       <0 V A E (O, m), and liInA+O VA(A, T+l)                     = m. Now consider

                                                31
the behavior      of self O in a game with horizon T + 1. Since there is a unique
subgame       perfect equilibrium     in the sub.game that arises after self O’s choice,

self O chooses a consumption          level to maximize, t~(co)+ V(R(WO – co), T + 1),

subject to the restriction      O s co s ~..     The properties     of ~f,(”)and V(, T + 1)
imply that this problem has a unique interior solution.               It, is easy to show that

the chosen consumption          level is proportional     to, but less than,      14’~.HeIlco,

there exists a number A, O < ~ <1 such that CO= Awo VW70.Set AT+] ~ A.

The proof proceeds by induction.            To start the induction,     simply observe that
Ao=l.     n



Proof   of Proposition        2: Continuing      the argument     from the proof of Propo-

sition 2, note that in equilibrium          the following condition      holds for all t :




Note that V(~t+l,       T – t) can be reexpressed,       V(lt’~+l, T – t) =


        ~6u(c,+,(w,+,, T)) + JV(R(W,+,- c,+,(u~,+,,T)), T-(t                     + 1))

Taking a partial      derivative,    yields, VA(M’t+l, T– t) =




Finally substitute     u~(ct+l ) for RVA (W’L+2,T–(t + 1)) to get, the required result.
❑




Proof     of Propositions           3 and   4: Recall that the proof of Proposition              1

shows that in a game with horizon T, the unique perfect equilibrium                   strategy

                                               32
of self t is to consume at rate ~T_t. Given this observation,                         it is possible to

use Proposition   2 to characterize      the consumption                  of self t in a T+l-horizon

game.

    Note that Proposition      2 implies that the following eql~ation holds on the

unique equilibrium    path of any finite horizon sl~bgame:

                                               ac~(wt,~)             j      1) + 1
                   u’(c~–1)= R(5u’((:~)                            (/ -
                                           [
                                                    ~wt

                                                                                  1
Assume that the game has horizon T. Substitute                           in for U(), replace cl, with

~~-t~rt,   and replace the partial derivative              with J~_t. Solving for et_, yields,


                                c~–1 =    A~_(t_l)P1’t_L,


where
                                                          A~-~
                  A~-(~_l) =                                                                       (32)
                               [6R1-~(A~_,(~ -1)+                    1)]:+      AT,
This implies that in a finite horizon game it is possible to calculate                       the equi-
librium consumption     rate of today’s self from the equilibrium                        consumption
rate of tomorrow’s    self. Another way of thinking                      about this is to say that, it
is possible to calculate self t’s equilibrium             strategy        in the T+ l-horizon    game

if we know self t’s equilibrium    strategy         in the T-horizon             game.
    So far I’ve noted the following properties.                  First ct(~t,     T) = A~_tJVt, both

on and off the equilibrium     path,     Second, the sequence of consumption                      rates

{~~}~0, follows the recursion,

                                                             A,
                  AT+~= $( A,) =
                                       [(5R’-~(Ar(p
                                                  - 1) + 1)]+ + A,

Hence, to prove the Theorem        it is sufficient to show that A, + J’.

       Let ~ = sup{~ I J E [0, 1], A = ~(~)}. There is at least one fixed point at
zero, so ~ exists. In fact, it is possible to show that ~ is strictly               gr{?ater than

of this equation          can be divided by ~ since it has been shown that ~ > ().

Transforming          the resulting     equality it is easy to show that

This result follows from Equation             9. Now, recall Equation     15.

Since limc+o(l        – A“) = (6R1-~) ~,        the numerator      and the denominator        of

the bracketed        term in Equation       15 both have finite, non-zero limits.       Hence,




which simplifies to the required result.              ❑.



Proof     of Proposition           7: Let


                             $(A) = U(A)+     DEJ’U(A(l -       A)’R’),
                                                a=l


and let
                               g(A) = U(A)+ ~ 6ZU(A(1– A)~R~).
                                            2=1
Since, U(Z) = ~,             j(~) can be represented,


                             j(A) = U(A)+ BAR’-’(1 - A)’-’g(A).


    The first step in the proof of Proposition             7 is to show g’(~) <0 for all A

such that, A“ s ~ < ~ where ~ = sup{ ~lg(~) > –m}.                  To sign this derivative

over this domain            it is helpful to note the following properties      of g(.). First,

.90 has a unique local (and hence global) maximum                    at A = 1 – (dR1 ‘~) ~.

Second, since g(. ) is differentiable,        ,9’(A) <0 if 1 – (6R1 ‘P) ~ < A < ~. Third,
1 – (JR1-@) ~ < J“. (This third point, is shown by noting:                    (a) the partial

derivative        of the RHS of Equation       9 with respect to A is less than one; (b)

                                                 35
evaluating     the RHS of Equation           9 at A = 1 – (dR1–fl) ~ yields a value which
is greater    than 1 – (6R1-fl) t.) Combining            observations      yields, g’(A) < 0 if

A*< A<I.

    The next step in the proof of Proposition               7 is to show

                         U’(A) –   (1 – p)p6R1-f’(1 –      A)-~g(A)<0

if J* < A < ~. First, note that ~~’(~)– (1 –p)~JR1-fl(l                 – ~)-flg(~)    = O iff } =

A“. (This first point is shown by noting:             (a) A’ is the unique linear symmetric

Markov equilibrium          in the infinite-horizon     game (Phelps and Pollak (1968));
(b) t~’’(~) – p(l – p)@6R1-P(l – J)-p-lg(x)              <0, for all A, z; (c) the concavity

property     stated    in b) implies, u’(~) – (1 – p)~fiRL-fl(l           – ~)-Pg(J)     = O iff J

supports     a linear symmetric         Markov equilibrium.)       Second, note that u’(A) –

(1 – p)~dR1-p(l         – A)-”g(A) <0 if A* < ~ <~.            (This second point is shown

by noting limx+X u’(~) – (1 – p)~dR1-~(l               – ~) ‘fig(J)    <0. Application          of the
Intermediate     Value Theorem implies that u’(~) – (1 – p)@JR’-o(l                    – ~)-flg(~)

can take on a positive value somewhere in the interval (A*, ~) only if ?~’(~) –
(1 – p)~6R1-~(1        – ~)-~g(~)       = O at some point in that interval.       But,, this has

already been ruled out. )

    Combining         results yields,

 f’(A) = U’(A) -(1         - p)[~JR1-’(l -       A)-”g(A) + [jJR]-’(l -        A)’-’,(A)A) <0

if A* s A < ~. This demonstrates               A1 < A“. Pareto-dominance              follows from

the fact that all future selves are made better                off in two ways.         First    they

prefer the sequence          of low A values that        applies      to their current     and fu-

ture consumption         choices, and second they prefer inheriting            greater levels of

wealth as implied by the sequence of previous low ~ values. ❑

Proof   of Proposition           8: Using the implicit function theorem it is possible

to show that equation        18 implies,

Also note that when [~ = 1 equation            18 implies,




This is sufficient to show that normative           savings rate I is less than normative

savings rate II.
   To show the Pareto-dominance             result, I introduce      the following notation.

Let U(A) represent      the utility of self O, given that all selves (including        self O)

consume at rate ~. I seek to show f(~) ~ ~(~~~) – U(A* (~)) > 0 when /~ is
close to unity. This notation         is used to emphasize     that, ~(~’ (~)) depends     on

{~in two ways. First, ~ is a discount rate, so changes in ~~affect the valu~j of
future consumption.        Second, [j is in the implicit equation         which determines

~’. Note that ~ only influences U(A1l) through the former mechanism                    as ~~f

does not depend on ~.
   The body of this proof characterizes              the value of j(”) in a neighborhood

of @ = 1. First, j(l)     = O since A’(l) = Arz. To evaluate            ~() at [j values just

below unity, I consider j’(l)         and j“(l).

                                  au(~JJ)
                     f’(~) =         a~     - a~$”)      - a~~”)      ~

Note that j’(l)    = O, as wij.l            = ~       ~j.l, and, ~        o.( = ~       [j.1 =

O. Tedious algebraic manipulations           reveal that

                         j“(l)    = :( A’’)-”(l     - A“)(l   - 2A”),


                                               37
which is positive by (recall that ~~~ = 1 – (6R1-~)1/~). Given that ,~(1) = 0,
,f’(1) = O, and j“(l)          >0,    there exists an interval   (@,1) such that j(~~) > ()

V ~ E (~, 1). Hence, for sufficiently large ~ <1,             ~(~) is positive.     This shows
that self O is made better off by switching to the A1l path.             Pareto-ciorrlirlanc:f’

follows from the fact that, all future selves are mad~? better               off in two ways.

First they prefer the sequence of ~~~ values that applies to their current, and

future consumption           choices, and second they prefer inheriting           greater levels

of wealth as implied by the sequence of past Arr values. ❑



Proof        of Proposition          9: Apply analogous      arguments    to the arguments

used to prove Propositions            1-4. First, let s: be a point in the strategy       space
of self t in a game with horizon T. So St~ .“ HL~l +                  [0, m),   Suppose    that,

the T-horizon        game has a unique perfect, equilibrium.             Also suppose      that

this equilibrium          has strategies     of the form:   .s~(h,t) = ~T–(~+l)~’~”’~+l,
                                                                                      for all
selves t E {O, 1, . . . . T – 1}. Finally,          assume O < AT_(L+l) < 1 for all t ●

{0,1,2,...      ,T – 2}. Let V(A, T+ 1) = ~d~~=l 6t~(~T-f~~), where i~’l = A,

and the rest of the ~t sequence is built, up recursively:           ~~+1 = R,(I –AT_f )lVl,.

It is easy to show V,(A, T+                1) >0   and V~~(A,T+      1) <0      V A E (O, m),
and limA+O VA (A, T + 1) = 00. Now consider the behavior of self O in a game
with horizon T + 1. Since there is a unique subgame                  perfect equilibrium      in

the subgame        that     arises after self O’s choice, self O chooses a consumption

level to maximize,         ~~du(cl) + V(R(W1       – c1), T + 1), subject to the restriction

O ~ c1 ~ ~1. The properties                of u(. ) and V(, T + 1) imply that, this problem

has a unique interior solution.             It is easy to show that the chosen consumption
level is proportional         to, but less than, WI, Hence, there exists a number              A,

O < A < 1 such that        c1 = AM71V~l.           Set AT s A. The proof proce[?ds by
induction.   To start the induction,      simply observe that AO= 1. ❑ Note that

in equilibrium    the following condition      holds for all t :

                             ptiu’(c,) = Rv~(w’,+,,
                                                 T-t).


Note that V(Wt+l, T – t) can be reexpressed,                 V(~~+l, T – t) =

        pa’u(c,+,(wt+,,     T))+    6V(R(W,+,-         C,+,   (w,+,, T)), T-(t   + 1))


Taking a partial     derivative,   yields, LL(~t+l, T– t) =

Finally substitute     @6u’(ct+l ) for RVA (Wt+2, T – (t + 1)) to find:

                                   u’(c~)= JR74’(c~+l).

Substitute   in for u(”), replace et with ~~-t~t,            and replace the partial deriva-
tive with A~_t. Solving for et-l yields,

                                   c~–1 = A~_(~_l)wt_l,
