                                     ABSTRACT



A   common theme in discusssions of trade reform is the possibility of improved

technical efficiency following trade liberalization,      This paper presents a

conceptual analysis of the likely linkages between trade regimes and technical

efficiency.     Three sets of arguments, having to do with X-inefficiency,

macroeconomic    instability, and increasing returns to scale, are reviewed and

found misleading or incomplete.     A simple model of technological catch-up by a

domestic firm shows the opposite of the usual argument: the larger market

share provided by protection to the firm increases its incentives to invest in

technological effort.     When modified to include oligopolistic considerations

at home, the model suggests that the incentives could go either way, depending

on the mode of strategic conduct.     The presence of economies of scale provides

perhaps the strongest reason for productivity improvements, but here the

argument relies on frictionless entry into and exit from industries.      The

paper concludes that the relationship between trade policy and technical

efficiency is fundamentally    ambiguous.

I.   Introduction

       The import-substitution   strategy's fall into disrepute among academics,

and increasingly among policy-makers, has      been   greatly assisted by the

discovery that infant industries spawned by the strategy have failed to

mature.    It has become increasingly clear that indiscriminate      protection of

nascent   industries yields few productivity gains, and that the benefits of the

strategy are unlikely to offset its costs in terms of resource misallocation,

For this and other reasons, "outward orientation" has now become the new

orthodoxy.    The new strategy's Siren song haa many refrains, but one which is

particularly appealing     is the promise   of improved technical efficiency once

protective trade barriers are lifted.       With trade liberalization set into

motion, policy-makers are told, protected firms will have no choice but to

modernize their     techniques and cut their costs in order to compete with

foreign producers.     What is at stake is no longer some Harberger triangles,

but hefty rectangles of unexploited technological opportunities.

      The relationship between trade policy and technical efficiency is an old

theme in economics, but one that has been overshadowed by the emphasis on the

Ricardian doctrine of comparative costs.       The traditional case for comparative

advantage and free trade is one that stresses allocative efficiency         (i.e.   the

allocation of domestic resources into sectors where they are most productive);

it is mostly silent on technical efficiency.        Interestingly,   the original case

for the gains from trade- - as articulated by Adam Smith- - relied on overall

gains in productivity deriving from an expanded division of labor within a
                                           -2-


larger marketJ     This rationale for trade--based on scale economies--was

hidden from the view of academic economists by the intellectual appeal of the

Ricardian outlook, and has only recently been resuscitated in the works of the

"new" trade theorists.2    But unlike the Ricardian perspective, the new one

lacks a clean model: except for the limiting case where they are "external" to

firms, scale economies must go hand in hand with imperfect competition.          The

range of possible outcomes of trade policy then becomes limited only by the

analyst's   imagination.

     The hopes for trade liberalization are by no means based only on the

exploitation of scale economies.        Protection typically leads to the

monopolization   of the domestic market by a few producers.       A common

presumption is that the resulting market structures will not be conducive to

improvements in productivity and technical efficiency.         Liberalization,   it is

argued, would reverse the incentives.       Here we bump against one of the oldest

concerns of the literature on industrial organization: the relationship

between market structure and innovation.         The ease with which pro-liberalizers

make their case is belied by the continuing debates in this literature about

the nature of the relationship.3        The Schumpeterian perspective would disagree

strongly with the view that competition is conducive to either innovation or

consumption, it encourages them to improve its productive powers        Smith

cost reducing investments.

       My objective in this paper is to clarify some of the conceptual issues in

the debate over the relationship between trade policy and technical

efficiency.    After a brief review of the arguments and the evidence in the

next section, I will devote most of my analysis to a set of highly stylized

models that shed light on different aspects of the debate.       I   will argue that

much current discussion has served only to muddy the waters by inadequately

distinguishing    between trade policy proper and other (mostly macro) policies

deployed in support of outward orientation.     Once attention   is focused on

trade policy, it becomes extremely difficult to sustain the case that

liberalization,    as a general rule, must have a positive impact on technical

efficiency.    The models considered here demonstrate the fundamentally

ambiguous nature of the relationship.



II.   The Arguments and the Evidence

      The available evidence suggests that increases in productivity have

played an important role in the economic growth of the developing countries.

But the contribution of productivity change relative to the growth of factor

inputs has been typically not as high as in developed countries.        On average,

the increase in total factor productivity (TFP) accounts for about half of the

growth in value added in developed economies; the comparable figure for

developing countries   is around a third (see Table 1),

      Is there any reason to believe that choices with respect to trade

strategy will have systematic effects on the level of technical efficiency and
                                        -4-


its change over time?    The straightforward answer is   no.   The theory   of trade

policy is generally silent on the effects of liberalization on the rate of

growth of output or productivity.     The conventional benefits of liberalization

are once-and-for-all gains, and although such gains can accumulate over time,

they do not necessarily put the economy on a superior path of technological

development   A
     To be    sure, there is no shortage of arguments regarding how trade policy

     affect domeatic productivity. The above comments refer to the lack of any

general theoretical presumptions; particular stories do abound.       Among such

stories, three deserve special mention as the onea that come cloaeat to

satiafying minimum standards of logical coherence, and it is on these that I

will focus in this section.

      X-efficiency.    The first set of arguments revolve around X-inefficiency.

While the particular rendition differs, the general theme here is that

protectionmakes it more likely that domeatic entrepreneurs will auccomb to

the "quiet life" of the monopolist.     Why work hard to improve productivity and

cut costa if foreign competition presents little threat?       In its simplest

form, this argument relies on satiaficing, rather than optimizing, behavior on

the part of entrepreneurs,    and requires further that domeatic competition be

not severe enough of a threat to keep them on their toes.       With optimizing

behavior,    it cannot be shown in general that protection weakena the pursuit of

higher productivity.     In fact, as I will argue in the following section, the



4.  The language in the World Bank's World Develooment Reoort. 198? (focusing
on trade and industrialization) reflects an all-too obvious tension between
the desire to make a positive case for liberalization on productivity grounds
and the need to acknowledge that the theoretical and empirical support for
auch a caae is weak. See pp. 90-92.
                                        -5-


normal case would be quite the opposite; for an individual firm,    the   larger

marker share provided by trade restrictions increases at the margin the

benefits of cost improvements, and is likely to spur, not retard,

technological effort.     If entrepreneurs satisfice instead, the presumed

negative effect can indeed occur.    But the working hypothesis of satisficing

behavior would require liberalizers to sacrifice   too many other beliefs held

even more firmly; for example, how many of them would be likely to reject the

notion that devaluation spurs exports, as they must if entrepreneurs are

indeed prone to satisficing?

     A more satisfactory theoretical explanation for this hypothesis is

provided by the possibility that liberalization may influence the labor-

leisure choice of entrepreneurs.    Suppose that reducing X-inefficiency

requires constant effort and diligence, which cuts into leisure.      Protection

increases the rents to entrepreneurs, who take some of their increased income

in the form of leisure.    As overall effort declines, technical efficiency

settles on a lower path.    Liberalization would then reverse the process.       The

definitive analysis of this question can be found in Corden (1974, pp. 224-

231),   who carefully disects the argument and shows its fragility.     Notice

that this line of reasoning is valid only when income effects outweigh

substitution effects, i.e. when the labor supply curve of entrepreneurs      is

backward-bending;   as indicated in the preceding paragraph, the substitution

effect is likely to go in the other direction.     In addition, this argument has

some disconcerting implications when viewed in general-equilibrium     terms;

liberalization    increases the incomes of exportera, who, by the same reasoning,

would be prone to relax on their technological efforts.       I suspect that this

contradicts a widely held belief to the contrary.6

     Macroeconomic    instability.    The second major line of reasoning relies on

the evidence that inward-oriented regimes are prone to foreign exchange

bottlenecks and atop-go macroeconomic cycles.       The instability in the

macroeconomic    environment and the consequent tendency for output to

                                                              inimical to
periodically fall below the full-capacity level are certainly

growth in measured productivity.       In addition, the overvaluation of the

domestic currency and shortagea of imported inputs diacourage domestic firms

from attempting to reap the benefits of scale via foreign markets.        t4hile


these arguments have an important kernel of truth, they say practically

                                                                  level of
nothing about the role of s.4.g policy per se. Conceptually, any
trade protection is compatible with macroeconomic stability, realistic

exchange rates, and the like.        The view that protection leads to chronic

current account deficits mixes up macroeconomics       with microeconomics.

                                                                in combination

with exchange-rate and macro policies that are quite unobjectionable.7

even when entrepreneurial labor supply is backward-bending. The reason is

without any sizable trade liberalization.8

     Current terminology ("outward orientation",      "export promotion strategy")

has the glaring shortcoming that it lumps together macroeconomic       policies with

trade policies.    Worse still, the combination is sometimes referred to as the

"trade regime", with devaluation-cum-stabilization      episodes referred to as

"trade liberalization"   .   While   this terminology may be useful for a

deacriptive categorization    of country experiences- -exceptions notwithstanding,

restrictive    trade regimes do tend to go hand in hand with macroeconomic

instability--it confuses things for prescriptive purposes.        When inferior

technological performance is due to mismanagement of macroeconomic policy,

countries   should be told to change their exchange rate and fiscal policies;

the inclusion of trade liberalization      in the policy package- - sometimes as the

lead policy initiative- -gives the upper hand to ideology over economics.

     Increasing returns to scale,       The third line of argument is based on

economies of scale.    More open trade regimes, it is argued, are conducive to

lower overall costs since domestic firms can achieve larger levels of output

by participating    in world markets.    In a broad general-equilibrium sense, this

is of course true.     Small, open economies are likely to specialize in a narrow

                                                    at sufficient scale to be
range of products which they can produce and export

competitive.     In more practical terms, as long as trade liberalization leads

to an expansion (on average> of firms and sectors with increasing returns to

scale (IRS), the conventional resource allocation benefits are magnified by

markets.      It is telling that all significant cases of export boom in

manufactures--Korea         and Taiwan in the l96Os, Brazil in late l960s and 1970s,

Turkey in the l980s- - took place well before any significant trade

liberalization had been attempted,11             The Chilen trade liberalization,     on the

other hand, appears to have fostered exports of primary or primary-related

products with little scope for IRS.

       In   section    V below, I will discuss some of these arguments further and

show why trade restrictions do not affect adversely the export incentives of

protected     firms.      What   is   true is that with sufficiently restrictive levels of

protection, trade policy may end up fostering an industry which is unable to

compete abroad at any level of output.                 This, then, is an argument against

"excessive" protection, rather than protection per se,                 The benefits from

liberalization      in this instance will derive predominantly from the contraction

of industries with no underlying comparative advantage in the conventional

sense, and not from an overall expansion of production                runs and associated

increases in overall productivity.

       To   sunusarize,    I conclude that the first of these arguments (about X-

efficiency)      is rather contrived, the second (about macro stability) is largely

irrelevant to trade policy, and the third (about IRS) is potentially important

but incomplete.           I will return to the more important of these arguments below.

What   about   the empirical evidence?

       Examining whether any broad cross-sectional              correlations emerge between




11.  The experience of these countries strongly suggests that a realistic
exchange-rate policy and a generous program of export subsidies, rather than
trade liberalization per Se, are the key ingredients for successful export
performance.

trade regimes and TFP growth has proved to be a tempting exercise.        A recent

survey by Howard Pack (1986) suggests that the evidence from such studies is

quite inconclusive: "to date there is no clear cut confirmation of the

hypothesis   that countries with an external orientation benefit from greater

growth in technical efficiency in the corponent sectors of manufacturing"       (p.

38).    Bhagwati, a proponent of outward-orientation, has also concluded

recently that there is little empirical or theoretical aupport for favoring

axport promotion over import substitution on grounds of scale economies,

technical efficiency, or innovation   (1988,   pp. 39-40).   In any case, the

evidence surveyed by Pack and Bhagwati does not directly bear on the issues at

hand, since none of the studies discriminates between trade policy and macro

policy choicesj2     As argued above, causality cannot be attributed to trade

policy proper if what one understands from "trade regimes" is the entire

complex of trade and payments policies.    To conclude, then, there is no

convincing empirical evidence that less protectionist trade policies do better

in terms of technical efficiency.

       I now move on to a series of stylized models that investigate the

relationship between trade policy and productivity.     In light of the

diacussion above, my objective will be to make simple points in the context of

simple models rather than to demonstrate the validity of a single general

proposition.

(1982).

III.   Protection and Technoloeical Catch-Up

        I    start with a case which shows the opposite of the orthodox argument.

consider a firm which invests in technological development to cut its costs,

and ask: how will the rate of increase of productivity                            depend on the level of

trade protection afforded to the firm?                       Once the backward bending

entrpreneurial             effort curve is ruled out, the answer is surprisingly general.

The larger is the firm's market share, the greater is its investment in

productivity-enhancing               technology.       As long as protection increases the firms

market share, then, trade restrictions improve the level of technical

efficiency.

        Let the firm have a monopoly at home.                      The case of domestic oligopoly

will be considered in the next section.                          Its maximized flow profits can be

written as


(1)     ir(c,      a)      max qp(q, a)        cq,
                            q


where c denotes the firm's (constant) marginal cost, q its output, p(.) the

inverse demond function it faces at home, and a the quantity of imports

alloyed       in         Import    liberalization in this context will refer to increases in
m.     For    the       moment,   I ignore   the   possibility       that   the   firm may want to export.

Let the foreign level of marginal costa be c*, with c >                             c   initially.   The

firm can        reduce its costs (all the way down to c*) by investing resources in

technology          and    overall tinkering. I model this by letting the firm choose the
rate    at which domestic costs decline, and denote this rate                               Then at any

point in        time, the         cost level is given by:
                                                     -12-



                             -ftt,   t<T,
(2)   c(t) —          *
                     c,              taT.

Here T denotes the time thst elapses before the domestic firm fully catches up

with foreign technology, and c0 represents the initial level of domestic
                                      *
costs.    This implies $          - c    or:
                                      (l/T)(c0        ),



(3)   c(t)          c0
                         -
                             (t/T)(c0   -
                                            0*),   for t      T.



The present discountedvalue of expenditures made on technological effort

increases with $, and can be written simply as                     ($),   with ' >     0 and   '' >   0,


      What is of interest is the length of time it takes for the firm to csrch

up with foreign technology.                  Since both c(t) and $ can be written as a

function of T, the firm's objective function can also be stated as a function

of T alone:


(4)   V(T)   —   f       exp(-pt)ir(c(t), m)dt +     J exp(-pt)r(c*,        m)dt   -




where p is the firm's discount fsctor.                     After simplifying,    the first-order

condition becomes:


(5)   V'(T) -       f        exp(-pt)tff0(c(t), m)dt +      '()    - 0.


This sets the marginal cost of technological effort equal to the discounted

sum of its benefits over the catch-up period.                      Notice that equation (I)

implies   ire
                —    -q,     so that the benefits of effort are directly proportional to

the scale of domestic output.                  As long as '(.)      is   finite and strictly

positive,       and assuming the second-order condition is satisfied,                   the catch-up

is completed within the open interval (0,                    ).

       To gauge the effects of trade policy, we can perform comparative statics

with respect to a.         Differentiating    (5) yields:


(6)    dT/dm —   -V'   (flu      (5 exp(-pt)tcm(.)dt}.
Since the second-order condition requires V' (.)                to   be negative, the sign of

this expression depends solely on                  But from (1),                — -aq/am so that
                                           lrcm.                         ircm


'cm is positive as long
                        as import liberalization                (an increase in imports)

reduces the output of the domestic firm.               Since this is the regular case, we

can conclude that dT/dni > 0; a more liberal trade regime slows down the rate

of increase of domestic productivity and delays technological catch-up.                           The

economic mechanism at work here is simple.               The larger the scale of output,

the greater the benefits to the firm from a given reduction in costs.                         Since


import liberalization          shrinks the domestic firms sales, it reduces the

incentive to invest in technological effort.

       The above ignored two possibilities:            (a)    the domestic firm may export,

and (b) it may eventually overtake foreign competitors in productivity.                           We

can incorporate both possibilities in the above framework by changing the

formulation of technical progress at home.               Suppose that the domestic firm can

set its own target for the eventual level of productivity                        it reaches, c.

This target could lie above or below the foreign level of productivity,                           c.

Its costs at any point in time are now written as follows:


(7)    c(t)      c + (c0   -
                               c)exp(-t)

The firm reaches c asymptotically as t->'.               We   now assume           is exogenous

            > 0), so that the firm's choice variable is c.                 We rewrite the cost
(1 >   fi



function for technological          effort as   (c), with       '    <   0 and   ' > 0.
                                                                  -14-

           The firm's flow profit function is as in (1) when it decides not to

export.           When it does export, its flow profits are also a function of the

foreign level of costs, c*, so csn be written generally as                                      (c, c*,     m).       As

before,          c—         -4,    the level of total output (domestic sales and exports

combined)          .    The point in time at which the firm becomes an exporter is

determined endogenously.                       Let ' denote the level of productivity at which the

firm just breaks even in world markets; &                                is   defined implicitly by the

relation (,                  c*,   m)   -
                                            r(a,   m)     0.      When costs are lower than        E,   the
firm's profits from foreign sales add on to existing profits in the domestic

market.           I will only look at the case where it pays to export eventually, i.e.

where the firm's target level of costa (c) is lower than                                    .   As long     as c <

&,       there    exists a finite length of time,                      T, after which       the firm services

both the domestic and the foreign markets.                                T is determined as follows: since
     —     +     (ce,
                        -
                            Z)exp(-$T)        from (7),


(8)       T —     (l/fi)[ln(c0          -
                                            Z) -   ln(&   -




          The firm's objective function can now be stated as a function of the

target level of productivity alone:


(9)       V(c) —        fj   exp(-pt)(c(t), m)dt +                J exp(-pt)(c(t), c,           m)dt    -




with      c(t) and T defined as in (7) and (8).                           The first-order condition can be

simplified to:


(10)       f exp(-pt)ir(l-exp(-$t))dt                         +   f   exp(-pt)[    -
                                                                                       c]     -exp(-$t))dt        -
                                                                                                                      '    = 0.

The marginal benefits of innovation are now larger as they are spread over a

larger scale of output:                      Nc     -
                                                        c1    represents the net increase in output that
                                                  - 15-

is made possible through exports.               Hence the carrot of future exports adds to

the incentive to enhance productivity.

        Once again, we can investigate the effects of import liberalization on the

rate of technical progress.               Differentiation of (10> yields:


(11)    dc/dm —    -(V   ) [5 exp(-pt)(l-exp(-fltfldt
                             J exp(-pt)cm(l-exp(-t))dt,
                                +


                                                                -                            is
where    I   have made use of the fact that               ()               0.     V' '            negative

from the second-order condition, so the sign of this expression depends on the

signs of     cm   and   cm     As long as increased foreign competition reduces the

total output of the domestic firm, dc/dm >                 0,   and liberalization is inimical to

technical progress.          The explanation is as before: while the export potential is

now an added inducement for cutting costs, a policy that reduces the scale of

domestic output diminishes the incentives to catch-up with foreign technology.

        Finally, let us consider briefly the question of temporary versus permanent

protection.       Suppose the government commits itself to a path of trade policy

such that trade is liberalized after a certain point in                   time,    r.        How does rhis

affect the behavior of the firm?

       Ignoring with no loss of generality the role of exports, let the profit

functions of the firm be written as             ir(c,   m) and T(c, a'), corresponding to pre-

nd post-liberalization          periods.      Liberalization implies m' > m.                 The firm

maximizes      its objective function:



(12)    V(o) -    J exp(-pt)s(c(t),         m)dt +   f( exp(-pt)s(c(t), m')dt            -




The first-order condition           is:
                                                                                  '
                                                16-

(13)    f    exp(-pt)ac(1-exp(-$tfldt       +     exp(-pt)c(1.exp(-$tfldt -           —   0.


We investigate what happena when the liberalization ia brought forwatd in time

(i.e.    r   ia reduced).       The comparative atatica yield:


(14)     dc/dr -       -(V'')    [exp(-pr)(l-exp(-rflJ    (mc(c(r), m)
                                                                         -
                                                                             ffc(c(r), m')}.

Since the level of domeatic output is smaller when imports are liberalized


  c(T),       m)   -
                       lrc(c(r), m')   <0), we have dc/dr < 0. Shortening the period

over which temporary protection is granted reduces the firm's technological

effort.      This contradicts once again the conventional wisdom regarding the

productivity-boosting effects of temporary, rather than permanent, protection.

        In sum, simple partial-equilibrium models of technological catch-up point

in the direction diametrically opposed to arguments made by liberalizers.                      While

models of the sort analyzed here need not be taken overly seriously as an actual

description of the process of innovation in developing countries, they certainly

cast doubt on the productivity-enhsncing effects of trade liberalization.

        An important caveat to this line of reasoning has to do with the partial-

equilibrium nature of the analysis.             Protection enhances the profitability of

firms in import-competing sectors, but acts as a tax on firms in exporting

sectors.      Unless there are under-utilized resources, protection cannot expand

output in import-competing and exporting sectors simultaneously.                  Consequently,

productivity gains in the former have to be weighed against foregone

productivity improvements in the latter.              An important implication, therefore,

is that the analysis above cannot be used as a justification for indiscriminate,

scrosa-the board protection.            A related caveat is that in the absence of some

knowledge regarding the externalitiea involved in technological effort, we
                                        -17-


cannot judge a faster technological catch-up induced by protection to be

necessarily welfare-improving)-3     At best, then, there is a case for selective

protection of industries where (a) the catch-up potential is largest, and (b)

there exist positive spillovers to the rest of the economy)-4



IV. The Role of Oligopoly

        The framework utilized above abstracted from interactions among competing

firms in the domestic market.    The new trade theory has stressed such

interactions as an important determinant of the effects of policy.     Accordingly,

I now concentrate on the implications of an oligopolistic market structure at

home.     The question to be analyzed is the same as before: how does protection

influence the level of technical efficiency of firms?

        The model that follows illustrates a rather simple and intuitive story.     In

an oligopolistic industry, incumbents could increase profits, in the absence of

perfect collusion, if they could all somehow commit themselves to lower sales.

In practice, centrifugal forces tend to prove too strong, and firms waste some

of their profits by "excessive" competition.     Now, one way that firms could

                                                                     outdated or
credibly commit themselves to less agressive behavior is by choosing

costly technology.     By maintaining costs artificially high, they could

facilitate collusion.

        How does protection affect all this?   As the level of protection increases,



13.  In fact, when no such externalities exist, trade protection can be show-n
to lead to welfare losses regardless of its effect on technological
performance.

14.  See Westpha]. (1982) for an interpretation of Korean technological
development in terms of selective promotion of infant industries. On Korea,
see also Dornbusch and Park (1987), pp. 402-406.
                                            -18-

the profits forgone by excessive competition increase as well, so that the

potential payoffs to a strategy of high costs rise.             Therefore, as long as

firms' strategic behavior is conducive to an increase in costs, protection

serves to inflate costs even further.        Notice that this argument is entirely

different from any stated so far; the adverse effect on costs is purely the

consequence of the nature of oligopolistic interactions among incumbent firms.

For the liberalizets, this is of course good news.             The bad news is that the

argument is extremely brittle,      As is common in models of oligopoly, it is easy

to   reverse the result by assuming a different     mode       of behavior on the part of
firms.

       To formalize the argument, let us consider a two-stage game being playod by

a pair of duopolists.      In the first period, each firm undertakes a certain

amount of investment in technological effort, denoted by            k   and
                                                                              k   respeotively,

taking as given the decisions of its rival.         In the second, the firms oorpete in

the domestic market.      At the beginning of the second period,         k: and k• are pre-

determined, and the profit function of firm i looks as follows:


(15)
               q1,
                     k)   p1(a, q1)q    -
                                            c1(q,   kt),


where p'(.) is the inverse demand function fared by firm i, and               c   C U.   Fira

j's profit function is symmetric.      For the moment      I   have supreseed imports;

trade policy will be discussed below in terms of changes in the fora of the

inverse demand function faced by the firms.         The first-order rondition is:


(li)   4 + vi4 =
                                                             -19-

where a subscript denotes a partial derivative with respect to the relevant

argument, and vL is firm i's conjecture regarding how firm                                        j will   respond to

changes in the former's output (see                      Dixit,           1985).    Equation (16) and its

analogue for firm                 define a pair of best-response functions
                             j
                                                                                                    q6(q     k6) and
                     and an equilibrium which is a function only of the predetermined
q(q k)
investment levels k6 and                       Therefore, the second period equilibrium can be
                         kj.
                                                         —
expressed as q1              q(k, k)           and
                                                     q           q(k,      k),
       In the first period, firms are fully cognizant of the effects of their

investment decisions on the subsequent game, so choose                                    k   and
                                                                                                    k   accordingly.

Letting     (.) stand            for the cost of investment ('>O, ''>O), the problem for

firm i is:


(17)       Max              kj)
                                  -
                                      '(q(k6,        ks).        q(k,      k1), k5)
                                                                                      -




If   the firm takes its rival's decision as given, the first-order condition for

     is:



(18)       (dq/dk6)         +    e(dq/dk6)       +           -   '   —    0.

Notice that firm j's output is sensitive to changes ink6 only insofar as the

latter affects firm l's output.                      So we can write                          —
                                                                                   dq/dk          (dq/dq)dq/dk6.
Let us define         r     as the slope of firm j's best-response function,                               Le.   rJ —

                     Then              —                             Now making use of (16), we can re-
(dq/dq).                    dq/dk          ri(dq/dk6),
write (18) as follows:


(19)       (r    -
                     v1)(dq/dk)            +   (     -   ')      —   0.


The second term in parentheses here captures the conventional trade-off between
                                               -20-

the   costs and benefits of technological effort,           in the abaence of oligopoliscic

interactions, this would be the only determinant of the level of investment in

technological development.          The first term,    on the other hand, captures the

atrategic role of the choice of technology, and it is on this that                  I   will now

concentrate.

       Under atandard assumptions, a decrease in marginal costa will make a fitm

produce more    (dq/dk >      0) and     an incmease in the rival's output will hurt

profits        < 0), so chat the sign of the strategic effect depends solely on
          (a
                             15
the sign of (r2    -   v1)        This term is the difference between the actual slope

of j's best-response function and the conjecture entertained by                  i, and is   a

familiar one in models of oligopoly.           When firms behave too "agressively" in the

second period, vt will be negative and large, so that            (r2   -
                                                                           vt)   > 0.    This is

the presumption when firms compete in Bertrand fashion (setting prices and

taking the price of the rival as given), for example.             In this instance, the

strategic effect makes a neaative contribution to the first-order condition in

(19)    the optimal level of       k1,   will now be        than would have been the case

in the absence of a strategic motive,            intuitively, it is in the interest of the

firm to increase       its costs as this blunts some of its agcessiveness               in the


second period.    And the same is true for its rival,           The profits to the firma

from a consequently greater degree of collusion can outweigh the losses in

productivity.     But from a social viewpoint, the costs of oligopoly are now

exacerbated by technical inefficiency.

       So far, this is standard maretial.16            The only new wrinkle comes with the

role of trade policy.        How does trade liberalization affect the technological

choice in this framework?           First, and most obviously, it affects the base level

of output on which cost savings are distributed.            This is the effect discussed

in the previous section.        As shown earlier, trade liberalization will reduce the

incentive to increase productivity on this account as long as domestic output is

reduced.     This is captured in the present framework by a reduction in

        Secondly, and this is the key point, liberalization reduces the excess

profits available in the home market, and therefore may be expected to de-

emphasize the strategic motive for under-investment in technology.             The algebra

here gets quite messy, but the point is simple enough.           As can be seen from

(19),    the incentive to inflate costs is proportional to             which equals
                                                                 7t,

qi(aP'/8q) (see     [15}).
                                                                       (3P1/aq)
be written as p1/c, where           is the price elasticity of demand facing each firm.

As the domestic market is opened, we expect          p   to decrease and    to increase (in

absolute value).     On both accounts, the strategic disincentive for technological

effort becomes smaller.        In the limit of free trade,       goes to negative

infinity, so that the strategic disincentive disappears altogether.

        This line of reasoning provides one possible rationale for why the

oligopolistic market structures created by protection may create a bias against

technological effort,        But,   as stated at the outset, this argument is not

particularly robust.     It relies on the possibility that firms compete "too

inatead, firms have "consistent" conjectures (ci            -   vt   —   0),   the strategic motive

disappears and the considerations discussed above no longer come into play.

Moreover, when firms behave in Cournot (quantity-setting) fashion, vt                         0 and a

negatively-sloped reaction function (r2 <          0)   iaplies that the strategic

incentive will work to enhance productivity)-8            With Cournot behavior in the

second petiod, there will be           -investsient     in technology as each firm would

like to pre-oomisit itself to a larger scale of output.                  Trade liberalization

will now be doubly inimical to rechnologtcal performance.



V.    The Role of Economies of Scale

         of the most appealing arguments for trade liberalization ia the one
        One

that has been mentioned at the beginning of the paper: liberalization may foatet
the    rationalization of industry structure by forcing inefficient firms out.                       The

maintained hypothesis here is that protection tends to crowd in too many firms

producing at too low levels of output.

        The industry-rationalization argument relies crucially on two feature:, of

the industty concerned: (a) economies of stale, and (b) free entry and exit.                          in


the prescore of these two, there is indeed a very good case for trade

liberalization on the grounds of productivity.             The argument goes as follows.

With free entry, the domestic price has to equal the average cost of the

representative firm since incumbents cannot make excess profits.                       With   IRS,


average coats are a declining function of firm-level output.                     Therefore, any




18.  See Eaton and Grossman (1986)       for a systematic discussion on the
importance of conjectures,
                                         -23-

policy which tends to increase the domestic price     (e.g.   protection) will also

increase the average cost level in the industry.      The mechanism that enables

this is the entry of additional firms, which squeezes the output of the

incumbents and forces them up their average cost curves.       Conversely,

liberalization reduces the domestic price and leads some of the incumbents to

leave the industry.    The remaining firms have to produce at sufficiently greater

scale for the reduced level of average costs to match the lower domestic price.

     Notice that this industry-rationalization argument is based on partial-

equilibrium reasoning.    Once the likely changes in relative factor prices are

taken into account, the force of the argument can be blunted somewhat.         The

reason is that these factor-price changes are likely to dampen (or reverse) the

increase in firm-level output as prices fall.      Consider the following likely

scenario for developing countries.      Suppose that the fixed costs of production

(the basis for IRS) consist primarily of capital costs,       Then, if trade

liberalization reduces capital costs relative to wages sufficiently- - as the

Stolper-Samuelson theorem would predict for developing countries- 'average costs

at unchanged output levels could fall so much that restoring the equality

between price and average cost nay require a reduction in the scale of

production of the typical firm.     The consequence, paradoxically, may be de'

rationalization (see Brown   and   Stern, 1988).

     Barring these general-equilibrium complications, the cost savings from

industry rationalization can greatly magnify the traditional gains from

liberalization (Harris, 1984).     In an earlier paper, I carried Out some simple

partial-equilibrium   simulations for three Turkish industries to assess the

likely welfare effect of pertial quota liberalization under various scenarios of

market   conduct (Rodrik, 1988).   The existence of IRS was assumed in each case,
                                         -24-


and modeled by incorporating aome fixed coats of production.         Table 2

summarizes the relevant results for the case of Cournot conjectures.        The

numbers highlight the crucial role of free exit, when such exists.        In all

cases, the industry rationalization promoted by exit adds a considerable boost

to the overall welfare effect, turning a negative outcome into a posittve ons in

one instance.

      In the presence of free entry and exit,      a rather similar outcome could

obtain even when IRS is not particularly important, as long as firms differ in

their levels of productivity.     There is evidence that such differences may he

quite important in some developing countries and in some industries (Page,

1984) .   Large   differences in producriviry are of course sustainable only with

trade protection.     Under free entry, the domestic price equals the average cost

of the marginal firm.     With liberalization, the least efficient firms have to

exit until the new marginal firm is defined by the level of productivity which

equates its average cost with the (lower) domestic price.        Just as in the IRS

case, the average level of productiviry rises with liberalization.

      gnthuaiaam for such arguments, however, has to be tempered by realisa ahnur

marker circumstances in developing countries.        In practice, fricrionless entry

and exit are likely to be the exception rather than the rule.        Exit is

                                                                          in
particularly problematic, as it implies a well-developed secondary market

capital equipment: if firms cannot dismantle and sell their operations- -in other

words, if capital is sunk--the productivity benefits of liberalizarion can be

easily canceled.      Firma will not   exr   until prices fall below average variable

cost, and may not even do so then if they are cross-subsidized by affiliates in

other sectors.      On the other aide of the ledger, depreciation of machinery and

equipment may provide a natural form of exit over rime.         Market charades aside,

where        is the (exogenous) world price, A is the Lagrange multiplier for the

capacity constraint, and Md and Mx are the respective multipliers for the non-

negativity constraints.              The first-order condition for exports is:



(21)    p    -   c   -
                         A+PxO•
We can now distinguish two cases.                   In the first,   p<    c so    exports would nor

even cover marginal costs.              Then       x > 0 and    — 0.    But when       p     c,   exports

are worthwhile             —   0),   so that the firm increases its export sales all the way

until the capacity constraint is hit and A > o.20

       Notice that the firm's export incentives are not adversely affected by

circumstances in the domestic market, and in particular by the extent of trade

protection.          If anything, trade protection is conducive to exports in the

following sense: protection allows the firm to make some excess profits at home

which can be used to cover its fixed costs; exports then become attractive even

if the world price is           aw      the firm's average cost (case two above).

Protection allows some exports in a sector where, in the absence of proroctioc,

there may nnr have been any domestic production to begin with.

       When we relax the assumption of constant marginal costs, the case for

protection becomes even stronger.                    Suppose that IRS rakes the form of decreasing

marginal costs.           Now protection allows the home firm to increase irs domestic

sales, and therefore to reduce its marginal cost.                      With a lower marginal cost,



20. This assumes that the firm finds it profitable to produce in the home
marker.
                                          -27-

the firm can become more competitive in world markets, and therefore increase

its exports as well,       This is Krugman's (1984) model of   import protection as

export promotion"     The sheltered home market provides the domestic firm with

the cost savings needed to compete with larger rivals in world markets.        Notice

that this is a vision diametrically opposed to the one where free entry crowds

in too many firms operating at high cost.        Which story one believes in depends

on one's priors regarding the ease of entry and exit and the effectiveness of

entry restrictions imposed by governments.



VI.   Concluding Remarks

       My objective in this paper was to identify some of the arguments commonly

made regarding the trade-productivity nexus, and to hold them to the analytical

          I have argued that many of these arguments lack coherence.      We are far
light.

from having any systematic theories which link trade policy to technical

efficiency.    In particular, we do not have any good reason to expect that trade

liberalization will generally be helpful to overall technological performance.

       The usual call for more empirical evidence is perhaps more appropriate in

this instance than in any other.       As more countries experiment with trade

                                                                 The challenge.

becomes tempting to credit the improved productivity performance to trade

policy.

     Until more evidence becomes available, then,   a healthy skepticism is in

order.    In the meantime, if truth-in-advertising were to apply to policy advice,

each prescription for trade liberalization would be accompanied with a

disclaimer: "Warning!   Trade liberalization cannot be shown to enhance technical

efficiency; nor has it been empirically demonstrated to do so."
