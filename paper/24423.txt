                                          ABSTRACT

The Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat is arguably the most controversial dam ever built in India,
with over a 100,000 displaced people. Most ousted families in Gujarat were resettled in the late
1980s and early 1990s. All oustees were tribals—a term used in India to cover a list of tribes
viewed as so backward and historically oppressed that the Indian Constitution in 1950 reserved a
quota of seats in education, government jobs, and Parliamentary seats for them. The Gujarat
government promised to offer each male adult in the ousted families above the age of 18 five
acres of land regardless of their earlier forest holdings. Additional compensation was to be given
for loss of houses and livestock. Despite the continuing opposition to the dam from influential
NGOs, there is no systematic empirical study of its effects on the long-term wellbeing of the
ousted families. Our study investigates: Are resettled oustees from the Sardar Sarovar Dam
project better off in 2017, approximately three decades after resettlement, than their former
neighbours who were not ousted?

We carried out a survey of a randomly selected sample of outsted families (treatment group) and
a randomly selected sample of their former neighbors who lived in high areas that would remain
above water when the reservoir rises to its maximum height and therefore were allowed to stay
(comparison group). We found that, despite implementation glitches, those displaced were far
better off than their former forest neighbours in ownership of a range of assets including TVs,
cellphones, vehicles, access to schools and hospitals, and agricultural markets. The gap in asset
ownership and other outcomes between the treatment and comparison groups were often
statistically larger if the heads of the household were illiterate compared to the gap if they were
literate. This finding suggests that resettlement helped vulnerable groups more than the less
vulnerable and that fears that resettlement will destroy the lives and life-styles of tribals have
been grossly exaggerated.

We also found that 54% of displaced folk wished to return to their old habitat, showing that
nostalgia for ancestral land can matter more than onweship of assets and economic wellbeing.
Nearby undisplaced forest dwellers were asked if they would like to be "forcibly" resettled with
the full compensation package. Of two forest groups, 31% and 52% said yes. Clearly many,
though not all, tribesfolk yearn to leave the forest.

Introduction

        The Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat is arguably the most controversial dam ever built in
India, with over a 100,000 displaced people. All oustees were tribals--- a term used in India to
cover a list of tribes viewed as so backward and historically oppressed that, as a measure of
affirmative action, the Indian Constitution in 1950 reserved a quota of seats in education,
government jobs, and Parliamentary seats for them. A number of activists led by Medha Patkar
have long claimed that, despite land and other forms of compensation, the tribals forced to move
will be worse off, and will suffer social ostracism and humiliation in the resettlement villages
(Patkar,1995, 2017, Baviskar, 1995, 1997, Hakim, 1997). Others like the Morse Commission set
up by the World Bank expressed concerns that tribal communities engaged in subsistence
agriculture in forests would not be able to cope with the shift to market oriented farming in
resettlement areas; that they would get entangled in debt cycles, losing land to money-lenders or
local landowners, and that, overall, resettlement would render a serious blow to their tribal
customs and ways of life (Morse and Berger, 1992).1

         Most tribals in Gujarat were resettled in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The Gujarat
government promised to offer each male adult above the age of 18 five acres of land regardless
of their earlier forest holdings which, from the Forest Department’s viewpoint, was largely
encroached and not legally owned land. Additional compensation was to be given for loss of
houses and livestock. The government identified large expanse of land in the command area of
the project where farmers (mostly of the dominant Patel caste) were willing to sell. With the help
of NGOs, tribal groups were shown the available areas and given the right to choose
compensatory land.

        Would the oustees have been better off had there been no dam? Despite the continuing
debates on how dams affect the wellbeing of ousted populations, there is little systematic
research to answer this question. Investigating how resettlement impacted the lives of the
oustees three decades after the event is not an easy task. Besides lack of comparable pre- and
post-resettlement data on the oustees, there are challenges in parsing out the effect of
resettlement from the effects of other events and developments that influenced their lives since
resettlement.

        We adopt a novel approach that involves comparing the living conditions of resettled
tribals with tribals living in semi-evacuated villages. The semi-evacuated villages have partially
submerged areas (in low-lying areas) and areas partly above water (in higher areas) that will
remain above water when the reservoir rises to its maximum height. Tribal families in the higher
areas therefore have not been forced to move. This becomes a natural comparison group for the

 Several other groups expressed similar concerns. A publication from the Third World Network, Malaysia
notes, “Besides displacement, this will affect the tribals’ very culture and basis of their livelihood, their beliefs,
myths and rituals, their festivals, songs and dances, all closely associated with the hills, woods and streams. As these
disintegrate in their new harsh surroundings, so too will the joy of their existence.” (Alvares & Billorey, 1987).


                                                                                                                      3
tribals who were forced to move. We also study the wellbeing of a third group of tribals in
villages within 15-20 kilometers radius of the project affected area, who therefore have some
knowledge of the resettlement package and its implementation. For convenience, we call this
group interior villages.

         We study the living conditions and wellbeing of the three groups - oustees, households in
semi-submerged villages, and households in the interior villages - on multiple dimensions
including, asset ownership, housing and living conditions, occupation, agricultural practices,
awareness and utilization of government programs and services -- to investigate if the resettled
tribals are better- or worse-off compared to the other two groups.

         Our survey also collected data on oustees’ views on resettlement and how it impacted
their religious practices, rituals and customs, attire and experience of resettlement. Further, we
asked the resettled families whether they agreed or disagreed with the following statement. “If
the government offers the exact amount of land you had earlier in the higher un-submerged part
of your old village in exchange for the land you have today, you will accept it.” Likewise, we
asked respondents in semi-evacuated and interior villages to rank their agreement with the
following statement: “I would be willing to give up my land, livestock and accept the
government’s rehabilitation package today.” We believe this is a unique approach and can
inform ongoing debates of the effects of resettlement that have generally been carried out
without actual or updated data on the experience and opinions of tribals themselves.

Previous Research

         Most studies on the effect resettlement of oustees in the Narmada Valley have been
conducted in the 1980s and early 1990s and focus on the process of resettlement or the well-
being of the oustees soon after resettlement (Baviskar, 1995, 1997, Hakim, 1997, Bhatia, 1997).
Many of these studies raise doubts about the success of resettlement on grounds that tribals have
life styles that cannot be replicated in resettled areas or that tribal attitudes and expectations,
agricultural and cultural practices make them unfit for non-tribal lifestyles, and therefore,
resettlement will not succeed. Others had a more positive attitude towards resettlement, as
summarized in Vidyut Joshi’s remark. “When someone says that the tribals have a different
culture and that their culture must be preserved, it is a denial of their right for development”
(Joshi, 1997).

       A weakness of many previous studies is that they do not distinguish between transitional
and long-term effects, and tend to highlight the transitional ones. Whatever the uses of that
approach, it does not address how the ousted tribals have fared in the long term, the issue that we
address in our survey. Nor have earlier studies asked undisplaced tribals if they would like to
move and be resettled with the government’s compensation package.




                                                                                                     4
Survey Design

        We surveyed a randomly selected sample of 401 tribal households resettled in 25 large
villages (the sample size would be too small, sometimes just one household, in smaller
resettlements). Our power analysis showed that a sample size of 400 will have a sampling error
of ±4.2% at 95% confidence interval.2 Based on this analysis, we determined the sample sizes of
the three groups.

        Similar sized random samples were taken, each, from four semi-evacuated villages3 and
nine interior villages. The sample of oustee households was representative of the two
rehabilitation phases (phase 1: mostly 1980-1983, completed by 1989 and phase 2: 1989-1995)
and tribal groups. We obtained the list of oustees from the Sardar Sarovar Punarvasvat Agency,
the resettlement agency (SSPA) from which a representative random sample of oustee
households was drawn.

       We used the voter list from the Election Commission for the families in the semi-
evacuated and interior villagers and drew random samples of each group. The survey was
contracted out to Karvy Insights and conducted in May-June 2017.

        Karvy Insights also conducted a qualitative study that included in depth interviews with
key stakeholders and focus group discussions with ousted families, families in semi-evacuated,
and interior villages. We report its main findings in the Results section here.

        One characteristic of the interior villages is that two of them (30% of the sample) are
located near mines developed by the Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation. GMDC has
built medical and other infrastructural facilities from which the villagers benefited. Three other
villages (39% of the sample) received drinking water and several other facilities from the Sardar
Sarovar Project. This gives some interior villagers an advantage in some respects and makes
them a somewhat inappropriate group for comparison. We therefore present and discuss results
for the ousted families and families in the semi-submerged areas. The results for the interior
villages are presented in the appendix.

    In sample surveys, an error of 5-7% is considered normal.

    Of the six partially sub-merged villages, two had no residents at the time of the survey.

evacuated villages respectively, the ownership of bicycles was 65% and 31%; of two-wheelers
was 61% and 31%; and of mobile phones was 88% and 59%. Similar patterns were evident for a


                                                                                                                               6
host of other assets (TVs, four-wheelers, sewing machine, gas and cable connections). As many
as 96% of the resettled families had bank accounts compared 74% families in semi-submerged
villages. There is a similar pattern in asset ownership between ousted families and families in the
interior villages (Appendix Table 1).

        One source of difference between the treatment and comparison groups could arise on
account of their characteristics such as literacy levels and occupation. These differences could be
an effect of the resettlement process. For instance, on account of the resettlement program, the
resettled families were more likely to own land and therefore engaged in self-cultivation whereas
those in semi-evacuated villages were more likely to be marginal farmers or agriculture workers.

        To investigate if differences in asset ownership were associated with age and educational
attainment of the respondent, we also estimated the gap in asset ownership after controlling for
the age (controlling for age and age-squared in the model) and literacy levels of the respondent,
and the estimated differences were similar to those reported.

        It is often argued that modernization adversely affects forest tribes because it devastates
traditional culture and lifestyle, dupes simple tribal folks with little understanding of markets or
prices, and destroys their habitat. If this were indeed true, illiterate oustees (who would be more
vulnerable to getting duped) would benefit less from resettlement than literate oustees. Our
estimates show that the very opposite is true (Table 1, columns IV to X). The improvement in
asset ownership between resettled and semi-evacuated villagers was far greater for illiterate
households than literate ones. We repeated this analysis using models that controlled for the age
of the respondent and results were similar to those reported in Table 1, columns VI and IX.
These results confirm that illiterates, the least sophisticated and least conversant with
modernization, gained more from resettlement than literates.

         The resettled families lived in houses with superior construction (Table 2, columns I to
III). They were more likely to live in brick/cement (semi-permanent/permanent) houses with
cement walls and concrete roofs than villagers in the two other groups (also see Appendix Table
2). The resettled families were more likely to have electricity, drinking and running water than
those in semi-submerged villages. Here too we find that the gaps in housing type and access to
utilities persist after controlling for age (included as a quadratic function) and literacy. Here too,
illiterates have gained much more from resettlement than literates.

        Counter-intuitively, literate families in the semi-submerged areas were more likely to
have access to running and drinking water than literate resettled families. This could be because
a large proportion of families in semi-submerged villages had private tube wells on account of
lack of access to canal water, an issue we explore below. Among the illiterates, on the other
hand, access to running and drinking water was higher for the resettled. One possible explanation
(documented below) is that a larger number of literate households in semi-submerged areas had
private tube wells compared to illiterate households.

     Occupation

             “The most serious threat to achievement of resettlement and rehabilitation policies may
     well lie in entanglement in debt cycles, and the resultant loss of land to money lenders or local
     landowners.” (Morse and Berger, 1992; Sardar Sarovar: Report of the Independent Review)

             The survey findings in Table 3 render baseless the concerns of many activists as well as
     the World Bank Independent Review (Morse report) about the ability of oustees to keep the
     government allocated land. Three decades after they were ousted, the resettled families were
     primarily landowners (85.2%) and engaged in farming. Only 6.4% reported that they were
     engaged in jobs outside farming, and these would include those who were below the age of 18
     when resettled, and hence got no land. Resettled villagers were mostly landowners engaged in
     self-cultivation (83%) or tenant cultivation (3%) and a small minority (4%) were agricultural
     laborers/ marginal farmers, the lowest occupational category in India. Land ownership was
     substantially less among families in semi-submerged (65%) and interior villages (58%) who
     were much more likely to work as agricultural laborers/marginal farmers (see Appendix Table
     3).

             In qualitative interviews, some resettled families reported leasing out their land and
     working as laborers because the land they received was of poor quality or because of water
     scarcity (Das, 2017). In town hall meetings and one-on-one interviews, we also came across
     oustees who leased in additional land for cultivation. One oustee family that owns 15 acres of


                                                                                                                                    9
land leased in an additional 25 acres of land for cultivation and another family that owns 7.5
acres leased in an additional 10 acres for cultivation.

          In the semi-evacuated villages, a surprising finding was that illiterates had a higher
proportion of landowners than literates. The reason is unclear, but might reflect more aggressive
encroachment (later regularized by the government) on the part of illiterates. Only 1.8% of the
illiterate resettled villagers were dependent on agriculture labor compared to 23.1% of illiterate
respondents in semi-evacuated villages.

        The resettled families differed from the families in semi-submerged villages in terms of
their agricultural practices (Table 4). The semi-evacuated groups grew mostly coarse grains and
toor dal (a kind of lentil) that do not require expensive purchased inputs (like fertilizers and


                                                                                                                           11
pesticides) or irrigation. The resettled villagers had substantially larger areas under crops
requiring expensive purchased inputs and irrigation (paddy and cotton). They were more likely to
own tractors and threshers. There is a similar difference in agricultural practices between ousted
families and families in the interior villages (Appendix Table 4).

         The ownership of private tube wells among the oustees was limited (Table 4). One reason
is that the oustees had more access to canal irrigation, and therefore they did not require private
tubewells. The resettled villagers were also more likely to use pesticides/insecticides, fertilizers,
and manure than the semi-evacuated group.

        While resettled villagers were more likely to own milch animals (which are relatively
expensive and yield a high return), semi-submerged villagers were more likely to own
sheep/goats and poultry (which are relatively cheap and so yield a relatively lower return) (Table
5). The resettled villagers had a lower ownership of bullocks than the semi-submerged villages,
indicating greater tractorisation and less reliance on ploughing by bullocks. Many activists have
highlighted the adverse impact of lost grazing grounds for the oustees. This does show up in the
lower ownership of sheep and goats of resettled villagers. But the ownership of milch cows is
higher for oustees, suggesting that access to cattle feed and milk markets is, at least for many
families, more important than access to forest grazing.

Access to Government Facilities/Schemes

      Table 6 shows that 99% of the resettled sample reported that they had access to schools
compared to 51% of the villagers in the semi-submerged villages. Improved access was huge for


                                                                                                                                  12
illiterates (up from 31.8% to 98.2%), and moderate for literates (up from 94.4% to 99.6%). The
resettled sample also had greater access to public health centers and hospitals compared to the
semi-submerged sample, and here again the illiterates gained more than the literates.
Interestingly, of the three groups the interior villages had the highest access to public healthcare
centers, hospitals, and community centers/panchayat offices (Appendix Table 6). Upon further
investigation, we found that this was because of the proximity of interior villages to the Gujarat
Mineral Development Corporation facilities.

        Literate households in semi-submerged villages had greater access to public tubewells
than in resettled villages, possibly because the resettled villages relied on canal water.

Impact on tribal culture and traditions

         “There are social and cultural factors that could well determine the long-term outcome of
the resettlement and rehabilitation program.” (Morse and Berger, 1992; Sardar Sarovar: Report
of the Independent Review)

       Many earlier studies showed substantial difficulties faced by displaced villagers in the
new environments into which resettlement thrust them (Baviskar, 1995, 1997, Hakim, 1997).
Our survey suggests that the long-run outcomes have been far more satisfactory, and transitional
problems have substantially been overcome. The vast majority of resettled villagers said they


                                                                                                                                     13
were able to adjust to new conditions within a few years, had harmonious relations with the
higher-caste folk in the new villages where they were relocated, and had not suffered
discrimination or hostility (Table 7). A minority disagreed, so there were differing opinions.
More tribals than not agreed with the proposition “At times we feel that we have been socially
cut-off and uprooted after moving out of the dam affected area.” In one-on-one interviews with
the researchers, the resettled tribals mentioned that the first two years after resettlement were
often difficult because they had to learn new techniques of growing crops like paddy. But within
one or two years, they learned the techniques from local neighbors, in particular from local
landless laborers, and which they applied to get better yields. Their transition period to modern
agriculture was short and relatively smooth, contrary to the dismal predictions of critics (see
section on qualitative study).

        What was the impact of resettlement on the religious practices, customs and rituals of the
ousted families? Our survey results show that, three decades after resettlement, 60% of the
oustee families said that rehabilitation had no effect on their religious practices, 56% said their
traditional customs and rituals have remained unaffected. A majority, 58%, said that there was
no change in their social status, suggesting that they had not been forced down the social ladder
by upper castes in the host villages where they were resettled. A significant minority (22%)
disagreed (Table 7).

        Earlier researchers reported damaging impacts of resettlement on religious practices,
traditional customs and social status (see studies in Dr� ze et al., 1997). They focused on
transitional impacts, whereas our research shows that long-term outcomes were far more
favorable. Consider the following passage from a book review of a 1997 book containing papers
on the Narmada resettlement by distinguished academics and activists. “The evidence provided
by several papers suggests that the existing experience of rehabilitation has almost entirely been
an unhappy one… All these studies show that there are a wide variety of benefits that cannot be
replaced in the new sites to which people are shifted-e.g., a sense of community, which
concretely manifests itself in mutual labor arrangements; loss of access to common property
resources (forests, grazing grounds, rivers); and loss of encroached land which often formed a
major portion of land cultivated as against the land to which people had legal title. Other
common issues highlighted are changes in the status of women, even as their daily tasks like
grinding may become easier; increasing monetization and tenuous relations to "host" villages.”
(p. 230, Sundar, 1999).

        The problem with this analysis is that it focuses entirely on losses from change while
saying absolutely nothing on the gains. Indeed, this book review ignores even those chapters in
the book that show resettlement in a more favorable light. Likewise, many other critics seem to
attach little or no importance to the fact that forest tribals have far less access to schools,
healthcare, roads, electricity, jobs, and the many comforts of modern life. Vidyut Joshi, one of
the authors in the book, emphasizes that to say tribals are different and must not be disturbed is
to deny them the right to development.

        Views on the social impact of resettlement were statistically the same among young and
old respondents, but varied significantly by literacy levels of the respondent (Appendix Table 7).
The literate respondents were more likely to agree (and less likely to disagree) that their religious
practices, traditional customs and rituals were unaffected after resettlement. They were also less
likely to agree that inter-caste marriages and dowry increased after resettlement.




                                                                                                    15
Given a choice, would they like to go back?

         The resettled villagers were asked whether, given the choice, they would prefer to go
back to their old villages with the same land they had earlier (Table 8). A majority (54%) said
they would like to go back. This shows that material possessions are not the only criteria for
location preference: nostalgia and attachment to the land of ancestors and sacred forest sites can
be more important. Activists may argue that the main reason for wanting to return is access to
forest resources (grazing, fruit, herbs, firewood), but our data show that in material terms those
in the forest are worse off, so those who want to go back probably have non-material priorities.
The semi-evacuated and interior villagers were asked whether, given the option of getting the
resettlement compensation package, they would like to move. In the semi-evacuated areas, 31%
wanted to move, 53% wanted to stay, and the rest gave no opinion. Those wanting to move were
more likely to be young (under 40). In the interior areas, a majority (52%) wanted to move, 35%
wanted to stay and 13% voiced no opinion. In the interior villages, those wanting to move were
more likely to be older (over 40). Clearly significant proportions of tribal groups, and in some
cases a majority, want to leave the forests and join the mainstream.




                                                                                                16

Qualitative Study

        In town hall meetings and detailed interviews, resettled families painted a rosier picture
of the impact of resettlement than revealed in the quantitative survey. The resettled villages were
better connected than the original villages and had better facilities including schools, hospitals,
banks, electricity and water.

        While response varied across villages, the qualitative report describes the opportunities
and constraints as follows: “There appear to be far better facilities in the treatment group villages
than in the earlier villages. Often support network was present as people belonged to the same
community. Education and livelihood opportunities were better. Girls could also study and learn
to use computers. Both boys and girls went to college and literacy rate went up in most villages.
There were better livelihood opportunities as well. Good milk output was another common
output which was sold to the local dairy. Farming income doubled in most resettled areas
because of fertile land and availability of irrigation facilities.” (Das, 2017).

        “While most people had a better standard of living, a few missed the access they had to
the nearby forest in their original place of settlement. Be it agricultural land, wood, fodder,
natural resources for them and also grazing fields for their cattle.” (Das, 2017).

        Possibly the qualitative study was able to capture certain aspects of living that survey
interviews missed. We believe the difference may also reflect the fact that respondents were
more out-spoken and candid in one-on-one interviews and surveys conducted in privacy than in
town hall meetings in the presence of other members of their community as well as NGO
representatives.

Complaints

        In one-on-one interviews, many resettled villagers had a variety of complaints.
Government officials said the complaints cover approximately 7 percent of the oustees. The
biggest grievance was that of men who were below the age of 18 in the cut-off year of
resettlement, and so got no land whereas their older brothers and fathers got five acres each.
Those who complain about not receiving land on account of the 18+ cut-off, believe that if they
had remained in the jungle, they would have been able to capture enough land to meet their need
for cultivation. Many said they had not gotten jobs as promised. Some complained that they did
not get grazing land for their animals and some complained about water and land quality
problems.

       Most resettled tribals mentioned that they appreciate the ease of tribal life, and still
remember the stress of leaving their ancestral lands. Nostalgia about the life left behind,
including access to forest resources, continues to linger.



                                                                                                   18
         Our study is limited to resettlement of Gujarat oustees. It does not cover resettlement of
oustees from Maharashtra of Madhya Pradesh (numbering approximately 4,000 and 38,000
families respectively), who were mostly resettled in their own states (though a limited number
opted to be resettled in Gujarat). According to most reports, Gujarat has been more successful in
resettlement than the other two states. Agitations of dissatisfied tribals from all three states are
still continuing three decades after displacement.

       We restricted our study to project affected families in Gujarat for several reasons. First,
we had budget constraints. Second, it made sense to focus on the claims of the state that was
reputed to have done best. Third, comparable groups (to test the counterfactual) were easily
available in Gujarat.

Conclusion

       Our study has three major conclusions. First, Gujarat has demonstrated that it is entirely
possible to implement rehabilitation packages that leave the oustees substantially better off in
material terms. The dire predictions of anti-dam activists were hugely exaggerated. Despite
many grievances of the oustees and shortcomings in implementation, the Gujarat government
has, overall, ensured higher living standards for oustees. This sets an example for other states,
whose performance has sometimes been terrible.

         Second, the study disproves the claim of activists (and the Morse Commission report)
that tribals have such a different ethos and lifestyle that they will be devastated and impoverished
if shifted to mainstream villages. Ownership of cellphones, bank accounts, and Aadhar cards is
close to universal in the resettled villages. Our survey documents that tribals have adjusted and
prospered. Far from losing their land to the Patels (land owning caste), as predicted by the
Morse Committee and several activists, a number of oustees have leased land from the Patels to
expand their cultivated area. The argument that the tribals will not be able to transition from
subsistence agriculture to commercial cropping has also been disproved by our survey. More
than half the respondents in our resettled sample grew cash crops and a vast majority (close to
90%) used pesticides or chemical fertilizers.

        Third, any blanket statement about the ethos and attitudes of tribals is unwarranted---they
exhibit a wide spectrum of views on changes after resettlement, and whether they would prefer
the forest or the mainstream. While the thesis that tribals should be protected from modernization
looks weak, the willingness of over half the resettled villagers to return to their old forest habitat,
despite being materially better off, shows that forced resettlement places considerable stress on
oustees, so great care is needed to design rehabilitation packages that alleviate the economic and
social stress.
