     A large body of empirical   work   has derriorfstrated that higher   inflation,
especially when it is unexpected, leads to greater dispers.ior in the

distribution of price changes across subaggregates, A sparse and more recent

literature suggests exactly the opposite effects on the distribution of wage

changes. This study first    reconciles   these apparently opposite results usinc

a model in which shocks to the econom> can affect both wages and prices and

the demand for indexing. If the positive effect of shocks on the demand for

indexing is sufficiently large, the dispersion of changes in wages or prices

will be reduced even though the shocks' direct effect is to incr-ease this

dispersion. Impl icitly from the evidence, this offset is large enough in

wage—setting, but not so large in price determination.

     Additional evidence on the relationship between inflation and the

dispersion of wage changes is provided by empirical i.iork for 14 israeli

manufacturing industries, 156—82. The results suggest that in Israel, Just as

in the United States (on which previous work has been conducted) with its much

less rapid and variable inflation, dispersion also decreased with unexpected
price inflation.

I. Introduction

       The relation between inflation and relative price variability has

received increasing attention in recent years. Several authors have found

that increased relative price variability is associated with increases in

unanticipated inflation (Parks, 1978; Fischer, 1982; Cukierman and Wachtel,

1982, to name a few). The apparent pervasiveness of this phenomenon across

countries (see, for example, Cukierman and Leiderman, 1981, for discussion of

the Israeli experience) has led to a wide acceptance of the view that this

positive correlation is (to use Friedman's terminology) an empirical

"regularity" of economic systems.    1
       Hamermesh (1986) has considered the relation between unexpected

inflation and relative wage variability in the United States and found that

the "regularity" does not hold. Increases in unexpected inflation tended to

narrow the dispersion of wage changes across sectors in the period 1955—81.

Allen (1984) finds similar results for the postwar U.S., but finds that

unexpected inflation widened the dispersion of relative wage changes in the

United States before World War II.

       These results raise at least two questions. First, is the narrowing of

wage dispersion in response to inflation unique to the postwar United States,

or is it characteristic of other economies as well, particularly those with

much higher and more variable rates of price inflation? Second, if lower wage

variability is a general result, how might it be consistent with the above

results on price variability? The purpose of this note is to address these

two issues.

II.     A General Framework
          We    begin by setting out a prototype model that can account for both a

positive and a negative relation between inflation and price dispersion,

depending on the nature of the price—setting process. The key question is

whether prices are set before or after an aggregate nominal shock Is

observed. If price and quantity decisions must be made before the realization

of the inflation shock is known, increased unanticipated inflation will

increase relative price dispersion in a model where there is a confusion of

aggregate and relative shocks. If, however, indexing arrangements allow

prices to be adjusted after nominal shocks have been observed, a higher mean

level of unanticipated inflation (that is, greater inflation uncertainty) may

increase the degree of indexing and reduce price dispersion. In short, the

effect of inflation on the dispersion of wage or price changes depends on the

nature of price—setting——whether prices are set ex ante or ex post the

realization of aggregate nominal shocks——and how inflation changes the nature

of price—setting arrangements.

          Let demand and supply for good I be log—linear of the form:



(1)            y(I) (I)                 -
                                            p(i)   +
                                                       aIx -   +



and

               y(I)       =   (i) (p(I) - p(I),
          d           s
where             y(i) are the logarithms of quantity demanded and supplied of

good i,               is log price of good i, p(i) is the perception by individuals

in market I of the general price level, x is an aggregate nominal variable

 (so that the second right—hand side term in (1) can be thought of as a real—

 balance effect), and w(i) is a random (excess) demand shock.

         —
             p(i)   is the locally perceived relative price, so

 that ii(i) and y(i) are demand and supply elasticities (u, ' > 0) ,                   which can
vary across markets. This characteristic is crucial to the results.

          The excess demand shock is assumed normal with mean zero and

variance cy2, and w(i) is uncorrelated over time and across markets. The rate

so that        is that part of Ax which is predictable given information up to

and including t—1 and is assumed known to individuals in all markets. The

innovation          is assumed normal with mean zero and variance a              ,   serially
uncorrelated and independent of w(i) .                   One may note that           will in

general convey information about c and, since relative demand shocks differ

across markets, how the posterior expectation of x varies across markets,

leading to differential expectations about the current general price

level p(i) .        As a reference point we may then solve for the market—clearing

price:




                      cA1[x1 +            + El   —               +          +
                                                     aX]p*(i)

where X =
         i
                             .       This general set—up is almost identical to that used
              i.i(i) +y(i)
in Cukierman and Leiderman (1984).



         We model price—setting and indexing as follows. In each period the
                                                           4




market—clearing price is observed, and the market—clearing quantity is

transacted. Agents may decide that the price actually paid may be adjusted ex

post, after            has been observed. An indexing arrangement then takes the

form:



                       =
                            p(i)   +

            =                 +         + ''    —
                                                    x1p(1)     +     +          + "'       ,




where 3(i) is an indexing parameter in the i'th market.



In the case where no indexing is used, p(i) =                        .   In   the other polar

case, where sector—specific demand shocks are not allowed to influence prices,

(5) becomes:



                       =                +       + [1 —
                                                          aX](i) +
where the first two terms in (5') are known at time t.

        We can now compute the dispersion of equilibrium relative prices under

different assumptions about the weights given to sector—specific demand shocks

and ex—post indexing in setting individual prices. For simplicity, assume

that the degree of indexing is the same across sectors, so that

i) =    3   for all 1.

        The general price level, Pt is a geometric weighted average of

individual prices, namely:



            Pt =   E                        Eu(i) =   1
                           u(i)pt(i);
                   i                        i
                                                      5




where u(i) is the weight of the i'th good. Pt is a function of the
which in turn depend on the expectation of p, namely p(i)                            .   In
equilibrium                 p, and p(i) are determined simultaneously. To find the

solution, we use the method of undetermined coefficients. Since the model is

log—linear, we hypothesize a solution:



            Pt =   it      + •ff2Xt_i   +
                                            r3Et


where the it1   are    to be determined.

          The rational perception of Pt in market i Is:



            p(i) =     E
(8)                        (pjI(1))
                =           +       +
                     it1t     it2xt_1




where I(i)      is the information set in market i             at       t,    which includes

(Remember we are assuming that the market—clearing price is known, even if it

is not the transaction price). Since all other aggregate information (which

is the same across markets) is independent of                       ,    it    is information on Pt(i)

that is crucial In taking the expectation of                            From (4), an observation on

pt(i) is equivalent to an observation on aE(i) + w(i). Given the normality

of       and io(i) , the optimal linear forecast is the least—squares projection

of c on [c + w(i)], yielding:



(9)         E(ctIIt(i)) =
                               - [ct        + u(i)], where 0                         +



We    thus obtain:

Substituting     (ii) into (6), rearranging, and assuming that the number of markets i is

large, one obtains:

Finally, we can compute Pt in equilibrium by substituting (13) into (6) and

recognizing that the sum of terms in w.(i) converges (in probability) to zero:



(4)         Pt t +                tl +             aa + 13

       We   can now compute relative price variability as a function of

unanticipated nominal shocks for a given degree of indexing. One measure of

relative price variability is:

                            )2 and U = [1       —0
              i



Equation (16) summarizes the determinants of relative price variability. The

second term shows that relative price variability depends, naturally, on the

varability of relative excess demand shocks. The first term shows that it

depends on the level of the unanticipated nominal shock (an effect discussed

by Hercowitz, 1981; 1982), with the size of the effect determined by the

extent of indexing. Given i3      ,   a higher mean c2 induces higher price

dispersion.

        How will dispersion be related to 8 for a given realization of                    ?


One immediately notices that for                —   1   ,   increases in 8 will decrease the
effect of given nominal shocks on dispersion. For increased aggregate nominal

uncertainty (as measured by higher mean 2) to decrease relative price

dispersion, it must therefore increase the indexing parameter 8 .                That    is,

for a given 8 higher       clearly increases dispersion. If, however,

higher r2 induces an increase in the degree of indexing 8 ,                dispersion   can

fall.

        The source of an increase in B is not hard to find. If we consider the

variance of a single relative price, we see that it too is related to B

Calling this variance S, we have:
                                                                    8

As long as         is sufficiently small, an increase in 8 (for 8                                  — 1) will

decrease Si, while an increase in a will increase S1. Therefore, If

individual utility is a decreasing function of the price variability of one
                                                                          2
price,   an optimal response to an increase In a is a higher degree of

indexing.

         This model can obviously be extended in a number of ways. Differential

indexing would increase relative price (or wage) dispersion. More complicated

indexing schemes (such as an explicit relation of the degree of indexing to

observed economic variables) would enrich this model. Our purpose here was to

present a model in which the effects of different methods of price—setting

could be studied and the possibility of their different effects on the

dispersion of relative prices and wages be explored.



III. Testing the Dispersion Hypothesis

         The theoretical model suggests that, where indexing is a possibility,

Increases in unanticipated inflation may actually lower dispersion by

increasing the degree of (implicit or explicit) indexing. As an evaluation of

the applicability of these ideas, annual data from the Israeli economy were

used to examine the model describing the variability of relative wage changes

between 1956 and 1982. Data covering 14 manufacturing and mining industries,

accounting for approximately 90 percent of output in these sectors, were
        3'
        —,
used.        With its rapid and highly variable inflation, Israel may be a good
                                         9




example of an economy in which wage—setting is characterized by changes in the

degree of formal, and especially informal indexing as uncertainty about

inflation varies.

       Using the same equation for calculating the variance of relative wage

changes as in Haniermesh (1986), we computed Var (w) as the weighted average of

annual changes in the relative nominal daily wage rates of workers. —4    The

same formula was used to calculate the variance of changes in relative output,

Var(y), with output being measured by the index of industrial production for

each industry.

       The annual inflation rate, p, was calculated as the twelve—month

average of annualized monthly rates of change in the Consumer Price Index in

Israel. Unlike the TJnited States, in which several surveys on expectations

about price inflation exist (and are used in Hamermesh, 1986), no comparable

series exist in Israel. To test the model we thus construct inflation

forecasts based on macro time series. The first forecast uses monthly rates

of inflation to construct ARIt'IA forecasts for one, two, three, etc., up to

twelve months ahead. In each case the most recent seven years of data on

prices were used. Thus, for example, data on monthly inflation rates from

1948—1954 were used to construct an ARIMA forecast of the monthly inflation

rates in 1955. while different ARIMA structures characterized different

seven—year time periods in Israeli inflation in the past 35 years, in most

cases integrated autoregressive processes involving one— and twelve—month lags

had the greatest explanatory power. Thus the series pe was constructed using

these forecasts. Unexpected inflation using this forecast is p —

       The second forecast of inflation is the naive projection of the

previous year's rate of price inflation, p_1. Such a simple forecast may

prove adequate in an economy such as Israel's, in which inflation until the

1980's has seemed to fluctuate randomly on several plateaus between which

there are discrete jumps. Unexpected inflation based on this forecast is p —

p_i.
       The basic data (other than Var y) are shown in Table 1. It is apparent

that, as in the United States, there is no particular trend in Var w. The

series does show substantial variability, but some of the lowest values are

observed in the early 1980s, the years of most rapid inflation in Israeli

history. The forecasts p track the broad trends in inflation fairly well,

but seem to predict poorly the yearly variation in inflation rates in the

early part of the sample period. This is undoubtedly the result of the rapid

annual fluctuations in inflation in the early 1950s and the lack of a

significant trend term In the forecasting equations in that period.

       The estimates of the determinants of Var w are presented in Table 2.

The equations were estimated using the Cochrane—Orcutt adjustment for serial

correlation in the errors. As in Hamermesh's (1986) results for the United

States, increases in the dispersion of output shocks increase the dispersion

of wage changes. As the estimates In the first column show, though, there is

essentially no relation between Var w and the actual rate of price

inflation. In both the United States and Israel, and contrary to the received

wisdom about the effects of price inflation on the dispersion of relative

prices, the data do not Indicate any relation between inflation and relative

wage dispersion.

       As In the United States, however, once the series on price inflation is

decomposed into expected and unexpected components we observe a striking

relationship   between inflation and Var w. Neither of the two inflation
forecasts,   p_1 or pC   ,   has   a significant effect on the dispersion of relative
wage changes. However, In both cases, and especially for the naive forecast,

p_1, unexpected inflation, the deviation of the actual inflation rate from the

forecast, has a negative effect on the dispersion of relative wage changes.

The term representing unexpected inflation is highly significant in the

equation using p_1, and is significantly different from zero at the 90—percent

        Whether the very strong results using the forecast         are more

believable than those using the ARIIIA forecast, e     ,   depends partly on which

forecast predicts annual inflation rates better. Some evidence on this

question is presented in Table 3, showing regressions of the inflation rate on

these forecasts. As the Table makes clear, the R2 is higher for the naive

forecast than for the annualized monthly ARIMA forecast; and the latter does

not add to the explanatory power of the lagged forecast when both are included

in the same regression. We may conclude from this that the results based on

the naive forecast deserve greater attention. —    6

IV.   Conclusions

        In this note we have shown how relative prices and wages are affected

by shocks to relative demand and to the entire economy. We have demonstrated

that their effects depend on whether they also affect the extent of indexing

of price— and/or wage—setting. In particular, if greater absolute shocks to

the economy increase the demand for indexation, those shocks can reduce

dispersion in wage— and/or price—setting. Without any change in indexation,

though, larger shocks will increase dispersion.

       Earlier empirical work has shown that inflationary shocks have

increased the dispersion of relative price changes in the postwar United

States, while decreasing the dispersion of relative wage changes. Similarly,

other work has   demonstrated   that (the much larger) inflationary shocks have

increased the dispersion of relative price changes in Israel. Our empirical

work shows that, as in the United States, those shocks reduce the dispersion

of relative wage changes in Israel. Taken as a whole and in conjunction with

the model set forth here, the results indicate that inflationary shocks induce

workers to seek (formal and informal) indexing to such an extent that

relative—wage variability declines in response to the shock. While shocks may

induce some increase in the indexing of price—setting arrangements, it is

implicitly less extensive, as it is insufficient to offset the positive

effects of the shocks on the observed dispersion in relative prices. The

difference between wage— and price—setting in an environment of inflationary

shocks may perhaps be due to the greater risk aversion of individuals in their

roles as workers than as consumers.

        One should note the finding of Hercowitz (1982). He argued that both
relative price dispersion and unanticipated inflation may be thought of as
endogenous, being driven by, among other things, monetary shocks. He found no
significant correlation between unanticipated money shocks and relative price
variability in postwar U.S. data.
