                                              ABSTRACT

This paper discusses recent economic research that demonstrates that the objectives of price stability
and stabilizing economic activity are often likely to be mutually reinforcing. Thus, the answer to the

         The ultimate purpose of a central bank should be to promote the public good

through policies that foster economic prosperity. Research in monetary economics

describes this purpose by specifying monetary policy objectives in terms of stabilizing

both inflation and economic activity. Indeed, this specification of monetary policy

objectives is exactly what is suggested by the dual mandate that the Congress has given

to the Federal Reserve to promote both price stability and maximum employment.1

         We might worry that, under some circumstances, the objectives of stabilizing

inflation and economic activity could conflict, particularly in the short run. However,

economic research over the past three decades suggests that such conflicts may not, in

fact, be that serious. Indeed, stabilizing inflation and stabilizing economic activity are

mutually reinforcing not only in the long run, but in the short run as well. In this paper, I

would like to outline how economic researchers came to that conclusion, and in so doing,

explain why it is so important to achieve and maintain price stability.



The Long Run

         Both economic theory and empirical evidence indicate that the stabilization of

inflation promotes stronger economic activity in the long run.2 Two principles underlie

that conclusion. The first principle is that low inflation is beneficial for economic

welfare. Rates of inflation significantly above the low levels of recent years can have

serious adverse effects on economic efficiency and hence on output in the long run. The

  The Federal Reserve’s congressional mandate is actually couched in terms of the goals of maximum
employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. However, as I have discussed in Mishkin
(2007a), the mandate is more appropriately interpreted in terms of the dual goals of price stability and
maximum sustainable employment, and this formulation is what is consistent with stabilizing both inflation
and economic activity.
2
  Mishkin (2007c) outlines a set of principles that form the basis of the science of monetary policy that is
currently practiced.


                                                     1
distortions from a moderate to high level of long-run inflation are many. High inflation

can cause confusion among households and firms, thereby distorting savings and

investment decisions (Lucas, 1972; Briault, 1995; Shafir, Diamond, and Tversky, 1997).

The interaction of inflation and the tax code, which is often applied to nominal income,

can have adverse effects, especially on the incentive of firms to invest in productive

capital (Feldstein, 1997). Infrequent nominal price adjustment implies that high inflation

results in distorted relative prices, thereby leading to an inefficient allocation of resources

(Woodford, 2003). And high inflation distorts the financial sector as firms and

households demand greater protection from inflation’s erosion of the value of cash

holdings (English, 1999).

         The second principle is the lack of a long-run tradeoff between unemployment

and the inflation rate. Rather, the long-run Phillips curve is vertical, implying that the

economy gravitates to some natural rate of unemployment in the long run no matter what

the rate of inflation is (Friedman, 1968; Phelps, 1968). 3 The natural rate, in turn, is

determined by the structure of labor and product markets, including elements such as the

ease with which people who lose their jobs can find new employment and the pace at

which technological progress creates new industries and occupations while shrinking or

eliminating others. Importantly, those structural features of the economy are outside the

control of monetary policy. As a result, any attempt by a central bank to keep

unemployment below the natural rate would prove fruitless. Such a strategy would only


3
  The deleterious effects of inflation on economic efficiency imply that the level of sustainable employment
may even be higher at lower rates of inflation. Thus, the goals of price stability and high employment are
likely to be complementary, rather than competing, and so there is no policy tradeoff between the goals of
price stability and maximum sustainable employment. A further possibility is that low inflation may even
help increase the rate of economic growth. Although time-series studies of individual countries and cross-
national comparisons of growth rates are not in total agreement (Anderson and Gruen, 1995), the consensus
has developed that inflation is detrimental to economic growth, particularly when inflation rates are high.


                                                     2
lead to higher inflation that, as the first principle suggests, would lower economic activity

and household welfare in the long run.

        Empirical evidence has starkly demonstrated the adverse effects of high inflation

(e.g., see the surveys in Fischer, 1993, and Anderson and Gruen, 1995). In most

industrialized countries, the late 1960s to early 1980s was a period during which inflation

rose to high levels while economic activity stagnated. While many factors contributed to

the improved economic performance of recent decades, policymakers’ focus on low and

stable inflation was likely an important factor.4



The Short Run

        Although there is no long-run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation, in

the short run, expansionary monetary policy that raises inflation can lower

unemployment and raise employment. That is, the short-run Phillips curve is not vertical.

That fact would seem to suggest that achieving the dual goals of price stability and

maximum sustainable employment might at times conflict. However, several lines of

research provide support for the view that stabilization of inflation and economic activity

can be complementary rather than in conflict.

        Economists have long recognized that some sources of economic fluctuations

imply that output stability and inflation stability are mutually reinforcing. Consider a

negative shock to aggregate demand (such as a decline in consumer confidence) that

causes households to cut spending. The drop in demand leads, in turn, to a decline in


4
 Cogley and Sargent (2001, 2005), Boivin and Giannoni (2006), and Kiley (2007a) provide evidence that
monetary policy that stabilized inflation played an important role in stabilizing real activity. However,
Primiceri (2005) and Sims and Zha (2006) argue that “good luck” from a reduction in the volatility of
shocks was more important in stabilizing output.


                                                    3
actual output relative to its potential—that is, the level of output that the economy can

produce at the maximum sustainable level of employment. As a result of increased slack

in the economy, future inflation will fall below levels consistent with price stability, and

the central bank will pursue an expansionary policy to keep inflation from falling. The

expansionary policy will then result in an increase in demand that boosts output toward

its potential to return inflation to a level consistent with price stability. Stabilizing output

thus stabilizes inflation and vice versa under these conditions.

        For example, the Federal Reserve reduced its target for the federal funds rate a

total of 5-1/2 percentage points during the 2001 recession; that stimulus not only

contributed to economic recovery but also helped to avoid an unwelcome decline in

inflation below its already low level. At other times, a tightening of the stance of

monetary policy has prevented the economy from overheating and generating a boom-

bust cycle in the level of employment as well as an undesirable upward spurt of inflation.

        One critical precondition for effective central-bank easing in response to adverse

demand shocks is anchored long-run inflation expectations. Otherwise, lowering short-

term interest rates could raise inflation expectations, which might lead to higher, rather

than lower, long-term interest rates, thereby depriving monetary policy of one of its key

transmission channels for stimulating the economy. The role of expectations illustrates

two additional basic principles of monetary policy that help explain why stabilizing

inflation helps stabilize economic activity: First, expectations of future policy actions

and accompanying economic conditions play a crucial role in determining the effects of

current policy actions on the economy. Second, monetary policy is most effective when

the central bank is firmly committed, through its actions and statements, to a “nominal




                                               4
anchor”—such as to keeping inflation low and stable. A strong commitment to

stabilizing inflation helps anchor inflation expectations so that a central bank will not

have to worry that expansionary policy to counter a negative demand shock will lead to a

sharp rise in expected inflation—a so-called inflation scare (Goodfriend, 1993, 2005).

Such a scare would not only blunt the effects of lower short-term interest rates on real

activity but would also push up actual inflation in the future. Thus, a strong commitment

to a nominal anchor enables a central bank to react more aggressively to negative demand

shocks and, therefore, to prevent rapid declines in employment or output.

       Unlike demand shocks, which drive inflation and economic activity in the same

direction and thus present policymakers with a clear signal for how to adjust policy,

supply shocks, such as the increases in the price of energy that we have been

experiencing lately, drive inflation and output in opposite directions. In this case,

because tightening monetary policy to reduce inflation can lead to lower output, the goal

of stabilizing inflation might conflict with the goal of stabilizing economic activity.

       Here again, a strong, previously established commitment to stabilizing inflation

can help stabilize economic activity, because supply shocks, such as a rise in relative

energy prices, are likely to have only a temporary effect on inflation in such

circumstances. When inflation expectations are well anchored, the central bank does not

necessarily need to raise interest rates aggressively to keep inflation under control

following an aggregate supply shock. Hence, the commitment to price stability can help

avoid imposing unnecessary hardship on workers and the economy more broadly.

       The experience of recent decades supports the view that a substantial conflict

between stabilizing inflation and stabilizing output in response to supply shocks does not




                                              5
arise if inflation expectations are well anchored. The oil shocks in the 1970s caused large

increases in inflation not only through their direct effects on household energy prices but

also through their “second round” effects on the prices of other goods that reflected, in

part, expectations of higher future inflation. Sharp economic downturns followed, driven

partly by restrictive monetary policy actions taken in response to the inflation outbreaks.

In contrast, the run-up in energy prices since 2003 has had only modest effects on

inflation for other goods; as a result, monetary policy has been able to avoid responding

precipitously to higher oil prices. More generally, the period from the mid-1960s to the

early 1980s was one of relatively high and volatile inflation; at the same time, real

activity was very volatile. Since the early 1980s, central banks have put greater weight

on achieving low and stable inflation, while during the same period, real activity

stabilized appreciably. Many factors were likely at work, but this experience suggests

that inflation stabilization does not have to come at the cost of greater volatility of real

activity; in fact, it suggests that, by anchoring inflation expectations, low and stable

inflation is an important precondition for macroeconomic stability.

       Research over the past decade using so-called New Keynesian models has added

further support to the proposition that inflation stabilization may contribute to stabilizing

employment and output at their maximum sustainable levels. This research has also led

to a deeper understanding of the benefits of price stability and the setting of monetary

policy in response to changes in economic activity and inflation.

       In particular, research has emphasized the interaction between stabilizing inflation

and economic activity and has found that price stability can contribute to overall

economic stability in a range of circumstances. The intuition that leads to the conclusion




                                               6
that stabilizing inflation promotes maximum sustainable output and employment is

simple, and it holds in a range of economic models whose policy prescriptions have been

dubbed the New Neoclassical Synthesis. To begin, the prices of many goods and services

adjust infrequently. Accordingly, under general price inflation, the prices of some goods

and services are changing while other prices do not, thus distorting relative prices

between different goods and services. As a consequence, the profitability of producing

the various goods and services no longer reflects the relative social costs of producing

them, which in turn yields an inefficient allocation of resources. A policy of price

stability minimizes those inefficiencies (Goodfriend and King, 1997; Rotemberg and

Woodford, 1997; Woodford, 2003).

       There are several subtleties here. First, in some circumstance, relative prices

should change. For example, the rapid technological advances in the production of

information-technology goods witnessed over the past decades mean that the prices of

these goods relative to other goods and services should decline, because fewer economic

resources are required for their production. Conversely, shifts in the balance between

global demand for, and supply of, oil require that relative prices change to achieve an

appropriate reallocation of resources—in this case, the reduced use of expensive energy.

Thus, the policy prescription from the New Neoclassical synthesis refers to stability of

the price level as a whole, not to the stability of each individual price.

       Second, the New Neoclassical Synthesis suggests that only those prices that move

sluggishly, referred to as sticky prices, should be stabilized. Indeed, these models

indicate that monetary policy should try to get the economy to operate at the same level

that would prevail if all prices were flexible—that is, at the so-called natural rate of




                                               7
output or employment. Stabilizing sticky prices helps the economy get close to the

theoretical flexible-price equilibrium because it keeps sticky prices from moving away

from their appropriate relative level while flexible prices are adjusting to their own

appropriate relative level. The New Neoclassical Synthesis, therefore, does not suggest

that headline inflation, in which the weight on flexible prices is larger, should be

stabilized. For example, to the extent that households directly consume energy goods

with flexible prices, such as gasoline, headline inflation should be allowed to increase in

response to an oil price shock. At the same time, insofar as energy enters as an input in

the production of goods whose prices are sticky, stabilizing the level of sticky prices

would require that the increase in energy-intensive goods prices be offset by declines in

the prices of other goods.

       That reasoning suggests that better outcomes in terms of stabilizing output and

employment would come from monetary policy which focuses on stabilizing a measure

of “core” inflation, which is made up mostly of sticky prices. Simulations with FRB/US,

the model of the U.S. economy created and maintained by the staff of the Federal

Reserve Board (Mishkin, 2007b), illustrate this point. To keep the simulations as simple

as possible, I have assumed that the economy begins at full employment with both

headline and core inflation at desired levels. The economy is then assumed to experience

a shock that raises the world price of oil about $30 per barrel over two years; the shock is

assumed to slowly dissipate thereafter. In each of two scenarios, a Taylor rule is assumed

to govern the response of the federal funds rate; the only difference between the two

scenarios is that in one, the federal funds rate responds to core personal consumption




                                              8
expenditures (PCE) inflation, whereas in the other, it responds to headline PCE inflation.5

Figure 1 illustrates the results of those two scenarios. The federal funds rate jumps

higher and faster when the central bank responds to headline inflation rather than to core

inflation, as would be expected (top-left panel). Likewise, responding to headline

inflation pushes the unemployment rate markedly higher than otherwise in the early

going (top-right panel), and produces an inflation rate that is slightly lower than

otherwise, whether measured by core or headline indexes (bottom panels). More

important, even for a shock as persistent as this one, the policy response under headline

inflation has to be unwound in the sense that the federal funds rate must drop

substantially below baseline once the first-round effects of the shock drop out of the

inflation data.6

           The basic point from these simulations is that monetary policy that responds to

headline inflation rather than to core inflation in response to an oil price shock pushes

unemployment markedly higher than monetary policy that responds to core inflation. In

addition, because this policy has larger swings in the federal funds rate that must be

reversed, it leads to more pronounced swings in unemployment. On the other hand,

monetary policy that responds to core inflation does not lead to appreciably worse

performance on stabilizing inflation than does monetary policy that responds to headline

    The Taylor rule is written as follows: R = r + π% + (π% − π ) + y , where R is the nominal policy rate; r* is

the equilibrium real short-term rate; π% is the four-quarter inflation rate, either core or headline; π is the
                                                                                                       *


inflation target, taken to be the baseline inflation rate; and y is the output gap. Under that specification, the
response coefficient on each gap variable is 1.
6
  The scenarios were constructed with a rule that assumes no knowledge of how long the oil price shock
will last. Research done by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board using other types of models also
suggests that when the persistence of shocks is uncertain, the use of core inflation rather than headline
inflation in central-bank reaction functions can improve policy outcomes (Bodenstein, Erceg, and
Guerrieri, 2007).


                                                         9
inflation. Stabilizing core inflation, therefore, leads to better economic outcomes than

stabilizing headline inflation.

       Although the simplest sticky-price models imply that stabilizing sticky-price

inflation and economic activity are two sides of the same coin, the presence of other

frictions besides sticky prices can lead to instances in which completely stabilizing

sticky-price inflation would not imply stabilizing employment (or output) around their

natural rates. For example, in response to an increase in productivity (a positive

technology shock), the real wage has to rise to reflect the higher marginal product of

labor inputs, which requires either prices to fall or nominal wages to rise for employment

to reach its natural rate. If both nominal wages and prices are sticky, a policy of

completely stabilizing prices will force the necessary real wage adjustment to occur

entirely through nominal wage adjustment, thereby impeding the adjustment of

employment to its efficient level (Blanchard, 1997; Erceg, Henderson, and Levin, 2000).

Indeed, if wages are much stickier than prices, the best strategy to promote stable output

and employment is to stabilize nominal wage inflation rather than price inflation, thereby

allowing price inflation to decline to achieve the required increase in real wages.

         Fluctuations in inflation and economic activity induced by variation over time in

sources of economic inefficiency, such as changes in the markups in goods and labor

markets or inefficiencies in labor market search, could also drive a wedge between the

goals of stabilizing inflation and economic activity (Blanchard and Galí, 2006; Galí,

Gertler, and López-Salido, 2007). For example, in sectors of the economy subject to little

competitive pressure, prices that firms set tend to be higher and output lower than would

prevail under greater competition. Monetary policy is, of course, unable to offset




                                             10
permanently high markups because of the principle, mentioned earlier, that the long-run

Phillips curve is vertical. However, a temporary increase in monopoly power that raises

markups would exert upward pressure on prices without, at the same time, reducing the

productive potential of the economy. That would, indeed, be a case of a tradeoff between

stabilizing inflation and stabilizing output.

         These examples narrow the degree to which the recent findings apply in all cases

of congruence between stabilizing inflation and economic activity (sometimes referred to

as the “divine coincidence”, Blanchard, 2005), but they do not necessarily overturn the

findings. The example of sticky wages would not invalidate the view that stabilizing

inflation stabilizes economic activity if wages are sticky, for example, because they are

held constant in order to operate as an “insurance” contract between employers and

workers (Goodfriend and King, 2001). And for many of the inefficient shocks that drive

a wedge between the sustainable level of output and the level of output associated with

price stability, monetary policy may be the wrong tool to offset their effects (Blanchard,

2005).

         Of course, central banks at times will still face difficult decisions regarding the

short-run tradeoff between stabilizing inflation and output. For example, judging from

the fit of New Keynesian Phillips curves, a substantial fraction of overall inflation

variability seems related to supply-type shocks that create a tradeoff between inflation

and output-gap stabilization (Kiley, 2007b). But the key insight from recent research—

that the interaction between inflation fluctuations and relative price distortions should

lead to a focus on the stability of nominal prices that adjust sluggishly—will likely prove




                                                11
to have important practical implications that can help contribute to inflation and

employment stabilization.



Stabilizing Inflation as a Robust Policy in the Presence of Uncertainty

       The discussion so far has been based on the premise that the central bank knows

the efficient, or natural, rate of output or employment. However, the natural rates of

employment and output cannot be directly observed and are subject to considerable

uncertainty—particularly in real time. Indeed, economists do not even agree on the

economic theory or econometric methods that should be used to measure those rates.

These concerns are perhaps even more severe in the most recent models, where

fluctuations in natural rates of output or employment can be very substantial (for

example, Rotemberg and Woodford, 1997; Edge, Kiley, and Laforte, forthcoming).

Furthermore, because the natural rates in the most recent models are defined as the

counterfactual levels of output and employment that would be obtained if prices and

wages were completely flexible, the estimated fluctuations in natural rates generated by

the research are very sensitive to model specification.

        If a central bank errs in measuring the natural rates of output and employment, its

attempts to stabilize economic activity at those mismeasured natural rates can lead to

very poor outcomes. For example, most economists now agree that the natural

unemployment rate shifted up for many years starting in the late 1960s and that the

growth of potential output shifted down for a considerable time after 1970. However,

perhaps because those shifts were not generally recognized until much later (Orphanides

and van Norden, 2002; Orphanides, 2003), monetary policy in the 1970s seems to have




                                            12
been aimed at achieving unsustainable levels of output and employment. Hence,

policymakers may have unwittingly contributed to accelerating inflation that reached

double digits by the end of the decade as well as undesirable swings in unemployment.

And although subsequent monetary policy tightening was successful in regaining control

of inflation, the toll was a severe recession in 1981-82, which pushed up the

unemployment rate to around 10 percent.

       Uncertainty about the natural rates of economic activity implies that less weight

may need to be put on stabilizing output or employment around what is likely to be a

mismeasured natural rate (Orphanides and Williams, 2002). Furthermore, research with

New Keynesian models has found that overall economic performance may be most

efficiently achieved by policies with a heavy focus on stabilizing inflation (for example,

Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2007).



Conclusion

       Because monetary policy has not one but two objectives, stabilizing inflation and

stabilizing economic activity, it might seem obvious that those objectives would usually,

if not always, conflict. As so often occurs with the “obvious,” however, the impression

turns out to be incorrect. The economic research that I have discussed today

demonstrates, rather, that the objectives of price stability and stabilizing economic

activity are often likely to be mutually reinforcing. Thus, the answer to the title of this

paper—“Does stabilizing inflation contribute to stabilizing economic activity?”—is, for

the most part, yes.
