I.     Introduction

       In   an effort to reduce salary costs, many school districts have begun

to offer teachers financial incentives to retire early. Often, however,

these districts have limits on the number of cumulated unused sick leave

days that teachers may     receive   cash payments, credits toward future health

insurance, or retirement credits for, at retirement. Thus, one might

expect that in addition to stimulating early retirement, early retirement

incentive programs may interact with sick leave provisions and provide an

unintended incentive for increased teacher absenteeism. To the extent

that less learning occurs when regular teachers are absent and student

motivation to attend school is also reduced, student academic performance

may   suffer.    This surely would be an unintended side effect of these

policies.

       Somewhat surprisingly, the study of the causes and effects of teacher

absenteeism has received very little attention. The "educational

production function" literature contains no references to the effects of

teacher absenteeism on student academic performance, although a few

studies have addressed the related topics of the effects of student

absenteeism and the amount of weekly instructional time on student

performance.1 While there are numerous studies of the determinants of

worker absenteeism by economists and industrial psychologists, only a

small number of these deal with how sick leave policies influence

absenteeism. 2

      Moreover, there have been only two studies of the effects of sick

leave policy on teacher absenteeism. The first used data for 57

elementary schools in California and Wisconsin in 1974-75 and      found   that

the presence of income protection plans (for long-term sick leave) was
                                      2

associated with higher absenteeism, while the requirements that teachers

provide proof of illness and report illness directly to the principals

were associated with lower absentee rates.3 This study, conducted a

decade ago, did not have data on a number of provisions governing sick

leave in teacher contracts (such as number of leave days per year, maximum

number of leave days teachers can cumulate, "pay-offs" to teachers for

unused sick leave days, and the presence of a "sick-leave bank") that are

important today. The second was a case study of one school district in

New York State and showed, using before-after comparisons, that the

institution of pay incentives for good attendance in 1986-87 was

associated with a significant reduction in the district's mean number of

sick days used.4 The paucity of research on teacher absenteeism is

undoubtedly due to the fact that data on teacher absenteeism are not

regularly reported by school districts to state education departments and

data on the leave provisions in collective bargaining agreements that

teachers work under in each school district are not regularly tabulated

anywhere.

     This paper, which is based on an extensive data collection effort

conducted by the authors, presents an econometric analyses of the

variations in teacher and student absenteeism across the over 700 school

districts in New York State (excluding New York City) in 1986-87 and of

how such variations influence student test score performance. We begin in

the next section by presenting the conceptual framework upon which our

empirical work is based. Section III discusses the data we use and

presents some descriptive statistics. Our econometric estimates are
                                       3

presented in section IV and their implications are discussed in a brief
                                                         -

concluding section.



II.   Conceytual, Framework; Teacher Absenteeism. Student Absenteeism, and
      Student Test Score Performance

      A.   Teacher Absenteeism

      Consider first how a school district's sick leave and pther leave

policies might be expected to influence teacher absenteeism. The nature

of these policies, at least for tenured teachers, suggests that the

appropriate framework to use is a life-cycle one that incorporates

uncertainty. For expositional convenience we will act as if all teacher

leave usage is sick leave usage; this assumption is reined in our

erpirical work.

      Teachers use sick leave either for serious illnesses (when their

health unambiguously prevents them from coming to work), for minor

illnesses (when they have some discretion about whether to come to work)

and, in the absence of requirements for doctofs notes certifying short

illnesses, for additional paid vacation" on days when they actually have

no health problems. While in the aggregate teachers in a district have no

control over their usage of sick leave for the first purpose, they do

control the usage for the latter two purposes and thus absenteeism can be

analyzed in a rational choice framework.5

      We will consider the effects of four key aspects of teacher leave

policies for which we have data. First, the annual leave days permitted

per teacher. Second, the maximum number of unused leave days that can be

cumulated and used (if needed) in future years. Third, whether teachers

can receive either direct cash payments at retirement, subsidies for post-
                                            4

retirement health insurance costs, or credit for additional      service at the
retirement   date, for unused   cumulated   leave.6 Fourth, the dollar value

per day of unused leave to them if any of the latter forms of payment

exist.

       A simple model in which teachers value both leave days that they use

and the payoff that they receive for cumulative unused leave days implies

(see Appendix A) that ceteris paribus, the greater the number of days of

leave granted annually, the greater the absentee rate will be. An

increase in the payoff for unused days will, ceteris paribus, have an

ambiguous effect on the absentee rate because it will have both income and

substitution effects. While a higher payoff increases the cost of using

sick leave days and therefore should decrease usage (substitution effect),

it also increases teachers' wealth and this should increase usage (income

effect). The net effect of higher payoff rates on teacher absenteeism ir

thus   an empirical question.
       Of course, teacher absentee rates will vary across school districts

for a number of reasons other than leave provisions and these must be

controlled for in our empirical analyses. For example, factors that

influence teachers' disutility of work (or the value they place on leave

days) surely matter and a school district's characteristics such as its

size or whether it is in an urban area may matter. Similarly, factors

that influence the incidence of illness among teachers, such as the

incidence of illness among students and the age distribution of teachers

surely matter.

       The life-cycle aspect of absenteeism decisions arises because

teachers' preferences for paid leisure (the third use of sick days) may
                                              5

vary    both over their life-cycles and with whether they have tenure and
because       of the possibility that a serious illness may arise that requires

them    to use     in a year sore than   the number of    sick leave days   they   are

granted       eligibility for in that year.      In   the absence of having cumulated
unused sick        leave days from previous years. a serious illness that

exhausted current year sick leave days could lead to a substantial

earnings loss.7 Since the incidence of such illnesses are a priori highly

uncertain, teachers will have a precautionary demand for sick leave days

and will want to accumulate some unused days across years. Of course,

some school districts do have 'sick leave banks' from which a teacher who

has used up his or her sick leave can 'borrow' days from other teachers in

the district. The existence of such sick leave banks will reduce

teachers' precautionary demand for unused sick leave days and should lead

to increased teacher absenteeism. More generally, one would expect to

observe teachers accumulating sick leave days when they are young and then

'spending' them as they near retirement. So for this reason also, the age

distribution of teachers in a district should affect its absentee rate.

        The   maximum number of leave days that teachers can cumulate should
also affect annual usage. If cumulated days can not be 'cashed in" at
retirement, an increase in the maximum number of days that can be
cumulates      might   be expected to decrease absenteeism for young teachers (in
the    'saving' phase of     their life cycle)    but increase absenteeism for older

teachers (in the "drawing-down' phase). While on             balance the effect on
the district-wide absentee rate is ambiguous in            this case, if cumulated

days          be   cashed-in, one would expect an increase in the number of days
                                            6

that can be cumulated to be associated with a lower district-wide absentee

rate.

        In this life-cycle framework, early retirement incentive plans that

induce some people to retire earlier than would otherwise be the case will

likely increase the absentee rate of older teachers (they will have a

smaller number of years left to use up" their cumulated leave days). In

theory, then an unintended short-term side effect of such plans will be

increases in teacher absentee rates.8

        The discussion above leads to the specification of teacher

absenteeism equations of the form


(1)          Ai —   FA(Li,   Rj, Ti, 0Ai' Si) +.EAi

Here Ai is the absentee rate of teachers in school district i, Li is a

vector of contract provisions that govern teacher usage of leave days in

the district, Rj is a dichotomous <1,0) variable that takes on the value

of one if an early retirement incentive program is in effect in the

district, Ti is a vector of teacher characteristics in the district,

DAi is a vector of characteristics of the school district (e.g., size)

that might be expected to influence the absentee rate of teachers in the

district, Si is the absentee rate of students in the district, and EAi

is a random error ten.



        B.   Student Absenteeism

        What are the factors that one might expect would influence the

absence rate of students in a school district? As with teacher

absenteeism, we can distinguish three different types of student

absenteeism in theory, althoug we can not separate them out in our data.
                                       7


First, some absent students have serious illnesses that render them unable

to attend school. Second, some have minor illnesses (e.g., minor colds)

and potentially could attend (without infecting their classmates) if they

chose to do so. Third, some are not ill at all and have either tricked

their parents into believing they are ill and/or are truants who are

absent without justification.

      The first type of absenteeism is likely to depend primarily on

unobservable factors (e.g., the incidence of illnesses,pcross school

districts) although district wide economic variables (e.g., family income)

may influence the nutrition that children in the district get and hence

their health. If these unobservable factors simultaneously increase the

incidence of illness among teachers and students, higher teacher absentee

rates may also be positively correlated with higher pupil absentee rates.

      The latter two types of student absenteeism are more the results of

choice made by students in the district. Characteristics of teachers in

the school district (e.g., age or gender) may affect these choices. The

age distribution of students in a district may also matter, as elementary

grade students may be more likely to stay in bed in response to a minor

illness but less likely to be truant. Socioeconomic variables that

reflect the value that parents in the community place on education (e.g.,

family income or parental education) also likely will matter, as will the

size of the district. Finally, higher teacher absentee rates may reduce

students motivation to attend school and further lead to higher student

absentee rates. Together, these factors suggest that the student absentee

equation can be specified as


(2)       Si —   F3(Ti.   Dzi. Ai) +
                                           8

where the vector Dj includes all the district-wide variables noted

above (student age distribution, school district size, sociodemographic

and economic variables) that have been postulated to influence student

absenteeism and EBI is a random error ten.



     C.    Student Test Scores

     Our   final   concern is with how student absenteeism and teacher

absenteeism in a school district affect student academic performance (ri)

in the district. To estimate these relationships one must control for

characteristics of teachers (e.g., education, experience), characteristics

of the school systems (e.g., class size, expenditure per pupil) and

characteristics of the community (e.g., parental income and education

levels, racial and ethnic mix) that one might expect to influence

educational achievement. Denoting these latter three types of district

variables by Dci, this leads to specifications o.f student performance

equations of the form


              —
                   F(DcJ   Ai. Si) + Eci


where ECi is a random error term.9

     In the analyses that follow various measures of student performance

will be used. In addition, since student absenteeism and teacher

absenteeism are specified to influence each other (equations (1) and (2))

tests for whether they should be considered endogenous in each other's

equation will be conducted.

111. The Data

    One reason that few studies on the determinants and effects of

teacher absenteeism have been conducted is that data on teacher

absenteeism and contract provisions governing school district leave

policies are not systematically collected and reported. To analyze these

issues required us to undertake a major data collection effort.

     A survey was sent to the superintendents of all 722 public school

districts in New York State (excluding New York City) in October of 1987

requesting information on a number of variables including teacher usage of

leave days during the 1986-87 academic year. Two follow-up surveys were

sent to nonrespondents in January and April of 1988. In total 419

districts, or nearly 60% of the school districts in the state, responded

to the survey.

     The survey asked respondents to include in usage of leave days "sick

leave and other leave days (e.g., family leave, personal leave, religious,

conference and/or visitation days) taken by teachers during the academic

year". The 381 districts that reported this information reported that, on

average, teachers in each district used 8.9 leave days per teacher in

1986-87, with the standard deviation of mean usage across districts being

3.3 days)- Given a school year of about 180 days, the absentee rate of

teachers in the state was slightly less than 5% in 1986-87. While this

number is somewhat higher than absence rates found in May 1985 Current

Ponulation Survey data, it must be stressed that the rate for teachers

includes all of the nonsick leave forms of absences enumerated above)-1

Simple tabulations also suggest that mean usage of leave days per teacher
                                           10

 increases with school district size; private sector studies have also

observed that absenteeism increases with establishment size)-2

        Data on leave provisions specified in New York State teachers'

contracts in 1986-87 were compiled from contracts that over 100 of the

superintendents returned with their surveys, from special reports prepared.

for the authors by F.A.C,T.S. (a Palmyra, New York firm        that maintains
files    on teacher contracts) and from teacher contracts that are on file at

the Albany offices of the New York State Public Employment Relations Board

(PERB). From these sources, contract information for S45 school districts

in    the state, including   virtually all districts who   responded   to our

survey,   was compiled.
       These contracts indicate that provisions governing teacher leave vary

widely    in the state. Total leave days available per teacher each year was
coded as the sum     of sick leave, personal leave, family illness leave,
religious      leave, and bereavement leave (the latter included nb when days

used for it were deducted from the days     provided in another of the
categories'     days). While the modal contract permitted 15 days      total leave
per   year, others permitted between 9 and 37 days   per   year. Of the

contracts that included a separate bereavement leave category, most

frequently     they provided for the availability of 3 to 5 days of leave in
the   event of a death of a close family member.

       While   most frequently contracts permitted between 180 and 200 days of
unused sick leave to cumulate, about 10% of the contracts specified less
than 180 days (or did not mention cumulation), while over 10% permitted
more than 200 days. Over two-thirds of the contracts allowed at least
part of unused accumulated sick leave to be "cashed in" at retirement <or
                                          11

sometimes before) either in the form of cash payments, terminal year

salary increases, or the funding of health insurance after retirement.

The dollar amount paid" for day     of   unused leave varied widely across

diètricts and, within a district, often varied with &     retiree's   age.13 In
some districts all retirees were eligible, while in others, only people

retiring by specified ages were eligible to cash in unused sick leave

days.

        Over two-thirds of teacher contracts specified teacher eligibility

for a fixed number of visitation, conference and/or professional days,

with 3 or 5 days per teacher per year specified most frequently. The

other one-third either did not mention such days, or indicated that they

were allocated at the discretion of school administrators. Finally,

almost 60% of the contracts indicated that some form of sick leave bank

was present in the district.

        The other data used in the analyses all came from New York State

Education Department (NYE) or U.S. Bureau of Census sources. The NYE

1986-87 Personnel Master File contained the age, sex, degrees, teaching

experience, tenure status, class size, and class "quality for every

assignment for every public school teacher employed in the state in the

spring of 1987. This enabled us to construct district-wide averages for

these variables. Data on sociodemographic characteristics of students in

the district and the communities in which they reside came from the NYE

1986-87 Basic Educational Data System File and the 1980 Census of

Population School District File. Data on student absenteeism were

obtained from NYE Annual Education Summary: Nineteen Eighty-Six

Seven.
                                       12

      The only standardized tests that jfl   students in New York State take
are third and sixth grade standardized reading and math tests (PEP tests),

a sixth grade social studies test (PET) and eighth or ninth grade

competency tests in reading and writing (PCT). High school students going

for Regents diplomas also take various high school Regents academic

examinations (REGENTS), while other high school students take Regents

competency examinations (RCT). Data on the percentage of students who

passed each of these tests were obtained from the NYE 1987 Comprehensive

Assessment Reoort.

      A limitation of these test score data is that they permit us to look

only at the academic performance of students in the lower-tail of the

academic talent distribution in each district. That is, together with the

prior mentioned data, they permit us to study how teacher and student

absenteeism affect pass rates (and hence failure rates) but not how

teacher and student absenteeism affect scores of students who perform well

above the passing level. While this is a limitation, one may plausibly

argue that the lower tail of the academic talent distribution is the group

whose academic performance will suffer the most from teacher and student

absences.

      A complete enumeration of all of the variables used in the analyses

that follow and their sources are found in Appendix B.



IV.   F.mvirical Analyses
      This section presents our econometric analyses of the determinants of

teacher and student absenteeism in New York State school districts in

1986-87 and of the effects of these variables on students' test score
                                          13

performance. Teacher and student absenteeism are each first analyzed

treating the other as exogenous and then consideration is given to whether

they should be treated as jointly endogenous. Finally, their effects on

students' test score performance are estimated.



     A)    Determinants of Teacher Absenteeism

     Table 1 presents estimates of teacher absenteeism equations for the

subset of responding districts in our sample whose teacher contracts had

provisions for "buy back" at the retirement date of unused cumulative sick

leave days, the formula for computing the buy back was explicit and a

stated maximum number of days that could be bought back was present. The

dependent variable in each of these equations is the average number of

leave days used by teachers in a district in 1986-87. The equation in

column (1) specifies that teacher absenteeism depends only on the leave

provisions found in the contract. These include the annual number of

leave days permitted (nleave), whether a sick leave bank is present

(bank), the number of days of bereavement leave permitted for one family

member (ber) •   the   maximum dollar per day buyout of unused cumulative leave

days at retirement (buydd), the maximum number of days to which unused

leave can cumulate (cum), and the annual number of visitation,

professional and conference days specified in the contract (vis).14

     Although our primary interest is in the effects of these variables,

succeeding columns generalize the specification to allow for the effects

of other variables. These include district size, as measured by the

number of teachers in the district (ne); the average number of days

students in the district were absent in 1986-87 (stuabs); three variables
                                         14

measuring teacher characteristics, the proportions of male teachers

(pmaled), teachers age 55 and older (page55d), and tenured teachers

(ptend) in the district; and two variables measuring demographic

characteristics of the district; the proportions of students in the

district in 1980 that resided in an urban area (purban) and that were

white (pwhite). To correct for heteroscedascityof the residuals, all
                                                                 -
observations are weighted by district size.

     Quite    strikingly, the leave policy variables all significantly

influence teacher usage of leave days and the magnitudes of their effects

are relatively insensitive to the other variables included in the

analyses. As expected, the larger the number of annual leave days

permitted the higher annual leave usage is. although the marginal effect

is significantly lower than unity. Districts that have sick leave banks

average approximately one day per year more leave usage than other

districts and districts that explicitly provide for bereavement leave, but

do not deduct usage of such from other leave categories, also experience

higher leave usage.

     The presence of more generous provisions for the buy-back of unused

sick leave days does lead to lower annual     usage of   leave days. On the one

hand, increasing the number of days that unused days can cumulate to by 30

would decrease annual   usage   of sick leave by about one day. On the other

hand, increasing the dollar per day buyout by $50 would decrease annual

usage by slightly more than one-half a day a year.15 We return below to a

discussion of the wisdom of such changes.

     Districts that provide for an explicit numbers of days for annual

visitation,   conference, and professional days   are   seen to have lower
                                      15

teacher usage of actual leave days. Since superintendents were instructed

in our survey to include visitation, conference and professional days in

total leave days used, this result may appear to some as

counterintuitive.16 One plausible explanation, however, is that the

provision of such days (and the treatment of teachers more generally as

professionals) reduces by a greater amount the number of sick leave days

that teachers feel they need use for what is popularly called rest and

recuperation" purposes.

     Briefly turning to the other findings, higher student absenteeism is

associated with higher teacher absenteeism. Contrary to our priors, the

greater the proportion of teachers older than 55, the lower the usage of

sick leave, perhaps because the payoff for unused sick days will be

received by older teachers in the near future. There is also some

evidence here that tenured teachers have higher usage of sick leave days

than nontenured teachers; a perhaps unintended side effect of the tenure

system.

     Tables 2 and 3 generalize the equations estimated in Table 1 to

permit us to analyze data from larger samples of school districts. In

Table 2 we drop the restriction that there must be a maximum stated number

of days to which unused leave can cumulate and include a dummy variable if

unlimited accumulation of leave is permitted (dcl). Districts which allow

for unlimited accumulation are seen to have somewhat lower annual usage of

sick leave than other districts.'7

     In Table 3, the further restriction is dropped that districts must

have buy-back provisions at retirement whose formulae we explicitly know.

The sample now used includes districts without buy-back provisions,
                                       16

districts with provisions for buy-back at retirement whose formulae we

don't know, and districts that provide for another form of buyout of

unused leave days (typically prior to retirement). As such, the

specifications in this table also include a dichotomous variable that

takes on the value of one if the buyout formula is not known to us or if

there is another form of buyout for unused leave days and zero otherwise

(buy4). Furthermore, since the affect of the number of unused days

teachers may accumulate likely depends on whether a buyout provision

exists, the coefficient of this variable is allowed to vary with whether a

buyout provision exists (CUMl -   provision,    CUI4O -   no provision), as is the

coefficient of the dummy variable for districts that permit unlimited

accumulation of unused leave days (dell -      provision,    dclO - no

provision) 18

    Due to severe collinearity problems among the latter four variables,

no significant effects for them are found in this table. Otherwise, the

pattern of coefficients of the leave policy variables is similar to,

although somewhat smaller and less significant, than those found in the

preceding tables. The large negative and significant coefficient for buy4

provides additional support for the notion that provisions for buybacks of

unused sick leave days reduce teacher usage of sick leave.

     One final extension warrants being briefly reported here,

Superintendents were asked in our survey if a retirement incentive program

existed in their district and this was included as a dichotomous variable

in preliminary specifications. However, this variable never proved to be

significant. This result was not unexpected for two reasons. First,

superintendents who responded to oursurvey reported that even in
                                       17

districts with such programs, on average, less than 2% of their teachers

retired in 1986-87. Even if retirees substantially increased their

absenteeism in response to a retirement incentive program, the effect on

the district-wide average absentee rate would probable be too small to

estimate. Second, many of the districts may well have considered their

buy back provisions as a retirement incentive program and variables to

capture these provisions were already included in the analyses.



     B.     Determinants of Student Absenteeism

     Table 4 presents estimates of equations that seek to explain average

absence days per student in New York State school districts in 1986-87.

Student absenteeism is postulated to vary with characteristics of the

district's teachers (the proportion that is male (pmaled), the proportion

that has tenure (ptend), the proportion that is 55 or older (pageS5d)),

sociodeuiographic characteristics of residents of the school district

(median household income (mhi79), proportion of adults with at least some

college education (pc), percent residing in urban areas (purban), and

percent that is white (pwhite)), characteristics of the school district

(proportion of students in elementary grades (felem), expenditures per

pupil (exppup), and total student enrollment (te67)), and the average

number of leave days used per teacher in 1986-87 (   ne)).   Separate

estimates are presented for the entire sample and for the subsamples of

school districts used in Tables 1 and 2. To correct for heteroscedascity,

each district's observation is weighted by total student enrollment in the

district.
                                     18

     Focusing initially on the specifications that treat teacher

absenteeism as exogenous (the columns denoted WLS), a fairly consistent

pattern of results emerges from these weighted least squares estimates.

Ceteris paribus, higher teacher absenteeism is associated with higher

student absenteeism, although the relationship is significantly less than

one-to-one. Similarly, larger districts and districts with a higher

proportion of teachers older than age 55 have higher student absentee

rates. In contrast, ceteris paribus, increases in the proportions of

students in elementary grades, male teachers, tenured teachers, and

residents that are white all are associated with lower absentee rates, as

are increases in household incomes in the community.



     C.   Should Teacher end Student Absenteeism be Treated as Jointly
          Determined?

     The estimates discussed above treat student absenteeism as exogenous

in the teacher absenteeism equation and teacher absenteeism as exogenous

in the student absenteeism equation. The structure of these equations

suggests that they may well be Jointly determined and consequently

weighted two-stage least squares estimates (2SLS) of the student and

teacher absenteeism equations appear in Tables 4 and 5 respectively.19

Two striking results emerge from these tables.

     On the one hand, student and teacher absenteeism no longer appear to

significantly influence each other; the relevant coefficients decline both

in their magnitudes and their statistical significance. On the other

hand, allowing each to be treated as endogenous in the other's equation

does not appear to affect any of the other coefficients in the model.

Most important, given our focus on the affects of school district leave
                                      19

policies on teacher usage of leave days, the effects of leave policies are

 invariant to whether student absenteeism is treated as endogenous in the

 teacher absenteeism equation.

     Of course, one can, in fact, conduct formal specification tests to

test the hypotheses that student absenteeism should be considered

endogenous in the teacher absenteeism equation and visa versa.20 These

tests, which are omitted for brevity, suggest that one can reject the

hypothesis that teacher usage of leave days is endogenous in the student

absentee day usage equation for all three samples used in Table 4 and that

one can similarly reject the hypothesis that student absentee day usage is

endogenous in the teacher usage of leave days equation for all but the

Table 1 sample.

     Recall that teacher usage of sick leave days may appear to positively

affect student usage of absentee days for two reasons. On the one hand,

there is the "behavioral explanation" that increased teacher absences from

the classroom may reduce students' motivation to attend school and thus

increase students' absentee rates. On the other hand, there is the

possibility that an omitted district-specific variable (e.g., incidence of

illness) simultaneously causes both teacher and student absenteeism to be

high in a district. The latter explanation, however, is JQS consistent

with our rejection of the hypothesis that teacher usage of leave days

should be considered endogenous in the student absentee days usage

equation.

     Taken together, these findings suggest that one should place more

confidence in the estimates in Table 4 that treat teacher leave usage as

exogenous, that teacher usage of leave days is consequently positively
                                          20

associated with student usage of absentee days and that the Thehavioral

explanation" for this association is the correct one. Our discussion in

the concluding section of the paper of the benefits of reducing teacher

usage of leave days will make use of these results.



     D.     Do Teacher and Student Absenteeism -Influence Student Test Score
            Performance?                                       -




     Table 6 presents estimates of the determinants of the percentages of

students    that   passed various standardized tests in New York State school

districts in 1986-87. Pass rates are specified in these equations to be

functions of vectors of characteristics of teachers in the district,

characteristics of classes in the district, characteristics of the racial,

ethnic and income distributions of students in the district, and of the

average number of days that students in the district were absent during

the year.

     The estimates suggest that, ceteris paribus, teachers with less than

a master's degree (PthAST) are associated with lower and those with more

than a master's degree (PCTMAST) higher, student achievement. Pass rates

also tend to be consistently (across tests) lower in districts with higher

percentages of black students (BLKP), hispanic students (HISP) and

students from low-income families (SOCIN). Student absenteeism also

appears to be important; for every three additional days students on

average are absent, the percentage of students who pass the various tests

falls by about 1.0 to 2.5 percentage points.21 This should be contrasted

with mean pass rates on the various tests that range from 82 to 93%22,23

    Teacher usage of leave days data were available for only about 55% of

the districts. To estimate the effect of teacher absenteeism on student
                                      21

test score performance, the equations in Table 6 were reestimating adding

teacher leave day usage to the equations, assigning this variable a value

of zero if it was not reported, and then adding a (1,0) nonreporting of

teacher leave usage variable to the equation.24 This was done separately

for the average number of leave days used by teachers in the district

variable and, for tests taken in the elementary and secondary grades

respectively, for estimates of the average number of leave days used by

elementary and secondary teachers in the district respectively.25

     The inclusion of these teacher absentee variables had virtually no

effect on the coefficients of the other variables in the model. Estimates

of the coefficients for the teacher and student absences variables are

presented in Table 7. Quite strikingly, for only one of these

standardized tests, the preliminary competency test (PCT) taken in the

eighth or ninth grades, is there any evidence that teacher absenteeism

adversely affects student test score performance. The estimates imply

that if teacher absenteeism in a district could be reduced by five days

per year, pass rate on the PCT in the district would rise by about .75 to

.85 percentage points.26 We stress, however, that these results suggest

that teacher absenteeism does not influence student performance on any of

the other elementary and secondary school standardized tests.

     Several extensions of these analyses warrant briefly being reported

here.27 First one may argue that the purpose of providing teachers with

conference, visitation, and professional days is to increase their

effectiveness in the classroom. Thus including these days in total leave

days used, as we have done, may confound the effects of other types of

leave days on student test score performance. While our data do not
                                         22

permit us to separate out conference, visitation, and profàssional days

actually used by teachers in each district, we do know for many    districts
the number of such days specified in union contracts that teachers may

take (vis). Reestimation of the equations in Table 7 with this variable

included as an additional explanatory variable did not cause the

coefficients of teacher usage of leave days to increase in size or

significance, nor were the coefficients of this variable systematically

either positively (or negatively) associated with student test score

performance.

     Second, one may argue that the positive partial correlations we

observe between student absenteeism and student test score performance

arise because students doing poorly in school tend to be those who are

less motivated and thus absent more, not because student absenteeism leads

to poorer test score performance. To test for this, we reestimated the

test score equations in Table 6 and the student absentee equation in Table

4, adding    the vector of test scores as additional explanatory variables in
the student absentee equation and treating the test scores and student
absentee    rate as being simultaneously determined.

     On average, treating student absenteeism as endogenous in the student

test score equations did not lead to smaller estimates of   the effects of
student absenteeism on student test score performance. Furthermore,
including   student test score performance in the student absentee equation

only marginally reduced the effect of teacher usage of leave days on

student absenteeism. 28
                                         23

V.   Conclusions

     Two   principal   sets of findings have emerged from our analyses.

First, school district policies governing the annual usage of teacher

leave days that appear in teacher contracts clearly do influence teachers'

usage of leave days. Ceteris paribas, a larger annual number of leave

days permitted, the presence of a "sick leave bank", a larger number of

days granted for bereavement leave, and a smaller number of professional1

visitation and conference days specified in the contract, are all

associated with higher actual teacher usage of leave days. Similarly,

policies that govern the "buyback' of unused sick days clearly matter. In

districts in which cumulated unused sick leave days can be "bought back",

typically at retirement, increases in the number of days that can be

"cashed-in" or in the dollars per day buyout are both associated, ceteris

paribus, with lower leave usage.

     Second, higher student absenteeism is associated with lower pass

rates (higher failure rates) for students on a set of standardized tests.

In contrast, teacher absence from the classroom, at least at the levels

currently observed in New York State, for the most part does not appear to

be associated with students' pass rates on these tests.

     Of course one should not conclude from this last statement that

teacher absenteeism has no impact on student learning. As already

discussed, our analyses focuses on pass rates on a set of standardized

tests; they thus do not permit one to conclude anything about how teacher

usage of leave days affects students whose academic performance is well-

above the "minimum pass" level on the exams nor how it affects aspects of

learning not measured by them. Moreover, one might reasonably suspect
                                      24

 that the variable measured with the greatest error in our analyses was the

 teacher usage of leave day variable, as all other variables came from

annual reports filed by school districts with New York State, census data,

or union contracts. As is well known, if the measurement error in the

teacher absenteeism variable is random, this will cause its estimated

effect on student test score performance to be biased towards zero.29

     Taking these latter results at face value, however, one can use our

findings to indicate the components that would go into a benefit/cost

analysis of the wisdom of changing the various provisions governing

teacher leave found in teacher contracts. For example, suppose one wanted

to increase the dollar per day buyout for unused leave by $50. Our

estimates (Table 1) suggest this would reduce teachers usage of sick leave

by more than one-half a day per teacher per year.

     Now the benefits of such a reduction would take several Eons.

First, districts would incur lower costs for substitute teachers; the

savings here would depend on the salaries they pay for substitutes, as

well as on the extent to which lower teacher absenteeism would lead

districts to reduce their usage of substitutes,3° Second, to the extent

that lower teacher absenteeism behaviorally leads to lower student

absenteeism, as our discussion in section IV.C suggests, districts would

benefit financially because state aid to education formulae in New York

are based on school districts' average daily attendance.31   Third, to the

extent that lower student absenteeism leads to higher student test score

performance, as the results in Table 6 suggest, student test scores would

increase and the districts should place some value on this outcome;
                                     25

     The costs of such a reduction would be the higher payments for unused

sick days that districts would be obligated to make when teachers retire.

These payments would increase both because the dollar per day payment had

increased and because the number of leave days teachers use had decreased.

Of course, not all teacher in a district actually remain in a district

until their retirement date and, to the extent that these buybacks have

minimum age requirements (they typically apply only if one leaves the

district at age 55 or later), the buybacks may not be as expensive as

crude estimates might suggest.

     1..   Eric HanUshek's (1986) survey of the educational production

function literature never mentions teacher absenteeism. Richard Humane

(1976) did find that student absenteeism adversely affected math test

scores in his sample of inner city children. Ann Summers and Barbara

Wolfe (1977) similarly find student absenteeism to negatively impact on

test scores, however other studies such as Lynn M. O'Brien, Ronnie

Meszaros, and William Pulliam (1985) and Robert Ziomek and William

Schoenberger (1983), do not find such a relationship. Studies of the

affects of the weekly time teachers spend on instruction on test scores

include Byron Brown and Dan Saks (1984), N.J. Kiesling (1984), and Charle.

Link and James Mulligan (1986).

    •2. Studies by economists, that treat absenteeism as a choice-

variable in "labor-leisure" or "compensating differential for unfavorable

job characteristic" frameworks, include Steven Allen (1981a) (1981b)

(1983) (1984), and James Chelius (1981). Research by industrial

psychologists and management specialists on absenteeism is critically

reviewed in Paul Goodman, et al. (1984). The few studies on the

relationship between absenteeism and sick leave policies include Dan

Dalton and James Perry (1981), Paul Edwards and Hugh Scullion (1979),

Barron Haney, Jerome Rogers, and Judy Schultze (1983), Richard Kopelman,

Ceorge Schneller and John Silver (1981), and William Woska (1972); in the

main these are case studies or simple correlational analyses based on a

small number of employers.

        5. In some districts teachers receive end of year cash bonuses if

their sick leave usage falls below prescribed levels.

        6.   See1 for example, Allen (l98lb) and Chelius (1981).

        7. Most long-term disability plans have six month waiting periods

and thus offer only limited earnings protection against long (but

temporary) illnesses).

        8. If the plans do succeed in reducing the average age of teachers

in the district, in subsequent years, ceteris paribus, absentee rates may

be lower.

        9. Ehrenberg, Chaykowski, and Ehrenberg (1988) have estimated

school district test score performance equations using earlier years data

for New York State than are used here. Their analyses, however, only used

a subset of the educational performance and district-wide measures used in

this paper and did not include measures of teacher or student absenteeism.

        10. Respondents who did not report usage of sick leave either chose

not to participate in the study or claimed they lacked the resources to

compute sick leave usage for us.

        11. See Bruce Klein (1986). While nationally 4.7% of all workers

were absent sometime during the survey week, the proportion of weekly

hours lost due to absenteeism (which corresponds to our absentee rate) was

2.6%.

        12. See ENA's Job Absence and Turnover Report" (1988).

        13. The credit received for unused day   is   sometimes specified as a

dollar amount, sometimes as a percentage of the individual's salary and,

still other times, as a percentage of the district's starting or average

teacher salary.
                                           28

         14,. ZUYDD was   calculated as follows. If the formula was specified
as   a   fixed dollar amount per day,   this amount was   used. In cases   where

the amount    varied (typically inversely) with age at retirement, the

largest fixed dollar amount was used. If the formula was specified as a

fixed percentage of either a teacher's final salary or of the average

salary in the district, this percentage was applied to the average teacher

salary in the district that we computed from individual teacher salary

data found in the NYE 1986-87 Personnel Master File. Again, in cases

where the percentage varied with age at retirement, the largest percentage

permitted was used.

         15. To judge the magnitude of such an increase, the mean value of

buydd in this sample was $48.53 dollars/day and the standard deviation was

$48.12. Actual values ranged from $5.00 to $228.56 per day across

districts.

         16. See section III.

         17. The mean level of CU)! in districts with a specified maximum

limit was about 200 in this sample. The product of 200 and -.03 is -6.00

which is slightly lower (in absolute value) than the -6.6 coefficient of

dcl in column (5).

         18. See section II.

         19. For comparison purposes, IlLS estimates of the teacher

absenteeism equations are also reproduced in Table 5.

         20. To test whether teacher usage of leave days should be considered

exogenous in the student absentee day usage equation, for example, one

reestimates the student absentee day equation including both teacher usage

of leave days and an instrument for teacher usage of leave days in the
                                       29

equation.    If the former's coefficient proves to be statistically

significantly different from zero but the latter's does not, one can

reject   the hypothesis that teacher usage of leave days is endogenous in
the student absentee equation. See 3.   A.   Hausman (1978) for details.
     21.    The mean number of days students were absent in each district

was about 10, while the standard deviation of wean absence days across
                                                              -
districts was around 2.5 days.

     22.    The PET score reported is the district's percentile rank in the

state and thus is lower on average, than the other test scores.

     23. One extension warrants being briefly reported. It is reasonable

to assume that unobserved district specific factors will cause the

residuals for a district to be correlated across equations in Table 6.

Efficiency can be improved in such a case by estimating the equations as a

system of "seemingly unrelated regressions" over the set of districts for

which data on all test scores were available. When this was done, using a

smaller sample of 610 districts, virtually identical results to those in

Table 6 were found.

     24. This is known as the "modified zero-order regression" method for

regression analyses with missing data. See Maddala (1977).

     25. About 250 school districts reported leave days used by secondary

school teachers in their survey responses as well as total teacher leave

day usage. For these districts we were thus able to estimate elementary

teacher usage of leave days.

     26. Across districts in the sample, the mean pass rate on the PCT

was close to 93% and the standard deviation was 6%:

     27. These results are available from the authors.
                                     30

     28. The .086 coefficient of ne in column 4 of Table 1 fell to .075

when the student test score performance variables were included and the

latter treated either as exogenous or endogenous.

     29. See l4addala (1977) or any other econometrics text. Strictly

speaking, the direction of the bias can be signed only if all other

explanatory variables in the model are measured without error. Random

measurement error in dependent variables leads to inefficient but unbiased

estimates so our estimated coefficients in the teacher usage of sick leave

equations remain unbiased.

     30. Salary data for substitute teachers are typically not found in

teacher contracts, as in most districts substitute teachers are not part

of the teacher bargaining unit. Special tabulations made by the Division

of Research and Educational Services of the New York State United Teachers

for four downstate counties (Suffolk, Putnam, Westchester, and Rockland)

suggest that starting salaries for certified per diem substitutes

typically were in the $40 to $65 per day range.

     Our survey also asked school districts to report their usage of

substitute teachers and approximately 350 reported this along with teacher

usage of leave days. While on average, the two numbers were quite close

one-quarter of the districts reported that they used 15% or more

substitute days than teachers' used leave days. Similarly, another

quarter reported that they used 11% or less substitute days than teachers'

used leave days. Thus, decreases in teacher usage of leave days do not

lead necessarily to equal decreases in the use of substitute days.
                                        31

     31. The specification tests described in the text imply that the

estimates in Table 4 that treat teacher leave usage as exogenous (the ones

labelled WLS) are the ones too focus on. They suggest that each

additional day of teacher absenteeism increases student absenteeism on

average by about .1 days. Hence, if increasing the buyback at retirement

for unused leave days by $50 would reduce teacher leave usage by .5 days

per teacher, it would decrease average student usage of sick leave days by

.05 days. Based on a 180 day school year, this would increase average

daily attendance in the district by .028%.

     Now in 1986-87, per-pupil state aid to education averaged $2,754 in

districts outside New York State (Office of the New York State Controller,

1987). Assuming a mean class size of 25 students per teacher, the average

increase in state aid oer teacher that would result would be

(.028/100) (2754) (25) or slightly over $19.

                       ASimvle   Model of Absenteeism



      Consider the following simple model of absenteeism that abstracts

 from many of the complexities discussed in the text. Let L be the

 maximum annual number of days of leave teachers are eligible for each

year. Let S(<L) be the annual number of sick leave days they           use
each year due to illness; this is assumed to be known with certainty and

too be constant over their work life.

     Let A be the number of leave days that teachers use each year and

assume that they are allowed to "save" each year's unused sick leave days

for potential use in the future. Any cumulated unused sick leave that is

unused as of their retirement date is "bought back" from them by the

school district at a rate of $6 per unused day.

     To further simplify ignore discounting and assume that teachers get

utility from the sum over their worklives of leave days that they use each

period that are not required due to illness and from the payments (Y) they

receive at retirement for unused leave days. That is; assume that they

have a quasi-concave utility function (U) of the form



(Al) u — u(n(A-S),Y)

           > 0,



where n is the number of periods they plan to work until retirement and



(A2) Y — bn(L-A)
                                            A-2
         Teachers seek   to choose value, of A to maximize


                            L—    u(n(A-S),Y) +   A   (bn(L-A)-Y).


where A is a lagrangian multiplier. The                first   order conditions
for a maximization require that


 (Ma) nu1 - Abn — 0
                                                                   -

 (A4b) u2       A—0
 (A4c)    bn(L-A)-Y —   0


From (A4a) and (A4b) it iuciediately follows that A > 0                and that     in
equilibriwn b — (u1/u2) > 0.

     Totally diffrentiating the first order conditions and writing the

results in matrix notation, one obtains

             "as .11 II -

                                                                                             Ldn



     Let D denote        the determinant of the 3 by 3 matrix on the                 left-hand
side of    (A5). Second order conditions for the solution to the
optimization problem to be a maximum guarantee that I) > 0.
     Comparative   static     results can be obtained by solving (AS) using
Cramer's Rule. It is straightforward           to show (making use          of the first
order condition result that         b—   u,/u2) that
                                             A-3



(Ak)     8A/BL — (bn2/u2D)                  and



(Al) BY/ÔL — (b2n/u1D)(u12u1.-u2u11)


        If the usage of leave days and the payments at retirement for unused
                                                                           -
leave days are both normal goods then


                           uizu2-ujua > 0   and u12u1-u21.½1 >   0.


Thus,    an   increase   in the number of leave days teachers are eligible for

each year will increase both       their    annual   usage of    leave days and the

payments      they   receive for unused   leave   days



(A8)     ÔA/oL>0           ôy/8L>0


        Taken together, this implies that an increase in the             number of leave

days    teachers are eligible for each year will lead to a smaller increase

in the number of leave days used each year since part of this increase in

"wealth" is used to "purchase" increased income at retirement.




(A9) 0<oA/ÔL<l


        It is similarly straightforward to show that



(AlO)    8A/ab — (-An/D) + ((L)/b)(aA/ÔL).
                                            A-4

        Unambiguous predictions about the effect of an increase in the size

of the payment at retirement for unused           sick   leave days can   not   be

obtained. The first term in (AlO), which represents the substitution

effect, is always negative. However, the second term in (AlO), which

represents the income effect of the change in the "price0 of unused days

is positive.
                                                                      -
        Finally, it is also straightforward to show that



(All)    ÔA/8n —   ((L.A))/n)(oA/an)   >   0.


     Teachers with longer horizons (those farthest from retirement at the

date of hire) will use more days of leave per year.

     We must stress that this model abstracts from many important

complexities. These include a varying incidence of the number of sick

days that must be used each year over the life cycle and the uncertainty

associated with these days, varying preferences for usage of leave days

over the life cycle, positive rates of discount, an upper limit on the

number of leave days that may be cumulated, and allowing the usage of

leave days to vary over the life cycle. Nonetheless, the model clearly

illustrates how leave policies may influence absenteeism.
