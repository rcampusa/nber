                                            ABSTRACT

I analyze the effects of state public pension parameters on the retirement of public employees.
Using a panel data set of public sector workers from 12 waves of the Health and Retirement
Study, I model the probability of retirement as a function of pension wealth at early and normal
retirement eligibility and Social Security coverage in the public sector job. I find that becoming
eligible for early retirement, or receiving an early-out offer, significantly increases the probability
of retiring. I do not find any effect of retirement wealth levels; instead the findings are consistent
with the literature on default options in defined contribution plans. These findings suggest that
state legislative action to affect retirement decisions and reduce future pension costs may be most
effective operating through plan eligibility rules and early-out incentives.

        While defined contribution plans are now the norm in private employment, defined

benefit plans remain dominant in the public sector. The additional costs incurred in closing a

plan covering current workers are unaffordable for most states – instead recent legislative actions

focus on changes that affect for new hires. The defined benefit structure has been maintained

with a few exceptions – recent legislation created defined benefit hybrids or combinations with

defined contribution plans for new hires that may reduce plan generosity but still maintain the

pattern of defined benefit financial influences on retirement. In the period 2009 to 2012, 44

states introduced changes in state pension plans for general employees and teachers to address

long-term funding issues -- some states more than once.1 These changes include adjustments to

generosity -- contribution rates, benefit reductions, and early retirement compensation rules -- as

well as age/service eligibility criteria.

        There is limited research to inform us on the relative importance of these parameters on

the retirement choices of public sector workers. In particular, how does the structure of these

plans – the eligibility age for early or normal retirement -- affect retirement behavior? Do early-

out offers increase the probability of retirement over and above existing incentives and the

financial incentives of continued work? Given the substantial underfunding of many of these

public pension plans, understanding the influences of plan generosity and eligibility requirements

is critical for assessing plan solvency and evaluating the impact of these recent legislative

changes.2 State and local government budget health depends on the cost of public sector defined

  The substantial underfunding of these public plans has been well documented. In 2016, state

benefit plans and the retirement incentives they create for employees are important tools for

managing the labor force Further, about three-quarters of public sector workers are also covered

by Social Security so their retirement choices affect Social Security finances as well. More

broadly, defined benefit payments in substantially underfunded plans have implications for

intergenerational equity. For example, Backes et al (2016) estimate that on average across state

plans, over 10 percent of current teachers’ earnings are set aside for previously-accrued pension

liabilities. As a public policy matter, it will be useful to understand the relative value

participants place on aspects of these plans.

        Unique features of public sector employment may allow us to compare separately the

influences of eligibility for pension income, health insurance, and Social Security benefits

because these eligibilities can occur at different ages. For example, many public sector workers

have employer provided retiree health insurance in retirement that provided a bridge to Medicare

for public sector workers who retire before 65. In most previous research, age 65 is also the

normal or full benefits retirement age for Social Security benefits. In contrast, most public sector

workers can buy into group health insurance if they retire before 65 – effectively delinking the

two influences at that important age. In addition, about 25 percent of state and local employees

are not covered by Social Security and do not directly face its financial incentives and key

eligibility ages. Studying the retirement behavior of public sector workers can inform us about

the influence of Social Security and pension retirement incentives apart from health insurance

eligibility.

economically appropriate discount rates. Giertz and Papke (2007) explore the interaction of state
pension systems with state finances.

           In a defined benefit plan, retirement eligibility is a function of personal characteristics –

age, years of service, and some measure of salary -- so the data requirements to estimate the

influence of eligibility separately from financial incentives are substantial. 3 Fortunately, the

Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the most comprehensive panel survey of pre-retirement

respondents, includes a substantial number of public employees. In addition, HRS restricted

pension data include individual-specific pension benefits and eligibility triggers. Thus, this

paper directly complements Coile and Gruber’s (2007) work to disentangle the effects of Social

Security eligibility ages and financial incentives of continued work on private sector employee

retirement in the HRS.

           In this paper I explore the sensitivity of public sector employee retirement decisions to

key features of state pension plans -- benefit generosity and early and normal retirement

eligibility thresholds as well as the role of Social Security coverage. I use respondent-provided

information on job history from 12 waves of the publicly available Health and Retirement Study

(HRS) data to identify public employees and their retirement choice. I calculate respondent

pension wealth and key eligibility ages using the HRS-provided Pension Estimation Program that

uses restricted data on actual employment history linked to detailed plan information. I am able

to identify an important subset of public employees – teachers – using restricted detailed industry

and occupation codes. Finally, because differences in state policy toward public employees are

of interest, I augment these data with the restricted geographic codes to identify state of

residence. Using state of residence and job characteristics, I am able to determine if the

employee is covered by Social Security and if further early retirement inducements from

integrating with Social Security by leveling benefit payments are available.



3
    For an example using aggregate data, see Munnell et al (2015).

                                                           2
       The model underlying this analysis is a proportional hazard model with time-varying

covariates that reflect state pension policy – vested pension wealth and eligibility for early

retirement options, whether the public sector job is covered by Social Security, whether it

includes employer-provided health insurance in retirement, as well as rich demographic

characteristics. To preview the main results, I find that public employee retirement is responsive

to program eligibility focal points – especially becoming eligible through meeting age and

service requirements for the plan’s early retirement benefit -- but not to pension wealth

separately. Social Security coverage increases retirement probabilities for employees age 60-64,

and coordinating with Social Security through leveling is an additional incentive to retire for this

age group. Unlike previous findings on private employees, I do not find a statistically significant

relationship between retirement and the gain in pension wealth from continued work. Special

early-out provisions do appear to encourage earlier retirement, over and above the plan’s early

retirement provisions.

       The next section presents some background on institutional features of public sector

pension plans and reviews some related literature. Section 3 discusses the HRS panel of public

employees and sources of pension plan information. Section 4 presents results using the sample

of respondents who enter the sample while in public employment and retire from their public

sector job. These results are compared to an HRS panel of non-public sector workers. The final

section concludes.



Background and Literature

       Most full-time state and local public employees participate in a defined benefit (DB) plan

that offers normal retirement benefits at relatively early ages, and these plans vary widely across



                                                  3
state and job descriptions in terms of pension generosity and early-out provisions. 4 Typical public

sector plans, for example, may allow for early retirement at age 55 and normal retirement at 60

conditional on a certain number of years of service. The retirement annuity is a function of a

specific benefit rate for each year of service and the participant’s final average salary over a

specified period – often three years. For example, plans with a two percent replacement rate

replace 60 percent of final average salary after 30 years of service. And plans also differ in

eligibility thresholds – the age and service combination that determine early or normal retirement.

           A second important dimension of difference across public sector jobs is Social Security

coverage. Beginning in 1991, public employees who were not members of a qualifying state or

local retirement system were generally required to have Social Security coverage. Federal law

permits each public employer to decide which employees to cover, and the extent to which

public employees are covered varies greatly from state to state. 5 For example, the GAO (2010)

reports that, based on Social Security Administration data (SSA), 98 percent of public employees

are covered by Social Security in Vermont, but in Ohio only about three percent are covered. 6

Further, there is variation in Social Security coverage among public employees working for the

same employer. For example, Missouri’s school districts have two separate retirement systems –

one for fulltime teachers and a separate one for fulltime non-teachers. The fulltime teachers do

not generally have Social Security coverage while the fulltime non-teachers do. It is common, as

in New Hampshire, to prohibit Social Security coverage for police and fire fighters who belong



4 Beshears, Choi, Laibson, and Madrian (2011) illustrate a large amount of heterogeneity in replacement rates across DB plans
even among employees with long tenure and discuss the role of DC plans in the public sector. Litwok and Papke (2014)
simulate large differences across states in teacher pension accrual.

    See GAO (2010) Appendix II for the amount of covered and uncovered earnings by employees in each state.

 Employers may also choose to provide only Medicare coverage rather than both Social Security and Medicare.
The SSA lacks basic data on which public employers have approved coverage and relies on public employers to
comply with coverage agreements voluntarily (GAO, 2010).

to a more generous plan than other public employees. Of course, public employees working in

uncovered employment may still be eligible for Social Security benefits based on their spouse’s

or their own earnings in other, covered employment (GAO, 2003).7 In 2007, 73 percent of state

and local government employees were covered by Social Security, accounting for $528 billion of

the $5 trillion of covered wages (GAO, 2010). This leaves over five million public employees

without Social Security coverage and seven states – California, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana,

Massachusetts, Ohio and Texas account for more than 75 percent of noncovered payroll (GAO,

2003). In particular, teachers do not participate in Social Security in 12 states.8 As I discuss

below, I am able to identify and expand the sample to include this important subgroup of public

employees using restricted HRS occupation codes.

         How to measure retirement is a subject of research itself. Gustman and Steinmeier

(2000) discuss alternative measures using HRS data: by self-report of labor force status, by an

hours-worked or salary measure, or leaving a job after a ten or 20 years. Maestas (2010) uses

the original HRS cohort to study unretirement transitions directly. She compares alternative

measures using hours of work and self-reports of retirement and finds that nearly 50 percent of

retirees follow a nontraditional retirement path that follows partial retirement or unretirement. In

what follows I use the panel structure of the HRS to identify retirement from the public sector




7
 SSA estimates that 95 percent of noncovered state and local employees become entitled to Social Security
benefits as workers, spouses, or dependents. Note that Social Security has two provisions – the Government
Pension Offset, which affects spouse and survivor benefits, and the Windfall Elimination Provisions which affects
retired worker benefits. Both provisions reduce Social Security benefits for those who receive noncovered pension
benefits. See Gustman, Steinmeier and Tabatabai (2013) for analysis of these provisions using HRS data.

For further discussion, see Doherty et al (2012).

                                                               5
job – few of the public sector employees who retire over my sample period report any post-

retirement work.

          Most previous research on the influence of retirement income – whether Social Security

benefits or defined benefits pensions - finds significant effects on the timing of retirement from

private sector employment.9 Coile and Gruber (2007) use HRS data to distinguish the

differential impact of the Social Security eligibility structure - early retirement at age 62 or

normal at (then) age 65 -- from the financial incentives of these benefits on male retirement in

the private sector. They develop a forward-looking measure of retirement incentives, the “peak

value,” whereby individuals consider incentives to work in all future years. They define peak

value as the difference between Social Security wealth (SSW) at its maximum expected value

and SSW at today’s value to measure incentives to continued work. Using two alternative

measures of retirement – changes in earnings and self-reports of first exit after age 55 -- they find

large effects at the key Social Security eligibility ages of 62 and 65, but they also find that

retirement decisions respond negatively to accrual of retirement wealth with future work and

positively to the level of retirement wealth. While the match to HRS restricted pension data is

limited to about 60 percent for their sample, they conclude that private pension incentives have

roughly similar effects. After comparing several incentive measures of future retirement income,

they conclude that retirement decisions are more responsive to the entire future stream of

retirement incentives than to the accrual in retirement wealth over the next year alone. In what

follows, I adopt this forward-looking approach and construct the peak value measure for public

pensions to capture the public pension incentive effects of working longer.

    Hurd (1990), and Friedberg and Webb (2005) provide summaries.

       Morrill and Westall (2018) use cross sectional data from the American Community

Survey (ACS) to study the influence of Social Security coverage for public school teachers.

ACS data on pension incentives are limited -- they approximate “theoretical eligibility” for

retirement from the public sector job by comparing the age of the teacher with the pension plan’s

earliest full retirement age. They find strong evidence of higher rates of retirement among

covered teachers at key Social Security eligibility ages with variation by marital status.

       This literature includes studies of teacher-only retirement choices using administrative

data from a handful of states (Costrell and Podgursky, 2009, Fitzpatrick, 2015, 2018). The

primary limitation of this work is that administrative data do not include other factors that affect

retirement well-being and retirement-related decisions – health, non-pension wealth, and spousal

characteristics for example. Further, most public employees also have a second annuity – Social

Security – so their valuation of benefits will likely differ from other public employees for whom

this is the only source of a retirement annuity. But Asch, Haider, and Zissimopoulos (2005)

examine retirement behavior of federal civil service workers using administrative data from the

Department of Defense. These federal workers do not participate in Social Security and the

authors find no “excess retirement” at age 62 or 65. They estimate that civil service workers

delay their retirement probability by four percent of the average retirement rate for every

additional $10,000 of expected pension wealth from working another year.

       Shoven and Slavov (2014) focus on another important benefit in the public sector --

employer-provided retiree health coverage -- on retirement decisions of federal, state, and local

workers using the HRS – while controlling for a measure of pension wealth. As mentioned

previously, employer provided retiree health insurance is common in the public sector, but

relatively rare in the private sector. They examine retirement before the age of Medicare



                                                  7
eligibility at 65 when retiree health coverage is most valuable and focus on the first full time

self—report work exit over the roughly two-year period between waves. Their pension controls

include the researcher-contributed supplement defined benefit and defined contribution wealth

(Gustman, et al, 2012) and a set of DB pension status indicators from self-reports of early and

normal retirement ages reported at entry into the HRS. They find that retiree health coverage

raises the probability of stopping full time work over two years by 4.3 percentage points at ages

55-59 and by 6.7 percentage points at ages 60-64.

       My analysis complements these previous studies by using some of the same controls but

with individual measures of pension eligibility and wealth based on work history. I control for

the same self-report of health insurance benefits, but am able to include the actual present value

of pension wealth on the current job – the one that is changing with continued work – and the

change in pension wealth from continuing to work another year at each age. I can control for the

wealth effect of pensions as well as the early retirement incentives resulting from the pattern of

benefit accrual with continued work. I use the person-specific eligibility for early retirement or

normal retirement that isolates the eligibility effect from the wealth effect. Note that since I do

not combine public employees with private employees, my method is not subject to selection on

unobservables into public jobs that offer generous retirement benefits relative to wages and

earlier retirement options with health insurance. But I do have concerns about unobservable

individual heterogeneity possibly correlated with public job characteristics. While it is not

possible to fully address these concerns with survey data, I do include initial job tenure and

defined contribution balances at entry to control for heterogeneous preferences for long tenure

and retirement. In addition, following Shoven and Slovov (2014), I exclude individuals with




                                                  8
fewer than five years of service on the current job to reduce the possibility that individual job

choice was motivated by health insurance.



Data: Public employment in the HRS

       I use four comparable cohorts of the HRS – all the same age when they entered the HRS

(age 51-56 in 1992, 1998, 2004, 2010) - that face different state or local defined benefit pension

landscapes as they approach and enter retirement. Respondents are re-interviewed every other

year after entering the survey. I make use of the panel structure of the HRS from 1992-2014 to

compare initial and final self-reports of retirement with dates of public employment to find their

final retirement from the public sector. Respondents indicate at their first interview whether

they had ever worked for the federal, state, or local government and the start and end date of

such jobs. In 2006, 2008, and 2010, the HRS added two new questions that determine if a

respondent is currently employed by a government (question J720), and if so, what level of

government (in 2008 only new interviewees and those who changed jobs were asked these

questions). Going forward, this question repeats every six years. I determine public

employment in other survey years by comparing the start and end date of any reported

government job with the start and interview dates of their current job. I follow employment in

each wave between 1992 and 2014 backward to earlier years that they remained in that same job.

I identify job changes in and out of public employment across the waves (2 year intervals) and

eventual retirement from the government job (if they retire from that job). So, the measure of

retirement used here is based on self-reports with later wave confirmation that the respondent

actually fully retired after leaving public employment.




                                                  9
         I focus on respondents who self-report as state or local public employees at their entry

into the survey. 10 Most of the data come from the RAND (version P) of the HRS with

supplemental information from the RAND HRS Fat files.11 I supplement these data with three

restricted data sources from the HRS: detailed industry and occupation, pension plan data, and

geographic codes for state of residence.          I use the industry and occupation data to identify finer

job categories than are available in the public data. This is particularly relevant for teachers – an

important category of public employment many of whom do not participate in Social Security.

Gustman et al. (2013) speculate that teachers are the most likely of non-Social Security covered

respondents to indicate that they do not work for the government so by using the detailed

industry data I can include them as public sector employees.

         To examine the influence of pension wealth and eligibility for retirement under different

provisions, I use detailed pension information that the HRS has matched to respondents to

calculate the present value of pension wealth. These data come from four surveys of employers

and from employer web sites (Fang et al, 2016). For respondents that have been matched to

employer plans, the HRS Pension Estimation Program (PEP) calculates three types of present

values of pension wealth for a respondent’s current plan at any age: values that are available to

participants who qualify for early retirement (ER), values available once the respondent qualifies

for the plan’s normal retirement age (NR), and vested deferred benefits that accumulate over

time prior to any eligibility for retirement.




10
   Gustman, Steinmeier, and Tabatabai (2013) indentify underrerporting of public employment in the HRS. They find
that too many respondents report not working for the government compared to those who report employment not
covered by Social Security. I use a similar process to flag employment not covered by Social Security to investigate
whether they should be flagged correctly as government employees. However, a full treatment of those respondents
is outside the scope of this paper.
11
   For details, see https://www.rand.org/labor/aging/dataprod/fattable.html. The composition of the sample of public
employees consists of the original HRS sample (46 percent), the War Babies/CODA sample (13 percent), the Early
Baby Boomers (15 percent), and the Mid Baby Boomers (26 percent).

                                                         10
           While the early HRS pension employer surveys had low response rates, later surveys

create more complete matches, particularly in the 2010 wave where much of the public plan

information comes from employer websites.12 For public employees these data are primarily

defined benefit (DB) plan parameters – benefit formulas and age and service requirements to

meet early and normal retirement. I use the PEP that uses these parameters and Social Security

earnings information to calculate present values of defined benefit pension wealth at ages 51 and

older. The PEP data include defined contribution balances as well as required employee

contributions to the DB plan.

           Finally, I use restricted respondent geographic codes to identify the respondent’s state of

residence. This allows me to verify self-reports of Social Security coverage with other sources

of Social Security coverage by employee type. The publicly available HRS data include

estimates of Social Security wealth at key ages and an indicator of receipt, but these Social

Security benefits are not necessarily due to the current job. The Wisconsin Legislative Council

(2013) reports fund name, type of employee covered, as well as Social Security coverage among

other features of 87 large public pension plans.13 I match these coverage data by state of

residence and employee type. Public employees who are also covered by Social Security may

have another option available for early retirement – Social Security leveling. Clark at al (2017)

summarize state annuity options for Social Security leveling for the 20 out of 85 large state-

managed public pension plans that cover teachers, state, and/or local employees. 14                  Another

way public pension benefits feature of public retirements is Social Security leveling. Leveling is

pension data.
           13
            The HRS restricted pension data do not identify whether the respondent is covered by Social Security
unless the pension benefit must be coordinated with Social Security benefits. The HRS restricted data agreements
do not allow use of both the restricted geographic codes and restricted Social Security earnings records.

the option to get a higher pension benefit before claiming Social Security, but after claiming, the

pension benefit drops. Leveling is a policy variable that could be used to encourage or

discourage retirement.


Methods and Results


       The sample consists of state and local public employees employed in the public sector at

their baseline interview. It is natural, then, since they all start in the same employment state to

model their retirement in duration framework. The model underlying the analysis is a

proportional hazard model with time-varying covariates, which can be written as

                                   ℎ;   =            exp 

where the  include covariates that may change over time. As shown in Jenkins (1995), the

proportional hazards model leads to a binary response model for retirement at age t conditional

on not having retired prior to age t. The resulting response probability has the complementary

log-log form, which is different from both logit and probit in that it is the cumulative distribution

function of an asymmetric distribution. The implied model relates the probability of retirement

from a public sector job, conditional on not having retired prior to that age, to pension options

available for that individual, adjusting for covariates that factor into the retirement decision such

as health status, Social Security participation, and employer-provided health insurance in

retirement.

       To be more specific, the conditional probability that public employee i retires at age t is

where retire is a binary indicator for whether individual i retires at age t. Because retirement is

taken as the final state in the analysis, it takes on zero followed by one if a person is observed to

retire. The function ? for argument u is the complementary log-log cumulative distribution

function:

                                              ? = 1 − exp− exp?

which is used in a pooled binary response estimation.



The vector 9:;<= represents a vector of age dummies, whose coefficients can be turned into

estimates of the baseline hazard. Employee retirement options are captured by eligible, that is,

the employee may be eligible for early retirement or normal retirement. 15                      The present value of

pension wealth, pvwealth, is the present value of early retirement benefits if eligible, normal-age

retirement benefits if eligible, or the present value of vested deferred benefits if not yet eligible

for either early or normal retirement. The peak value concept, peakdiff, is the forward-looking

measure of the incentive to continued work developed by Coile and Gruber (2000, 2007). It

measures the difference between pension wealth at its maximum expected value and pension

wealth at today’s value. The HRS PEP includes defined contribution balances for the small set

of employees who have them in addition to their defined benefit plan. I include in indicator for

whether they have balances at entry into the survey to control for individual saving propensity.

Demographic variables are included in X. SSCov is the indicator for participation in Social

Security and SSelig is an interaction between the coverage variable and age 62, when early

retirement from Social Security is possible. I adjust the standard errors by clustering at the

household level.



15
     I set the early retirement dummy variable to zero once normal-age retirement eligibility is reached.

                                                             13
         Many of the dollar amounts (measured in 2012 dollars) in the data are zero (before

pension benefits are vested, for example) and there are extreme values for total assets and

pension wealth. I use the log-modulus transformation (John and Draper, 1980) to dampen

extreme values without having to use a special convention for zero values.16                      For values of

pension wealth away from zero, the log modulus transformation is very similar to taking the log.

Therefore, when interpreting the results, it makes sense to change the log modulus by something

like 0.01 (a one percent increase in pension wealth) or 0.10 (a ten percent increase in pension

wealth). In the latter case, this is the same as dividing the coefficient by 10. But because the

model is nonlinear, I will report the average partial effects of changing each variable, but these,

too, must be multiplied by the desired change on the log modulus.

         The baseline hazard, estimated with only age dummies (ages 51-72 and older) using

13,455 observations, is pictured in Figure 1. As Coile and Gruber (2007) note regarding Social

Security, the underlying structure of public pension plans – early and normal retirement

eligibility ages -- play a critical role in determining retirement decisions. There is a small peak

at age 55; that is, conditional on working to 55, the probability of retiring at this age is about .08.

The largest spike occurs around ages 60 and 62 – the probability of exiting during this interval

conditional on not having exited is .25. Table 1 illustrates the early and normal retirement

eligibility ages for the respondents that are calculated by the PEP program. That is, 1,294

respondents have an early retirement option, and based on their eventual years of service 16.69

percent of them (216) were eligible for early retirement at age 55, and 17.54 percent of them at

age 56. The most common eligibility age is 60 in the sample, with 15.73 percent attaining

normal retirement at that age.


16
  The transformation is g(x) = sign(x)log(|x| + 1) where sign(x) = 1, x >0, sign(x) = -1, x <0, and sign(x) = 0, x =0.
The function is strictly increasing and continuously differentiable, even at x = 0.

                                                           14
        Table 2 presents summary statistics for the data used in this analysis -- the teacher

category is the only industry or occupation category I summarize here. The sample size for entry

characteristics is 3,248 and 1,460 for characteristics measured in the retirement wave that I

eventually observe. Sixty-two percent of the sample is female, and 28 percent enter employed as

teachers. Twelve percent report being in fair or poor health and nine percent have spouses that

are already retired. Eighty-five percent of the sample is covered by Social Security and 24

percent have access to leveling. At retirement, 19 percent are eligible for early retirement

benefits, and 40 percent are eligible for normal retirement. Nine percent of the sample report

being offered an early-out package over and above their plan’s early retirement provisions.

        Table 3 presents the maximum likelihood estimation results of the complementary log-

log response probability. I report only the marginal effects of interest, but also have included age

and wave dummies, a female dummy, race, education, marital status, fair or poor health self-

reported status, whether a spouse is retired, broad occupation dummies, as well as the teacher

indicator, tenure and defined contribution balances at survey entry in the current job, and

earnings and assets transformed as discussed earlier. These are estimated on a sample that

includes missing data indicators.17

        The marginal effects of the dummy variables are interpreted as changes in the probability

of retiring from one’s public sector job. The results are consistent across all five specifications

so I discuss the estimates from the most complete model in column 5. Two personal

characteristics – having a spouse who is already retired and being in fair or poor health --

increase the probability of retirement by .029 and .057 respectively. They are highly statistically

significant. Employer provision of retiree health insurance encourages retirement for the two


17
  The complete cases hazards use between 3,093 and 4,830 observations. I note in the text where the results differ.
These results are available from the author.

young age categories highlighted and these estimates are precisely measured. This health

insurance increases the probability of retiring by .05 for those age 55 to 59 and by .04 for those

60 to 64, holding pension eligibility and Social Security coverage fixed. Social Security

coverage does affect the probability of retirement for those 60 to 64 by about .05, about the same

magnitude as access to health insurance in retirement. The effect of the Social Security leveling

variable is statistically insignificant when it is included for the two key age groups.

         I define the early retirement and normal retirement indicators to be mutually exclusive.

In plans without an early retirement option programmed in the PEP, the normal retirement

indicator is on and stays on once the normal retirement eligibility is reached. I estimate that

becoming eligible for early retirement increases the probability of retiring by .042 and this

estimate is statistically significant at conventional levels. Becoming eligible for normal

retirement also increases the probability of retiring but this estimate has a p-value of .09. I

estimate a positive as expected, but very small, statistically insignificant impact of retirement

wealth on retirement itself – whether at early or normal retirement.

         The peakdiff coefficient measures the effect of forward-looking incentives – the increase

in retirement wealth from continuing to work. Recall, this is measured as the difference between

pension wealth in the current wave (the present value of deferred vested benefits calculated in

the PEP at that age) and the maximum value of pension wealth, transformed as described

previously. There appears to be no effect of these financial incentives apart from becoming

eligible for retirement in these models. In other results that use complete cases of the data (not

reported here) I find a statistically significant but economically very small effect -- a ten percent

higher future value of retirement benefits is estimated to reduce the probability of retirement by

.0006.



                                                  16
        The HRS PEP is programed with the typical structure of the public sector pension plans

but not with special one-time offers to encourage retirement. The HRS publicly available data

includes questions about this potentially important labor management tool and I include a

general indicator for being offered an early out package as well as the indicator interacted with

the two pre-retirement age groups of interest. These offers are estimated to increase the

probability of retirement the most for the youngest employees -- by .096 regardless of age, and

by.048 for those age 55 to 59. The estimate for those ages 60-64 is .071 but is not statistically

significant.

        As discussed previously, it is in the public sector where defined benefit plans play an

important role now and in future retirement decisions and labor management choices – defined

contribution plans now dominate in private sector employment. But for completeness and

comparison purposes, I estimate similar hazard models on respondents in the HRS that I did not

flag as public employees at entry – these respondents are privately employed or (a small number

of) self-employed. I estimate the models on the private sector employees separately – in a model

that combined public and private sectors, a test that the pension variables have a similar effect

for the two types of employees was rejected with a p-value of .0002. Summary statistics are

provided in Table 4, and hazard model estimates in Table 5. I summarize the interesting

differences here.

        The private sample is only 40 percent female compared with my public sample of 60

percent, includes fewer non-white respondents, a higher percentage in poor health, and lower

percentages with post-high school education. The influence of having a retired spouse is

estimate to be twice as large at that in the public sector – increasing the retirement probability by

.061. The effect of health insurance in retirement is similar for both samples – increasing



                                                 17
retirement probabilities for the two pre-retirement age groups by about .04. The most interesting

differences are with respect to early retirement eligibility and Social Security coverage and the

findings are consistent with older retirement ages observed in the private sector. Becoming

eligible for early retirement in one’s private sector job is estimated to reduce the probability of

retiring by .036, holding pension wealth and Social Security coverage fixed. Unlike in the public

sector estimates, there is a statistically significant effect of wealth at early retirement but the

estimated effect is small – ten percent higher pension wealth increases the probability of retiring

by .002.

        The effect of Social Security, while positive and large generally (.13), is negative and

statistically significant for the younger age group – I estimate that Social Security coverage

reduces the probability of retiring by .04 for those 55-59 and increases it by .025 for those 60-64.

Finally, an early out offer increases the probability of first retirement from a private sector job by

.126 for those age 55-59, a much larger effect than the .048 for the comparable age group in the

public sector.



Discussion and Conclusion

        Evidence presented here suggests that public employee retirement is responsive to

program eligibility focal points – in particular becoming eligible for the plan’s early retirement

benefit through one’s age and years of service. But I find no evidence that pension wealth or

future pension incentives influence retirement separately. This finding is consistent with the

literature on default options in 401(k) plans documented by Choi at al (2002,2003). Defaults

established in these 401(k) plans affect plan participation and individual savings rates, for

example, perhaps because employees view them as implicit suggestions. The results in this



                                                   18
paper suggest that the same may true for defined benefit plans in the public sector. It is possible

that if becoming eligible for early retirement is perceived as reference point, deviations from that

point may be psychologically uncomfortable.18 This effect appears particularly strong in the

public sector results in comparison with the opposite impact in the private sector results.

           While personal circumstances like poor health have larger economic effects, state and

local governments, or school districts, can encourage retirement by offering retiree health

insurance, and offering an early out package. Or, conversely, they may choose to retain

employees longer by eliminating retiree health insurance (which, unlike pension benefits in most

state, are not constitutionally protected) or by changing the age/service combination for these

suggested retirement focal points. These findings do suggest that state legislative action to affect

retirement decisions and reduce future pension costs may be most effective operating through

plan eligibility rules and early-out incentives rather than plan generosity. Similarly, these

findings suggest that legislators may be able to reduce plan generosity without much affecting

retirement decisions.

            Some caveats of this work should be mentioned. I am unable to control for Social

Security wealth that is known to influence retirement along with pensions, although I do control

for earnings and coverage (Coile and Gruber, 2007). Further, this work focuses on the decision

to fully retire from the public sector – that is, the employees do not return to work elswhere.

Only about five percent of this sample report later part-time employment following retirement

from their public sector job. Given the use of final average salary in the defined benefit annuity,

part-time work would have to be done under a special arrangement like a DROP plan, or with

another employer. In future work it may be possible to identify states where DROP plans are

waves of the HRS may assist in the study of unretirement in the public sector.
