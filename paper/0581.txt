           International Effects on the U.S. Capital Market


                               ABSTRACT



    This paper presents evidence bearing on the question of international

influences on the U.S. capital market. Both the examination of relative

magnitudes of international asset holdings and the estimation of a simple

partial—equilibrium capital market model indicate that such influences are

potentially quite important. In particular, we find that the effects on

international flows on the long—term new—issue corporate bond rate -in the U.S.

are highly significant. Since this interest rate is often seen as crucial

in domestic investment decisions, the paper provides reason to believe that

investment in the U.S. is significantly influenced by international capital

transactions.

              International Effects on the U.S. Capital Market

                               David G. Hartman




         The past decade brought dramatic changes in the U.S. economy's dependence

on events occurring abroad. Some aspects of this dependence have been studied

extensively and are now understood quite well. Changes in the functioning of

the U.S. capital market due to external influences, while a matter of serious con-

cern in policy debates, have not been examined in detail. The purpose of this

paper is to explore how significant a role is played by international capital

flows.

         Much of the previous research on international capital holdings is concerned

with explaining the flows of capital themselves.1 In the case of the U.S., capital

flows have been explained by conditions in the domestic capital market, with no

attention given to a possible simultaneous effect of international capital trans-

actions on the domestic market. While an assumption that such impacts are negli-

gible seemed quite reasonable in the past, it is now the case, as we shall see, that

international capital transactions are sizable relative to the U.S. market.2 Before

turning to a more formal analysis of the effects of international capital transac-

tions on the U.S. capital market and, in particular, on the determination of

long—term interest rates, we will examine the nature and magnitudes of international

capital transactions. In Section II a model of the U.S. capital market is adapted

to allow examination of foreign influences. In Section III, empirical evidence

is presented which confirms the significance of international impacts on the

domestic capital market.

I. International Capital Holdings

       In this section, we will describe and analyze the levels of international

asset holdings to evaluate their potential for affecting the U.S. capital

market. At the outset an important question of aggregation arises.

       Since our goal is a study of macroeconomic effects, it might seem sufficient

to follow the convention, found in theoretical models of the open economy, of

considering net aggregate international capital holdings. These theoretical

models rely on a characterization of international capital flows as occurring

because of a premium in the overall return to capital in the recipient country.

       Even a crude empirical investigation suggests that the explanation of

capital flows into and out of the U.S. is more complicated. Table 1 shows the

correlations among the following quarterly capital flows during the decade of

the 1970's: U.S. direct investment abroad (DI°), foreign direct investment in

the U.S. (011), U.S. purchases of foreign equity (E°), foreign purchases of

U.S. equity (E1), U.S. purchases of foreign bonds (3°), foreign purchases of U.S.

private bonds (31) and foreign purchases of U.S. governemnt bonds (GB1).

       What seems remarkable in these numbers is the lack of high correlations

among the flows. In particular, inflows and outflows of the same categories

of capital fail even to exhibit the expected negative correlation in two of

three cases (or in one of three cases with data detrended); and the correlations

which are of the "correct" sign are not large. In only 9 of 21 cases (8 of 21

using detrended data) do the data confirm the expectation that capital outflows

would be positively related, capital inflows would be positively related, and

inflows would 'be negatively related to outflows.

       While this evidence is far from conclusive, it does suggest that interna-

tional flows of various assets have been determined over the past decade by a

variety of factors. To gain further insight into the nature of international

asset holdings, the remainder of this section will be devoted to discussions of

each asset category.



       A. U.S. Government Securities

       From a level of just over $10 billion at the beginning of 1970, foreign

holdings of U.S. government debt had, by the end of 1978, grown to almost

$138 billion, or approximately 20.23 percent of such bonds outstanding. This

marked increase is indicative both of the desirability of U.S. government obliga-

tions as a relatively safe store of value and of the role of the U.S. dollar as

the official reserve currency. The desire of oil—producing nations for the secur-

ity and liquidity provided by U.S. government bonds has been a particularly large

influence. More recently, foreign government interventions in the foreign exchange

market have been given as an explanation for massive changes in foreign holdings.

While the reasons for these transactions are both interesting and important, a

thorough examination is outside the primary focus of this paper.

       The foreign presence in the U.S. government bond market appears, from

casual observation, to be sufficiently large that the possibility of a significant

effect on the economy cannot be ruled out. Not only do foreign holdings make

up a sizable fraction of the government debt outstanding, but also the net

foreign purchases on a year—to—year basis are large and volatile enough to

drive a considerable wedge between the federal budget deficit and the domestic

deficit finance required. The pattern is shown in Table 2. In 1971, for example,

a federal deficit if $22 billion was offset by even greater U.S. government

borrowing from foreign sources.5 Also striking has been the situation in more

recent years. In contrast with 1975, when the record federal deficit of over

$70 billion was almost ninety percent fInanced at home, the $74 billion deficit

 during 1977—1978 was accompanied by foreign financing of over eighty percent

 of that amount. Then, during the first half of 1979, foreign governments, in

 attempting to stabilize a rising dollar, sold almost $18 billion of U.S. govern-

 ment obligations.

          Whether foreign holdings, of government securities have a significant impact

 on the U.S. capital market is a question left for the more formal analysis of

 Section III. However, to the extent that the domestic financing of government

 deficits is believed to have important effects, the raw data point to the signi-

 ficance of foreign transactions in government debt as well.


         B. Direct Investment

         Direct investment is the transfer of capital across national boundaries for

use in an operation over which the provider of the capital has control.

Specifically, capital transfers are designated by the Commerce Department as direct

investment, rather than portfolio investment, when a firm incorporated abroad

which receives the transfer is at least ten percent owned by the parent firm

providing the capital. Direct investment abroad by U.S. firms has long represented

the most sizable U.S. long—term capital outflow. For that reason, it has raised

considerable opposition in the U.S., particularly among those who fear that trans-

ferring U.S. capital abroad harms immobile factors of production such as U.S.

labor.

         Foreign firms also make direct investments in the U.S., but these capital

flows are a more recent and still much smaller phenomenon.     While U.S. firms had

invested a total of $174.5 billion abroad by the end of 1979, foreign investment in

the U.S. stood at only $46.7 billion. These figures reflect a very significant

recent growth, both in absolute terms and relative to the total shareholders'
                                   —7—

equity in U.S. corporations. From the beginning of 1970 until the end of 1979,

U.S. direct investment abroad grew from a level of 7.0 percent as large as total

U.S. corporate equity to a level of 14.2 percent. At the same time, foreign

direct investment in the U.S. more than tripled as a percentage of total U.S.

corporate equity: from 1.3 percent to 4.2 percent.

       In recent years some Americans have voiced concern about this rapid growth

in foreign control over U.S. production. Viewed in relation to U.S. capital

employed abroad, the level of foreign direct investment in the U.S. does not

seem so alarming. In addition, a close examination of the data reveals that,

while the level of foreign investment in the U.S. grew enormously in the period

1973—1974, even the rate of growth in U.S. investment abroad has not been markedly

smaller In other recent periods (see Figure 1).

       The size of these capital holdings leads one to anticipate that they might

have important effects on the U.S. capital market. Also, as Figure 2 shows, the

quarterly flows of capital are quite volatile. This volatility to transactions

implies significant quarter—to—quarter changes in the total direct investment

outstanding, contributing to the effects on the U.S. market which will be explored

later in this paper.



       C. Portfolio Investment in Private Securities

      Foreign portfolio holdings of private U.S. securities, at a level of

$60.1 billion at the end of 1979 was only slightly exceeded by the figure

($61.7 billion) for U.S. holdings of foreign securities. However, the composi-

tion of the assets held differs markedly. Just over eighty percent of the foreign

portfolio consists of the stock of U.S. firms, while nearly eighty percent of

the U.S. holdings are foreign bonds.

        1. Stocks

       The dominance of foreign purchases of U.S. stocks (capital inflows)

 over portfolio equity capital outflows also stands in sharp contrast, of course,

 to the situation with direct investment. With portfolio and direct investment

 taken together, U.S. equity investment abroad is far greater than foreign

equity investment in the U.S.

       U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign equity, which stood at about $13.8

billion at the end of 1979, or a value 1.1 percent as large as U.S. firms' total

equity outstanding, had, until 1979, exhibited very little fluctuation (see

Figure 3). The average rate of growth in U.S. dollar ownership of foreign stock

since 1965 has been about five percent per year. From the data on net purchases

of foreign stock presented in Figure 4 it is clear that the long—run increase

in investment position has resulted primarily from increases in the dollar value

of foreign stocks held, since net purchases had merely fluctuated around zero

for many years prior to 1979.

       From popular press reports, it would seem that U.S. investors are becoming

more interested in equity investments abroad. This interest has only recently

been reflected in the statistics on U.S. portfolios. In aggregate U.S. investors

were actually net sellers of over one—half billion dollars of foreign stocks in

1978, but unprecedented purchases occurred in 1979. For the present, at least,

U.S. holdings of foreign stocks seem inconsequential compared to the size of

the U.S. equity market.

       Of apparently greater potential importance in the U.S. capital market are

foreign holdings of U.S. stocks. Such foreign holdings were in 1960 less than

nine billion dollars; they rose to $39.1 billion by 1972 and have fluctuated

considerably since, standing at about $49.9 billion at the end of 1979 (or over

four percent of total U.S. stock outstanding). Changes in stock values are a

major cause of this growth. But even when net purchases are examined in isolation

(Figure 4), large annual variations are present. For example, annual net

purchases during the period 1974—1976 were: $.539 billion, $4.667 billion,

and $2.753 billion.

       The popular literature is quick to credit foreign investors with causing

major market movements, and detecting the presence of foreign buyers in the mar-

ket is a popular pastime of market analysts. One reason for believing that for-

eign holdings of less than five percent of the equity market could have a signi-

ficant impact is the volatility of foreign purchases and sales. Also, foreign

purchases cannot be easily compared to total transactions or holdings to determine

their impact, since a fluctuation in the foreign demand for securities, unlike

a domestic change, is likely to represent a change in overall U.S. asset demand.

It is important, therefore, that more formal empirical investigations be pursued.



       2. Bonds

       U.S. holdings of foreign bonds reached about $48 billion at the end of

1979, after twenty years of growth from a level of just over $3 billion. As

Figure 5 shows, this growth has been far from uniform, accelerating greatly in

the past five years. Specifically, U.S. holdings of foreign bonds grew at about

a five percent annual rate from 1965 through 1969, an eleven percent annual

rate from 1970 through 1973, and an eighteen percent annual rate from 1974

through 1979.

       The most obvious explanation of the recent acceleration in U.S. purchases

is the ending of the interest equaliztion tax (lET) in early 1974. The tax

was collected as an excise on purchases of foreign securities, with the tax on

bonds ranging from about one to fifteen percent (depending on the time to matur-

ity) at the beginning of the program. The rates were changed by Executive Order

several times. The maximum rate was 18.75 percent from August 1967 to April

1969, then 11.25 percent until January 1974. The effects of the 1969 and

1974 tax changes seem very obvious from Figure 5. However, the figures on

U.S. holdings of foreign bonds partially reflect changes in the U.S. dollar

value of bonds held as well as purchases and sales. When only net purchases

are considered (Figure 6), a dramatic effect on U.S. investor behavior is

apparent only after the lET elimination.

       Some idea of the potential effects of these transactions can be obtained

from comparing U.S. purchases of foreign bonds with figures on domestic bonds.

The level of U.S. holdings of foreign bonds stood, at the end of 1979, at nearly

twelve percent of the value of U.S. private domestic bonds outstanding. Net

purchases of foreign bonds are even more significant compared to net new

issues of U.S. corporate bonds, being nearly 17 percent as large in the 1976—

1979 period. In sunary, transactions in foreign bonds would seem to neither

dominate the U.S. market nor be sufficiently small that their effects could

safely be ignored.

       Foreign investment in U.S. private bonds is only about a quarter as large

as either U.S. holdings of foreign private bonds or foreign holdings of U.S.

stock. Figure 6 demonstrates, however, that foreign purchases of U.S. bonds

have, in the last year, reached an unprecedented magnitude and volatility. The

major reason seems to be OPEC purchases of U.S. bonds. Total OPEC purchases of

bonds, other than U.S. Treasury issues, reached $1.61 B in 1977, from a level

of $1.18 B in 1976 and $1.57 B in 1975.6 The Commerce Department noted a growing

trend in OPEC nations' purchases toward bonds privately placed by U.S. corporations.

      The recent growth in foreign transactions in private U.S. bonds has in-

creased the possibility of a significant impact on the U.S. economy. The 1977
                                   —14—

foreign purchases of over $3.7 billion in private U.S. bonds, for example,

amounted to over ten percent of U.S. firms'   net   bond issues. Therefore, it

is difficult to argue without further evidence either that foreign purchases

dominate the U.S. market or are inconsequential.

      II. Analyzing the Effects of
                                     International Capital Flows
            The international capital
                                        holdings discussed in the previous section
  would seem to be neither
                               so large that they dominate the
                                                                  U.S. capital market, nor
  so small that they can be
                                ignored in models of the U.S. capital market. While
  this evidence is of the
                              most casual sort, it would seem to rule out application
  of both the simplest
                       open economy models and closed economy models. In the former,
  capital flows across national boundaries
                                            to equalize rates of return, while in
  the latter, capital does not flow at all.

           Instead, we recognize the
                                        apparent overriding importance of special risks
 embodied in and the special
                                  institutional factors of importance in international
 investments. Assets available in the U.S. will be viewed
                                                           as imperfect substitutes
 for foreign assets, in terms of both domestic and
                                                   foreign asset demands. In
 addition, because international flows
                                              of different assets seem to respond very
 differently to market conditions, the
                                              asset categories we examined will be viewed
 as indicating assets which
                            are imperfect substitutes. This view is consistent
 with recent research on the
                             U.S. domestic capital market which emphasizes the

 imperfect substitutability of assets.7

          This previous research on closed
                                               economy capital markets will be utilized
in specifying domestic asset demand and supply
                                                      relationships. The portfolio
theory of asset demands implies that
                                          the allocation of the portfolio among assets
will depend on the rates of
                                return to all assets and the variances and covariances
of asset returns.
                   Anticipating the empirical implementation of the model in a
time series context, the second moments of asset
                                                 returns will be Suppressed
                                                                                   here,
under the assumption that
                              mean return changes play the major role in altering
portfolio decisions over time.
                                     Demands for government bonds,
                                                                     money, private bonds,
and   equities   can, therefore be written:

      WF =   net   financial wealth

      Z is a vector of other factors affecting asset demands



Again following previous work, such as Friedman (1980), we write the market

clearing condition as:



              AD =           AS                                                           (2)




where AS is a vector of asset supplies. AS includes, in a closed economy

model, zero values for inside assets, and the exogenously given values for

outside assets. That is, the asset demands are taken as net demands by the

domestic private sector.                  (2) is, therefore, a complete partial equilibrium model

of asset markets. Similar systems have been subjected to empirical analysis in

a variety of ways.

       The most direct method would be to estimate the parameters of each

equation in the system. In a series of papers, Friedman has explored structural

estimation of asset demand systems. From these estimates, market—clearing rates

of return can be derived for given levels of asset supplies.

      Alternatively, the system can, with the standard assumptions, be written

as:



      r = r(A5,                                                                          (3)
                WF .?)
                                        —17—


to emphasize the determination of rates of return.8 That is, for instance,

the long—term corporate bond yield depends on supplies of outside

assets and other demand determinants. In this initial attempt to incorporate

the effects of international capital transactions, we will emphasize the

determination of the long—term corporate bond rate which is viewed as crucial

in familiar neoclassical investment models. The other determinants, Z, consist

of inflation expectations and expectations of income (or output).9

       So, ignoring international transactions, we can write the individual yield

equation of interest as:


       rB = rB(GB,      H e e)                                                  (4)


where the outside assets are government bonds (GB) and money (M))°

       The inclusion of foreign holdings of domestic assets in this model can

be accomplished by viewing AS as the assets available to the domestic market.

Therefore:
                   GBS       GB — GB1

           s
                   MS            M
       A       =
                   BS        —B1
                   ES        —E1
                                                                                (5)




      Domestic holdings of foreign assets could be included by simply expanding

the menu of assets available. However, since the returns to these assets are not

established entirely in the domestic market and since the holdings of these

assets are often restricted by government policies, it seems more reasonable

to include holdings of foreign assets as influences on domestic asset demands.

Equation (4) therefore becomes, in an open economy context:11
                                   —18—

            rB(GB — GB1, M, e e B, B°, E', E°, D11, DI°)                          (6)




       Of course, the foreign holdings of government bonds (GB1), private bonds

(B1), portfolio equity (E1) and direct investment capital (D1) as. well as U.S.

holdings of foreign bonds (B°), portfolio equity (E°) and direct investment

capital (DI°) are in general functions of rB. So, (6) should not be taken as a

closed form relation, but only as a particular way of writing the asset market

equilibrium condition, which is convenient because the international asset

holdings are incorporated explicitly. Similarly, ,   e    and e are clearly

functions of rB.
                                               —19—
 III. Empirical Implementation

       The empirical estimation will use quarterly data from 1954 through

 1979. During that period, the levels of international asset holdings have

 experienced tremendous changes due to changes in government policies, fluctua-

 tions in the world's distribution of wealth, and structural changes in the world

economy. It might not be too implausible to assume these holdings exogenous in

empirical work. If so, we can estimate (6) directly, using distributed lags of

past values to represent e and e12

       Using the data described in the Appendix, we obtain the following:



       rB = — 129.41    + 2.76 (GB—GB') + 6.28 DI°—2.3l DI'

(deflated by the GNP deflator). In order to minimize problems of endogeneity of

the money supply, the monetary base is used here. A distributed lag is employed
                                     —20—

both to better represent influences on the current money supply and to represent

possible effects on expectations of other asset market influences. All distributed

lags are estimated as third degree polynomials.

       An attempt to expand, somewhat, the purely financial focus of the model by

incorporating a broader definition of wealth as an influence on asset demands

and supplies met with no success. As Feldstein and Chamberlain (1973) pointed

out, over a period of estimation non—financial components of wealth can vary and

should be included in the model. The inclusion of a logarithmic trend (to roughly

account for structural changes in asset markets over the twenty—six year period)

proxies for wealth sufficiently well that the several measures we tried were

highly insignificant in all cases.

       In general, the results are supportive of the view that changes in inter-

national asset holdings have important impacts on the U.S. capital market.

Although predictions of coefficient signs depend on the nature of asset substitu-

tion, it was expected that capital outflows would usually tend to increase the

bond yield while capital inflows would have the opposite effect. Except for

the coefficients of bond holdings, this expectation is realized. The coefficients

of the largest private holdings, DI° and E1 are highly significant. The coefficients

of DI' and E° are nearly significant at the .05 level, while the coefficient

of the net government bond supply is nearly significant at the .1 level. The

result with respect to bond holdings is, however, disturbing. The effect of B1

should be unambiguously negative. Since foreign bonds purchased by U.S. citizens

are largely dollar—denominated and issued in the U.S.. and thus are presumably

close substitutes for domestic bonds, the effect of B° should almost certainly

be positive. This result points to the possibility of bias due to simultaneity.

Of course, it would be anticipated that simultaneity would be a particular diff i—

culty in the case of bonds.
                                    —21—

        To reduce any simultaneity bias, lagged values of asset holdings are used

as instruments in reestimating (7)13 The results of a number of experiments

(see Table 3) are indicative of reduction in simultaneity bias. U.S. holdings

of foreign bonds now obtains the correct positive sign and the coefficients of

U.S. holdings of foreign equity are greater. However, foreign holdings of U.S.

bonds (B1) continues to have insignificant coefficients with the wrong sign.

Since the simple correlation of B° with B1 equals .984, it is not surprising that

separate coefficients for B° and B1 are difficult to estimate. However, most

foreign bonds held by U.S. residents are so similar in nature to domestic bonds that

it is sensible to consider the outside supply of bonds to be the net value

B° —   B.
        Equations (3.2) and (3.3) show the result of this aggregation. The

net bond holdings variable has the correct sign and is significant or nearly

significant at the .05 level. The difference between (3.2) and (3.3) is in the

treatment of government bonds. If, as we have been assuming, a decrease in

foreign holdings is exactly equivalent to an increase in the level of government

bonds outstanding, (3.3) is appropriate. Since the public's perception of govern-

ment bonds as an asset is controversial and since foreign holdings of these

bonds are an actual outside obligation, treating foreign holdings separately,

as in (3.2), may be justifiable. Since the right—hand variables in each equation

are in logs, no direct test of these specifications is possible, but estimating

separate coefficients does improve the fit. The level of government bonds out-

standing is insignificant, while the level of foreign holdings is significant; the

impact of a change in the level of foreign holdings is more than twice as great

as a change in the level of bonds outstanding (since foreign holdings represent

about twenty percent of the total).14 The explanatory power of each specification

is nearly identical. It appears, then, that we can be confident that changes in

foreign holdings of government bonds affect the U.S. corporate bond rate, but can

say little about the overall level of such bonds outstanding.

       Other specifications were tried to determine the impact of further aggrega-

tions. For example, equation (3.5) includes international holdings only as a net

aggregate value, which fails to obtain significance in the equation.15 In fact,

the two international asset variables taken together are not significant.

       The rest of the specifications have sets of international asset coefficients

significantly different from zero at the .01 level, with the equation (3.4)

coefficients barely exceeding that level of significance and the other equations'

coefficients exceeding the .01 level by wide margins.

       As indicated by equation (3.6) which contains no international asset

variables, the purely domestic factors of money supply, income, and inflation pro-

vide the major explanation of the corporate bond yield.16 In addition, the inclusion

of the international asset variables does very little to change the coefficients

of the domestic variables, since the correlations between these sets of variables

tend to be rather low.

       To summarize, then, U.S. holdings of foreign assets and foreign holdings

of U.S. assets have been shown to have significant effects on the U.S. corporate

bond rate. Disaggregation of these assets holdings by asset type also appears to

be quite important in isolating their effects. In particular, aggregation into

a net private asset holdings variable completely masks the important impacts these

asset holdings have on the U.S. capital market. When these holdings are disaggre—

gated, as in specification (3.2) all are individually significant at the .05 level

and have plausible signs. Capital outflows have positive impacts on the corporate

bond rate, whether the outflows result from U.S. purchases of foreign assets or

foreign sales of U.S. assets.
                                      —24—


         To put these effects in the context of historical patterns of inter-

national capital transactions, several simulations are performed, using the

estimated coefficients from equation (3.2). First, we test the effect of an

exogenous change which would have eliminated net foreign purchases of U.S.

government bonds after the end of 1977. Because this alternative eliminates

the very heavy foreign purchases through 1978, the increase in bond yields

which results (see Figure 7) is quite discernible, reaching 13 basis points by

the first quarter of 1979. Figure 8 shows the impact of keeping foreign hold-

ings at the 1973 level in real terms. For the three years following 1973 actual

foreign holdings declined in real terms, so under the alternative, interest

rates would actually have been lower. Then, the situation is reversed and the

yield on bonds would have risen somewhat higher than the increase which

actually occurred. However, similar changes in holdings of other assets would

have more significant effects.

         As an example of an alternative direct investment scenario, we examine the
                    4
impact   of exogenously holding direct investment at the 1975 level in real terms.

As Figure 9 shows, the yield on corporate bonds would have been as much as 98

basis points lower. Finally, Figure 10 shows the effect of not allowing net

foreign portfolio purchases of U.S. stock after the end of 1977.

         These exercises must be considered as illustrative only, since they are

the product of one asset market equation from a full economic system. In partic-

ular, both government policy responses and lagged responses from the real side

of the economy are not considered.

IV. Conclusions

       This paper has presented evidence bearing on the question of international

influences on the U.S. capital market. Both the examination of relative magnitudes

of international asset holdings and the estimation of a simple partial—equilibrium

capital market model indicate that such influences are quite important. In

particular, we have found that international effects on the long—term new—issue

corporate bond rate in the U.S. are highly significant. Since this interest rate

is often seen as crucial in domestic investment decisions, we have reason to be-

lieve that investment in the U.S. is significantly influenced by international

capital movements.

       Further research will be required before some highly important policy

questions can be addressed. For example, knowledge of the elasticities of

international capital holdings will be needed in order to determine whether

government policies to influence savings result in changes in domestic or

foreign investment. Such information will be difficult to discern in historical

evidence, since international asset holdings have been so strongly influenced by

government policies and by the changes in the world wealth distribution engendered

by oil price increases. What the present study has hopefully done is to indicate

that these questions are worth asking.

  See, for example, Branson (1968) and Kenen (1978).

 2We are concerned here with the effects on the long—term capital market.
  This author has recently provided evidence (Hartman (1979)) which suggests
  that foreign events have a significant impact on U.S. money market rates.

 31n the remainder of the paper this notation will be used to describe the asset
  holdings which are the result of these capital flows. Thus, a superscript "ii'
  win indicate foreign holdings of a U.S. asset, while "o" will be used to indicate
  U.S. holdings of a foreign asset.

 4All data utilized in this study are taken from the Flow of Funds Accounts of the
  Federal Reserve, and are collected from various original sources by the Federal
  Reserve. Stock and bond transactions are reported directly to the U.S. Treasury
  by banks, brokers, and dealers, and are published monthly in the Treasury
  Bulletin. The Commerce Department utilizes a survey to estimate direct investment
  flows which are then reported in the Survey of Current Business.

    analysis of foreign activity in the U.S. government bond market in the early
 1970's can be found in Adams (1973).

 7See Friedman (1977, 1979, 1980).

 8Because of the wealth constraint, only n—i of the n equations in the system are
  independent. Therefore, only relative rates of return can be determined. How-
  ever, if one asset return is fixed then the other returns can be determined.
  Following this line of reasoning, we will consider equation (3) to be a descrip-
  tion of how a truncated asset return vector is determined. Note that since net
  financial wealth is simply the aggregated value of outside asset supplies, it
  need not be included.       -




9The latter affects both liquidity preference and the willingness of net suppliers
 to provide inside assets.

 By utilizing a model of this form, we are not able to employ the restrictions im—
 pliedby the underlying asset demand theory (see Friedman (1979)). However, since
 our interest is in the international transactions, we choose to estimate their
 impacts in the most straightforward manner.

1J.S. holdings of foreign government bonds and the international holdings of money
  are not included because of empirical not theoretical considerations.
 Direct investment and portfolio equity investment are somewhat different phenomena
 and, hence, are treated as separate assets.

12There remains the issue of simultaneity of W, Y, and it with r3. Since rB is
  usually seen as having a lagged effect on these values, and because we are not
  particularly concerned about the coefficients of these variables, this problem
  will be ignored.
                                            —29—



13Such a procedure is not, of course, guaranteed to eliminate simultaneity problems,
  particularly when there is some evidence of serial correlation as in (7). However,
  this method should reduce the severity of the problem. Without specifying a model
  of the world asset market, that is the most that can be hoped for.

       similar s?ecification, in which log (GB—GB) from equation (3.3) is replaced by
     log (GB—SGB ),was tried with the result that   equaled approximately 1.7. The
     restriction 60 was tested, and could not be rejected with any reasonable conf 1—
     dence.

15Across equations,     significance tests are not possible because aggregation is
  not formally a coefficient restriction in a regression of this functional form.
  However, the difference in explanatory power between (3.5) and, for example, (3.3)
  is quite substantial.  (If the difference in specification could be treated as
  approximately the same as four coefficient restrictions, the F—value for rejecting
  those restrictions would exceed 7).

     (3.2), we find that the major influences on rB come from the domestic variables.
