                            Tax Reform and Housing


                                   ABSTRACT

      Current tax law provides tax advantages to owner—occupied housing that
increase with a household's income. This well understood fact has led to
periodic proposals to substitute a tax credit equal to, say, 25 percent of
housing—related expenses for their current deductibility. Because all of the
tax reforms considered in this paper (Hall—Rabushka, Kemp—Kasten and Bradley—
Gephardt) move toward a flat rate schedule, they all will sharply reduce the
tax—advantages of owner—occupied housing to higher income households relative
to lower income households. In fact, our analysis suggests that all reforms
will lower the price of obtaining housing services from owner—occupied housing
for these households and raise it for higher—income households. The
"breakeven" income at which the price of these housing services would be
unchanged is about $55,000 for Kemp—Kasten and Hall—Rabushka probably $10,000
less for Bradley—Gephardt.

      The price of renting housing should rise under all reforms, probably by 5
to 10 percent. In combination with the decline in the price of obtaining
housing services for middle and lower income households, this should give a
signficant boost to homeownership. Under Kemp—Kasten, Ownership rates will
rise for four—member households with AGI (as renters) of under $60,000; for
higher income households Ownership could decline marginally. The breakeven
income level is roughly $40,000 for Bradley—Gephardt and $35,000 or Hall—
Rabushka.

                              Tax Reform and Housing

                     Patric H. Hendershott and David C. Ling



      There are two housing decisions for a household: whether to own or rent

and how much housing to obtain, given that one owns or rents. Second or

vacation houses for personal use only are part of the "how much" decision (and

housing renovation spending is one method of getting more housing). The two

decisions are affected differently by taxes. To a first approximation, tenure

choice depends on the average tax rate at which interest and property taxes are

deductible and the return on own equity is exempt, while the quantity decision

depends on the marginal tax rate (Hendershott and Slemrod, 1983). Assuming

that households itemize, and it is difficult to imagine that many households

(except for the wealthy) purchasing homes today would not itemize given the

current level of interest rates, both of these tax rates would depend on the

entire "tax schedule" ——   the standard deduction, the value of personal

exceptions, and the marginal rates applicable to different increments of

taxable income. The tenure choice tax rate also depends on the deductibility

of nonhousing—related items (state and local taxes other than property taxes,

medical expenses, etc.). More specifically, if an excess standard deduction

exists ——   if the standard deduction exceeds nonhousing—related deductions ——
then part of housing—related deductions are wasted (do not reduce taxable

income)

      A number of tax plans have been proposed as substitutes for the present

tax system, the most prominent being Hall—Rabushka (the pure flat rate tax)

Bradley—Gephardt, and Kemp-.Kasten. This paper considers the likely impact of

these three plans, relative to current law, on the demand for owner and rental

housing per household and on the homeownership rate.1 These proposals change
                                         —2—



every aspect of the tax schedule and, to different degrees, alter the treatment

of both nonhousing and housing related deductions. They also change the tax

treatment of rental housing which would affect both the amount of housing

demanded by renters and the homeownership rate.

         We do not calculate changes in the quantities of owner and rental housing

demanded and in the homeownership rate. Rather, we compute changes in the

prices of obtaining housing services by owning and renting. The directional

changes in these prices indicate whether more of less housing would be demanded

by households at different income levels (under different tax regimes) and the

change in the ratio of these prices indicates whether the homeownership rate is

likely to rise or fall. Before—tax incomes and all prices except those of

obtaining housing services are held constant throughout the analysis.

Calculations are performed first with constant interest rates, and then with

rate changes that seem to be plausible responses to enactment of the reforms.

         The paper is divided into three sections and a summary. Section I

computes the impact of the reorms on the prices of obtaining housing services

from owner—occupied housing and thus on the quantity of owner—occupied housing

demanded. Section II computes the impact on the price of obtaining rental

housing services and thus on the quantity of them demanded and, in conjunction

with the earlier analysis, on the homeownership rate. The computations are

redone in Section III after allowing for reform—induced declines in interest

rates.

                           I. Current Law and the Reforms

      The top panel of Table 1 presents taxable income and a variety of tax

rates for households with adjusted gross income, assuming they rented, of 17½,

27½, 40, and 70 thousand dollars. Separate data are computed for renting and

owning households. The calculations assume:

      (1) the households have the average nonhousing itemized deductions of
                       S
            their   income classes (based on 1981 SOl data)

      (2)   the households file jointly and claim 4 total exemptions,

      (3)   owning households with middle and lower incomes finance 90 percent

            of their purchases with a 12.65 percent (13 percent including the

            cost of mortgage default insurance) fixed—rate mortgage, purchase a

            house of size such that their mortgage payments equal 28 percent of

            their income, and pay property taxes equal to 1.2 percent of the

            house value, and

      (4) higher income owning households will purchase a house such that

            their payments equal 30 percent of their income.

As can be seen, under current law the average tax rates nearly triple, for both

renters and owners, as income rises from $l7½ thousand to $70 thousand; the

marginal rates increase by about 2½ times.2

      The next three panels provide comparable data for the three tax reforms.

Assuming no impact on interest rates, average tax burdens under Kemp—Kasten

(KK) and Bradley—Gephardt (BG) appear to be about as progressive as under

current law (maybe a little more progressive for KK owners and BG renters) .    In
contrast, progressivity is significantly reduced under Hall—Rabushka (HR); the

average tax rates do not double for either renters or owners.

       Under KK, the marginal tax rates relevant to the quantity of owner—

occupied housing demanded are all 0.20 over this income range. This is less

than that applicable under current law for households with AGI (if they rented)

above about $45,000 and more for households with ACT below this amount. Thus,

ceteris paribus, housing demand would be stimulated for middle and low income

households (in the absence of affordability constraints) and reduced for high

income households. Under BC, the marginal tax rates roughly track those

existing under current law over this income range but are slightly less,

implying a minor reduction, in housing demand across the board. However,

because interest is deductible at only the 0.14 rate, the demand by higher

income households will be more sharply reduced.     (As a partial offset, higher

income Wealthy households will increase the portion of housing that is equity

financed ——    the tax rate at which own equity finance is implicitly deductible

is the higher 30 percent.) The zero deductibility under HR implies a

significant drop in housing demand in the absence of a decline in before—tax

interest rates (see below) -

       We   next consider the tax rate relevant to the tenure choice. For the

income levels considered, this rate lies between the marginal tax rates for

owners and renters under current tax law. Such would not be the case for lower

income households (AGI on renter basis below about $16,000) because a

significant part of their housing deductions would be wasted (their nonhousing

deductions are less than their standard deduction) .   This phenomenon is very
clear under both the KK and BC plans. These plans effectively eliminate the

deduction for medical exemptions (only over 10 percent of AGI), and KK

eliminates the deduction for state and local income taxes. Moreover, BC raises

the standard deduction from the current $3,400 to $6,000 (KK raises this to

$3,500) .   Thus the excess standard deductions are substantial except at high
                                          —6—



incomes, and at other than high incomes the tenure choice tax rate is an

average of zero and the marginal rate (14 or 20 percent) .     The resultant tenure

choice tax rate for KK is slightly less than under current law for households

with AGI below $30,000 but a quarter less for those with higher incomes. For

BG, the tenure choice tax rate is less than half that under current law for all

AGI and is zero for those with AOl below about $16,000 (the excess standard

deduction exceeds housing—related expenses) .     For HR, the tenure choice tax
rate, like the quantity choice tax rate, is zero.



   II. The Price of Obtaining Housing Services from Owner—Occupied Housing

      To obtain the services of a capital unit such as a house for a year, one

must pay for the financing and "upkeep". The financing cust is the real

interest rate; upkeep includes maintenance and a charge for economic

depreciation to the extent that the capital is not fully maintained. In

addition, taxes must be paid and tax savisigs, owing to deductions, are earned.

To a first approximation, the annual cost. of obtaining the use of a dollar's

worth of owner—occupied housing to the jth household (co.) under current law is



      co. =   (l—'r.)i   — ii + yd + m + (l—Tjp                            (1)




where i is the mortgage rate, ii is the expected rate of appreciation in the

house, d is the depreciation rate (which is applied to only the structure

portion, y, of the house) , m is the maintenance rate, p is the property tax

rate, and T. is the relevant tax rate of the jth household. As discussed in

the previous section, . depends intricately on the tax schedule and different

values need to be employed in calculations of the cost of owning generally and

of owning an additional dollar of housing.
                                         —7—



       Equation (1) holds when the risk—adjusted after—tax costs of equity and

debt financing are equal, expectations regarding future inflation, interest,

and tax rates are constant, and there are no transactions or selling costs

(Fjendershott and Shilling, 1982). More generally, (l—Tji is replaced by

(l_T)vi +      (l—v)e.,   where v is the ratio of the loan value in period t to

the initial house value and e. is the after—tax cost of equity finance for the

jth household. We assume that e. equals the maximum of (i—ni and 0.7i (a

proxy for the tax exempt rate) plus a 0.03 risk premium, that v equals 0.9 and

that the mortgage amortizes over 30 years. We also assume selling costs of 6

percent of the house sale value and a holding period of eight years. Lastly,

the other assumptions are an i (including a 35 basis point default premium) of

0.13, in of 0.05, m of 0.035, Is of 0.83, d of 0.012, and p of 0.012. With

these assumptions, the costs for the quantity—demanded and tenure choice

decisions, under current law and the reform proposals, are those listed in

Table 2.

      The prices or costs of owner—occupied housing decline with income under

current law because the deductions are worth more as incomes rise (T
                                                                      J
increases) .   Under each of the three reform proposals this is not true

regarding the quantity—demanded decision because all households deduct at the

same tax rates, 0.20 under XX, 0.14 under BG, and 0.00 under HR.     (Of course,

the higher the tax rate the lower the price of housing services.) There is

exception. At high income levels own—equity becomes cheaper under Bradley—

Gephardt (funds invested elsewhere are taxed at the 30 percent rate) and thus

the price falls. This should induce these households to shift toward equity

financing, and the numbers in parentheses reveal that a shift to a 75 percent

loan—to—value ratio does reduce the price slightly. The price relevant to the

tenure choice is also constant across income classes for Hall—Rabushka. The

tenure—choice price declines somewhat with income under the other reforms

because the excess standard deduction eats up a smaller portion of housing—

related deductions the greater is income, and thus the size of the house.

        The percentage changes in the prices or costs indicate the impact of the

reforms relative to current law. For the quantity—demanded prices, the pattern

of change is that noted above in our discussion of tax rates. Lower income

households will demand more housing under Kemp—Kasten because the value of

their deductions increases, and higher income households demand less for the

opposite reason. The same pattern holds under Bradley—Gephardt, but only those

with incomes under $17,500 demand more housing. With Hall—Rabushka all

households demand less housing and high income households would demand much

less. For the tenure decision, the changes in these prices must be compared to

changes in the price of obtaining housing services from rental housing.



                     III. Rental Housing and the Tenure Decision

        The approximate annual cost of renting a dollar's worth of housing (cr)

can be obtained from an expression analogous to equation (1)



        (l—t)cr =   (l—T)i — (l—T)r + yd + (l—T) (p+o+m) —   Tyd,          (2)




where T   is   now the tax rate of the marginal investor in rental housing,            is

the concurrent equivalent tax rate on capital gains, a is the operating expense
               *
rate,   and d is the annual—equivalent rate at which the rental structure can be

depreciated for tax purposes. Equation (2) differs from (1) is a number of

important ways: the returns to investors in rental housing ——       both   cr and iT    ——
                                      —10—




are taxed (the latter lightly owing to deferral and a low statuary rate)1

maintenance expenditures are deductible, and some depreciation measure is also

deductible. The various tax reforms affect T,   t and d.
      Equation (2) is, like (1) , an approximation. Actual calculations require

specification of an initial loan—to—value ratio (v) , an amortization period, a

required after—tax return on equity (e) , a holding period, recapture

provisions, and the treatment of construction period interest and property

taxes. We assume v =0.78, a 30 year loan, e0.7i + 0.03,      ir=O.05,


d0.017, and p+o +   m0.035.   The assumed tax treatments under current law and

the tax reforms are listed in Table 3. The holding period is determined

optimally following Hendershott and Ling (1984); to a first approximation, the

optimal period is that which maximizes id —   t. With      this period, cr is

calculated following Hendershott and Shilling (1982). The bottom row of the

table indicates that the KK and BG plans would raise the cost of renting by 14

percent, while HR would raise it by 29 percent. This would clearly reduce the

quantity of rental housing demanded by existing renters.

      Tenure choice and thus the homeownership rate depends on the ratio of the

cost of obtaining housing services from owner housing relative to that from

rental housing. The remainder of Table 4 reports this ratio under current law

and the three reforms. The fact that these ratios are all below unity does

not, of course, mean that all family households with incomes above $17,500 will

be owners. Those with shorter expected holding periods or with greater

aversion to or less talent for maintenance will have higher costs for owning

and thus could prefer to rent.

     All reforms lower the cost of owning relatively for households with

income below about $40,000 (about $70,000 for KK) and thus would increase

ownership among these households. In contrast, the ownership rate would

decline under HG and HR for households with incomes over $40,000 (over about

$70,000 for KK)



         IV. The Impact of Reform—Induced Declines in Interest Rates

      The level of interest rates in an economy depends on many factors. One

of these is the tax treatment of interest expense. The more liberally interest

expense can be deducted, the higher a pretax interest rate are borrowers

willing to pay. More generally, if at is the composite equilibrium after—tax

rate of return borrowers are willing to pay at the margin and T   is the

marginal tax rate of these borrowers, then



            i =   i at/(l—Tx).                                           (3)



That is, the pretax rate is simply the after—tax rate grossed up for the tax

 rate. Again,      is greater the more liberally is interest deducted.

       In our earlier calculations, we held i constant, implicitly assuming no

 change in T. This seems patently inappropriate. All of the reforms cut the

 deductibility of interest for households and corporate and nonincorporated

 businesses. The extreme case is Hall—RabuShka under which no interest is

 deducted, i.e., O. The biggest difficulty is determining T under current

 law. We arbitrarily set it equal to 0.3. Thus at equals 0.091 ( a real

 after—tax rate of 4 percent plus a 5 percent expected inflation premium) , and   i



 will fall from 0.13 to 0.091 if Hall—RabuShka is adopted. We set T0.25 under

 both Kemp—Kasten and Bradley—Gephardt; thus i declines to 0.1213.
                                            —14-.




           The pretax interest rate, it, could also change. For one thing, reduced

taxation of business capital, such as was provided for in the ERTA of 1981,

would tend to raise the pretax rate (see Hendershott and Shilling, 1982)              ,   while
increased taxation, such as implemented in the TEFRA of 1982 and the DRA of

1984, would act to lower at For another, saving could respond insofar as the

after—tax return to savers is changed. While the change in the rate paid to

domestic savers is unclear (and the directional impact on saving is uncertain

in any event) ,     the   after—tax return to foreign savers is certainly lowered (the

pretax rate falls and their tax rate is presumably unchanged)       ,   and this would

tend to reduce their demand for American securities and thus raise i              .       We
                                                                             at
leave a full consideration of these factors until a later date and simply treat

i        as a constant.
    at

          Tables 5 and 6 are analogues to Tables 2 and 4 except that the tax

reforms are assumed to have reduced the level of interest rates. The six

percent (87 basis point) lower interest rate triggered by KK and BC reduces the

percentage change in the cost of owner—occupied housing induced by both KK and

BC by six percent at all income levels. The 30 percent decline in interest

rates under HR reduces the percentage change in the cost of owner—occupied

housing by 30 percent for family households with incomes under $30,000 and by

up to nearly 40 percent at incomes of $75,000. With allowance for interest

rate declines, HR is as favorable to owner—occupied housing as BC and more

favorable than ICC.       In fact, if affordability is a major constraint on the

quantity of housing demanded, then the sharp decline in rates under HR would

substantially increase demand.5

          The cost of rental housing rises less with KK and BC when interest rates

are allowed to adjust downward. Thus, the quantity of rental housing demanded

by existing households will still fall. In contrast, with HR the cost of

rental housing now declines, suggesting an increase in rental housing demand.

As for the tenure choice, the changes in the ratios of costs are virtually

unaltered for KK, are about 2 percentage points less at all income levels for

BG and are about 3 percentage points greater for HR. The basic theme remains

that homeownership will increase for family households with incomes below

$35,000 (HR) to $65,000 (KK) and will decrease for family households with

higher incomes. Because HR is so favorable to rental housing, HR would reduce

ownership at all income levels relative to KK and would do so for family

households with incomes above $30,000 relative to BC. BC, too, would result in

lower ownership rates relative to KK at all income levels.



                                  V. Summary

      Current tax law provides tax advantages to owner—occupied housing that

increase with a household's income level. This well understood fact has led to

periodic proposals to substitute a tax credit equal to, say, 25 percent of

housing—related expenses for their current deductibility.6 Because all of the

tax reforms being considered go to (nearly) flat rate schedules, they all will

sharply reduce the tax—advantages of owner—occupied housing to higher income

households relative to lower income households. In fact, our analysis suggests

that all reforms will lower the price of obtaining housing services from

owner—occupied housing for these households and raise it for higher—income

households. The "breakeven" income at which the price of these housing

services would be unchanged is about $50,000 for Kemp—Kasten and probably

$10,000 to $25,000 less for Bradley—Cephardt and Hall—Rabushka, the difference

depending on the amount interest rates decline.
                                     —18—



     This leveling of marginal tax rates has broad implications for the wealth

redistributions of the tax reforms. Even if the reform adopted leaves tax

shares unchanged over income ranges, a redistribution of wealth from wealthy to

less wealthy (not poor) households is certain to occur. The equilibrium value

of land upon which expensive houses are built will decline, and that upon which

cheaper houses lie will rise. Expensive houses themselves will fall in price

for a period (a very long period in slow growing parts of the country) during

which new construction will be minimal. Other tax—sheltered assets, such as

tax—exempt bonds, will also decline in value, while fully—taxed bonds will

increase in price.

      The price of renting housing should rise under all reforms, probably by 5

to 10 percent. In combination with the decline in the price of obtaining

housing services by middle and lower income households, this should give a

signficant boost to homeownership. Under Kemp—Kasten, ownership rates will

rise for four—member households with AOl (as renters) of under $65,000; for

higher income households ownership could decline marginally. The breakeven

income level for Bradley—Gephardt and Hall—Rabushka is roughly $35,000 to

$40,000.

                                         Notes



     *
         This research is part of the NEER's project on capital formation and was

         supported by the National Association of Homebuilders, where Ling was

         employed when this paper was written.

1. A possible impact on housing even prior to the tenure choice should be

         noted, namely the impact on how the population forms into households.

         Some recent evidence suggests that headship rates, and thus the number of

         households, will be greater the lower are the real prices of housing

         services derived from owner and rental housing (Hendershott and Smith,

         1984)

2. The basic methodology for calculating all the tax rates in Table 1 is laid

         out in Hendershott and Slemrod (1983). An excellent summary of the tax

         reform plans is given in Burton (1984) -

3.       For the exact methodology underlying the calculations, see Hendershott and

         Shilling (1982)

4. We thank Harvey Galper for drawing this to our attention. Any decline in

         1at would lower the value of the dollar, a favorable side effect according

         to most observers.

5. A decline in nominal interest rates would also impact very favorably on

         the housing finance system, generating positive market value for thrift

         institutions and FNMA.

6. Higher income households would still have a larger tax advantage than

         lower income households because the after—tax opportunity cost of their

         own equity invested in housing is less than that of lower income

         households. For a full discussion of the advantages of owner—occupied

         housing under current law, see Hendershott (1983)
