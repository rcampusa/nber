                                         ABSTRACT

Innovation is often predicated on discovering useful new combinations of existing knowledge in
highly complex knowledge spaces. These needle-in-a-haystack type problems are pervasive in
fields like genomics, drug discovery, materials science, and particle physics. We develop a
combinatorial-based knowledge production function and embed it in the classic Jones growth
model (1995) to explore how breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) that dramatically
improve prediction accuracy about which combinations have the highest potential could enhance
discovery rates and consequently economic growth. This production function is a generalization
(and reinterpretation) of the Romer/Jones knowledge production function. Separate parameters
control the extent of individual-researcher knowledge access, the effects of fishing out/
complexity, and the ease of forming research teams.

The potential for continued economic growth comes from the vast search space that we
  can explore. The curse of dimensionality is, for economic purposes, a remarkable
    blessing. To appreciate the potential for discovery, one need only consider the
 possibility that an extremely small fraction of the large number of potential mixtures
                    may be valuable. (Paul Romer, 1993, pp. 68-69)


Deep learning is making major advances in solving problems that have resisted the best
attempts of the artificial intelligence community for years. It has turned out to be very
   good at discovering intricate structure in high-dimensional data and is therefore
   applicable to many domains of science, business, and government. (Yann LeCun,
                   Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffrey Hinton, 2015, p. 436)


1. Introduction



       What are the prospects for technology-driven economic growth? Technological
optimists point to the ever-expanding possibilities for combining existing knowledge into
new knowledge (Paul Romer, 1990, 1993; Martin Weitzman, 1998; Brian Arthur, 2009;
Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, 2014).         The counter case put forward by
technological pessimists is primarily empirical: Growth at the technological frontier has
been slowing down rather than speeding up (Tyler Cowen, 2011; Robert Gordon, 2016).
Gordon (2016, p. 575) highlights this slowdown for the US economy. Between 1920 and
1970, total factor productivity grew at an annual average compound rate of 1.89 percent,
falling to 0.57 percent between 1970 and 1994, then rebounding to 1.03 percent during
the information technology boom between 1994 and 2004, before falling again to just
0.40 percent between 2004 and 2014. Even the maintenance of this lowered growth rate
has only been possible due to exponential growth in the number of research workers
(Charles Jones, 1995). Nicholas Bloom, Charles Jones, John Van Reenen, and Michael
Webb (2017) document that the total factor productivity in knowledge production itself
has been falling both in the aggregate and in key specific knowledge domains such as
transistors, healthcare, and agriculture.



       Economists have given a number of explanations for the disappointing growth
performance. Cowen (2011) and Gordon (2016) point to a “fishing out” or “low-hanging
fruit” effect – good ideas are simply becoming harder to find. Benjamin Jones (2009)

                                            2
points to the headwind created by an increased “burden of knowledge.” As the
technological frontier expands, it becomes harder for individual researchers to know
enough to find the combinations of knowledge that produce useful new ideas. This is
reflected in PhDs being awarded at older ages and a rise in team size as ever-more
specialized researchers must combine their knowledge to produce breakthroughs (Ajay
Agrawal, Avi Goldfarb, and Florenta Teodoridis, 2016). Other evidence points to the
physical, social, and institutional constraints that limit access to knowledge, including the
need to be physically close to the sources of knowledge (Adam Jaffe, Manuel Trajtenberg,
and Rebacca Henderson, 1993; Christian Catalini, 2017), the importance of social
relationships in accessing knowledge (Joel Mokyr, 2002; Agrawal, Iain Cockburn, and
John McHale, 2006; Agrawal, Devesh Kapur, and McHale, 2008), and the importance of
institutions in facilitating – or limiting – access to knowledge (Jeff Furman and Scott
Stern, 2011).



       Despite the evidence of a growth slowdown, one reason to be hopeful about the
future is the recent explosion in data availability under the rubric of “big data” and
computer-based advances in capabilities to discover and process those data. We can view
these technologies in part as “meta technologies” – technologies for the production of
new knowledge. If part of the challenge is dealing with the combinatorial explosion in
the potential ways that existing knowledge can be combined as the knowledge base
grows, then meta technologies such as deep learning hold out the potential to partially
overcome the challenges of fishing out, the rising burden of knowledge, and the social and
institutional constraints on knowledge access.



       Of course, meta technologies that aid in the discovery of new knowledge are
nothing new.     Mokyr (2002; 2017) gives numerous examples of how scientific
instruments such as microscopes and x-ray crystallography significantly aided the
discovery process. Nathan Rosenberg (1998) provides an account of how technology-
embodied chemical engineering altered the path of discovery in the petro-chemical
industry. Moreover, the use of artificial intelligence for discovery is itself not new and
has underpinned fields such as cheminformatics, bioinformatics, and particle physics for


                                             3
decades. However, recent breakthroughs in AI such as deep learning have given a new
impetus to these fields.5 The convergence of GPU-accelerated computing power,
exponential growth in data availability buttressed in part by open data sources, and the
rapid advance in AI-based prediction technologies is leading to breakthroughs in solving
many needle-in-a-haystack problems (Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb, 2018). If the curse of
dimensionality is both the blessing and curse of discovery, advances in AI offer renewed
hope of breaking the curse while helping to deliver on the blessing.



       Understanding how these technologies could affect future growth dynamics is
likely to require an explicitly combinatorial framework. Weitzman’s (1998) pioneering
development of a recombinant growth model has unfortunately not been well
incorporated into the corpus of growth theory literature. Our contribution in this paper
is thus twofold. First, we develop a relatively simple combinatorial-based knowledge
production function that converges in the limit to the Romer/Jones function. The model
allows for the consideration of how existing knowledge is combined to produce new
knowledge and also how researchers combine to form teams. Second, while this function
can be incorporated into existing growth models, the specific combinatorial foundations
mean that the model provides insights into how new meta technologies such as artificial
intelligence might matter for the path of future economic growth.



       The starting point for the model we develop is the Romer/Jones knowledge
production function. This function – a workhorse of modern growth theory – models the
output of new ideas as a Cobb-Douglas function with the existing knowledge stock and
labor resources devoted to knowledge production as inputs. Implicit in the Romer/Jones
formulation is that new knowledge production depends on access to the existing
knowledge stock and the ability to combine distinct elements of that stock into valuable
new ideas. The promise of AI as a meta technology for new idea production is that it
facilitates the search over complex knowledge spaces, allowing for both improved access
to relevant knowledge and improved capacity to predict the value of new combinations.

 See, for example, the recent survey of the use of deep learning in computational chemistry by
Garrett Goh, Nathan Hodas, and Abhinav Vishnu (2017).

                                               4
It may be especially valuable where the complexity of the underlying biological or
physical systems has stymied technological advance, notwithstanding the apparent
promise of new fields such as biotechnology or nanotechnology. We thus develop an
explicitly combinatorial-based knowledge production function. Separate parameters
control the ease of knowledge access, the ability to search the complex space of potential
combinations and the ease of forming research teams to pool knowledge access. An
attractive feature of our proposed function is that the Romer/Jones function emerges as
a limiting case. By explicitly delineating the knowledge access, combinatorial and
collaboration aspects of knowledge production, we hope that the model can help
elucidate how AI could improve the chances of solving needle-in-a-haystack type
challenges and thus influence the path of economic growth.



       Our paper thus contributes to a recent but rapidly expanding literature on the
effects of AI on economic growth. Much of the focus of this new literature is on how
increased automation substitutes for labor in the production process. Building on the
pioneering work of Joseph Zeira (1998), Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo (2017)
develop a model in which AI substitutes for workers in existing tasks but also creates new
tasks for workers to do. Philippe Aghion, Benjamin Jones, and Charles Jones (2018) show
how automation can be consistent with relatively constant factor shares when the
elasticity of substitution between goods is less than one. Central to their results is
Baumol’s “cost disease,” which posits the ultimate constraint on growth to be from goods
that are essential but hard to improve rather than goods whose production benefits from
AI-driven technical change. In a similar vein, William Nordhaus (2015) explores the
conditions under which AI would lead to an “economic singularity” and examines the
empirical evidence on the elasticity of substitution on both the demand and supply sides
of the economy.



       Our focus is different from these papers in that instead of emphasising the
potential substitution of machines for workers in existing tasks, we emphasise the
importance of AI in overcoming a specific problem that impedes human researchers –
finding useful combinations in complex discovery spaces. Our paper is closest in spirit to


                                            5
Iain Cockburn, Rebecca Henderson, and Scott Stern (2018), which examines the
implications of AI – and deep learning in particular – as a general purpose technology
(GPT) for invention. We provide a suggested formalization of this key idea. Nielsen
(2012) usefully illuminates the myriad ways in which “big data” and associated
technologies are changing the mechanisms of discovery in science. Nielsen emphasizes
the increasing importance of “collective intelligence” in formal and informal networked
teams, the growth of “data-driven intelligence” that can solve problems that challenge
human intelligence, and the importance of increased technology facilitating access to
knowledge and data. We incorporate all of these elements into the model developed in
this paper.



       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we outline some
examples of how advances in artificial intelligence are changing both knowledge access
and the ability to combine knowledge in high dimensional data across a number of
domains. In Section 3, we develop an explicitly combinatorial-based knowledge
production function and embed it in the growth model of Jones (1995), which itself is a
modification of Romer (1990). In Section 4, we extend the basic model to allow for
knowledge production by teams. We discuss our results in Section 5 and conclude in
Section 6 with some speculative thoughts on how an “economic singularity” might
emerge.



2. How Artificial Intelligence is Impacting the Production of Knowledge: Some Motivating
Examples



       Breakthroughs in AI are already impacting the productivity of scientific research
and technology development. It is useful to distinguish between such meta technologies
that aid in the process of search (knowledge access) and discovery (combining existing
knowledge to produce new knowledge). For search, we are interested in AIs that solve
problems that meet two conditions: 1) potential knowledge relevant to the process of
discovery is subject to an explosion of data that an individual researcher or team of
researchers finds increasingly difficult to stay abreast of (the “burden of knowledge”);

                                            6
and 2) the AI predicts which pieces of knowledge will be most relevant to the researcher,
typically through the input of search terms.        For discovery, we also identify two
conditions: 1) potentially combinable knowledge for the production of new knowledge is
subject to combinatorial explosion; and 2) the AI predicts which combinations of existing
knowledge will yield valuable new knowledge across a large number of domains. We now
consider some specific examples of how AI-based search and discovery technologies may
change the innovation process.



Search

         Metaα produces AI-based search technologies for identifying relevant scientific
papers and tracking the evolution of scientific ideas. The company was acquired by the
Chan-Zuckerberg Foundation, which intends to make it available free of charge to
researchers. This AI-based search technology meets our two conditions for a meta
technology for knowledge access: 1) the stock of scientific papers is subject to
exponential growth at an estimated 8-9 percent per year (Lutz Bornmann and Rüdiger
Mutz, 2015); and 2) the AI-based search technology helps scientists identify relevant
papers, thereby reducing the “burden of knowledge” associated with the exponential
growth of published output.



         BenchSci is an AI-based search technology for the more specific task of identifying
effective compounds used in drug discovery (notably antibodies that act as reagents in
scientific experiments). It again meets our two conditions: 1) reports on compound
efficacy are scattered through millions of scientific papers with little standardisation in
how these reports are provided; and 2) an AI extracts compound-efficacy information,
allowing scientists to more effectively identify appropriate compounds to use in
experiments.



Discovery

         Atomwise is a deep learning-based AI for the discovery of drug molecules
(compounds) that have the potential to yield safe and effective new drugs. This AI meets

                                              7
our two conditions for a meta technology for discovery: 1) the number of potential
compounds is subject to combinatorial explosion; and 2) the AI predicts how basic
chemical features combine into more intricate features to identify potential compounds
for more detailed investigation.



       Deep Genomics is a deep learning-based AI that predicts what happens in a cell
when DNA is altered by natural or therapeutic genetic variation. It again meets our two
conditions: 1) genotype-phenotype variations are subject to combinatorial explosion;
and 2) the AI “bridges the genotype-phenotype divide” by predicting the results of
complex biological processes that relate variations in the genotype to observable
characteristics of an organism, thus helping to identify potentially valuable therapeutic
interventions for further testing.



3. A Combinatorial-Based Knowledge Production Function



       Figure 1 provides an overview of our modelling approach and how it relates to the
classic Romer/Jones knowledge production function. The solid lines capture the essential
character of the Romer/Jones function. Researchers use existing knowledge – the
standing-on-shoulders effect – to produce new knowledge. The new knowledge then
becomes part of the knowledge base from which subsequent discoveries are made. The
dashed lines capture our approach. The existing knowledge base determines the
potential new combinations that are possible, the majority of which are likely to have no
value. The discovery of valuable new knowledge is made by searching among the massive
number of potential combinations. This discovery process is aided by meta technologies
such as deep learning that allow researchers to identify valuable combinations in spaces
where existing knowledge interacts in often highly complex ways. As with the
Romer/Jones function, the new knowledge adds to the knowledge base – and thus the
potential combinations of that knowledge base – which subsequent researchers have to
work with. A feature of our new knowledge production function will be that the
Romer/Jones function emerges as a limiting case both with and without team production
of new knowledge. In this section, we first develop the new function without team

                                           8
production of new knowledge; in the next section, we extend the function to allow for
team production.



       The total stock of knowledge in the world is denoted as A, which we assume
initially is measured discretely. An individual researcher has access to an amount of
knowledge, 𝐴𝜙 (also assumed to be an integer), so that the share of the stock of knowledge
available to an individual researcher is 𝐴𝜙−1 . 6 We assume that 0 < 𝜙 < 1. This implies
that the share of total knowledge accessible to an individual researcher is falling with the
total stock of knowledge. This is a manifestation in the model of the “burden of
knowledge” effect identified by Jones (2009) – it becomes more difficult to access all the
available knowledge as the total stock of knowledge grows. The knowledge access
parameter, 𝜙, is assumed to capture not only what a researcher knows at a point in time
but also their ability to find existing knowledge should they require it. The value of the
parameter will thus be affected by the extent to which knowledge is available in codified
form and can be found as needed by researchers. The combination of digital repositories
of knowledge and search technologies that can predict what knowledge will be most
relevant to the researcher given the search terms they input – think of the ubiquitous
Google as well as more specialized search technologies such Metaα and BenchSci – should
increase the value of 𝜙.



       Innovations occur as a result of combining existing knowledge to produce new
knowledge. Knowledge can be combined a ideas at a time, where a = 0, 1 . . . 𝐴𝜙 . For a
given individual researcher, the total number of possible combinations of units of

 Paul Romer emphasized the importance of distinguishing between ideas (a non-rival good)
and human capital (a rival good). “Ideas are . . . the critical input in the production of more
valuable human and non-human capital. But human capital is also the most important input in
the production of new ideas. . . . Because human capital and ideas are so closely related as inputs
and outputs, it is tempting to aggregate them into a single type of good. . . . It is important,
nevertheless, to distinguish ideas and human capital because they have different fundamental
attributes as economic goods, with different implications for economic theory” (Romer, 1993, p.
71). In our model, 𝐴𝜙 is a measure of a researcher’s human capital. Clearly, human capital
depends on the existing technological and other knowledge and the researcher’s access to that
knowledge. In turn, the production of new knowledge depends on the researcher’s human
capital.

                                                9
existing knowledge (including singletons and the null set)7 given their knowledge access
is:



            𝐴𝜙
                𝜙
      𝑍𝑖 = ∑ (𝐴 ) = 2𝐴 .
                      𝜙
(1)
               𝑎
            𝑎=0




The total number of potential combinations, 𝑍𝑖 , grows exponentially with 𝐴𝜙 . Clearly, if
A is itself growing exponentially, 𝑍𝑖 will be growing at a double exponential rate. This is
the source of combinatorial explosion in the model. Since it is more convenient to work
with continuously measured variables in the growth model, from this point on we treat A
and 𝑍𝑖 as continuously measured variables. However, the key assumption is that the
number of potential combinations grow exponentially with knowledge access.



       The next step is to specify how potential combinations map to discoveries. We
assume that a large share of potential combinations do not produce useful new
knowledge. Moreover, of those combinations that are useful, many will have already
been discovered and thus are already part of A. This latter feature reflects the fishing-
out phenomenon. The per period translation of potential combinations into valuable
new knowledge is given by the (asymptotically) constant elasticity discovery function:



                                    𝜙   𝜃
                  𝑍𝑖𝜃   −1      (2 𝐴 ) − 1
(2)   𝐴̇𝑖 = 𝛽 (           ) = 𝛽(          )                 𝑓𝑜𝑟    0<𝜃≤1
                        𝜃            𝜃




7
 Excluding the singletons and the null set, total number of potential combinations would be
   𝜙
2 𝐴 − 𝐴𝜙 − 1. As singletons and the null set are not true “combinations,” we take equation (1)
to be an approximation of the true number of potential combinations. The relative significance
of this approximation will decline as the knowledge base grows, and we ignore it in what
follows.

                                              10

where 𝛽 is a positively valued knowledge discovery parameter and use is made of
L’Hôpital’s rule for the limiting case of 𝜃 = 0.8



       For θ > 0, the elasticity of new discoveries with respect to the number of possible
combinations, Zi, is:




        𝜕𝐴̇ 𝑍𝑖       𝛽𝑍𝑖𝜃−1        𝑍𝑖𝜃
(3)            =             = (       ) 𝜃,
        𝜕𝑍𝑖 𝐴̇       𝑍𝑖𝜃 − 1    𝑍𝑖𝜃 − 1
                   𝛽( 𝜃 )




which converges to 𝜃 as the number of potential combinations goes to infinity. For 𝜃 =
0, the elasticity of new discoveries is:



        𝜕𝐴̇ 𝑍𝑖 𝛽 𝑍𝑖      1
(4)           =        =     ,
        𝜕𝑍𝑖 𝐴̇ 𝑍𝑖 𝛽𝑙𝑛𝑍𝑖 𝑙𝑛𝑍𝑖



which converges to zero as the number of potential combinations goes to infinity.



       A number of factors seem likely to affect the value of the fishing-out/complexity
parameter, θ. First are basic constraints relating to natural phenomena that limit what is


8
 L’Hôpital’s rule is often useful where a limit of a quotient is indeterminate. The limit of the
term in brackets on the right-hand-side of equation (2) as 𝜃 goes to zero is 0 divided by 0 and is
thus indeterminate. However, by L’Hôpital’s rule, the limit of this quotient is equal to the limit
of the quotient produced by dividing the limit of the derivative of the numerator with respect to
𝜃 by the limit of the derivative of the denominator with respect to 𝜃. This limit is equal to
ln(2)𝐴𝜙 .

                                                11
physically possible in terms of combining existing knowledge to produce scientifically or
technologically useful new knowledge. Pessimistic views on the possibilities for future
growth tend to emphasize such constraints. Second is the ease of discovering new useful
combinations that are physically possible. The potentially massive size and complexity of
the space of potential combinations means that finding useful combinations can be a
needle-in-the-haystack problem. Optimistic views of the possibilities for future growth
tend to emphasize how the combination of AI (embedded in algorithms such as those
developed by Atomwise and DeepGenomics) and increases in computing power can aid
prediction in the discovery process, especially where it is difficult to identify patterns of
cause and effect in high dimensional data. Third, recognizing that future opportunities for
discoveries are path dependent (see, for example, Weitzman, 1998), the value of θ will
depend on the actual path that is followed. To the extent that AI can help identify
productive paths, it will limit the chances of economies going down technological dead-
ends.



        There are 𝐿𝐴 researchers in the economy each working independently, where 𝐿𝐴
is assumed to be measured continuously. (In Section 4, we consider the case of team
production in an extension of the model.)         We assume that some researchers will
duplicate each other’s discoveries – the standing-on-toes effect. To capture this effect,
new discoveries are assumed to take place “as if” the actual number of researchers is
equal to 𝐿𝐴𝜆 , where 0 ≤ 𝜆 ≤ 1. Thus the aggregate knowledge production function for 𝜃 >
0 is given:



                        𝜙   𝜃
                      (2𝐴 ) − 1
(5)     𝐴̇ = β𝐿𝐴𝜆 (               ).

        At a point in time (with given values of A and 𝐿𝐴 ), how does an increase in 𝜃 affect
the rate of discovery of new knowledge, 𝐴̇? The partial derivative of 𝐴̇ with respect to 𝜃
is:

A sufficient condition for this partial derivative to be positive is that that term in square
brackets is greater than zero, which requires:



                     1
              1    𝜙
(7)    𝐴>(        ) .
           𝜃ln(2)



We assume this condition holds. Figure 2 shows an example of how 𝐴̇ (and also the
percentage growth of A given that A is assumed to be equal to 100) varies with 𝜃 for
different assumed values of 𝜙. Higher values of 𝜃 are associated with a faster growth
rate. The figure also shows how 𝜃 and 𝜙 interact positively: Greater knowledge access
(as reflected in a higher value of 𝜙) increases the gain associated with a given increase in
the value of 𝜃.



       We assume, however, that 𝜃 itself evolves with A. A larger A means a bigger and
more complex discovery search space.        We further assume that this complexity will
eventually overwhelm any discovery technology given the power of the combinatorial
explosion as A grows. This is captured by assuming that 𝜃 is a declining function of A; that
is, 𝜃 = 𝜃(𝐴), where 𝜃 ′ (𝐴) < 0. In the limit as A goes to infinity, we assume that 𝜃(𝐴) goes
to zero, or:



(8)    lim 𝜃(𝐴) = 0.
       𝐴→∞




This means that the discovery function converges asymptotically (given sustained
growth in A) to:

                                             13
(9)    𝐴̇ = βln(2)𝐿𝐴𝜆 𝐴𝜙 .



This mirrors the functional form of the Romer/Jones function and allows for decreasing
returns to scale in the number of researchers, depending on the size of 𝜆. While the form
of the function is familiar by design, its combinatorial-based foundations have the
advantage of providing richer motivations for the key parameters in the knowledge
discovery function.



       We use the fact that the functional form of equation (9) is the same as that used in
Jones (1995) to solve for the steady state of the model. More precisely, given that the
limiting behaviour of our knowledge production function mirrors the function used by
Jones and all other aspects of the economy are assumed to be identical, the steady-state
along a balanced growth path with constant exponential growth will be the same as in
that model.



       As we have nothing to add to the other elements of the model, we here simply
sketch the growth model developed by Jones (1995), referring the reader to the original
for details. The economy is composed of a final goods sector and a research sector. The
final goods sector uses labor, 𝐿𝑌 , and intermediate inputs to produce its output. Each new
idea (or “blueprint”) supports the design of an intermediate input, with each input being
supplied by a profit-maximizing monopolist. Given the blueprint, capital, K, is
transformed unit for unit in producing the input. The total labor force, L, is fully allocated
between the final goods and research sectors, so that 𝐿𝑌 + 𝐿𝐴 = 𝐿. We assume the labor
force to be equal to the population and growing at rate 𝑛(> 0).



       Building on Romer (1990), Jones (1995) shows that the production function for
final goods can be written as:




                                             14
(10)     𝑌 = (𝐴𝐿𝑌 )𝛼 𝐾 1−𝛼 ,



where Y is final goods output. The intertemporal utility function of a representative
consumer in the economy is given by:



               ∞
(11)    𝑈 = ∫ 𝑢(𝑐)𝑒 −𝜌𝑡 𝑑𝑡,
              0




where c is per capita consumption and 𝜌 is the consumer’s discount rate.                 The
instantaneous utility function is assumed to exhibit constant relative risk aversion, with
a coefficient of risk aversion equal to 𝜎 and a (constant) intertemporal elasticity of
substitution equal to 1⁄𝜎 .



       Jones (1995) shows that the steady-state growth rate of this economy along a
balanced growth path with constant exponential growth is given by:



                                𝜆𝑛
(12)    𝑔𝐴 = 𝑔𝑦 = 𝑔𝑐 = 𝑔𝑘 =        ,
                               1−𝜙



where 𝑔𝐴 = 𝐴̇⁄𝐴 is the growth rate of the knowledge stock, 𝑔𝑦 is the growth rate of per
capita output 𝑦 (𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑦 = 𝑌⁄𝐿), 𝑔𝑐 is the growth rate of per capita output 𝑐
(𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑐 = 𝐶 ⁄𝐿), and 𝑔𝑘 is the growth rate of the capital labor ratio (𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑘 = 𝐾 ⁄𝐿).



Finally, the steady-state share of labor allocated to the research sector is given by:



                          1
(13)     𝑠=                               .
                             1
              1+
                      𝜌(1 − 𝜙) 1
                   𝜆[          + 𝜎 − 𝜙]
                         𝜆𝑛


                                              15
         We can now consider how changes in the parameters of knowledge production
given by equation (5) will affect the dynamics of growth in the economy. We start with
improvement in the availability of AI-based search technologies that improve a
researcher’s access to knowledge. In the context of the model, the availability of AI-based
search technologies – e.g., Google, Metaα, BenchSci, etc. – should increase the value of 𝜙
and reduce the “burden of knowledge” effect. From equation (12), an increase in this
parameter will increase the steady steady-state growth rate and also the growth rate and
the level of per capital output along the transition path to the steady state.



         We next consider AI-based technologies that increase the value of the discovery
parameter, 𝛽. As 𝛽 does not appear in the steady state in equation (12), the steady-state
growth rate is unaffected. However, such an increase will raise the growth rate (and
level) along the path to that steady state.



         The most interesting potential changes to the possibilities for growth come about
if we allow a change to the fishing-out/complexity parameter, 𝜃. We assume that the
economy is initially in a steady state and then experiences an increase in 𝜃 as the result
of the discovery of a new AI technology. Recall that we assume that 𝜃 will eventually
converge back to zero as the complexity that comes with combinatorial explosion
eventually overwhelms the new AI. Thus, the steady state of the economy is unaffected.
However, the transition dynamics are again quite different, with larger increases in
knowledge for an given starting of the knowledge stock along the path back to the steady
state.



         Using Jones (1995) as the limiting case of the model is appealing because we avoid
unbounded increases in the growth rate, which would lead to the breakdown of any
reasonable growth model and indeed a breakdown in the normal operations of any actual
economy. It is interesting to note, however, what happens to growth in the economy if
instead of assuming that 𝜃 converges asymptotically to zero, it stays at some positive


                                              16
value (even if very small). Dividing both sides of equation (5) by A gives an expression
for the growth rate of the stock of knowledge:



                              𝜙   𝜃
                          𝐴
         𝐴̇ β ln(2) 𝐿𝐴𝜆 (2 ) − 1
(14)       =           (        ).
         𝐴      𝐴           𝜃




The partial derivative of this growth rate with respect to A is:



            𝐴̇
         𝜕 ( ) 𝐿𝜆 𝛽
            𝐴    𝐴         𝜙 𝜃
(15)           = 2 [1 + (2𝐴 ) (𝜙𝜃ln(2)𝐴𝜙 − 1)].
          𝜕𝐴    𝜃𝐴



The key to the sign of this derivative is the sign of the term inside the last round brackets.
This term will be positive for a large enough A. As A is growing over time (for any positive
number of researchers and existing knowledge stock), the growth rate must eventually
begin to rise once A exceeds some threshold value. Thus, with a fixed positive value of 𝜃
(or with 𝜃 converging asymptotically to a positive value), the growth rate will eventually
begin to grow without bound.



       A possible deeper foundation for our combinatorial-based knowledge production
function is provided by the work on “rugged landscapes” (Stuart Kauffman, 1993).
Kauffman’s NK model has been fruitfully applied to questions of organizational design
(Daniel Levinthal, 1997), strategy (Jan Rivkin, 2000) and science-driven technological
search (Lee Fleming and Olav Sorenson, 2004).              In our setting, each potential
combination of existing ideas accessible to a researcher is a point in the landscape
represented by a binary string indicating whether each idea in the set of accessible
knowledge is in the combination (a 1 in the string) or not (a 0 in the string). The
complexity – or “ruggedness” – of the landscape depends on the total number of ideas
that can be combined and also on the way that the elements of the binary string interact.

                                             17
For any given element, its impact on the value of the combination will depend on the value
of X other elements.9 The larger the value of X the more interrelated are the various
elements of the string, creating a more rugged knowledge landscape and thus a harder
the search problem for the innovator.



          We can think of would-be innovators as starting from some already known
valuable combination and searching for other valuable combinations in the vicinity of
that combination (see, e.g., Nelson and Winter, 1982). Purely local search can be thought
of as varying one component of the binary string at a time for some given fraction of the
total elements of the string. This implies that the total number of combinations that can
be searched is a linear function of the innovator’s knowledge. This is consistent with the
Romer/Jones knowledge production function where the discovery of new knowledge is
a linear function of knowledge access, 𝐴𝜙 . Positive values of 𝜃 are then associated with
the capacity to search a larger fraction of the space of possible combinations, which in
turn increases the probability of discovering a valuable combination. Meta technologies
such as deep learning can be thought of as expanding the capacity to search a given space
of potential combinations – i.e. as increasing the value of 𝜃 – thereby increasing the
chance of new discoveries. Given its ability to deal with complex non-linear spaces, deep
learning may be especially valuable for search over highly rugged landscapes.



4. A Combinatorial-Based Knowledge Production Function with Team Production: An
Extended Model



          Our basic model assumes that researchers working alone combine the knowledge
to which they have access, 𝐴𝜙 , to discover new knowledge. In reality, new discoveries are
increasingly being made by research teams (Benjamin Jones, 2009; Nielsen, 2012;
Agrawal, Avi Goldfarb, Florenta Teodoridis, 2016). Assuming initially no redundancy in
the knowledge that individual members bring to the team – i.e., collective team
knowledge is the sum of the knowledge of the individual team members – combining


9
    K elements in Kauffman’s original notation.

                                                  18
individual researchers into teams can greatly expand the knowledge base from which
new combinations of existing knowledge can be made. This also opens up the possibility
of a positive interaction between factors that facilitate the operation of larger teams and
factors that raise the size of the fishing out/complexity parameter, 𝜃.         New meta
technologies such as deep learning can be more effective in a world where they are
operating on a larger knowledge base due to the ability of researchers to more effectively
pool their knowledge by forming larger teams.



       We thus extend in this section the basic model to allow for new knowledge to be
discovered by research teams. For a team with m members and no overlap in the
knowledge of its members, the total knowledge access for the team is simply 𝑚𝐴𝜙 . (We
later relax the assumption of no knowledge overlap within a team.) Innovations occur as
a result of the team combining existing knowledge to produce new knowledge.
Knowledge can be combined by the team a ideas at a time, where a = 0, 1 . . . 𝑚𝐴𝜙 . For
a given team j with m members, the total number of possible combinations of units of
existing knowledge (including singletons and the null set) given their combined
knowledge access is:



             𝑚𝐴𝜙
                  𝜙
       𝑍𝑗 = ∑ (𝑚𝐴 ) = 2𝑚𝐴 .
                         𝜙
(16)
                𝑎
             𝑎=0




       Assuming again for convenience that 𝐴𝜙 and Z can be treated as continuous, the
per period translation of potential combinations into valuable new knowledge by a team
is again given by the (asymptotic) constant elasticity discovery function:



                                         𝜃
                                  𝑚𝐴𝜙
               𝑍𝑗𝜃 − 1       (2         ) −1
(17)    ̇
       𝐴𝑗 = 𝛽 (       ) = 𝛽(                   )           𝑓𝑜𝑟    0<𝜃≤1
                  𝜃                  𝜃




                                             19
                                𝜙
          = 𝛽 ln 𝑍𝑗 = 𝛽 ln (2𝑚𝐴 ) = 𝛽 ln(2)𝑚𝐴𝜙               𝑓𝑜𝑟    𝜃 = 0,




where use is again made of L’Hôpital’s rule for the limiting case of 𝜃 = 0.



       The number of researchers in the economy at a point in time is again 𝐿𝐴 (which
we now assume is measured discretely). Research teams can potentially be formed from
any possible combination of the 𝐿𝐴 researchers. For each of these potential teams, a
entrepreneur can coordinate the team. However, for a potential team with m members
to form, the entrepreneur must have relationships with all m members. The need for a
relationship thus places a constraint on feasible teams. The probability of a relationship
existing between the entrepreneur and any given researcher is 𝜂, and thus the probability
of relationships existing between all members of a team of size m is 𝜂𝑚 .       Using the
formula for a binomial expansion, the expected total number of feasible teams is:



            𝐿𝐴

(18) 𝑆 = ∑ (𝐿𝐴 ) 𝜂𝑚 = (1 + 𝜂)𝐿𝐴 .
            𝑚
           𝑚=0




The average feasible team size is then given by:



                 𝐿
          ∑𝐿𝑚=0
             𝐴
                ( 𝐴 ) 𝜂𝑚 𝑚
(19)   𝑚
       ̅=        𝑚         .
             𝐿𝐴   𝐿
           ∑𝑚=0 ( 𝐴 ) 𝜂𝑚
                  𝑚



Factorizing the numerator and substituting in the denominator using equation (18), we
obtain a simple expression for the average feasible team size:




                                            20
               𝐿
        ∑𝐿𝑚=0
           𝐴
              ( 𝐴 ) 𝜂𝑚 𝑚 (1 + 𝜂)𝐿𝐴−1 𝜂𝐿      𝜂
(20) 𝑚
     ̅=        𝑚        =
                                       𝐴
                                         = (   )𝐿 .
         ∑𝐿𝑚=0
            𝐴   𝐿
               ( 𝐴 ) 𝜂𝑚     (1 + 𝜂)𝐿𝐴       1+𝜂 𝐴
                𝑚



Figure 3 shows an example of the full distribution of teams sizes (with 𝐿𝐴 = 50) for two
different values of 𝜂. An increase in 𝜂 (i.e. an improvement in the capability to form
teams) will push the distribution to the right and increase the average team size.



       We can now write down the form that the knowledge production function would
take if all possible research teams could form (ignoring for the moment any stepping-on-
toes effects):



                 𝐿𝐴              𝜙   𝜃
                       𝑚𝐴
         ̇      𝐿𝐴 𝑚 (2    ) −1
(21)    𝐴 = (∑ ( )𝜂 𝛽          )                      𝑓𝑜𝑟       0 < 𝜃 ≤ 1.
                𝑚         𝜃
                 𝑚=0




We next allow for the fact that only a fraction of the feasible teams will actually form.
Recognising obvious time constraints on the ability of a given researcher to be part of
multiple research teams, we impose the constraint that each researcher can only be part
of one team. However, we assume the size of any team that successfully forms is drawn
from the same distribution over sizes as the potential teams. Therefore, the expected
average team size is also given by equation (18). With this restriction, we can solve for
                                                            𝜂                         1+𝜂
the total number of teams, N, from the equation 𝐿𝐴 = 𝑁 (1+𝜂) 𝐿𝐴 , which implies 𝑁 =         .
                                                                                       𝜂


Given the assumption that the distribution of actual team sizes is drawn from the same
distribution as the feasible team sizes, the aggregate knowledge production function
(assuming 𝜃 > 0) is then given by:




                                           21
               1+𝜂       𝐿𝐴             𝑚𝐴𝜙
                                              𝜃
                 𝜂            𝐿𝐴 𝑚    (2    )   −1
(22)    𝐴̇ =           ( ∑  (   ) 𝜂 𝛽              )
             (1 + 𝜂)𝐿𝐴        𝑚            𝜃
                          𝑚=0


                                𝐿𝐴                  𝜃
                                              𝑚𝐴𝜙
                  1             𝐿𝐴 𝑚 (2            ) −1
          =               ( ∑ (   )𝜂 𝛽                 ),
            (1 + 𝜂)𝐿𝐴−1 𝜂       𝑚                 𝜃
                             𝑚=0




where the first term is the actual number of teams as a fraction of the potentially feasible
number of teams. For 𝜃 = 0, the aggregate knowledge production function takes the
form:



                              𝐿𝐴
                   1            𝐿
(23)    𝐴̇ =               ( ∑ ( 𝐴 ) 𝜂𝑚 𝑚𝛽ln(2)𝐴𝜙 )
             (1 + 𝜂)𝐿𝐴−1 𝜂      𝑚
                             𝑚=0


                    1
          =                 ((1 + 𝜂)𝐿𝐴−1 𝜂𝐿𝐴 𝛽ln(2)𝐴𝜙 ),
              (1 + 𝜂)𝐿𝐴−1 𝜂

          = 𝛽𝐿𝐴 ln(2)𝐴𝜙 .



        To see intuitively how an increase in 𝜂 could affect aggregate knowledge discovery
when 𝜃 > 0, note that from equation (20) an increase in 𝜂 will increase the average team
size of the teams that form. From equation (16), we see that for a given knowledge access
by an individual researcher, the number of potential combinations increases
exponentially with the size of the team, m (see Figure 4). This implies that combining
two teams of size m’ to create a team of size 2m’ will more than double the new knowledge
output of the team. Hence, there is a positive interaction between 𝜃 and 𝜂. On the other
hand, when 𝜃 = 0, combining the two teams will exactly double the new knowledge
output given the linearity of the relationship between team size and knowledge output.
In this case, the aggregate knowledge is invariant to the distribution of team sizes.




                                             22
       To see this formally, note that from equation (23) we know that when 𝜃 = 0, the
partial derivative of 𝐴̇ with respect to 𝜂 must be zero since 𝜂 does not appear in the final
form of the knowledge production function. This results from the balancing of two effects
as 𝜂 increases. The first (negative) effect is that the number of teams as a share of the
potentially possible teams falls. The second (positive) effect is that the amount of new
knowledge production if all possible teams do form rises. We can now ask what happens
if we raise 𝜃 to a strictly positive value. The first of these effects is unchanged. But that
second effect will be stronger provided that the knowledge production of a team for any
given team size rises with 𝜃. A sufficient condition for this to be true is that:



                         1
              1     𝜙
(24)    𝐴>(        )           for all 𝑚 > 0.
           𝜃ln(2)𝑚



We assume that the starting size of the knowledge stock is large enough so that this
condition holds. Moreover, the partial derivative of 𝐴̇ with respect to 𝜂 will be larger the
larger is the value of 𝜃. We show these effects for a particular example in Figure 5.



       The possibilities of knowledge overlap at the level of the team and duplication of
knowledge outputs between teams creates additional complications.                   To allow for
stepping-on-toes effects, it is useful to first rewrite equation (20) as:



                                                     𝐿𝐴                     𝜙   𝜃

We introduce two stepping-on-toes effects. First, we allow for knowledge overlap within
teams to introduce the potential for redundancy of knowledge. A convenient way to
introduce this effect is to assume that the overlap reduces the effective average team size



                                                23
in the economy from the viewpoint of generating new knowledge. More specifically, we
assume the effective team size is given by:



                                  𝛾
          𝑒     𝛾
                  𝜂
(26)   𝑚
       ̅ =𝑚
          ̅ = ((    )𝐿 ) ,
                 1+𝜂 𝐴




where 0 ≤ 𝛾 ≤ 1. The extreme case of 𝛾 = 0 (full overlap) has each team acting as if it
had effectively a single member; the opposite extreme of 𝛾 = 1 (no overlap) has no
knowledge redundancy at the level of the team. Second, we allow for the possibility that
new ideas are duplicated across teams. The effective number of non-idea-duplicating
teams is given by:



                         1 + 𝜂 1−𝜓
(27)    𝑁 𝑒 = 𝑁1−𝜓 = (        )    ,
                           𝜂



where 0 ≤ 𝜓 ≤ 1. The extreme case of 𝜓 = 0 (no duplication) implies that the effective
number of teams is equal to the actual number of teams; the extreme case of 𝜓 = 1 (full
duplication) implies that a single team produces the same number of new ideas as the full
set of teams.



We can now add the stepping-on-toes effects – knowledge redundancy within teams and
discovery duplication between teams – to yield the general form of the knowledge
production function for 𝜃 > 0:



                                       𝛾                 𝐿𝐴                      𝜃
                                                                          𝑚𝐴𝜙
              1 + 𝜂 1−𝜓    𝜂                1               𝐿𝐴 𝑚 (2             ) −1
(28)   𝐴̇ = (      )    ((    ) 𝐿𝐴 )                  ( ∑ (   )𝜂 𝛽                     ).
                𝜂         1+𝜂        (1 + 𝜂)𝐿𝐴 −1 𝜂𝐿𝐴       𝑚                𝜃
                                                         𝑚=0




                                              24
If we take the limit of equation (24) as 𝜃 goes to zero, we reproduce the limiting case of
the knowledge production function. Ignoring integer constraints on 𝐿𝐴 , this knowledge
production function again has the form of the Romer/Jones function:



                                       𝛾                    𝐿𝐴
                1 + 𝜂 1−𝜓    𝜂                1             𝐿
(29)     𝐴̇ = (      )    ((    ) 𝐿𝐴 )                 ( ∑ ( 𝐴 ) 𝜂𝑚 𝛽 ln(2) 𝑚𝐴𝜙 )
                  𝜂         1+𝜂        (1 + 𝜂)𝐿𝐴−1 𝜂𝐿𝐴      𝑚
                                                           𝑚=0
                                            𝛾
                   1 + 𝜂 1−𝜓    𝜂         (1 + 𝜂)𝐿𝐴−1 𝜂𝐿𝐴
                =(      )    ((    ) 𝐿𝐴 )                 𝛽 ln(2) 𝐴𝜙
                     𝜂         1+𝜂        (1 + 𝜂)𝐿𝐴−1 𝜂𝐿𝐴

                                        𝛾
                  1 + 𝜂 1−𝜓     𝜂
                =(     )    ((     )) 𝛽 ln(2) 𝐿𝐴 𝛾 𝐴𝜙 .
                    𝜂          1+𝜂




       We note finally the presence of the relationship parameter 𝜂 in the knowledge
production equation. This can be taken to reflect in part the importance of (social)
relationships in the forming of research teams. Advances in computer-based technologies
such as email and file sharing (as well as policies and institutions) could also affect this
parameter (see, for example, Agrawal and Goldfarb (2008) on the effects of the
introduction of precursors to today’s internet on collaboration between researchers).
Although not the main focus of this paper, being able to incorporate the effects of changes
in collaboration technologies increases the richness of the framework for considering the
determinants of the efficiency of knowledge production.



5. Discussion



5.1 Something new under the sun? Deep learning as a new tool for discovery



       Two key observations motivate the model developed above. First, using the
analogy of finding a needle in a haystack, significant obstacles to discovery in numerous
domains of science and technology result from highly non-linear relationships of causes

                                                25
and effect in high dimensional data. Second, advances in algorithms such as deep learning
(combined with increased availability of data and computing power) offer the potential
to find relevant knowledge and predict combinations that will yield valuable new
discoveries.



       Even a cursory review of the scientific and engineering literatures indicates that
needle-in-the-haystack problems are pervasive in many frontier fields of innovation,
especially in areas where matter is manipulated at the molecular or sub-molecular level.
In the field of genomics, for example, complex genotype-phenotype interactions make it
difficult to identify therapies that yield valuable improvements in human health or
agricultural productivity. In the field of drug discovery, complex interactions between
drug compounds and biological systems present an obstacle to identifying promising new
drug therapies. And in the field of material sciences, including nanotechnology, complex
interactions between the underlying physical and chemical mechanisms increases the
challenge of predicting the performance of potential new materials with potential
applications ranging from new materials to prevent traumatic brain injury to lightweight
materials for use in transportation to reduce dependence on carbon-based fuels
(National Science and Technology Council, 2011).



       The apparent speed with which deep learning is being applied in these and other
fields suggests it represents a breakthrough general purpose meta technology for
predicting valuable new combinations in highly complex spaces. Although an in-depth
discussion of the technical advances underlying deep learning is beyond the scope of this
paper, two aspects are worth highlighting. First, previous generations of machine
learning were constrained by the need to extract features (or explanatory variables) by
hand before statistical analysis. A major advance in machine learning involves the use of
“representation learning” to automatically extract the relevant features. 10 Second, the

10
  As described by LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton (2015, p. 436), “[c]onventional machine-learning
techniques were limited in their ability to process natural data in their raw form. For decades,
constructing a pattern-recognition or machine-learning system required careful engineering
and considerable domain expertise to design a feature extractor that transformed the raw data
(such as the pixel values of an image) into a suitable internal representation or feature vector
from which the learning subsystem, often a classifier, could detect or classify patterns in the

                                               26
development and optimization of multilayer neural networks allows for substantial
improvement in the ability to predict outcomes in high-dimensional spaces with complex
non-linear interactions (LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton, 2015). A recent review of the use of
deep learning in computational biology, for instance, notes that the “rapid increase in
biological data dimensions and acquisition rates is challenging conventional analysis
strategies,” and that “[m]odern machine learning methods, such as deep learning,
promise to leverage very large data sets for finding hidden structure within them, and for
making accurate predictions” (Christof Angermueller, Tanel Pärnamaa, Leopold Parts,
and Oliver Stegle, 2016, p.1). Another review of the use of deep learning in computational
chemistry highlights how deep learning has a “ubiquity and broad applicability to a wide
range of challenges in the field, including quantitative activity relationship, virtual
screening, protein structure prediction, quantum chemistry, materials design and
property prediction” (Goh, Hoda, and Vishu, 2017).



       Although the most publicized successes of deep learning have been in areas such
as image recognition, voice recognition, and natural language processing, parallels to the
way in which the new methods work on unstructured data are increasingly being
identified in many fields with similar data challenges to produce research
breakthroughs.11 While these new general purpose research tools will not displace
traditional mathematical models of cause and effect and careful experimental design,
machine learning methods such as deep learning offer a promising new tool for discovery
– including hypothesis generation – where the complexity of the underlying phenomena
present obstacles to more traditional methods.12



input. . . . Representation learning is a set of methods that allows a machine to be fed with raw
data and to automatically discover the representations needed for detection or classification.”
11
   A recent review of deep learning applications in biomedicine usefully draws out these
parallels: “With some imagination, parallels can be drawn between biological data and the types
of data deep learning has shown the most success with – namely image and voice data. A gene
expression profile, for instance, is essentially a ‘snapshot,’ or image, of what is going on in a
given cell or tissue in the same way that patterns of pixilation are representative of the objects
in a picture” (Polina Mamoshina, Armando Vieira, Evgeny Putin, and Alex Zhavoronkov, 2016, p.
1445).
12
   A recent survey of the emerging use of machine learning in economics (including policy
design) provides a pithy characterization of the power of the new methods: “The appeal of
machine learning is that it manages to uncover generalizable patterns. In fact, the success of
machine learning at intelligence tasks is largely due to its ability to discover complex structure

                                                27
5.2 Meta ideas, meta technologies, and general purpose technologies



       We conceptualize AIs as general purpose meta technologies – that is, general
purpose technologies (GPTs) for the discovery of new knowledge. Figure 6 summarises
the relationship between Paul Romer’s broader idea of meta ideas, meta technologies,
and GPTs. Romer defines a meta idea as an idea that supports the production and
transmission of other ideas (see, for example, Romer, 2008). He points to such ideas as
the patent, the agricultural extension station, and the peer-review system for research
grants as examples of meta ideas. We think of meta technologies as a subset of Romer’s
meta ideas (the area enclosed by the dashed lines in Figure 6), where the idea for how to
discover new ideas is embedded in a technological form such as an algorithm or
measurement instrument.



       Elhanan Helpman (1998, p. 3) argues that a “drastic innovation qualifies as a GPT
if it has the potential for pervasive use in a wide range of sectors in ways that drastically
change their mode of operation.” He further notes two important features necessary to
qualify as a GPT: “generality of purpose and innovational complementarities” (see also
Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995). Not all meta technologies are general purpose in this
sense. The set of general purpose meta technologies is given by the intersection of the
two circles in Figure 6. Cockburn, Henderson, and Stern (2018) give the example of
functional MRI as an example of a discovery tool that lacks the generality of purpose
required for a GPT. In contrast, the range of application of deep learning as a discovery
tool would appear to qualify it as a GPT. It is worth noting that some authors discuss
GPTs as technologies that more closely align with our idea of a meta technology.
Rosenberg (1998), for example, provides a fascinating examination of chemical
engineering as an example of GPT. Writing of this branch of engineering, he argues that
a “discipline that provides the concepts and methodologies to generate new or improved



that was not specified in advance. It manages to fit complex and very flexible functional forms
to the data without simply overfitting; it finds functions that work well out of sample” (Sendhil
Mullainathan and Jann Spiess, 2017, p. 88).

                                                28
technologies over a wide range of downstream economic activity may be thought of as an
even purer, or higher order, GPT” (Rosenberg, 1998, p. 170).



        Our concentration on general purpose meta technologies (GPMTs) parallels
Cockburn, Henderson, and Stern’s (2018) idea of a general purpose invention of a method
of invention. This idea combines the idea of a GPT with Zvi Griliches’ (1957) idea of the
“invention of a method of invention,” or IMI. Such an invention has the “potential for a
more influential impact than a single invention, but is also likely to be associated with a
wide variation in the ability to adapt the new tool to particular settings, resulting in a
more heterogeneous pattern of diffusion over time” (Cockburn, Henderson, and Stern,
2018, p. 4). They see some emerging AIs such as deep learning as candidates for such
general purpose IMIs and contrast these with AIs underpinning robotics that, while being
GPTs, do not have the characteristic features of an IMI.



5.3 Beyond AI: potential uses of the new knowledge production function



        Although the primary motivation for this paper is to explore how breakthroughs
in AI could affect the path of economic growth, the knowledge production function we
develop is potentially of broader applicability. By deriving the Romer/Jones knowledge
production function as the limiting case of a more general function, our analysis may also
contribute to providing candidate micro-foundations for that function.13 The key


13
  In developing and applying the Romer/Jones knowledge production function, growth
theorists have understood its potential combinatorial underpinnings and the limits of the Cobb-
Douglas form. Charles Jones (2005) observes in his review chapter on “Growth and Ideas” for
the Handbook of Economic Growth: “While we have made much progress in understanding
economic growth in a world where ideas are important, there remain many open, interesting
research questions. The first is ‘What is the shape of the idea production function?’ How do
ideas get produced? The combinatorial calculations of Romer (1993) and Weitzman (1998) are
fascinating and suggestive. The current research practice of modelling the idea production
function as a stable Cobb-Douglas combination of research and the existing stock of ideas is
elegant, but at this point we have little reason to believe it is correct. One insight that illustrates
the incompleteness of our knowledge is that there is no reason why research productivity
should be a smooth monotonic function of the stock of ideas. One can easily imagine that some
ideas lead to domino-like unravelling of phenomena that were previously mysterious . . . Indeed,
perhaps decoding of the human genome or the continued boom in information technology will

                                                  29
conceptual change is to model discovery as operating on the space of potential
combinations (rather than directly on the knowledge base itself). As in Weitzman (1998),
our production function focuses attention explicitly on how new knowledge is discovered
by combining existing knowledge, which is left implicit in the Romer/Jones formulation.
While this shift in emphasis is motivated by the particular way in which deep learning
can aid discovery – allowing researchers to uncover otherwise hard-to-find valuable
combinations in highly complex spaces – the view of discovery as the innovative
combination of what is already known has broader applicability. The more general
function also has the advantage of providing a richer parameter space for mapping how
meta technologies or policies could affect knowledge discovery. The 𝜙 parameter
captures how access to knowledge at the individual researcher level determines the
potential for new combinations to be made given the inherited knowledge base. The 𝜃
parameter captures how the available potential combinations (given the access to
knowledge) map to new discoveries. Finally, the 𝜂 parameter captures the ease of
forming research teams and ultimately the average team size. To the extent that the
capacity to bring the knowledge of individual researchers together through research
teams directly affects the possible combinations, the ease of team formation can have an
important effect on how the existing knowledge base is utilized for new knowledge
discovery.



       We hope this more general function will be of use in other contexts. In a recent
commentary celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publication of Romer (1990), Joshua
Gans (2015) observes that the Romer growth model has not been as influential on the
design of growth policy as might have been expected despite its enormous influence on
the subsequent growth theory literature. The reason he identifies is that it abstracts away
“some of the richness of the microeconomy that give rise to new ideas and also their
dissemination” (Gans, 2015). By expanding the parameter space, our function allows for
the inclusion of more of this richness, including the role that meta technologies such as
deep learning can play in knowledge access and knowledge discovery but potentially


lead to a large upward shift in the production function for ideas. On the other hand, one can
equally imagine situations where research productivity unexpectedly stagnates, if not forever
then at least for a long time” (Jones, 2005, p. 1107).


                                              30
other policy and institutional factors that affect knowledge access, discovery rates, and
team formation as well.



6. Concluding Thoughts: A Coming Singularity?



       We developed this paper upon a number of prior ideas. First, the production of
new knowledge is central to sustaining economic growth (Romer, 1990, 1993). Second,
the production of new ideas is fundamentally a combinatorial process (Weitzman, 1998).
Third, given this combinatorial process, technologies that predict what combinations of
existing knowledge will yield useful new knowledge hold out the promise of improving
growth prospects. Fourth, breakthroughs in AI represent a potential step change in the
ability of algorithms to predict what knowledge is potentially useful to researchers and
also to predict what combinations of existing knowledge will yield useful new discoveries
(LeCun, Benigo, and Hinton, 2015).



       In a provocative recent paper, William Nordhaus (2015) explored the possibilities
for a coming “economic singularity,” which he defines as “[t]he idea . . . that rapid growth
in computation and artificial intelligence will cross some boundary or singularity after
which economic growth will accelerate sharply as an ever-accelerating pace of
improvements cascade through the economy.” Central to Nordhaus’ analysis is that rapid
technological advance is occurring in a relatively small part of the economy (see also
Aghion, Jones, and Jones, 2018).     To generate more broadly based rapid growth, the
products of the new economy need to substitute for products on either the demand- or
supply-side of the economy. His review of the evidence – including, critically, the relevant
elasticities of substitution – leads him to conclude that a singularity through this route is
highly unlikely.



       However, our paper’s analysis suggests an alternative route to an economic
singularity – a broad-based alteration in the economy’s knowledge production function.
Given the centrality of new knowledge to sustained growth at the technological frontier,

                                             31
it seems likely that if an economic singularity were to arise, it would be because of some
significant change to the knowledge production function affecting a number of domains
outside of information technology itself. In a world where new knowledge is the result of
combining existing knowledge, AI technologies that help ease needle-in-the-haystack
discovery challenges could affect growth prospects, at least along the transition path to
the steady state. It doesn’t take an impossible leap of imagination to see how new meta
technologies such as AI could alter – perhaps modestly, perhaps dramatically – the
knowledge production function in a way that changes the prospects for economic growth.
