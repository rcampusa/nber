This paper provides quasi-experimental estimates of the causal effect of long-term unemployment
on wages. Using standard job search theory, the paper derives and tests conditions on reemployment
wages under which Unemployment Insurance (UI) extensions can be used as instrumental variables
(IV) for unemployment duration. Using a regression discontinuity design, the paper shows that UI
extensions at age thresholds reduced reemployment wages of job searchers in Germany. The UI
extensions do not affect the reemployment wages conditional on the month of unemployment exit,
implying reservation wages do not bind on average. Hence, UI extensions affect mean wages only
through unemployment durations. Our IV estimates imply substantial negative effects of unemployment
duration on wages of 0.8% per month.

1       Introduction

At the peak of the Great Recession, long-term unemployment (unemployment spell lasting
more than one year) in the United States rose to a historical 5 million individuals, and stands
at 3.2 million in 2014. In many European countries, long-term unemployment has been a
persistent feature of labor markets since at least the early 1980s. There is an increasing
concern among policy makers and academics as to the costs of rising unemployment durations
to individuals and families, as well as for the labor market and the economy as a whole
(e.g., Bernanke 2012, Yellen 2014).1 However, there are few causal estimates of the effect
of unemployment duration on wages, earnings, or other outcomes.2 This makes it not only
difficult to assess the costs of long-term unemployment, but also difficult to choose policies
at both the micro and the macro level.3 For example, if nonemployment durations decrease
reemployment wages, extensions in unemployment insurance (UI) durations – the largest
government program geared towards job losers in recessions – may hurt the prospects of job
losers rather than helping them to obtain better job matches.
        We use the term ‘the causal effect of unemployment durations on job outcomes’ to describe
how rising unemployment durations harm the job prospects of unemployed workers.. An
individual who is unemployed longer may receive different job offers the longer the duration of
unemployment, e.g. because of skill depreciation or stigma. Thus the worker will effectively
face different labor demand solely due to the fact that she has been out of work longer. In
addition the worker may accept different jobs the longer she is unemployed (she may have a
declining reservation wage), effectively constituting a labor supply response. We define the
‘causal effect of unemployment duration’ as the change in reemployment wages that comes only
    1
      It is widely thought that long unemployment durations can lower reemployment wages and other job
outcomes of workers via depreciation of skills or because of stigma (e.g., Acemoglu 1995, Machin and Manning
1999). As a result, long-term unemployment can affect the aggregate labor market and economic recovery
(e.g., Pissarides 1992, Ljungqvist and Sargent 2008, Ball 2009).
    2
      We found essentially no studies estimating the effect of long-term unemployment on any outcome using
quasi-experimental variation or within-spell variation from panels. This is reflected in Bernanke (2012) and
Yellen (2014), who do not cite a single empirical study in support of the claim that unemployment duration
is costly. As discussed below, several studies estimate the depreciation of human capital as one of several
parameters in models of life-cycle earnings.
    3
      Several papers show that the degree of skill depreciation affects the optimal policy mix at the micro level
(e.g., Shimer and Werning 2006, Pavoni and Violante 2007, Pavoni 2009). Moreover, the speed and sources of
wage loss with unemployment duration have important implications for the potential usefulness of both fiscal
and monetary policy over the short and longer run.



                                                       1
from the labor demand side, holding job acceptance decisions (labor supply) constant. This
change in the wage offer distribution throughout the unemployment spell is an important
parameter as it describes how quickly the job prospects of the unemployed are declining,
independent from their own decisions.4
       Existing estimates suggest that the cost of a widespread rise of unemployment duration
could indeed be very large.5 However, these estimates potentially overstate the effect of unem-
ployment duration on job outcomes for two reasons. A common concern is that workers with
longer nonemployment durations also have other, potentially unobserved characteristics that
make them hard to employ and lower their wages. Furthermore one would expect that any
exogenous manipulation that affects nonemployment durations would also lead to changes in
which jobs are accepted by the unemployed. As a result, even estimates free of selection gener-
ally recover a combination of effects arising from the individual’s labor supply response (e.g., a
change in reservation wages) and a decline in wage offers in response to longer unemployment
durations (what we call the causal effect on wages) and are thus hard to interpret.
       In this paper, we provide the first quasi-experimental estimates of the causal effect of
unemployment duration on wage offers. These estimates are free of selection and of effects from
changes in the reservation wage, and hence reflect true shifts in the wage offer distribution. We
begin by laying out a conceptual framework based on the canonical partial-equilibrium model
of job search in which both unemployment duration and reemployment wages are endogenous,
which we augment with worker heterogeneity. A classic prediction from the model is that if
workers value their outside option, a rise in potential UI durations leads to a decline in job
search intensity and a rise in reservation wages. A key insight we exploit is that one can
learn about the behavior of reservation wages from observed reemployment wages at different
unemployment durations. In particular, we show that if the path of observed reemployment
wages does not shift outward in response to a rise in UI durations, this implies that reservation
   4
     The duration of unemployment is an endogenous variable, determined by individuals’ search effort and
job acceptance decisions as well as random arrivals of job offers. As in any instrumental variables setting, we
identify the effect of unemploment duration that results from explit exogenous variation. Below, we derive
the mathematical formula for the treatment effect we obtain.
   5
     Violante and Pavoni (2007) put consensus estimates from structural models (e.g., Keane and Wolpin 1997)
and regression studies (e.g., Addison and Portugal 1989) at 16-23% wage loss per year. For 3.2 million workers
with unemployment spells longer than one year that implies a loss of over $30 Billion at median earnings.
This loss is understated since many individuals have unemployment spells longer than one year, and skill
depreciation is usually specified linearly, implying losses for the many unemployment spells lasting below one
year as well.


                                                      2
wages do not bind, at least in the part of the wage offer distribution relevant for workers’
employment decisions.
       If the condition on reemployment wages are satisfied in the data, the only effect of nonem-
ployment durations on wages must arise from the wage offer distribution changing over the
duration of unemployment. We derive an expression of the resulting instrumental variables
(IV) estimator, show that it obtains a local average treatment effect of unemployment dura-
tion on wages over individuals whose nonemployment duration responds to the UI extension,
and derive an estimable expression of the corresponding weighting function. To gain further
insights on the potential role of reservation wages, which are likely to affect the lower tail of
accepted wages, we also extend our approach to estimate the average effect of nonemployment
duration throughout the wage distribution. Based on the theory, we derive bounds for the
causal effect of nonemployment duration on wages in case the condition on reemployment
wages does not hold and instead reservation wages do seem to affect job prospects in response
to UI extensions.
       We implement our conceptual framework using quasi-experimental variation and data from
Germany, which has several features that are ideal for our purposes. During the 1980s, UI
durations for middle aged workers in Germany were a step function of exact age at benefit
claiming, such that the causal effect of UI durations on job outcomes can be estimated using
a regression discontinuity design. A key feature of the German environment is that we have
access to the universe of social security records with information on day-to-day nonemployment
spells, exact dates of birth, as well as a broad range of worker and job characteristics. The
large samples and precisely measured unemployment and earnings information turn out to be
crucial for estimating the effect of nonemployment durations on wages.6
       We obtain three main findings. First, we find small but precisely estimated negative effects
of UI extensions on wages, job duration, and other job outcomes of middle aged workers, such
as the probability of full-time work and working in the same industry and occupation. Second,
   6
     Similar data is currently not available for the United States, because administrative data do not measure
exact unemployment and job durations, and samples from survey data are too small. During the period we
study, the incidence of long unemployment spells and effect of UI extensions on unemployment duration in
Germany were similar to comparable estimates for the United States (Schmieder, von Wachter, and Bender
2012); the size and structure of wage losses of job losers were similar as in the United States (Schmieder, von
Wachter, and Bender 2009); it is well known that the structure of earnings in the United States and Germany
is similar as well.



                                                      3
we show that the path of average reemployment wages at different nonemployment durations
does not shift, implying that reservation wages do not bind in our setting. As a result,
reservation wages do not contribute to declining wages over the nonemployment spell, and one
can use UI extensions as valid manipulation of nonemployment durations. Third, we obtain
IV estimates of the causal effect of nonemployment durations on wage offers. We find that for
each additional month in nonemployment duration, average daily wages decline by a bit less
than one percent. Thes results are robust to bounds resulting from small effects of reservation
wages consistent with our wage data. If one extrapolates linearly over the course of six months,
this effect can explain about a third of the average wage loss of unemployed workers. This
effect fades after people have been on a job for a few years and is statistically indistinguishable
from zero after five years. This negative effect can arise from multiple sources, including skill
depreciation, stigma effects, or changes in job characteristics, something we address explicitly
in our empirical analysis.
       Our paper is related to several strands of literature. Foremost, it presents both a framework
for obtaining causal estimates of the effect of nonemployment durations on wage offers, and a
new set of causal estimates, neither of which is currently available in the literature. Existing
estimates of wage effects are typically based on cross-sectional analyses of nonemployment
durations and wages (e.g., Addison and Portugal 1989), or derived from structural models (e.g.,
Keane and Wolpin 1997).7 While our ordinary-least squares estimates are of similar magnitude
as in the existing literature, our IV estimates are about two-thirds to a half of the basic
correlation, suggesting a potential role of negative selection in standard estimates. In a recent
paper, using an audit study Kroft, Lange, and Notowidigdo (2013) provided experimental
evidence showing that there is a negative causal effect of nonemployment durations on call
back rates for job interviews. Our paper extends these findings by studying the effect of
unemployment on other key outcomes of the employment process, wages and job outcomes,
which are harder to analyze in the context of an audit study because they inherently depend
on the actual employment decision.
       The parameter we estimate is important for policy. Our findings can be used to assess
with more confidence the potential cost of rising unenmployment durations for middle aged
   7
    In an exception, Edin and Gustavsson (2008) document a significant negative effect of nonemployment
spells on direct measures of skills in Sweden. Estimates of the earnings losses of displaced workers have also
been used to infer the correlation of nonemployment duration and wages (e.g., Neal 1995).


                                                      4
workers. Since we find that our IV estimate puts weight on all workers exiting unemployment
from one to 18 months, our results suggest even shorter increases in unemployment duration
may be costly. Our estimates can be used to calibrate models in macroeconomics or in
public finance in which the causal effect of nonemployment plays an important role. In public
finance, a growing theoretical literature shows how the structure of labor market depends on
the degree of wage decline with nonemployment. For example, Pavoni and Violante (2007)
show that this parameter plays a key role when multiple labor market policies are chosen
jointly. In macroeconomics, a series of papers by Ljungqvist and Sargent (2008) argues that
skill depreciation in conjunction with generous UI benefits has led to rising unemployment
rates in Europe in the 1980s. For the 2008 recession in the U.S., Katz, Kroft, Lange, and
Notowidigdo (2013) argue that negative duration dependence may explain part of the lasting
rise in long-term unemployment. In an extension of our main findings, we show that the
effect of unemployment durations on wages appears to be larger in recessionary environments.
Hence, a negative causal effect of nonemployment duration on wage offers may indeed be a
reason for this duration dependence.
       Our findings also relate to the literature examining the properties and effects of reser-
vation wages. Most of the literature is based on survey evidence of reservation wages (e.g.,
Feldstein and Poterba 1984, Blau and Robins 1986, DellaVigna and Paserman 2005, Krueger
and Mueller 2011, 2014). In contrast, here we show that it is possible to infer about the effect
of and changes in reservation wages directly when quasi-experimental variation of workers’
outside option is available. As in many other areas of economics, such a revealed-preference
approach allows one to side step important measurement issues and hence provides an impor-
tant complement to analyses of stated preferences. This is in a similar spirit as Hornstein,
Violante, and Krueger (2011), who infer about reservation wages using data on worker flows,
and who find, consistent with our results, that in a broad range of search models unemployed
workers’ must place a low value on their outside option.8 The best recent evidence on reser-
vation wages comes from Krueger and Mueller (2014), who find that while reservation wages
appear to influence employment decisions among UI recipients in New Jersey, reservation
   8
    Lalive, Landais, and Zweimueller (2013) replicate our approach of analyzing reemployment wage paths for
Austria and find similar results. In contrast to our findings, and findings by Card, Chetty, and Weber (2007a)
and Lalive, Landais, and Zweimueller (2013) for Austria, Nekoei and Weber (2013) find a larger spike in wages
at UI exhaustion that induces a slight positive overall effect of UI extensions on wages.



                                                      5
wages are effectively unaffected by unemployment duration and UI exhaustion. Hence, as
in our setting, changes in reservation wages are unlikely to be responsible for reductions in
reemployment wages over the unemployment spell.
        Our paper also adds to the literature estimating the effect of UI benefits on nonemploy-
ment durations and job outcomes. While a substantial body of research has documented the
disincentive effect of UI benefits (for example, Moffitt 1985; Katz and Meyer 1990; Meyer 1990;
Rothstein 2011, Kroft and Notowidigdo 2012, Schmieder, von Wachter, and Bender 2012a,b,
Farber and Valletta 2013), a much smaller literature has found mixed results regarding the
effects on wages and other job outcomes based on research designs using observational stud-
ies (e.g., Addison and Blackburn 2000). More recent studies by Lalive (2007), Card, Chetty
and Weber (2007a), and Centeno and Novo (2009) used regression discontinuity designs to
more clearly identify the effects and find negative impacts on wages. While these results are
relatively imprecisely estimated and hence not statistically significantly different from zero,
confidence intervals contain possible negative and positive values that are economically mean-
ingful.9 In addition to providing more precise estimates, partly due to larger sample sizes, the
framework in this paper also allows an empirical assessment of the sources behind the wage
effects of UI extensions.


2       Theory

We use a discrete time, non-stationary search model (e.g. van den Berg 1990) to derive our
main findings in three steps. First, we show how the effect of UI extensions on reemployment
wages can be decomposed into changes in reservation wages and changes in the wage offer
distribution over the nonemployment spell.10 Second, we use the model to show how the
effect of UI extensions on the reemployment wage path (i.e., reemployment wages conditional
on the time of exiting unemployment) can be used to infer about the response of reservation
wages to UI extensions. Third, we show that if the reemployment wage path is unaffected, it is
    9
     Consistent with a negative effect of nonemployment durations, Black, Smith, Berger and Noel (2003) find
positive effects on reemployment and quarterly earnings of UI recipients who are randomly assigned to (but
not necessarily participate in) more intensive job search services. Meyer (1995) reports imprecisely estimated
positive effects on earnings for UI recipients who receive a bonus upon faster reemployment. Degen and Lalive
(2013) find negative earnings effects from a reduction in potential UI benefit durations in Switzerland in a
difference in difference design.

     For an early insightful discussion of these issues, see Addison and Portugal (1989).


                                                      6
possible to identify the average change in the wage offer distribution over the nonemployment
spell – and hence the causal effect of nonemployment durations on wages – using UI extensions
as a source of exogenous variation.


2.1       Setup of Model

Workers become unemployed in period t = 0, are risk neutral and maximize the present
discounted value of income. In each period workers receive UI benefits bt and choose search
intensity λt , which is normalized to be equal to the probability of receiving a job offer in that
period. Without loss of generality we focus on the case of a two-tiered UI system, where UI
benefits are at a constant level b up to the maximum potential duration of receiving UI benefits
P . After benefit exhaustion, individuals receive a second tier of payments indefinitely, so that
bt = b for all t ≤ P and bt = b for all t > P . The cost of job search ψ(λt ) is an increasing,
convex and twice differentiable function.
       Jobs offer a wage wt∗ and wage offers are drawn from a distribution with cumulative distri-
bution function F (w∗ ; µt ), which may vary with the duration of unemployment t, for example
due to skill depreciation or stigma. To simplify the exposition we assume that the distribution
can be summarized by its mean in period t: µt .11 In this case we can write wt∗ = µt + ut ,
where E[ut |t] = 0 such that ut reflect random draws from the wage offer distribution. If a job
is accepted, the worker starts working at the beginning of the next period and stays at that
job forever. Optimal search behavior of the worker is described by a search effort path λt and
a reservation wage path φt , so that all wage offers wt∗ ≥ φt are accepted. In the appendix we
provide details on the value functions, the first order conditions, as well as the derivations for
the following results.


2.2       The Causal Effect of Unemployment Durations on Wages

Since unemployment duration is a choice variable in the model, it is useful to explicitly define
what we mean by its causal effect. GivenRour set up, the expected wage of an individual exiting
                                                    ∞
                                                         w∗ dF (w∗ ;µt )
                                       e            φt
unemployment in month t is w (t; P ) =                   1−F (φt )
                                                                           , which given the above assumptions can
be written as: we (φt , µt ) ≡ we (t; P ) = µt + E[ut |ut ≥ φt (P ) − µt ]. Note that the change
  11
       This is easily generalizable to more flexible distribution functions characterized by a vector of parameters
µt .


                                                             7
in we (t; P ) over time can be either due to changes in φt or due to changes in µt . Using
this notation, we define the slope of the reemployment wage path as the total (right)
derivative of the reemployment wage with respect to unemployment duration:12

                               dwe (t; P )   ∂we (φt , µt ) ∂φt ∂we (φt , µt ) ∂µt
                                           =                   +                                                       (1)
                                  dt            ∂φt         ∂t     ∂µt         ∂t
Based on this we can provide a precise definition of the causal effect of unemployment
duration on wages as the part of the slope of the reemployment wage path that is due to
changes in the wage offer distribution over time:

                                                  ∂we (φt , µt ) ∂µt
                                                                                                                       (2)
                                                     ∂µt         ∂t

The causal effect of unemployment duration on wages is thus the change in expected reem-
ployment wages that would result from exogenously increasing unemployment duration by
one month while holding the reservation wage constant over time. Note that if the reserva-
                                                                                               ∂we (φt ,µt ) ∂µt       ∂µt
tion wage is not binding at t, i.e., F (φt ) = 0, then we (φt , µt ) = µt and                     ∂µt         ∂t
                                                                                                                   =    ∂t
                                                                                                                           ,
that is the causal effect of unemployment duration on the reemployment wage is simply the
change in mean offered wages over time. We will argue below that this seems plausible
in the light of our empirical results. Therefore, for simplicity, we will alternatively refer to
∂we (φt ,µt ) ∂µt

in the wage offer distribution in the rest of the paper.
       Regressing w on unemployment durations t using OLS will not result in a meaningful
parameter for two reasons: First, since the duration of unemployment t itself is determined
by the search intensity and reservation wage of an individual, both t and w are affected by
individual characteristics (such as human capital) and the correlation between the error term
of the wage equation and t leads to the standard omitted variable bias in the estimate of the
                                                  dwe (t;P )
slope of the reemployment wage path                  dt
                                                             .   Second, even if we could fully condition on

      Our model is a discrete model in time, but for the following the notation will be simpler if we can work
with time derivatives. In the model only the values of φt , µt and we (t, P ) at discrete values of time {0, 1, 2, ...}
are necessary to describe the relevant environment for an individual and the optimal search strategy. Without
loss of generality we can therefore define the values of φt , µt and we (t, P ) for the time values between these
discrete values such that they are linear between the discrete points. For example for 0 < t < 1 let we (t, P )
be defined as: w(0) + [w(1) − w(0)]t. This means that φt , µt and we (t, P ) are piecewise linear, with kinks
at the integer values. All time derivatives below are right derivatives so that by construction we have that:
df (t)                                                          e
  dt = f (t + 1) − f (t),where f (t) is any function φt , µt , w (t, P ).

individual heterogeneity, due to changes in reservation wages over the spell we would obtain
an estimate of (1) but not of the causal effect of unemployment duration on wages as defined
in (2).


2.3     The Effect of Increasing Potential UI Durations on Wages

To simplify the exposition we will first analyze the model under the additional assumption that
workers are homogeneous and that the expected reemployment wage is a linear function of
                                                                   e                           dwe (t;P )
unemployment duration: we (t; P ) = ξ + dw dt(t;P ) t, where we assume that                       dt
                                                                                                            is a constant.
Below we will show that our result generalizes to the nonlinear case with heterogenous workers.
      The expected reemployment wage of an individual at the start of the nonemployment
spell can be calculated by integrating the reemployment wage conditional on exiting unem-
ployment at t over the distribution of nonemployment durations. In particular, if g(t) is
the probability mass function of the nonemployment distribution, we have that E[we (t; P )] =
P∞
  0   we (t; P ) g(t). An extension in potential UI durations P affects the expected reemployment
wage through two components:

distribution of nonemployment durations) shift in the reemployment wage path that is caused
by the benefit extension. The second term is due to the shift in the distribution of nonemploy-
ment durations along the reemployment wage path. Note that the expected nonemployment

Given our assumption of linearity for w (t; P ), Equation (3) can then be written as:

                              dE[we (t; P )]    ∂we (t, P )   dwe (t; P ) dD
                                                               "               #

          dD
where     dP
               is the marginal effect of an increase in P on the expected non-employment duration
D. This formula holds independently from our model and shows how in general the reemploy-
ment wage effect can be decomposed into shifts of the reemployment wage path and movement
along the reemployment wage path due to increases in nonemployment durations.


                                                                       9
      While the decomposition in equation (4) is mechanical, results from the search model
provide key insights into how changes in the outside option (in this case UI durations) affect
wages. Combining equations (4) and (1) it follows that the reemployment wage effect can
then be written as a combination of the reservation wage effect and the change in the wage
offer distribution over time:

          dE[we (t; P )]    ∂we (φt , µt ) ∂φt   ∂we (φt , µt ) ∂φt ∂we (φt , µt ) ∂µt dD

                         =E                    +                   +                                                    (5)

where E[.] again takes the expectation over nonemployment durations. The reservation wage
response affects the reemployment wage in two ways: through a shift in the reservation wage
and through movements along the reservation wage path. A key implication of equation (5) is
                                                                                                          ∂we (φt ,µt ) ∂µt

that in order to identify the causal effect of unemployment duration on wages                                ∂µt         ∂t

it is necessary to isolate it from these two reservation wage effects. Direct estimates of the
effect of UI extensions (or other changes in the outside options) capture all three components.
      A final point of equation (5) is that the sign of the effect of extending UI benefits on
the reemployment wage is ambiguous, reflecting the contrasting hypotheses about the effect
of UI mentioned in the introduction: The first component – due to an upward shift in the
reservation wage – will tend to increase the reemployment wage. The second component –
longer nonemployment durations leading to more job offers drawn from a different wage offer
distribution with lower reservation wages – will tend to decrease the reemployment wage.


2.4     Estimating the Causal Effect of Nonemployment Durations on Wages

The search model has clear implications how reservation wages change with UI durations and
over the nonemployment spell. Hence, to obtain an estimate of the effect of nonemployment
durations on the wage offer distribution, we need to infer about the effect of reservation wages
                                                                       ∂we (φt ,µt )          ∂we (φt ,µt )
on reemployment wages conditional on exiting at time t,                   ∂φt
                                                                                     .   If      ∂φt
                                                                                                              = 0, i.e.,
if reservation wages do not bind, then we can estimate the causal effect of nonemployment
duration on wages directly from equation (5).
                       ∂we (φt ,µt )
      To learn about      ∂φt
                                       we can exploit the fact that in a search model the response of the
reemployment wage at any nonemployment duration to increases in UI duration (i.e., shifts
in the reemployment wage path) is directly dependent on shifts in the reservation wage:


                                                         10
                                        ∂we (t, P )   ∂we (φt , µt ) ∂φt   ∂we (φt , µt ) dVtu
                                                    =                    =                     ρ                             (6)
                                          ∂P             ∂φt         ∂P       ∂φt         dP
       Rearranging this, one can see that the response in the path of reemployment wages to
UI extensions can be used to infer about the effect of reservation wages on accepted wages:
∂we (φt ,µt )       ∂we (t,P )         dVtu                                     dVtu

extension does in fact affect the value of the outside option. Yet, the valuation of the outside
                                                                                                          dht 14

                                                                                                             .     This leads to
a straightforward test for whether or not reservation wages affect reemployment wages. If
the exit hazard is changing ( dh
                              dP
                                t
                                  < 0) and there is no effect of UI durations on reemployment
                e
wages ( ∂w∂P
           (t,P )
                  = 0), then changes in the reservation wage do not affect reemployment wages.
       Note that if reservation wages do not affect reemployment wages, then an increase in UI
durations affects wages only through a rise in nonemployment durations and a corresponding
decline in wage offers (the third term in equation 5). In this case, UI extensions satisfy all
conditions of a valid instrumental variable. From equation (5), the causal effect of nonemploy-
ment durations on wages is simply the ratio between the effect of UI extensions on the average
wage and the effect of UI extensions on nonemployment durations, which is the formula of
the standard IV estimator. In other words, if the conditions on the reemployment hazard
and the path of reemployment wages hold, then the change in the wage offer distribution
can be estimated by regressing wages on nonemployment durations using UI extensions as an
instrument.
       Note that the result that the reemployment wage path does not shift in response to UI
extensions does not necessarily imply that the reservation wage is not binding for the entire
wage distribution. In the Web Appendix we show that all that is required for our empirical
strategy to hold is that for small changes reservation wages have no effect locally in the
distribution. This can be the case if for example the wage offer distribution is bimodal, with a
mode for very low wage jobs, and a mode for higher wage jobs, with little density in between.
  13
     Note that we have implicitly assumed that there is no direct of UI extensions on the wage offer distribution
itself, i.e., ∂µ
              ∂P = 0. This would fail for example if firms set wages taking a worker’s outside option into account,
                t


in which case ∂µ  ∂P > 0. However as long as
                    t

If the reservation wage lies in between two modes – as is likely to be realistic in our empirical
application of middle aged workers with high labor force attachment – then reservation wages
are binding, but small changes therein will not affect the mean of accepted wages.15


2.5      Heterogeneity and Nonlinearity

The results generalize to the case of heterogeneous workers and nonlinear changes in reem-
ployment wage path. Allowing for heterogeneity in our context is important since it makes
it clear that our estimates of the effect of UI extensions on the path of reemployment wages
may be affected by dynamic selection. As we further discuss in Section 3.3, selection may
entail either higher or lower ability individuals searching longer or responding more strongly
to UI incentives. In the theory, heterogeneity is purposefully kept completely flexible. In our
empirical analysis, we resolve the problem of dynamic selection using our quasi-experimental
research design.
       Heterogeneity is also important because in its presence our IV estimates will be a weighted
average of the individual-specific treatment effects. Moreover, since skill depreciation is not
necessarily linear throughout the nonemployment spell, the IV estimates will also be an average
over different parts of the potentially nonlinear skill depreciation schedule. To be able to
interpret the IV estimate, we derive an expression for the IV estimator and its weighting
function.
       Let subscripts i denote heterogeneity in terms of the model parameters (such as the cost
of job search, the wage offer distribution, preferences, etc.). In the Web Appendix we show
that in the presence of heterogeneity and nonlinearity, the effect of UI extensions on average
reemployment wages shown in equation (4) can be generalized to:

    One can show that if the wage distribution has a range in which workers do not receive wage offers and the
reservation wage lies in that range, then our empirical strategy measures the causal effect of nonemployment
duration over the effective wage offer distribution, i.e., the part of the distribution above the reservation wage.

be decomposed into the shift of reemployment wages conditional on unemployment durations,
which depends on the shift in reservation wages, and movement along the reemployment wage
path, which depends on the change in reservation wages and wage offers with unemployment
duration. The movement along the reemployment wage path can again be expressed as the
                                                                               dD

                                                                                     ∂wie (t)
average of the individual slopes of the reemployment wage path                         ∂t
                                                                                              .   At each nonemploy-
ment duration t, the average is taken over the (possibly heterogeneous) slope of wages at
that nonemployment duration of all individuals whose nonemployment durations are in fact
responding to the UI extension. The average slopes at each month t then receive a weight
proportional to the overall change in the survivor function in that month.
   As in the linear, homogenous case, if the reemployment wage path is not affected by
changes in potential UI durations, then we can infer that the reservation wage does not affect
reemployment wages. Thus, the second term in equation (7) would reduce to a weighted
average of causal effects of nonemployment duration on wages for different individuals at
                       ∂wie (φit ,µit ) ∂µit
different durations,        ∂µit         ∂t
                                             .   In this case, we can derive an IV estimator of the causal
effect of nonemployment durations on wages. The following proposition states the exact
interpretation of this IV estimator for the case that potential UI durations P take on discrete
values (as it does in our empirical application):

Proposition 1. Suppose the reservation wage is not binding for all individuals for whom the
duration of unemployment is responding to changes in UI durations. If potential UI durations
P take on exactly two values (P, P 0 ), then the IV estimand, defined as the ratio of the differ-
ence in average wage at two values of the durations instrument, to the difference in average
durations at the same two values of the durations instrument,

                                                  E[wi (t, P 0 )] − E[wi (t, P )]

   equals the following weighted average of the derivative of the wage function:

are nonnegative and integrate to one.

      Proposition 1 states that the IV estimator from a regression of wages on nonemployment
durations using UI extensions as an instrument has an interpretation of a local average treat-
ment effect of unemployment durations on wages. The weighting function ω ∗ (t) is proportional
to the differences in survivor functions. The IV estimator puts more weight on those individ-
uals whose nonemployment durations respond more strongly to the instrument (i.e., whose
survival functions are shifting). This is akin to the standard result in linear models with
heterogeneous parameters (Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin 1996), but is here derived for the gen-
eral case in which wages may be a nonlinear function of nonemployment durations (Angrist,
Graddy, and Imbens 2000). Hence, as in the more standard linear case, the weighting function
can be estimated from the data. In the empirical section, we discuss the weighting function,
discuss how the IV estimator is affected if the underlying conditions of Propositions 1 fail, and
we present bounds for the case in which there are small shifts in the reservation wage path.


2.6     Empirical Content of Model

The main results do not depend on the particular model of wage setting. The contribution
of the theory is to show that estimating whether the path of reemployment wages is affected
by changes in the UI benefit path (or other factors affecting the value of nonemployment),
provides a test for the importance of the outside option of unemployed workers in the wage
determination process. If reemployment wages conditional on unemployment duration do not
respond to changes in the outside option, then the decline of reemployment wages over the
unemployment spell can not be due to a response to the the outside option throughout the
unemployment spell. Instead, it must be due to a decline of the wage offer distribution over the
nonemployment spell. For this to be meaningful, individuals must value the outside option,
as implied by a change in hazard rates. The theory suggests a straightforward strategy for
the empirical work. Another key insight is that using weak additional assumptions implied by
the theory, one can estimate the effect of UI extensions on the path of reemployment wages

                                                   14
even if the distribution of characteristics throughout the nonemployment spell changes. We
will return to our empirical approach after briefly describing the institutional set up.
         While we illustrated this insight in a model of wage posting, a symmetric intuition applies
in wage bargaining models, where wages should in principle also be affected by the outside
option of the unemployed worker. If they are not, then changes in the value of the outside
option throughout the unemployment spell should also not have an effect on reemployment
wages and thus cannot explain the observed decline in reemployment wages. A similar intuition
would hold in a directed search model where workers choose to search for jobs in a segment of
the labor market. In such a model wages are affected by the choice of the labor market and
the reservation wage when searching in a market. If the wage conditional on unemployment
duration does not respond to UI benefit changes, then the choice of which segment to search
in is not responding to changes in the outside option and the outside option cannot explain
the decline in wages over the unemployment spell.


3        Institutions, Data and Empirical Methods

3.1        Institutional Background

After working for at least 12 months in the previous three years, workers losing a job through
no fault of their own in Germany are eligible for UI benefits that provide a fixed replacement
rate of 63 percent for an individual without children.16 This paper focuses on the time period
between 1987 and 1999, which is the longest period for which the UI system was stable, and
during which the maximum duration of benefits was tied to the exact age of the start of benefit
receipt and to prior labor force history. Between July 1987 and March 1999, the maximum
potential UI duration for workers who were younger than 42 years old was 12 months.17 For
workers age 42 to 43 maximum potential UI duration increased to 18 months and for workers
age 44 to 48, the maximum duration further rose to 22 months. Workers with lower prior
labor force attachment also experienced increases in potential UI durations at the 42 and
44 age cutoffs, albeit smaller. Our main identification strategy is to use the variation in
    16
      For individuals with children the replacement rate is 68 percent. There is a cap on earnings insured, but
it affects only a small number of recipients. Since they are derived based on net earnings, in Germany UI
benefits are not taxed themselves, but can push total income into a higher income tax bracket.
   17
      For a description of other cutoffs present in the system and recent reforms, see Schmieder, von Wachter,
and Bender (2012a).

potential UI durations at the age thresholds to analyze unemployment, wages, and the effect
of nonemployment duration on wages.18


3.2     Data

For this paper we have obtained access to the universe of social security records in Germany
from 1975 to 2008. The data covers day-to-day information on every instance of employment
covered by social security and every receipt of unemployment insurance benefits, as well as cor-
responding wages and benefit levels. We observe several demographic characteristics, namely
gender, education, birth date, nationality, place of residence and work, as well as detailed job
characteristics, such as average daily wage, occupation, industry, and characteristics of the
employer.19
      For our analysis sample, we extracted all unemployment insurance spells where the claimant
was between age 40 and age 46 on the claim date. We consider unemployment spells starting
any time between July 1987 and April 1999. For each UI spell we created variables about
the previous work history (such as job tenure, labor market experience, wage, industry and
occupation at the previous job), the duration of UI benefit receipt in days, the UI benefit
level, and information about the next job held after non-employment.
      Since we do not directly observe whether individuals are unemployed we follow the previous
literature and, in addition to duration of UI benefit receipt, we use length of non-employment
as a measure for unemployment durations (e.g., Card, Chetty, and Weber 2007b). The du-
ration of non-employment is measured as the time between the start of receiving UI benefits
and the date of the next registered period of employment. Our analysis period assures that
we can follow individuals for at least 9 years after the start of the UI spell.
      We calculate each individual’s potential UI duration at the beginning of the UI spell,
using information about the law together with information on exact birth dates and work
  18
     In Germany individuals who exhaust regular UI benefits are eligible for means tested unemployment
assistance benefits (UA), which do not have a limited duration. The nominal replacement rate is 53%, but
UA payments are reduced substantially by spousal earnings and other sources of income, which may explain
why only about 50% of UI exhaustees take up UA benefits. In Schmieder, von Wachter and Bender (2012a)
we provide an in-depth assessment of the role of UA.
  19
     Individual workers can be followed using a unique person identifier. Since about 80 percent of all jobs are
within the social security system (the main exceptions are self-employed, students, and government employees)
this situation results in nearly complete work histories for most individuals. Each employment record also
has a unique establishment identifier that can be used to merge establishment characteristics to individual
observations.

                                                      16
histories. This method yields exact measures for workers who have been employed for a long
continuous time and hence are eligible for the maximum potential benefit durations for their
age groups. However, the calculation is not as clear cut for workers with intermittent periods
of unemployment because of complex carry-forward provisions in the law. We thus define
our core analysis sample to be all unemployment spells of workers who have been employed
for at least 36 months (44 months at the age 44 cutoff) of the last seven years and who did
not receive unemployment insurance benefits during that time period.20 In Schmieder et.
al. (2012a), we show that the characteristics of this sample are comparable with those of UI
recipients of similar age in the United States. In addition, in our sensitivity analysis we also
consider results when we use all workers affected by the two age cutoffs, irrespective of prior
labor force history. While for these we cannot obtain the marginal effect of an additional
month of UI extension, we show that we can obtain consistent IV estimates of the effect of
nonemployment duration under the same conditions as in our main sample.


3.3   Estimation

The institutional structure and data allow us to estimate the causal effect of UI durations on
wages. In addition, it allows us to verify the conditions on the path of reemployment wages
described in Section 2 even in the presence of dynamic selection. As a result, it can be used
to obtain estimates of the causal effect of nonemployment duration on wages. Our empirical
strategy follows three consecutive steps.


Estimating the Causal Effect of UI Durations on Employment and Wages. The
institutional structure and data allow us to estimate the causal effect of large extensions in UI
benefit durations on non-employment duration, reemployment wages and other outcomes for
workers with previously stable employment using a regression discontinuity design. We follow
common practice and first show smoothed figures to visually examine discontinuities at the
eligibility thresholds (e.g., Lee and Lemieux 2010). To obtain estimates for the main causal
effects, we follow standard regression discontinuity methodology and estimate variants of the
  20
     Individuals who have quit their jobs voluntarily are subject to a 12 weeks waiting period. To focus on
individuals who lost their job involuntarily and minimize selection concerns due to quitting we restrict our
sample to individuals who claimed UI benefits within 12 weeks after their job ended.




                                                    17
following regression model:


                                yi = β + γ × ∆P × Dai ≥a∗ + f (ai ) + i ,                                   (8)


where yi is an outcome variable, such as non-employment duration (D) or reemployment wages
(w), of an individual i of age ai . Dai ≥a∗ is a dummy variable that indicates that an individual
is above the age threshold a∗ . In the notation from Section 2, we obtain estimates for                 dD
                                                                                                        dP
                                                                                                             and
dE[w]
 dP
      .
    For our main estimates, we focus on the period from July 1987 - March 1999, and we use
the sharp threshold at age 42. We estimate equation (8) locally around the two cutoffs and
specify f (ai ) as a linear function while allowing different slopes on both sides of the cutoff.
We use a relatively small bandwidth of two years on each side of the cutoff, and summarize
our extensive sensitivity analysis below.In order to obtain additional power we also estimate a
pooled regression model, where we take the estimation samples for the age 42 and the age 44
cutoffs together.21 For this procedure we normalize the age for all individuals within two years
of the age 42 (44) threshold to the age relative to age 42 (44) (i.e. the rescaled age variable
is set to 0 for someone who is exactly age 42 (44) at the time of claiming UI). We estimate
the following model on the pooled sample: yi = β + γ × ∆P × Dai ≥a∗ + f (ai ) + i , where ai
is the normalized age variable and ∆P is the average change in potential UI durations at the
age threshold. With this specification γ̂ is a direct estimate of the rescaled marginal effect,
forcing it to be equal at the two cutoffs. We always present regression discontinuity robust
standard errors based on Calonico et al. (forthcoming).22


Estimating the Shift in the Path of Reemployment Wages and Hazards. The main
goal of the paper is to estimate the causal effect of nonemployment durations on wages. As
derived in Section 2, the first step in obtaining such an estimate is to assess whether the path
of reemployment wages and the reemployment hazard shift in response to the UI extensions.
While estimating the shift is in principle straightforward, a key issue is the potential presence
  21
     We also estimated all results at the age 44 cutoff separately. The point estimates are very similar but lack
precision.
  22
     Optimal bandwidth computations (as in Imbens and Kalyanaraman, 2012, and Calonico et al., forth-
coming) are computationally quite demanding due to the large number of observations, especially when we
calculate dynamic effects. We therefore keep the bandwidth at 2 years, but report optimal bandwidth estimates
for the main results in our robustness checks.

                                                       18
of dynamic selection. For example, low skilled workers may be more credit constrained, and
hence respond more strongly to UI extensions. Even absent changes in UI benefits, it is likely
that less productive workers have longer nonemployment durations.
   In the absence of selection, we could directly estimate the average shift in the reemployment
                                                                                 ∂wie (t,P )
                                                                             h                 i
wage path and test whether it is equal to zero. Let δ = E                           ∂P
                                                                                                   be the average shift in
the reemployment wage path. To obtain an estimate of δ, one would estimate the following
regression on the sample above and below the respective age cutoffs

                                                    T
                                    wi∗
                                                    X
                                          = δPi +         θt + f (ai ) + i                                            (9)
                                                    t=1


where wi∗ is the observed reemployment wage, θt are time dummies for the duration of non-
employment, and f (ai ) is a polynomial in age. Yet, although cov(P, ) = 0 from the RD
assumptions, the resulting estimate for δ from this regression is inconsistent because nonem-
ployment durations may be correlated with unobserved productivity (i.e., cov(t, ) 6= 0). How-
ever, under the standard assumption that cov(t, ) ≤ 0, we show in the Web Appendix that
the estimated OLS coefficient δ̂ is an upper bound for the true δ. Our analysis of observable
characteristics of individuals exiting at different durations and our contrast of the IV and OLS
estimators of the effect of nonemployment on wages in Section 5 support the assumption that
less able individuals tend to have longer nonemployment durations.
   This is sufficient for our purposes, because from the theory we know that the reservation
                                                              ∂we (t,P )
wage has to rise or stay constant and hence that                ∂P
                                                                           ≥ 0 for all t. Since δ is a weighted
average of the effect of UI extensions at all nonemployment durations (with positive weights),
                                ∂we (t,P )
if δ ≈ 0 then it must be that     ∂P
                                             = 0 at all nonemployment durations t. In other words, if
we find that the estimated δ̂ is close to zero, given that δ̂ is an upper bound of the true δ, we
can conclude that the entire reemployment wage path and hence reservation wages have not
shifted. Below, we will also use the confidence interval for the estimate δ̂ to derive bounds for
our causal estimates for small shifts in reservation wages.
   We will also graphically examine the reemployment wage path, as well as a rich set of
predetermined characteristics of workers exiting at different points in the nonemployment
spell. If the distribution of observed characteristics over the duration of nonemployment is
unaffected by UI extensions, then this provides further direct evidence for the absence of a


                                                     19
strong role of selection. Similar arguments based on observables can be made as for estimates

                                                                                                                = 0)
then the relevant conditions for Proposition 1 hold, and the effect of UI durations on reem-
ployment wages are driven solely by higher nonemployment durations. The final step then is
to directly estimate the causal effect of nonemployment duration on wage offers using poten-
tial UI durations as instrumental variables for nonemployment durations. By the results in
Section 2.3, the resulting IV estimator obtains the average effect of nonemployment duration
on wages for all individuals responding to the UI extension, irrespective of elapsed nonem-
ployment duration. Below, we will calculate the weighting function of the IV estimator over
the nonemployment spell. As explained in Section 3.2, we also extend our IV strategy and
use the age cutoff itself as instrument for nonemployment duration for the broader sample of
workers for whom we cannot calculate potential UI durations.


3.4      Validity of RD Design

A key aspect in all three steps of our empirical strategy is the validity of the RD design.
The regression discontinuity method only yields consistent results if factors apart from the
treatment variable do not vary discontinuously at the threshold. In our setting, both UI
claimants and their employers face potential incentives to manipulate the age of claiming. We
have examined this issue at length in our related paper (Schmieder, von Wachter, and Bender
2012a) and its Web Appendix, and conclude that sorting around the threshold is not a concern
in this case. We only summarize the main findings here and refer the interested reader to our
precursor paper for a more detailed discussion of manipulation, including potential reasons
for its absence.
       A standard test for sorting around the threshold is to investigate whether the density of
observations shifts or spikes near the threshold (McCrary 2008). Figure 1 (a) shows the number
of unemployment spells in two-week age intervals around the cutoff. There is a small shift in
  23
    Most of the literature presents estimates of the effect of UI durations on reemployment hazards without
specifically addressing this selection issue.



                                                    20
observations from two weeks before to two weeks after the age cutoffs, that affects only about
200 individuals relative to about 500,000 observations in the sample close to the age cutoff.
Further investigation showed that this increase is not driven by individuals who postpone their
claim, but that, if at all, the incidence of separations rises slightly at the eligibility age. To
investigate the nature of sorting further we investigated whether predetermined characteristics
vary discontinuously at the threshold. Figure 1 (b) shows the pre-unemployment log wage in
2 month bins around the thresholds and shows no discernible discontinuity. We investigated
many other baseline characteristics and found that only the fraction of UI recipients who
are female is estimated to increase statistically significantly by about 0.8 percentage points.
All other variables show essentially no (economically or statistically) meaningful difference
at the threshold.24 In smaller datasets, such minor discontinuities and density shifts would
almost certainly not be detectable. While these findings point to a small violation of the RD
identification assumptions, these should have a relatively small impact on the overall results.
In fact, neither trimming observations close to the eligibility thresholds nor directly controlling
for observable characteristics affects our results. To ensure that our results are not affected by
sorting around the threshold and by particular implementation choices of the RD estimator,
we performed multiple robustness checks summarized in the sensitivity section (Section 6).


4        The Average Effect of UI extensions on Job Quality

4.1       The Effects of UI extensions on Nonemployment Durations

We begin by replicating our findings on the effect of UI extensions on UI duration and nonem-
ployment duration from our previous paper (Schmieder, von Wachter, and Bender 2012a),
which we will later use to calculate IV estimates of the effect of nonemployment duration on
wages. Increases in potential UI durations have a very clear effect on nonemployment dura-
tions and hence substantially change behavior of unemployed individuals. Showing averages
by two-months age windows, Figure 2 (a) shows that increasing potential UI durations at
the two age thresholds leads to substantial increases in UI durations. This effect is partly
mechanical, since individuals who would have exhausted their benefits at 12 months or 18
    24
    There is a tiny difference in the years of education variable at the first threshold of about 0.03 years (or
10 days) of education.



                                                      21
months are now covered for up to 6 more months, and partly behavioral, since individuals
may reduce their search effort and thus stay unemployed longer. The purely behavioral effect
of an increase in potential UI durations is demonstrated in Figure 2 (b), which shows the
effect on nonemployment durations.
      In Table 1, columns (1) and (2) confirm the visual impression. The effects on actual UI
duration and nonemployment duration are very precisely estimated. The table also shows the
marginal effect of an increase in potential UI durations by 1 month, i.e. the estimated RD
coefficient rescaled by the increase in potential UI durations. For one additional month of
potential UI benefits unemployed individuals receive about 0.3 months of additional benefits
and remain unemployed for about 0.15 months longer. These marginal effects are similar
to findings from previous research including Moffitt (1985), Katz and Meyer (1990), Meyer
(1990) Card, Chetty, and Weber. (2007a), or Lalive (2007), although much more precisely
estimated.
      Finally, as further discussed in von Wachter, Bender, and Schmieder (2012b), column (3)
of 1 shows that the probability of ever again working in a social security liable job decreases
by about 0.5 (0.1) percentage points per additional month of potential UI benefits at the age
42 threshold (pooled). In the sensitivity section, we will assess whether this small effect could
imply a potential bias from sample selection in our main wage estimates.


4.2     The Effect of UI Extensions on Reemployment Wages

As discussed in the theory section, longer nonemployment durations in response to higher po-
tential UI durations could either raise wages as individuals have more time to search for a bet-
ter job, or lower wages if the negative effect from longer nonemployment durations dominates.
Figure 3 (a) shows the effect on the log wage at the first job after the period of unemployment.
There appears to be a small decline by about 0.01 log points in the post-unemployment wage
at the age 42 threshold. At the age 44 threshold, the lines (fitted quadratic polynomials)
also seem to indicate a small drop in the post-unemployment wage. Figure 3 (b) shows the
difference in the pre-unemployment log wage and the post-unemployment log wage. This
difference is a way to remove an individual fixed effect and hence can be viewed as a way to
both control for possible selection into employment and to obtain more precise estimates by
controlling for predetermined characteristics. The figure shows that the average wage loss for

                                               22
the unemployed in our sample is substantial, ranging from 13% to 16%. While the gain in
precision is modest, Figure 3 (b) indicates that selection along the previous wage has little
impact on the results, and again clearly points to a negative effect of a rise in potential UI
durations on post-unemployment wages.
   The corresponding regression estimates in Table 1 columns (4) and (5) show that increases
in potential UI durations lead to precisely estimated negative effects on post-unemployment
wages. Panel A shows that the post-unemployment wage is about 0.8 percent lower in both
levels and first differences when potential UI durations increase by six months. Panel B
shows the results from pooling both cutoffs and reveals similar estimates with a small gain in
statistical precision. The estimate from the pooled model implies that an increase in potential
UI durations by one month decreases post-unemployment wages by about 0.1 percent. Below
we show that these small effects of UI extensions on wages can imply substantial negative
effects of nonemployment durations on wages.
   Although the effect on the initial wage obtained after reemployment shown in Table 1 is
small, the losses can add up to more substantial effects if individuals remain in lower paying
jobs for a long period of time. Table 2 shows the effect on the log wage one, three, and five
years after the start of the new employment spell. The estimates decline from one to five
years start of employment, consistent with the result in Table 2 that there is a small positive
(yet insignificant) effect of potential UI durations on wage growth. Yet, although the longer-
term effects are not estimated precisely, the point estimates after 5 years are suggestive of
potentially substantial cumulated wage losses. We will return to the implications for the total
wage loss and individual behavior in the conclusion.
   Other papers that have estimated the wage effect of increases in potential UI durations
have found similar point estimates, although generally with less precision than we do. For
example Card, Chetty and Weber (2007a) found a negative point estimate of UI durations
on wages, quite comparable when rescaled to a marginal effect. Similarly, van Ours and
Vodopivec (2008) and Centeno and Novo (2009) find negative effects of similar magnitude of
UI extensions. As further discussed in Section 5, an additional value added with respect to
these papers is that we provide a framework and dynamic results that allow us to separate
the wage offer and the reservation wage effect.



                                              23
4.3     The Effect of UI Extensions on Other Job Outcomes

In this section we show that individuals do not simply accept lower wages in return for other
desirable job characteristics – i.e., jobs tend to be worse among all the dimensions we can
measure here. Columns (1) to (4) of Panel B of Table 2 show the effect of increases in
potential UI durations on a number of job-related outcome variables. The first outcome is the
completed job tenure at the post-unemployment job, which is often used as an indicator of the
quality of the job match. Column (1) of Panel B shows that there is a small decrease in the
duration of the post-unemployment job of about 0.0081 years in Panel A, which is a decline
of about 1% relative to mean post-unemployment job tenure (it is statistically significant at
a 10% level for the full sample, see the Web Appendix). This confirms findings in Table 1
that higher potential UI durations reduce job stability even beyond the initial spell. Hence, it
does not appear individuals with longer UI durations trade lower wages for more stable jobs
or jobs that appear to represent better matches.
      We analyzed several additional indicators of job quality. Longer potential UI durations
decrease the probability of finding a full time job, but although precisely estimated the effect
is less than 1% relative to the mean of 89% (column (2) of Panel B).25 An important finding of
the literature on displaced workers is that those switching to another industry or occupation
experience much larger declines in earnings (e.g., Neal 1995, Addison and Portugal 1989).
Hence, one would expect that longer UI durations may help individuals to find jobs in their
previous line of work. Columns (3) and (4) of Panel B of Table 2 show that this is not the case.
Longer potential UI durations increase the probability of switching to a different industry and
a different occupation by about 0.12 to 0.18 percentage points, respectively.
      Overall, all measures of job quality available in our data either point to negative effects
of longer potential UI durations or no effect. Hence, at least based on this limited set of job
characteristics, it does not appear that workers with longer UI durations accept lower wages
in return to better job outcomes along other dimensions. The analysis of other job outcomes
also provides insights into the potential channels underlying the reduction in wages and the
role of nonemployment durations, which we further discuss below.
  25
     We also analyzed changes in firm size as proxy for employer quality, as well as the probability of a rise in
commuting, and found no significant change.

5        The Causal Effect of Nonemployment Durations on Reemployment Wages

5.1       Selection Throughout the Nonemployment Spell

A key step in estimating the causal effect of nonemployment duration on wages is to assess
the response in hazard rates and reemployment wages throughout the nonemployment spell.
Although we will directly control for selection below, to assess the potential for dynamic
selection we begin with a descriptive analysis of the evolution of observable characteristics
throughout the nonemployment spell. As summary measures Figure 4 shows the mean of
pre-unemployment wages (a) and the mean of predicted reemployment wages (b) (based on a
broad range of pre-determined characteristics) by month of nonemployment duration. Vertical
bars indicate that the point estimates at time t are statistically significant at the 5 percent
level. As expected, there is some correlation between pre-determined characteristics and
nonemployment duration, though the gradient is not very strong. For example, mean pre-
unemployment wages fall by about 5% and mean predicted wages fall by about 7% in the
first year of nonemployment duration. In separate analysis, we found that years of schooling
or fraction female is positively correlated with nonemployment duration. More importantly
for our analysis, in both of these figures the pre-unemployment wage paths and the predicted
reemployment wage path are essentially unaffected by changes in potential UI durations.
While there are a few statistically significant point estimates in each figure (and in the figures
of single characteristics not shown here), given that each figure is created from 24 separate
point estimates, it is expected that about one to two of the estimates are statistically significant
on the 5 percent level purely because of sampling variation.26 Overall, these figures therefore
support the notion that the distribution of observable characteristics over the nonemployment
spell is essentially uncorrelated with potential UI durations, suggesting that it is unlikely that
potential UI durations exert a strong effect on the distribution of unobservable characteristics.
    26
    The one exception appears to be the spikes at the exhaustion point for fraction female. Individuals who
are exiting from unemployment at the exhaustion points are significantly more likely to be female. This is
consistent with larger labor supply effects of UI benefits for women. The fact that the spikes in fraction women
cancel each other out, seems to indicate that some women are simply waiting until their benefits expire before
going back to work. To address this aspect, we show in the sensitivity section that our results hold within
gender groups.




                                                      25
5.2     Estimates of the Shift of Reemployment Hazards and Wages

Figure 5 shows estimates of the shift in the hazard rate at the age 42 discontinuity. We clearly
see that the hazard rate shifts downward in response to increasing P for all nonemployment
durations t smaller than the maximum potential UI duration P . This is statistically significant
for nearly all point estimates, even in the first period (t = 0), so individuals are clearly forward
looking and responding to the increase in P a long time before they are running out of benefits.
A similar pattern has been observed in many other studies of the effect of UI extensions on
nonemployment duration (e.g., Card, Chetty, and Weber 2007b).
      Figure 6 Panel (a) shows the effect of changes in P on the reemployment wage conditional
on t. On average, wages decline by about 25 percent within the first year. However, we do not
observe a corresponding change in the path of reemployment wages over the nonemployment
                                                                                           ∂wie (t,P )
spell. In the notation of the model of Section 2, it appears that indeed                      ∂P
                                                                                                         = 0 for
all nonemployment durations t < P . In the Web Appendix we show an almost unchanged
pattern when we control for individual heterogeneity by plotting the difference in post and
pre unemployment log wage. Extending UI benefits does not shift the reemployment wage
path upwards.
      The only statistically significant changes in the reemployment wages are at the exhaustion
points for the two groups, when reemployment wages go down relative to the other group. It is
noteworthy that the two downward spikes are of very similar magnitude and essentially cancel
each other out. These differences are reduced when we look at women and men separately,
indicating that the negative wage spikes are partly driven by more women exhausting UI
benefits.
      The evidence in Section 5.1 and theoretical considerations discussed in Section 3.3 suggest
it is unlikely that these findings are overturned by a change in the distribution of worker
characteristics over the nonemplyoment spell. As outlined in Section 3.3, relying on our RD
assumptions, we can obtain direct estimates of the mean shift in the reemployment wage
paths that are not affected by dynamic selection. Table 3 presents estimates of the average
                                               ∂wie (t,P )
                                           h                 i
shift in the reemployment wage path, E            ∂P
                                                                 , obtained from implementing equation (9).
Column (1) of Table 3 shows the results controlling for a linear effect of nonemployment
duration. This yields an estimate for δ for the 12 to 18 month discontinuity very close to


                                                    26
zero (point estimate -0.016% with a standard error of 0.048%). If we control more flexibly
for the nonemployment duration effect (Columns 2 to 3), the point estimate is even closer to
0. Given that the estimates in Table 3 are very close to zero, and that theory excludes cases
              ∂wie (t,P )                                                               ∂wie (t,P )
for which        ∂P
                            < 0, this confirms the visual impression of Figure 6 that      ∂P
                                                                                                       = 0 for all
nonemployment durations t < P . This shows that the value of the outside option, in this case
the potential UI duration, does not affect reservation wages and therefore that the effect of
UI durations on wages found in Section 4 arises due to a rise in nonemployment durations.
      These results imply that reservation wages do not appear to bind in our sample. This
is consistent with related findings in the literature. For example, DellaVigna and Paserman
(2005) calibrate a model similar to ours and find that very few wage offers fall below the
reservation wage. Our results are also consistent with structural estimates in van den Berg
(1990) who found that most job offers are indeed accepted and that unemployed workers do
not seem to reject many jobs based on wages. Similarly, Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante
(2011) show that in broad classes of search models, the value of non market time – and hence
the reservation wage – has to be low to be able to reconcile why despite high wage dispersion,
and hence a high option value of searching, workers in practice accept jobs quickly. Following
our approach, Lalive, Landais, and Zweimueller (2013) also find that the path of reemployment
wages does not respond to increases in UI durations in Austria.
      In contrast, Krueger and Mueller (2014) find that jobs with wages above the self-reported
reservation wage are more likely to be accepted, although a substantial fraction of jobs paying
below the reservation wage are accepted as well. However, they also find that reservation
wages do not change significantly throughout the nonemployment spell within individuals,
                                                                                                      ∂wie (t,P )
nor do they respond to UI exhaustion. Hence, in our notation these results imply                        ∂φit
                                                                                                                    >0
       ∂φit       ∂φit
but    ∂P
              =    ∂t
                         = 0. In this case the first two terms in equation (5) are still equal to zero
and the IV estimator discussed next recovers the causal effect of unemployment duration on
wages.


5.3     Estimates of the Causal Effect of Nonemployment Durations on Wages

The results on the hazard and reemployment wage path imply that reservation wages do not
bind. As a result, the observed decline in reemployment wages is entirely due to the decline
in the wage offer distribution (equation 1), and the effect of UI durations on wages is only due

                                                       27
to a rise in nonemployment durations (equation 5). Proposition 1 then allows us to obtain
a valid estimate of the average decline in the reemployment wage path. In the final step of
our empirical analysis, we thus estimate the slope of the reemployment wage path using UI
                                                                          dE[w]
durations as instrumental variables for nonemployment durations: π =       dP
                                                                           dD     .
                                                                           dP

   Table 4 shows 2SLS results for the effect of nonemployment durations on reemployment
wages using extensions in potential UI durations as an instrument. The table first shows the
first stage regression (i.e., the effect of UI extension on nonemployment durations), which
easily passes weak instrument concerns. The second column shows the ’reduced form’ of the
IV estimator, which correspond to the baseline estimates of the effect of potential UI durations
on wages of Section 4.2. Column (3) reports the resulting 2SLS estimate of nonemployment
durations on wages. We find that π = −0.78%, which is precisely estimated. Thus, our main
finding is that an additional month of nonemployment lowers average wage offers of middle
aged workers by about 0.8 percent.
   To better understand the nature of our IV estimator, recall that Proposition 1 states that in
the presence of heterogeneity and nonlinearity in the slope of the reemployment wage function,
the IV estimator obtains the local average treatment effect of wage declines for individuals
whose nonemployment durations are most affected by the instrument. As such, it is weighted
towards the treatment effects of compliers to the UI extensions that underlie our regression
discontinuity (RD) estimates. As seen from the survival functions in Panel (b) of Figure
5 the compliers come from the entire range of nonemployment durations, with the largest
weight being between 12 and 18 months. Hence, the IV estimator estimates an average of the
effect of nonemployment duration on wages over a broad spell of nonemployment durations.
In contrast to the IV estimator, the implicit weighting function of the OLS estimator puts
more weight on long durations where there are fewer individuals but for whom the gradient is
flatter. As a result the, OLS estimator for the full sample (column 3 of Table 4) is similar to
the IV estimate. To obtain a better comparison, we reestimated the OLS estimator excluding
individuals with spells longer than 18 months that would typically receive little weight in
surveys with much smaller sample sizes. The resulting estimate corresponds more closely to
what is shown in Figure 6, and is approximately double the IV estimate.
   To gauge the magnitude of our estimates, our point estimates imply a loss in daily wages
of 4.8% (9.6%) for 6 (12) additional months of nonemployment duration. Based on Figure 6,

                                              28
this represents about 40% of the average wage loss at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Thus,
the causal effect of nonemployment spells explain a substantial fraction of the average wage
loss at job loss. Since the causal effect we estimate here is likely due to multiple channels
– including skill depreciation, discouragement, or stigma – it is not clear what magnitude
to expect. While it is hard to compare our estimate with previous findings based on non-
experimental estimates, the findings fall in the same broad range. Estimates based on the
correlation of nonemployment duration of displaced workers with reemployment wages suggest
effects bigger than our IV estimate, and similar to our censored OLS estimate (e.g., Addison
and Portugal 1989), but as explained above may be affected by selection.27 Estimates of the
rate of depreciation of human capital during unemployment based on structural models show
results of similar order of magnitude as our findings (e.g., Keane and Wolpin 1997).


5.4    Analysis of Wage Distribution and Bounding

The finding in Table 3 and Figure 6 (a) provide strong evidence that UI extensions do not affect
reemployment wages through changes in reservation wages. Even with large extensions that
clearly affect the hazard rate and a large administrative dataset the implied effect of changes
in the reservation wage on the mean reemployment wage is a precisely estimated zero. To
investigate whether our focus on the mean (even though this is the correct measure in our
model) masks small effects of the reservation wage at the bottom of the wage distribution
(where one might expect the largest effect), we used our large sample sizes to analyze the full
distribution of wages. The percentiles of the wage distribution by nonemployment duration
for those above and below the 12 month cut off point are shown in Figure 6 (b) (as before
those RD estimates that are significant are shown with vertical bars). The figure clearly shows
the evolution of the wage distribution with nonemployment duration as it shifts downwards
and fans out. If a response in reservation wages to UI extensions mattered, one should see the
effect mostly at the bottom of the wage distribution. Figure 6 (b) indeed shows that there
appears to be a significant rise in the lower quantiles of the wage distribution in response to
UI extensions. However, the rise at the first cutoff and appears to be offset by a decline at the
second cutoff. As in case of mean wages in Figure 6 (a), this crossing of the reemployment

wage path can only be explained by dynamic selection and suggests the pattern may be due to
a selective shifting from one exhaustion point to the next. To directly assess this possibility,
we applied the same procedure as with the mean in Section 5.2 to the cumulative density
function (CDF) of reemployment wages for the entire sample. Columns 3 to 5 of Table 3
show estimates of the mean shift of selected points of the CDF in response to UI extensions.28
These estimates suggests that the effect of UI extensions on the CDF of wages for the entire
sample is very close to zero. Recall that the effect on the entire CDF is a weighted average of
the effect of the CDF at each nonemployment duration. Hence, since the theory suggests that
reservation wages (and hence the CDF) should rise, the finding of a zero response implies that
the effect of UI extensions on the CDF at each nonemployment duration must be zero. This
provides direct evidence that the pattern in Figure 6 (b) are likely to be due to selection.29
       The interpretation of our IV estimates as causal effect of nonemployment duration on
                                                        ∂wie (t,P )
wages relies on our empirical result that                  ∂P
                                                                      is approximately zero, which is difficult to
establish empirically with certainty. It is however straightforward to derive bounds for the
effect of nonemployment durations on wage offers for the case that there are small shifts in the
                               ∂wie (t,P )
reemployment wage path,           ∂P
                                           .   In the Web Appendix, we show that for the homogeneous
and linear case for small shifts δ in the reemployment wage path the IV estimate obtains

                              dE[we (t;P )]                     dVtu
                                  dP               1             dt        ∂we (t; P ) ∂µt
                                  dD           = δ dD + δ       dVtu   +
                                  dP               dP            dP
                                                                             ∂µt       ∂t

       Comparing this expression to equation (5), it is clear that the first term measures the
direct effect of reservation wages on the reemployment wage path (akin to a direct effect of
an instrument on the outcome). The second term captures a bias that arises from the fact
that if reservation wages matter, longer nonemployment durations also induce wage changes
due to changes in reservation wages.30
  28
     These estimates use the identical specification as in equation (10) in Section 3.2 with using a dummy for
being above the respective wage cutoff as a dependent variable. The CDFs at each nonemployment duration
are shown in the Web Appendix, and contain the same results as the percentiles in Figure6 (b).
  29
     Note that we cannot do the same exercise fo the percentile figures, because there is no direct linear
correspondence between the percentiles of the wage distribution in the full sample and at each nonemployment
duration. However, since there is a direct correspondence of the CDF at each nonemployment duration with
the percentiles, the results in Table 3 are informative about the percentiles as well.
  30
     Recall from equation 6 that dE[w|t]
                                     dP    is determined by the change in the reservation wage in response to
a rise in potential UI durations times the effect of reservation wages on actual wages. The intuition of the
various terms is hard to see from the final equation, but clear from the derivation in the Web Appendix, to

the value function declines faster than what one would expect simply from moving one month
closer to the exhaustion date. This would be because skills are depreciating, people run out of
savings, the cost of job search may increase (or job search becomes less effective), etc. On the
other other hand these additional sources of non-stationarity are probably of similar or lesser
importance for the value function as the finite duration of UI benefits. If so, then a plausible,

the upper bound of the confidence interval for the pooled estimate in Column (3) of Table 3,
δ̂= 0.095%, the range of slopes for the wage offer distribution is between -1.4% (actually even
smaller than the IV estimate) to -0.7%, just slightly larger than the IV estimate of -0.78%
decline in mean wage offers per month.31


5.5        Discussion of Potential Channels Underlying IV Estimates

As discussed in the theory section, the interpretation of our estimate as the causal effect of
nonemployment duration is independent of the particular economic model of job search we
which we defer the interested reader.
   31
      Another source of potential bias in the IV estimator arises if dh dP = 0, which in our sample occurs for
                                                                          t


nonemployment durations greater than two years, when benefit durations are exhausted on both sides of the
                                            ∂wie (t,P )
age threshold. In that case, even though       ∂P       = 0, for t > 24 it may be that reservation wages affect
accepted wages (i.e., the second term in equation (5) is not zero). Given our results imply no response in
reservation wages for t < 24, and given the findings in the literature on the role of reservation wages, we find
it safe to assume that the reservation wage effect at t > 24 is likely to be small and this source of bias minor.



                                                           31
used, and holds for a broad range of how wages and outside options are determined. Hence,
independently of the particular underlying model or source of the effect, the parameter can
be used to gauge the costs of uneployment duration and for assessing the optimal policy mix
in response to nonemployment. However, for some applications it would be helpful to know
more about the channels underlying the effect we find. Several channels have been suggested
in the literature. Using longitudinal data on explicit skill measures from Sweden, Edison
and Gustavsson (2008) report that one year of unemployment duration reduces skills by an
equivalent of 0.7 years of schooling, pointing to the potential of skill decline. Kroft, Lange,
and Notowidigdo (forthcoming) find that employers discriminate against the long-term un-
employed, even holding information on education and career progression constant. Similarly,
there is some evidence that the unemployed become increasingly unhappy throughout the
nonemployment spell (e.g., Krueger and Mueller 2011).
   Our analysis is not geared to uncover the channels underlying the causal effects we find.
Nevertheless, our RD analysis reported in Section 4.3 provides some tentative findings about
some potential channels. To assess the potential impact of these effects on reemployment
wages, we included these outcomes as additional explanatory variables in our main RD esti-
mates (not shown). Controlling for an indicator capturing industry and occupation changes
leads to a slight drop in the effect of UI extensions on reemployment wages of 20-25%. Con-
trolling for a part-time indicator and completed tenure at the new job leads to a bit larger
decline of 30-40%. Including proxies for employer quality made no difference. Overall, while
such regressions have to be interpreted with caution, they imply some prima facie evidence of
role of industry and occupation changes, which have been associated with losses in (industry
or occupation) specific skills in the literature. Similarly, the rise in part-time employment
and the reduction in completed job tenure could reflect a decline in job quality. Clearly, some
of these outcomes could reflect several mechanisms, hence we do not stress any particular
interpretation here.
   We have also analyzed differences in the effect of UI extensions on reemployment wages
over the business cycle. On the one hand, if there is statistical discrimination and employ-
ers correctly update their priors, the rise in expected mean quality of job applicants during
recessions should lead to lower stigma of nonemployment duration. On the other hand, it is
plausible that the effect of nonemployment duration on wage offers is stronger in recessions.

                                              32
For example, there is ample evidence of both a decline in job quality and of a reduction of
wages within jobs in recessions, which could hurt in particular workers with longer unemploy-
ment spells. When we compare our findings in periods with high and with low unemployment
rates, the results are very robust in recessions, but imprecise and ambiguous in expansions
(not shown).32 Hence, this does not point towards an explanation based on stigma.
         Overall, we do not find prima facie evidence in favor of a stigma effect and find some
suggestive evidence for skill depreciation. However, our results would also be consistent with
stigma, skill depreciation, and factors such as worker discouragement jointly determining the
causal effect of nonemployment durations on wages.


6        Summary of Robustness Analysis

6.1        Robustness of Regression Discontinuity Estimates

Our main results are all based on a two-year bandwidth around the age thresholds with linear
age controls. Focusing on the model pooling both thresholds, Table 6 shows the sensitivity
of our results when we allow for more flexibility in the estimation, focusing on five outcome
variables. Columns (2) and (3) show the estimated effects when the bandwidth is reduced
to 1 year and 0.5 years. While the sample size drops dramatically and the standard errors
increase correspondingly, the point estimates all become larger in absolute terms, pointing
to worse match outcomes than in the baseline estimates. This pattern is very similar when
we control for age with quadratic or cubic polynomials on both sides of the cutoff (columns
3 and 4), where the point estimates are similar to the linear specification with 0.5 years of
bandwidth. Using the Calonico et al. (forthcoming) optimal bandwidth algorithm - column
(5) - we obtain optimal bandwidths between 0.6 to 0.7 and again slightly more negative wage
effecs.
         In section 3, we reported that we found a slight increase in density just to right of the two
age thresholds. Furthermore, we found a small increase in the fraction of female UI recipients
at the threshold. Here, we provide several methods to investigate whether this increase will
affect our results. Column (6) of Table 6 shows the results from estimating the marginal effect
    32
    The ideal test would hold the distribution of job types constant (comparable to what is done in audit
studies), but is not feasible in our quasi-experimental setting because of small sample sizes and endogeneity
problems.


                                                     33
of potential benefit durations on employment outcomes using our RD design pooling both
thresholds, when we exclude all observations within one month of the age threshold. Overall,
while excluding the observations close to the cutoff reduces statistical power somewhat, it does
not affect our overall conclusions. Column (7) of Table 6 shows how the estimates change when
we control for a rich set of observables, including year, state, and industry fixed effects, as
well as human capital and experience measures. The effects on nonemployment durations,
the post-unemployment wage, and the duration of the post-unemployment job are slightly
reduced but still clearly imply negative match effects. Column (8) of Table 6 shows another
method robustness check to limit the effect of selective waiting before claiming UI, where we
limit the sample to individuals who claim UI within two weeks of losing their job. These
effects are quite similar to our baseline results.


6.2     Robustness of Estimated Effects on Wages

We implemented numerous robustness checks regarding our findings on wages as well. Here,
we report results addressing the aspects of selective return to employment, differences in effects
across groups, and changes in unemployment rates throughout the nonemployment spell.
      In Section 4, we have shown that increases in UI extensions lead to precisely estimated
declines in the incidence of employment (Table 1). While these effects were very small relative
to the mean (less than 1%), we investigated the potential effect of such selection on our
estimates of the effect of UI durations on wages by analyzing differences in the quantiles of
the distribution of outcomes on the two sides of the age cutoffs (shown in the Web Appendix).
This standard procedure yields consistent estimates if selection depends monotonously on a
single index of underlying characteristics. The results suggest that the decline in median
wages is larger than the mean effect, suggesting that if at all our main findings underestimate
the effect of UI extensions on wages. Moreover, the lower percentiles of the wage distribution
decline more strongly than the upper percentiles, , implying that the majority of wage declines
in response to UI extensions occurr in the lower part of the distribution.
      The concern of selective participation also arises when studying reemployment wages at
each point in the nonemployment spell. As long as selection into employment for the full
sample is not an issue, our procedure for controlling for dynamic selection in Table 3 also
controls for the effects of selective participation when estimating the effect of UI extensions

                                                34
on the shift in the reemployment wage path.
    In Section 5, we had said that part of the effect on reemployment wages at the exhaustion
points month 12 and month 18 are likely to be due to a change in sample composition. In par-
ticular, there is a rise in the fraction of women to the right of the RD cutoffs, and a rise in the
fraction of women exiting at the exhaustion points. To address this point, we have replicated
our main RD analysis and our analysis of reemployment wages by gender. Women’s nonem-
ployment durations clearly respond more strongly to UI extensions (Schmieder, von Wachter,
and Bender 2012a), there is no precisely estimated difference in the effect on reemployment
wages by gender. As a result, the implied IV estimate of the effect of nonemployment dura-
tions on wages is somewhat smaller for women, and approximately the same for men. Hence,
our main findings are robust for the small degree of selection of women into nonemployment
and UI exhaustion we find.
    Another potential concern is that our main analysis focuses on workers with comparatively
high labor force attachment for whom nonemployment spells might be particularly costly. As
discussed in Section 3, we can replicate our IV strategy for any worker eligible for UI. For this
broader sample, Table 4 shows we obtain a somewhat larger estimate of −1.2% for the age 42
cutoff, and −1.5% when we pool both cutoffs, where only the latter is statistically significant
from our main sample.33 Thus, our findings are not driven by the particular sample we use,
and hold for a broad sample of middle aged workers in Germany. We also considered the effect
of UI durations and nonemployment durations on wages for other subgroups, but statistical
precision was low and hence did not pursue this further.34


7   Conclusion

The effect of unemployment durations on job outcomes has important implications for policy
at the micro and macro level. Using an IV strategy based on quasi-experimental extensions
in UI benefits we find that for middle aged workers each additional month of nonemployment
duration leads to a statistically significant and substantial reduction in wage offers of 0.8%. We
  33
     The difference in the size of the IV estimate is mainly driven by a smaller effect of UI extensions on
nonemployment durations, which is to be expected since the average rise of potential UI durations is smaller
for this group. The corresponding estimates are shown in the Web Appendix.
  34
     For example, while lower educated workers had substantially larger responses in employment duration,
the effect of UI durations on wage changes appeared only slightly larger for the lower educated, implying a
smaller (but not precisely estimated) causal effect of nonemployment durations on wages.

                                                    35
show that this estimate identifies a weighted average of the slope of the wage offer distribution
for individuals whose nonemployment durations are affected by the UI extensions. Given that
UI durations lead to a decline in reemployment probabilities throughout the nonemployment
spell, it is relevant for a broad group of unemployed workers. In our setting, over six to twelve
months this can explain about a third of wage losses from unemployment. These estimates
are smaller than existing estimates with non-experimental controls for selection.
   Our IV strategy is based on the key insight that the response of reemployment wages to UI
extensions throughout the nonemployment spell is informative about the role of reservation
wages even if the degree of selection is arbitrarily affected by UI durations. Our finding that
the path of reemployment wages over nonemployment duration does not shift in response to
UI extensions implies that reservation wages do not bind. Hence, the UI extensions only affect
wages through a rise in unemployment durations and hence can be used as an instrument for
non-employment durations. We also analyzed the response of different points in the wage
distribution to UI extensions. While we do observe some small shifts in the lower quantiles
estimates in response to UI extensions, these changes appear to be due to selection. In a
bounding exercise, we show that our main results are robust to small and realistic effects of
reservation wages. The framework we develop here for the analysis of the causal effects of
nonemployment durations on wages and other job outcomes will be useful for other studies
that analyze the effects of exogenous changes in wokers outside options on worker outcomes.
   Our findings can be used to help quantify the earnings losses from long unemployment spells
for workers. They also affect the optimal policy mix in response to long-term unemployment
and suggest that both at the micro- and macro-level policies should be front loaded to avoid
the substatial cost associated with long-term unemployment. The results are also potentially
informative about the effects of prolonged nonemployment spells on the aggregate economy.
Our findings suggest that these can lead to persistent and substantial declines in wages that
appear to be larger in recessions. In so far as workers may be receiving lower job matches or
have lower productivity, this could imply a significant cost to society going beyond the direct
cost of unemployment itself. However, by construction our regression discontinuity analysis
is partial equilibrium in nature, and a full evaluation of the implications of causal effects of
nonemployment we document here would require specifying the source of the losses and a
macroeconomic model.

                                               36
       While we find unemployment duration has potentially large effects on wages, the small
underlying effect of UI extensions on wages may not substantially affect the welfare conse-
quences of UI extensions. If individuals get all the surplus from higher match quality, then
they will have internalized the effect of their search behavior on match quality, and the effects
of potential UI durations on match quality can be ignored from a social welfare perspective.
This situation is different, if workers do not reap all the benefits of better matches—for ex-
ample, because the surplus is shared with the employer or because the government receives
taxes. Even in the latter case, the small direct effects of UI extensions on wages we find are
unlikely to imply a substantial rise in costs of UI extensions.35
       Our results are also related to the value of leisure. Rational individuals incur the costs
of additional wage reductions above and beyond foregone earnings during nonemployment
in favor of additional leisure. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the present
discounted value of the cost from lower wages due to higher nonemployment durations is
about half a month of average earnings per additional month of nonemployment duration.
This may indeed be rational, in so far fixed costs of working or fixed costs of leaving a job
put a wedge between the value of leisure and foregone earnings. Yet, it also could be that
individuals do not fully foresee the wage penalty they incur. Without additional information
and estimating structural parameters we cannot say more here.
       Last but not least, by the nature of our regression discontinuity design and institutional
framework, our estimates are based on middle age workers with stable labor force attach-
ment. While this is the core constituency of unemployment insurance in Germany, the United
States and other countries, it does not speak to the potential effects of UI durations and
nonemployment durations for a broader population. Studies with data and research designs
encompassing broader groups of workers will help to obtain additional information on how the
effects we measure here differ in the population, what the likely effect on the macroeconomy is,
and what the underlying channels may be. Similarly, while we showed in our precursor paper
that the characteristics of our sample is comparable to similarly aged UI recipients in the
United States and that the effect of UI durations on employment are comparable (Schmieder,
von Wachter, and Bender 2012a), one has to be careful in generalizing from our results based
  35
    This is essentially an application of the envelope theorem. See Chetty (2008) and Schmieder, von Wachter,
and Bender (2012a) for details. Nekoei and Weber (2013) show that foregone tax revenues from lower earnings
can also play a role.

The sample are individuals who started receiving unemployment insurance between 1987 and 1999
within 2 years from the age thresholds. Each coefficient is from a separate regression discontinuity
model with the dependent variable given in the column heading. The first panel shows the increase
at the discontinuity at the age 42 threshold (where potential UI durations increase from 12 to
18 months). The second panel shows pooled estimates using the age 42 threshold as well as the
increase at the age 44 threshold (where potential UI durations increase from 18 to 22 months).
The models control for linear splines in age with different slopes on each side of the cutoff. The
number of observations vary across specifications due to missing observations for right hand side
variables: UI benefit durations (column 1) are defined for everyone in our sample (UI recipients)
by definition, non-employment duration is the duration until reemployment, which is missing if
individuals are never employed again within 9 years after UI entry, reemployment is defined for
everyone, post wage and wage difference are slightly smaller than column 2 due to missing wage
observations.

Notes: * P<.05, ** P<.01 Standard errors clustered on day level. Columns 1-3 show the slope coefficient
of a regression of log reemployment wages on nonemployment durations. Column 1 for the main RD sample
of individuals eligible to the maximum potential UI durations from Table 1, Column 2 for the same sample
but with the restriction that nonemployment duration is less than 18 months, and Column 3 for the full
sample without experience restrictions. Columns 4 and 5 show the two-stage least squares estimator of the
effect of nonemployment duration on wages using UI extensions as instrument variable. Column 4 shows
the main RD sample, while Column 5 the full sample without experience restrictions.

                                           (b) Months of Nonemployment

Notes: The top figure shows average durations of receiving UI benefits by age at the start of
unemployment insurance receipt. The bottom figure shows average nonemployment durations for
these workers, where nonemployment duration is measured as the time until return to a job and
is capped at 36 months. Each dot corresponds to an average over 60 days. The continuous lines
represent quadratic polynomials fitted separately within the respective age range. The vertical lines
mark age cutoffs for increases in potential UI durations at age 42 (12 to 18 months), 44 (18 to 22
months).

                  (b) Log wage difference (pre unemployment minus post unemployment)

Notes: The top figure shows average post unemployment log wages by age at the start of un-
employment insurance receipt. The bottom figure shows average difference in the pre and post
unemployment log wage for these workers. Each dot corresponds to an average over 60 days. The
continuous lines represent quadratic polynomials fitted separately within the respective age range.
The vertical lines mark age cutoffs for increases in potential UI durations at age 42 (12 to 18 months),
44 (18 to 22 months).
