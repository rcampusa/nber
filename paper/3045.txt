     DOES MONETARY POLICY MATTER?      NARRATIVE VERSUS STRUCTURAL APPROACHES




                                       ABSTRACT

    This paper compares  results from the narrative approach of Romer and Romer
 (1989) to those from the structural approach regarding the effects of monetary
policy on real output. The results from both approaches lead to the
conclusions that monetary policy matters and that the effects build slowly
following   a monetary policy shock.   The narrative approach, however, leads to

larger and more persistent effects than does the structural approach.     Reasons

are advanced in the paper as to why this might be so.

I.   Introduction

     Romer and Romer (1989) use what they call the "narrative approach"              to

examine   the   effects of monetary policy on real output.         This approach is in

the spirit of the work of Friedman and Schwartz (1963).             In defending this

approach,   Romer and Romer (RR) point out that statistical teats like

"regressions of output on money, studies of the effects of 'anticipated' and

'unanticipated'     money, and vector autoregressions   .   . .   cannot persuasively

identify the direction of causation."     (p. 1)   This criticism, however, does

not apply to the estimation of structural relationships,             and the structural

approach is a clear alternative to the narrative approach.                The purpose of

this paper is to see if the two approaches lead to similar results regarding

monetary policy effects.

      RR chose six months in the post-war period in which they believed there

was a negative monetary shock that was independent of the level of output:

October 1947, September 1955, December 1968, April 1974, August 1978, and

October 1979.      They defined a dummy variable, D, that is one in each of

these months and zero otherwise.       They next regressed the percentage change

in industrial production on a constant,      11 seasonal dummy variables,          24 lags

of the percentage change in industrial production, the current value of 0,

and 36 lags of 0.      The estimation period was January 1948         -   December 1987.

From this regression they computed the impulse response function of a one

unit increase in D.
                                              2

     The impulse response function showed little effect on industrial

produotion for about the first eight montha after the shock, but negative

and fairly large effects after that.          The maximum impact was industrial

production 12 percent lower after 33 months.              Similar results were obtained

using the level of the unemployment rate in plate of the percentage change

in industrial production.     The maximum impact waa the unemployment rate 2.1

percentage points higher after 34 months.           In both cases the affects of the

shocks showed considerable persistence.           P.R   concluded from the overall

results that monetary shocks have real effects,

     In moat structural macroeconometricmodels interest rates affect a

number of categories of investment and at least a few categories of

consumer expenditures.    In this framework a test of whether monetary policy

matters is simply a teat of the significance of the interest rate

coefficients in the estimated investment and consumption equations.              In most

models interest rates are significant in a number of equations,             and so the

RR conclusion chat monetary shocks have real effects is hardly surprising to

a structural model builder.

     The structural approach is based on the estimation of approximations to

decision equations.1'    It is open to the criticism that the estimated

approximations may be seriously miaspecified.             Aggregation problems may be

serious,   inaccurate functional forms may be used, and the fact that "deep

structural paremetera" are not being estimated may be quantitatively

important.   On the other hand, the     P.R   regreaaiona seem even more open to the

possibility of being seriously miaspecified.              The regressions are reduced-

form like equations, and it seems likely that the regressions have left out

     1                              .
      See Fair   (1989) for discusaion of this.
                                              3

many variables that belong in the true reduced form equations for industrial

production and unemployment.        Certainly the implicit reduced form equations

for output and unemployment in a typical macroeconometricmodel contain many

more variables than are in the RR regressions.

     RR examine the robustness of their results by adding supply-shock,

fiscal-policy,       and inflation variables to their regressions and by excluding

certain shocks from the regressions.          They report that adding other

variables lowers the maximum impact on industrial production and

unemployment slightly, but no numbers are given.         When the monetary shocks

in 1974 and 1979 are excluded (since they may be associated with oil price

shocks)     P.R   report that the maximum impact on industrial production falls

from 12 percent to 10 percent.       Although these robustness tests are of some

interest,    they fall far short of adding enough variables to the reduced
form equations to satisfy a structural model builder.

     Another problem with the      P.R   approach is that the use of the same       value
of D (namely one) for each of the six shocks is a strong assumption.                   It

seems unlikely that the Fed tightened up by the same           amount in each      case,

As will be seen in the next section, the degree of tightening appears to

have varied considerably across the shocks.

     Given that both approaches are open to criticism,              it is of interest to

see if they lead to similar results,         namely if the   P.R   results are consistent

with the properties of a structural macroeconometricmodel.                If the results

are consistent,       this is to some extent support for both approaches.          A

structural model builder could say that although the           P.R   regressions   leave

out many important variables,       this misspecification does not appear to

affect in a serious way the estimated effects of monetary policy on real
                                          4

output.     PR could say that although structural models are subject to many

problems,    their properties regarding the effects of monetary policy on real

output seem about right.     If the results are not conaistent,        the differences

may shed light on possible biases of each approach.



II.   Estimated Effects of the Shocks from a Structural Mcdel

      It is fairly easy to see if the properties of a structural model are

consistent with the   P.R results.   The Fair model (1984) is used as the

structural model in this paper.2      The model is quarterly, and the data set

begins in 1952 I,     The October 1907 shock could not be analyzed because the

data set does not gc back that far.

      In the regular version of the model monetary policy is endogenous.

One of the stochastic equations is an interest rate reaction function,

where the Fed is estimated to "lead against the wind" as real output

increases,    labor markets tighten, inflation increases, and the lagged growth

of the money supply increases.       The interest rate on the left-hand-side of

this equation is the three-month Treasury bill rare, denoted RS, which is

the key short term rare in the model.         For the present results this equation

was dropped, and RS was taken to be exogenous.

      The results of the experiments are presented in Table       1,    and the rest

of this section is a discussion of this table.        Consider Experiment I first.


     2The model consists of 30 stochastic equations and 98 identities. The
main description of it is in Chapters 3 and 4 in Fair (1984)    The results
                                                                   .



of adding age distribution variables to the household behavioral equations
are presented in Fair and Oomingues (1989), and the equations with the age
variables included are uaed for the current results. It can be seen in
Tables 1 and 2 in this latter paper that the interest rate is highly
significant in the equations explaining ronaumption of services, durable
expenditures, and housing investment.   For the present results the model was
estimated by two-stage least squares for the 1954 I    1988 IV period.

September 1955 is one of the RR shock months.                   It can be seen from the table

that RS rose from 1.86 in 1955 III to 2.35 in 1955 IV.                        It rose further

after that and continued to be above 1.86 until 1958 1.                        In order to run the

experiment,        one has to choose what the Fed would have done had there been no

shock.       As can be seen in the table, the assumption here is that the Fed

would have kept the interest rate at 1.86 through 1957 IV.                             In other words,

the Fed would not have allowed interest rates to rise in 1956 and 1957.

After 1957 IV, the assumption is that the shock was over, and the values of

RS are simply set to their actual values.

          The question to ask of the model is how would the economy have differed

had there been no monetary shock? For Experiment 1, the five-year period

1955 IV      -   1960 III was considered.       The estimated error terms were first

added to the stochastic equations of the model and taken to be exogenous.

This means that when the model is solved using the actual values of all the

exogenous variables, a perfect tracking solution is obtained.                             The solution

values of the endogenous variables are simply the actual values.                                The model

was then solve for the new (non-shock) values of RS.                         The difference between

the solution value of an endogenous             variable and its actual value for a

given quarter is an estimate of the effect of the shock on the variable,

The results for three endogenoua variables are reported in Table                               I:   real GNP

(Y)   ,   industrial   production (IP), and the unemployment rate (UR)


     3lndustrial production is not              a variable in the regular version of the
model.   For purposes of this paper             it is useful to be able to predict
industrial production because this              is the output measure used by P.R.
Therefore, a simple link from real              output (Y) to industrial production (IP)
was estimated. The equation is:

          log IP       -12.6 + 1.541og Y    ,    p        .993      ,   SE    .0132,     P.2        .999,
                       (13.32) (15.49)                   (111.49)

where p is the estimated first order serial correlation coefficient of the
error term and the numbers in parentheses are t- statistics in absolute
                                          10

        The results for Experiment 1 show that the peak effect on all three

variables is 10 quarters after the change.        This is close to the PR number

of 33 or 34 months.     In addition,   the effects for the first two or three

quarters are fairly small, which is consistent with the PR results.               tn the

other hand, the sizes of the peak effects are much smaller here.            For

industrial production the peak effect is 4.34 percent, which compares to the

PR number of 10 to 12 percent.     For the unemployment rate the peak effect is

1.20 percentage points, which compares to about 2 percentage points for RR,

Also,    the effects here are less persistent than those reported by PR.            In

fact, after about four years the signs of the changes are reversed.               The

shock has generated a small cycle.

        The same procedure was followed for the other experiments.          For

Experiment 2 the solution period was 1969 I        -   1973 IV.    In this case the

results in Table 1 show that the peaks are reached after 7 or S quarters.

The sizes of the changes for Experiment 2 are slightly smaller than those

for Experiment 1.

        Experiment 3 covers the 1974 II   -   1979 I period.      Although PR chose

April 1974 as a shock month, the overall shock in this case was much smaller

than the others as measured by the size and duration of the increase in PS

from the base quarter.     Only in 1974 II and III was PS higher than the base-

quarter value of 7.60.     The results for Experiment       3 show that this shock

had fairly small effetts as estimated by the model.

        The two remaining PR shock months are August 1978 and October 1979.              It

is somewhat unclear whether the August 1978 shock should be assumed to end

in October 1979 or continue after that.         For Experiment 4 the shock was




value.    The equation was estimated by ordinary least squares for the 1954 I
-   1988 IV period.
                                         11

assumed to end in October 1979, and for Experiment 5 it was assumed to

continue to the end of the solution period.     For Experiment 4 the peak

impact occurs after 6 quarters, with the effect on industrial production

being 2.81 percent, and for Experiment 5 the peak impact occurs after 15

quarters,   with the effect on industrial production being      999   percent. The

peak effects on the unemployment rate are .92 and 2.65 percentage points

respectively.     Note that for Experiment 5 the shock is quite large: RS is

held to 6.48 percent through the period in which the actual values reached

double digits.

     Experiment 6 is for the shock that began in October 1979.          The effects

here are also fairly large.     The peak effects are after 10 quarters, with

the effect on industrial production of 6.00 percent and the effect on the

unemployment rate of 1.49 percentage points.

     It should be noted that the present results would not be changed very

much if the beginning quarter for each shock was taken to be one quarter

sooner than what was in fact done.      In each case, as can be seen in Table 1,

the interest rate in the quarter sooner is close to the interest rate in the

quarter actually used,      For Experiment 1, for eiample, the interest rate in

the quarter sooner is 1.61, which is only slightly smaller than the value of

1.86 used.      The results in Table 1 are thus not sensitive    to timing issues

of this kind.

     What do the overall results in Table 1 say about the RR results? There

are four main messages       First (a point that is not model specific),        the

size and duration of the shocks as measured by the interest rate deviations

vary considerably across the five shock periods.      It is thus not clear that

RR's use of one for all six nonzero values of 0 is accurate,          Second,    the RR

result that the initial effects are small and the peak effect occurs after
                                                12

33 to 34 months is consistent with some loose average of the results               in

Table 1.    Third, the persistence of the P.R effects is inconsistent with the

results in Table 1, which in fact show small cycles being generated.

Fourth, the P.R maximum effects of 10 to 12 percent for industrial production

and 2.1 percentage points for the unemployment rate are on average higher

than the maximum effects in Table          1.   Only for Experiment 5 are the peak

effects    similar.




III.    Conclusion

       in structural macroeconometricmodels monetary policy matters because

interest rates are significsnt explanatoryvariables in investment and

consumption equations.      The   P.R   conclusion that monetary policy matters is

clearly consistent with this.           Likewise,    the timing of the effects from the

initial shock to the peak impact is similar between the two approaches,

which is encoursging to both.           The main inconsistencies      are the larger

estimated effects for     P.R   and their persistence.

       The persistence differences may stem from so many variables being

excluded from the     P.R regressions.      These regressions are likely to be much

more autoregressive than the implied reduced form equations of structural

models.     There are, for example, a number of channels through which cycles

can be generated in structural models following an interest rate shock.                  As

the economy expands,     prices may initially rise faster than nominal wages,

which eventually has a negative effect on demand.             Also,    stocks of durable

goods, housing, and capital are built up during an expansion,               and these

eventually have a negative effect on further increases             in durable

expenditures,    housing investment, and plant and equipment investment.                The

increase in prices also has negative real wealth effects.                In the present
                                          13

model the eventual negative effect from the build up of the stocks of

durable goods, housing, and capital is the main cause of the cycles in Table

     Since the   P.R regressions   do not incorporate stock effects of this kind,

it is not surprising that they show more persistence      than does the

structural model.

     it is less clear why monetary policy effects are larger for      P.R   than

they are for the structural model.       It may be that interest rate effects are

underestimated in the structural model through misspecification of the

structural equations.     Or it may be that by treating all shocks as the same,

the RR regressions give undue weight to the large shocks in 1978 and 1979

and thus bias upward the estimated size of the monetary policy effects.

More sensitivity tests are needed before much can be said about thia




      4Although not shown in Table 1, the cycles damp down over time, After
 a few more quarters, the negative chsnges begin to reverse themselves. No
 coefficient restrictions have been imposed in the estimation of the model
 regarding either short run or long run effects.
