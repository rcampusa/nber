     This paper examines the effects of auctioning quota licenses when

monopoly power exists.   With a foreign monopoly and domestic competition

the sales of licenses will        raise any revenue if domestic and foreign

markets are segmented.   More surprisingly, the inability to raise revenue is

shown to persist even when partial or perfect arbitrage across markets is

possible, as long as the quota is not too far from the free trade import

level.

     In contrast, when there is a home monopoly and foreign competition, the

price of a quota license can be positive so that selling licenses can

dominate giving them away.   However, because of the absence of any profit

I.   INTRODUCTION

      In this paper I examine the case for auction quotas when there is

either a foreign or domestic monopolist.        A companion paper deals with

oligolistic markets.'

      One of the most common criticisms of voluntary export restrictions

(VERS) and of the way quotas are presently allocated is that they allow

foreigners to reap the rents associated with the quantitative constraint.

It has been suggested that auctioning import quotas would be a remedy for

this.    It is claimed that:


         this would leave the price support features of quotas intact
      but deliver the higher profits to the U.S. economy instead of
      abroad.2


In an article in Business Week, Alan Blinder argues that:


      Auctioning import rights is one of those marvelous policy
      innovations that create winners, but no losers, or, more
      precisely, no American losers. The big winner is obvious:
      the U.S. Treasury. .


An article   in   Ijg   magazine quotes C. Fred Bergsten as saying that:


      Quota auctions might bring in revenues as high as $7 billion a
      year


      A Congressional Budget Office     (CBO)   memorandum5 estimates quota rents

possible in 1987 for a group of industries to be 3.7 billion dollars.          It

compares this to the Bergsten et al.      (1987) estimate made for the Institute

for International Economics (TIE) of 5.15 billion.         These estimates are

summarized in Table 1.       Both estimates assume perfect competition


                                           I
everywhere.   Takacs (1987) points out that propoaals to auction quotaa have

become increasingly frequent.6 She states:       Commissioners Ablondi and

Leonard of the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) recommended

auctioning sugar quota licenses in 1977.    The ITC recommended auctioning

footwear quotas in 1985.   Studies by Hufhauer and Rosen (1985) and Lawrence

and Litan (1985) suggested auctioning quotas and earmarking the funds for

trade adjustment assistance. "

     Despite the   importance of the issues involved, the intuition behind

such statements and the procedure used in the estimation is based on models

of perfett competition. In such models, the level of the quota determines

the domestic price, and the difference between the domestic price and the

world price determines the price of a license when auctioned.     If the

country is small, then the world price is given.     If the country is large,

then the world price does change with a quota.     How it changes is determined

by supply and demand conditions in the world market.

     However, when markets are imperfectly competitive, as they are thought

to be in the market for autos, this analysis is misleading.6 In such

environments, prices are chosen by producers, i.e. there is no supply curve,

and the response of producers to the constraint must be taken into account

when determining the price of a license when it is auctioned off.     For

example, if the response of profit maximizing producers is to adjust their

prices so that there is no benefit to be derived from owning a license to

import, its auction price must be zero!

     Therefore, the question that needs to be addressed concerns the

behavior of producers in response to quantitative constraints in such

markets, and the impact of this on the price of a license.     There are two


                                        2
policy questions that need to be adressed.       First,   should existing licenses

be auctioned off?    Second, if quotas are set at their optimal level,       can

they he welfare improving over free trade?       There has been relatively little

work in this area.    The work on the effects of quantitative restrictions in

imperfectly competitive markets is linked to the above question,9 but to

date, no analysis of what this might suggest about the price of a license

seems to exist.

     In this paper, I develop a series of models of monopoly which address

this issue,    The models show that the way in which licenses are sold, the

demand conditions, and the market structure all influence the resulting

price of s license.    The results indicate that there is reason to expect

that the price of a license may be much lower than that indicated by

applying models of perfect competition.       Thus,   estimstes of potential

revenues such ss those of the CR0 and Retgsten may be fsr too large.

Moreover, if no revenues are to be raised from auctioning quotas unless they

are very restrictive, the profit shifting effect of such quotas, even when

auctioned off, is unlikely to outweigh the loss in consumer surplus of such

policies.     For this resson, they are likely to have adverse welfare

consequences even when set optimally.

     T do not srgue that in the real world license ssles will raise no

revenues.     In the ptesence of uncertsin demand they     will,   as licenses have

on option value in this    case.   I   merely point out that there is reason to

expect revenues to be lower than those estimsted under the assumption of

perfect competition and make my arguments in the simplest model, one without

uncertainty.     The uncertainty case is discussed in Krishna (l988s).
     Sections 2 and 3 discuss the price of a license with a foreign

monopoly.      If there is a single foreign supplier of the product, and

markets are segeenred, the price of a license is clearly zero. It is optimal

for the monopolist to raise his price in response to a quota or VER so that

the price of a license becomes zero.     This model with segmented markets is

                                           and is mentioned in Shibata
developed diagramacically in Takacs (1987)

(1968)    as well and most recently in Krugman and Helpman (1989).

                                                                  and the
     However, one would expect that the presence of other markets
                                                 it optimal for the foreign
possibility of arbitrage between them would make
                                                   to a quota, thereby
monopolist to limit his price increase in response

creating a price for the license.     Thus, one might expect non-zero prices

for licenses when markets are not segmented even with a foreign monopoly.

Somewhat surprisingly, this is not necessarily so!     Quotas set close to the

free trade level always have a zero price.     All that occurs is an increase

in the world price!     This is the subject of Section 2.

         A simple example is developed in Section 3 in order to show how

restrictive the quota has to be for the license price to become positive.

The way that this varies with the relative size of the markets and demand

 elasticities is considered in addition to the welfare consequences of such

 policies.

         Section 4 considers the case of a domestic monopoly.   Here it is shown

 that the price of a license is positive and that auctioning quotas can

 ensure that rents accrue to domestic agents.     Despite   this, welfare does

 not increase because of the absence of profit shifting effects.      Section    5

future research.
2.    FOREIGN MONOPOLY WITH COSTLESS ARBITRAGE

       In this section 1 consider the price of s license in a simple cese.                    It


is assumed that there is a foreign monopolist who cannot price discriminate

between his markets.15

       Let Q(P)     and    q(p)    be the demand functions facing the foreign firm in

the home market and in the other market(s), respectively. Let                   C[q +   Q be

its cost function.         Note that marginal costs are assumed constant.             Similar

results are obtained when marginal costs are not assumed constant.

       Assume that R(P) is concave in P and is maximized at                M•   Similarly,

let    r(p)be the profits from sales in other market(s), and let r(p) be

maximized at        m
                   It is easy to see that     —         M
                                                      and
                                                            m—

where    c    and   e     are the respective demand elasticities, so that the

monopolist in the absence of arbitrage would choose to charge a higher price

in the market with less elastic demand. Because of arbitrage, the

monopolist will choose one price which will be between the two prices he

would have set in the absence of arbitrage possibilities.                  It is easy to

show that the optimal price for him to set maximizes               ,r(P)
                                                                           — R(P) ÷   r(P),

and is given by:


         M_ —s—C


              — Dc +    (l-8)e    and 0 —            This is also the free trade price
where
                                            —.
        Thus, the monopolist chooses price ma if he were faced with one market

where the elasticity of demand is a share weighted combination of the

 elasticities of the two markets.




                                                 6
The question then is how a quota affects the price charged by the monopolist

when the quota licenses are auctioned off.

      At this point it is important to be clear about exactly what

constitutes a license, how licenses are sold, and what the timing of moves

is.   With market segmentation, a license is defined to be a piece of paper

which entitles irs possessor to buy one unit of the product in question at

the price charged     by the seller in his market. If arbitrage      is possible,

then the possessor buys at the lower of the prices charged by the seller in

the home and the world market.       However, it is a dominated strategy for the

monopolist to attempt to charge different prices in his different markets as

sales will only be made at the lower of the two prices.        For this reason,

the monopolist can be restricted to choosing only           price.

      The licenses are sold in a competitive market to either competitive

domestic retailers with zero marginal costs of retailing or to consumers

directly.     In sections 2 to 4 I assume that the timing of moves is as

follows.     First,   the govern.ment sets the quota.   Then the monopolist sets

his price.     Finally, the market for licenses clears.      This timing is

consistent with the idea that the market for licenses clears         gg.   frequently

than the monopolist sets prices, and that the government sets the quota even

less frequently than the monopolist sets prices.         Section 5 studies the case

where the monopolist can adjust prices faster than the rate at which the

market for licenses clears.

      The model is then solved backwards as usual.        First consider the market

for licenses.     If the price charged by the monopolist is P        and the price

of a license is       L,   then the demand for licenses must be the same as the

demand for the good at       P÷L, Q(P+L).   The supply of licenses is    V,   the


                                            7
level of the quota.         The equilibrium ptice of a license is given by                   L(P,V).

L()     is defined    by the market fot licenses clearing,             i.e.    Q(I'-t-L)    — V.

Notice that if        Q(P) C V    then   L(P,V)   C0      as defined thus far.              However,

since a quota is not binding if such a high price is charged,                      L(P,V)          is

defined to be zero in this case.          Let     P'RV)   be defined by          Q(F") — V          so

that   L(P,V)   > 0     and the quota is binding if         P      PV(V)       By the

definition of     L(.), it is apparent that if P C PV(V), then deaand at home

equals    V,    although    V    is less than     Q(P).

       Now consider the total demand facing the monopolist with a quota.                            As

demand in the home market has shrunk for             P < P"RV),        the total demand curve
                     V
has a krnk in it at P (V).                is depicted in Figure 1.
                                       .
                                     This



(FIGURE 1 here)



       In the absence of any quota, demand is given by AD,                    and marginal

revenue by      AF.    The monopolist sets price equal to              M,     and sells       QM +

qM,    For convenience, Figure 1 is drawn so that               Q(P)    and     q(p)       are

similar and linear.         Hence the marginal revenue corresponding to total

demand coincides with Q(P).          A quota at the free trade          level,      Q(pM),         makes

the demand facing the monopolist into             ABE.    This creates a kink in the

demand curve at        M•    Marginal revenue is given by          AGHR.      Therefore, it

remains optimal for the monopolist to price at

       Now consider the effect of reducing the quota from Q(pM)                        to    V.     This

raises the price at which the quota binds to               PV(V)       from    M    and the kink

 in demand occurs at        V(Q),    The demand curve with a quota at                   is given         by
AIJ    and the corresponding marginal revenue curve by                 AKLM.     Notice that if
                        K
V   is   close to   Q         the       .
                                    profit maximizing point      pj     occur at   the

intersection of the vertical part of the marginal revenue curve and marginal

cost,    C.11   Therefore, the monopolist will find it                optimal   to charge   P"(V)

so that the price of a license is zero!                   Only if V     is so small that the

intersection of the marginal revenue curve (with a quota) and the marginal

cost curve occurs on the steeper but fl2 vertical segment of the marginal

revenue curve will the price of a license be positive.                      This can only occur

if V      is substantially below            QM,    In Figure   1, any   V    lower than     ,   the
quota level depicted, gives             L(') >     0.    Thus, slightly restrictive quotas

must reduce welfare because they do not raise revenue and they reduce

consumer surplus.           Quotas at an even lower level conceivably can raise

welfare if the gain in revenue outweighs the loss in consumer surplus.

Finally, auctioning quotas is better than giving them away only when the

license price is positive, i.e.             ,   when the quota is set at s low level. Note
also that as the world price rises, a quota by one country reduces the

welfare of other importing countries as well as that of the
                                                            exporting

country whose profits also fall with s quota.

       Prooosttion 1.        With a foreign monopoly and perfect and costless

arbitrage, quotas at or close to the free trade level implemented by

auctioning licenses yield no revenues and must reduce welfare.                      Quotas must
be very restrictive if they ste to raise welfare over free trade. Moreover,

auction quotas dominate VERs at the same level only if the restriction is

set at quite a low level.

     Three questions naturally arise.                   First, how restrictive must the quota

be before a license commands a posi'ive price.                  Second, how does the answer




                                                    9
to this question depend on demand conditions.   And finally,   under what

                                                            over free trade.
conditions can a quota which is auctioned off raise welfare

A simple example   is worked out in Section 3 that sheds some light on these


questions.

3.   AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE

       This example focuses on the role of the home market size telative to

that of the other matket and of demand elasticity in determining the effects

of quota auctions.

         It is assumed that consumers at home and abroad have identical constant

consumers at home and               n consumers abroad so that market demand in the home

market is Q(P) — NPE                and that in the other market is                      q(P) —     nP.        As

before, marginal coats are constant at                          C.

         If the quota is set at                 V,    the marginal revenue corresponding to the

market demand curve when the quota is binding equals the marginal coat curve

where:

                          op
This     implies    that:


         V   -   (P-C)enP    -(c+l)     + nP -c —                                                                        (1)

Moreover, for this to hold at the point where the constraint just binds, it

must also be that:

Substituting      (2)       into   (1)     gives:


                    1     -              +      —   0

        There are a few things to notice about this expression.                                             First,       Q

needs to be quite restrictive for a license price to be positive.                                                    Third,
                                                                                     M
 for any    c   and       N,     the limit as        n       -> w           of               is      1.    Thus, as the

 becomes positive when the quota is not very restrictive.                                                Fourth, for any

        How does the price charged by the monopolist                                     and hence the license

price, changes with the level of the quota.                                   Let us denote this by

Notice that given a quota at the level                                  V    the profit

function facing the monopolist denoted                                  r(P,V),      is given by:

where:                 (P,V) — (P - C)V + (P                   -    C)Q(P).



       Thus,         ir(P,V)       is Composed         of pieces of n(.)                 and   r(.).    Moreover,
if     r(.)     and       r(.)        are both concave, so is                   r(.).     Also if        > 0 >

profits are maximized at the peak of                              r(.)       at     A.

4.   HOME MONOPOLY

      So far we have argued that with a foreign monopoly there is reason to

expect that auctioning quota licenses will not raise revenue.    Here we

briefly discuss whether the same result occurs when there is a monopoly at

home and competition abroad.    The goods are assumed to be differentiated for

ease of analysis.    The main result is summarized in Proposition 3.

      Prooosition 3:   If goods are substitutes and a quota at or close to the

free trade level is imposed then a license has a positive price, while if

goods are complements, the license has a zero price.    In either case,

welfare is adversely effected.

      The intuition behind these results is that when goods are substitutes,

a quota at the free trade level implemented by auctioning licenses makes the

demand facing the home monopolist lass elastic for price increases above the

free trade level, but does not alter demand for price decreases.       This

creates an incentive for the home monopolist to raise its price.       This in

turn shifts the demand for the foreign good out and creates a positive price

for licenses.    On the other hand, if goods are complements, the quota makes

demand facing the home monopolist at the free trade prices jgj.g   elastic    for

price decreases, but leaves it unaffected for price increases.     This makes

it unprofitable to raise or lower prices from the free trade level so that

the market for licenses clears when the license price is zero.

      The classic paper by Bhagwati (1965) is related to this section in that

he was the first to point out the price increase induced by a quota with

home monopoly.    However, this analysis differs from his since he does not

 address the effects of auctioning quotas.   In addition, both complements and




                                        17
substitutes are considered here with differentiated products produced while

he considers only subsrirures and a homogeneous product.

     Let      O(P,p)   and     d(P,p)      be the demand functions for the home and

foreign goods, and        C    be their common marginal cost.          Foreign supply is

competitive so that          p — C.    Thus,     in the   absence of a quota the home firm

charges          which is implicitly defined by the first order condition:


     (P -                 + D(P,C) — 0(4)                                                  (4)
              C)D1(P,C)
                                              M
     The level of imports is thus given by d(P ,C)
                                                   — V                 F.in the absence of
a quora.

     Now consider the effect of imposing m quota at rhe free trade level and

auctioning off licenses in the manner specified.                  The license price is

determined by the market clearing condition in the market for licenses,

and so     L(P,C,V)    is determined by



                          d(P,C +     L)   — V                                             (5)




where     V   is the level of the quota. Notice that L1 (P,C,V) — -d1 /d2

is positive if the goods are substitutes, and negative if they are

complements.      If goods are substitutes, an increase in the home goods' price

shifts out demand for the foreign good, thereby raising the price of a

 license.     On the other hand, if they are complements, this would shift
                                                                                       1
demand in and therefore reduce the license price.                  Also,   L (P,C,V) — —
                                                                        2
 < 0, so that an increase in the quota always reduces the price of a license.

        The demand function facing the home monopolist, when the                quota is   V,




                                                    18
is given    by D(P,C)       if the quota does not bind and by D(P,C,V) — D(P,C +

L(P.C,V)) if        it does bind.      Moreover, the quota binds if P               PV(cv)      when

goods are substitutes and if            P     PV(cv) when goods are complements, where

PV(cv)      is defined by       (5)    with     L(')     equal to zero.     It is easy to

verify that     D(.)      and   D(.)    are equal when          P —   P'(CV),     and that whether

goods are complements or substitutes               D1(P,C,V)
                                                                 > D1(P,C) as

is positive in either case.            Thus the demand function facing the home

monopolist is given by          D(.)    if    P    P'RC,V) and by          D(.)    if P      PV(cv)
when goods are substitutes.             It is given by f(.)           if        V(cv)     and        D(•)

if   P     PV(cv)      when goods are complements.



(FIGURE 4 here)



        This is depicted in Figures 4(a) and 4(b) for substitutes and

complements respectively.             In both   cases,    the free trade price is

—   F     The demand curve with a quota at the free trade level is depicted by

the line     A3D.    The quota makes demand less elastic for price increases with

substitutes and less elastic for price decreases with complements,                         The

corresponding marginal revenue curves to the demand curve                         AED   are the

dashed lines in        4(a)     and (b).      In 4(a) profits are maximized by reducing

output and raising prices to            P     where marginal revenue cuts marginal cost

from above.     This in turn shifts out foreign demand so that at price                         C,

demand exceeds        V   so that the price of a license is positive in this case.

         Similar arguments and appeals to continuity show that the price of a

license is positive for quotas close to                  Vi'.   Raising/lowering the quota

from          shifts      (.)    inwards/outwards. In either case, the intersection

                                                  19
of the marginal revenue curve corresponding to Ô()                          with marginal coat


gives the profit maximizing output.             This raises the profit maximizing price

away from   P   as long as            V   is close to       VF'.    This is all that is needed

to shift out    d(.)       enough for demand to exceed               V   at a foreign price of

C by continuity arguments so that the price of a license                           is positive.


      If goods are complements, and            V    is the quota level,                the profit

maximizing monopoly price remains at             b".        Hence demand for licenses equals

     when the price of a license is zero so that the price of a license is

zero in equilibrium.         If the quota is set close to but below                     vF,

shifts   inwards.    The profit maximizing price remains at the intersection of

the vertical part of the marginal revenue curve and the marginal coat curve,

so that the profit maximizing price equals                    PV(G,V)      and so the price of a

license is again zero.              If the quota is set above            Vi',   b(S)    shifts outwards

and the profit maximizing price remains at                    pF'   which exceeds         P(c,V)    and


again the price of a license is zero.
                                                 tends to fall with such
      Despite the existence of revenues, welfare
                                                effects with foreign
policies because the absence of profit shifting

 competitive supply14 just leaves the dead weight loss of lower consumption

 of the home good.         Given the usual assumption of a numeraire good, welfare

 is the sum of consumer surplus, home profits and license revenues.                            Thus, if

 x   is the amount sold of the home good,               and     y    is the amount sold of

 imports, welfare is given by:


       W — (U(x,y)     -   Px   -   (C ÷ L)y) + (Px     -
                                                            Cx) + Ly




                                                   20
The first term is consumer surplus, the second is profits, and the third i5

license revenues.         However, notice that license revenues are just a transfer

between consumers who pay mote for imports and the government, and that the

revenues of the home monopolist,                        N,     also cancel out in welfare.        Thus

y    is unchanged.       Also     x       falls if a quota is at or close to the free trade

level.      Since utility maximization equates marginal utility with the price
                                                                                             -   C)       is

5.   THE IMPORTANCE OF TIMING

     So far we have assumed thar the market for licenses clears faster than

the-monopolist sets his price.          Thus, the monopolist can act like a

Stadkelberg leader and rake into accounr the effect of his actions on the

equilibrium price of a license.             One might ask whether this timing structure

is responsible for the results.             Here I argue that this is oot the case.

When the market for licenses clears more slowly than the monopolist sets his

p±ice, so that the monopolist takes the license price as given, results

similar to those above bold.          However, a multiplicity of equilibria exist.

     Consider the model of Section 2 with the new timing structure.                      In the

lsmt stage,     the firm chooses price P taking as          jygj    the value of L and V.

Its profits thus depend on how consumer demand is affected given this level

of L and V.     If consumers assume that L is fixed and that any number of

licenses will be available at this price, their demand for the good is given

by Q(P+L) even if P is very          low.     I call this the case with myopic

consumers.      If,   on the other    hand,   consumers realize that the number of

licenses is limited to V, they infer that if the monopolist charges a very

low price so that Q(P+L) > V, i.e., p            <    PV(V)_L, then the shadow price of a

license will exceed L and equal L where Q(P+L) — V, so that,                 L   —   V(V)_L.
This will give the monopolist a total demand of q(P)+V instead of

q(P)+Q(P+L).      This is the csse with non-myopic consumers.              Consider the

myopic case first.

     The firm's profits sre given by ir(P,L) —              r(P)   + (P—C)Q(P+L).      Let

PM(L) —   arg   max w(P,L).    Note that:




                                                 22
              dP(L) —     5PL — - [P—C)Q"(P+L) +
                dL                 (P-C)Q"(P+L) + 2Q'(Pi-L)




which lies between        —1 and 0, assuming that        LL < 0   and that demand is not

                                             PM(L) is depicted in Figure 5.
too convex, so that         PL < 0.

(FIGURE   5   here)



     Now look at the equilibrium value of L determined in the second stage.

This is given by:



              Q(PM(L) +    L) —     V - Q(PV(V))



                                                         — PM(L) + L. Notice
Thus the eqilibriuxn value of L, L(V), is given by PV(V)

that PM(L) +      L    is increasing in L and has a slope between 0 and

1.   L(V) is thus unique.            Moreover, that if V — Vp', the free      trade   level,

PVCV) —    PF .   If   V > VF   ,   there    is an excess supply of licenses at

                      — 0. As V falls, P'(V) rises above ?'.                   Hence, L(V)
 equilibrium and L(V)

 rises as V falls and L(V') — 0. This gives Proposition 4.

      Pronosition 4,         When firms take L as given,        the equilibrium price of a

 license is zero if v                   It is positive if v <     vF' and increases as    V

 decreases.       Thus, for V <       vF',   a license always has a positive price.

      Now consider the case with non-myopic consumers.                 Here consumers take

                                                            but realize that
 the license price as given when the product price is high,

 a low product price creates a black market for licenses and raises the

 effective license price.             This asymmetry is shown to create a continuum of


                                                    23
equilibrium license prices, and a zero license price remains an equilibrium

as long as the quota is not too restrictive.

       Take the last stage.               For a given L and V, 7r(P,L,V) denoted profits,

which is a composite function made up of ir(P,L) if P is high and

;(P,V) if P is low enough.


            ;(P,L,V) -          ir(P,L)    -   r(P)   + (P-C)Q(P+L)

                                                        if    PPV(V)_L

                             — ;(P,V) —        r(P)   + (P—C)V

                                                        if



       Notice that at P —            P'(V).-L,    ,t(P,L)    — w(P,V) and ;P(.) >

Hence, if      ic(.)   and   ir(.)   are   concave in 2, as is assumed here,                 ir(.)     is
concave in P.          Therefore, there are three cases anmiagous to those discussed

in              3 and depicted in Figure               2.    In case   (a),      (.)   >     0 >                   P
     :ecti0r
          —
  P            L. In this case the maximum of                 ir(')    occurs at P     (V)    —   L.        In case

(b),   i(.) >      ir•          0 at       — PV(v)— L and the peak of w(.),                  occurs         at the

                                                             (•) > (.) at P
peak of   ir(.),       PM(L).    In case       (c), 0                       —           PV(V) —         L    and

the peak of        (.)    occurs at the peak of              ('), denoted     by fM(V).

       The question now is how does the profit maximizing level of P set by

the monopolist, P*(L,V), change with L and V?                          First, consider the answer to

this when V is set at            Vs'.      Figure 6(s) depicts P"(V) —          L,   PM(L) snd

        as a function of L in this case.                     Note that pM(L) —       P'(V')        — 2F when L


                                                        24
—   0 and that       PM(V)     exceeds               Also, as PM(L) has a slope between 0 and

—1,   it lies above P''(V) —             L    for all L > 0.            Hence, for all L > o, pM(L) and

        lie above P"(V) — L                   and we are in case (b) so that P*(L,V) equals

PM(L)

        As V falls from V", ,M(V) falls, and P"(V) rises above                                     so that

        >            > pF'     jv       is close to V'.             This is depicted in 6(b).          As v

falls further FV(V) > P(V)                    >   p1',   This is depicted in 6(c).             As V falls

even more,       PV(V)   >         >                This is depicted in 6(d).               Define

                                 — PV(V) — M(V),                                    Notice that if
L*(V) — PV(V) — P*(V))and L**(V)

PV(V)    > P(V) >                L**(V) < 0 < L*(V) and if PV(V) >                   pF'   > PM(V),
                                                                                                             -
o < L**(V) < L*(V).
                         the                      of Figure     6(a)     we get Figures       6(b) and 6(c)
        By drawing               analogues

and 6(d) for these three cases as well.                             By considering the relative

                               — PM(L)                   for        L   L*(V).

    Having derived P*(L,V) for varying levels of L and V, it remains to

find the equilibrium level of L.               Again, this is defined by



            Q(p*(L,V) +       L)   - V - Q(PV(V))




And so by:



                 p*(L,V) +     L—    PVV)




p*(L,V) +    L   is depicted in Figures 6(a)-(d).                  Thus, for V — vF,

only L — 0 is an equilibrium, as shown in Figures 6(a).                        For V below      but

not very small so that M(V) >               P'v'(V)   >   Pb',   as depicted in Figure 6(b),   all

values of L between 0 and L*(V) are equilibria.                        For V smaller, so that

PV(V) >           >   Pr',   depicted in Figure 6(c), all values of L between L**(V)

and L*(V) are equilibria, but L — 0 is not.                        For V very small, where PV(V) >

   > i(V), depicted in Figure               6(d) again all          L between L**(V) and L*(V) are

equilibria, but L — 0 is not.               This gives Proposition 5.

     Pronosition 5.           When firms realize that a black market for licenses

will exist if price is too low, but take L as given otherwise, zero remains

in the support of the equilibrium license prices as long as the quota is not

too restrictive.         For more restrictive quotas,                equilibrium license prices

are bounded away from zero.            However, there are a continuum of such license

prices for any quota below the free trade level.

     Thus, the result that auction quotas may not raise revenues unless they

are quite restrictive re-emerges even when the timing of moves is altered


                                                      26
and consumers are not myopic.   However, it is less compelling here ss other

equilihria with positive license prices also exist.




                                       27
6.   CONCLUSION

     This paper points our that proposals to auction quota licenses are

unlikely to raise revenues in the presence of foreign monopoly power.       In

this case,   auctioning quotas is not better than giving them away unless the

quota is quite restrictive.     For this reason,    they are also unlikely to

raise welfare above the free trade level because of the loss of consumer

surplus due to quotas.     However, in the presence of home monopoly power, the

proposal is likely to raise revenues if goods are substitutes.       In this

case, auctioning quotas is preferable to giving them away.       However, if

goods are complements, auction quotas do not raise revenues with a home

monopoly and so do not dominate giving away licenses. Although this paper

only touches on some simple monopoly examples, Krishna (1988) discusses the

case of an oligopoly, where similar results obtain.

      Still, much remains to be done to determine the desirability of auction

quotas.    First, their desirability under uncertainty needs more study.        Note

that here a license has an option value and its price is positive even when

the quota is set at the free trade level.     This is discussed in Krishna

(1988a).     Second, it may be possible to use recent work on computable

partial equilibrium models, such as that of Dixit (1987)       and Venables and

Smith (1986),     to help build emperically implementable models to give

estimates of the welfare effects of auctioning quota rights in particular

markets.     Third, while this paper assumes the market for licenses is

competitive, it would be desirable to study the determinants of the market

structure in the market for licenses.     Fourth,    it would be worthwhile asking

whether the results are sensitive to the way that licenses are sold.        I am

presently working along these lines.

      area.

8.    Auction quota revenues in autos for 1987 are estimated at about 2.2

      billion by Bergsten et al.         The quota revenues fluctuate quite

      considerably over the years as demand fluctuates and their level

      changes making them more or less restrictive.


 9.    See Krishna (1987) for a survey of this work.


10.    There may be domestic competitive supply in which case the monopolist's




                                              29
      demand in what follows should be interpreted as the residual demand

      curve.


11.   This is because when V          QM,   the intersection of          }IR,   the marginal

      revenue curve corresponding to            BE,    with marginal cost would occur at

      a lower output level than the output level at which the kink in demand

      occurs.    As the quota falls, the kink in the demand curve moves back

      twice as fast as the intersection of the marginal revenue curve with

      marginal cost.       Finally, at the quota level of V depicted, the two

      coincide.


12.   It is possible to draw the analogue of Figure 3 with                      BB   very steep

      and    V   close to QH,      where auction quotas can raise welfare above its

      free trade level.


13.   Assuming          = 1.1,   e = 8,     N   0001     yields one such example.
                                            n


14.   This is because of our constant marginal cost assumption.                        If costs

      were increasing; there would be some producer surplus to shift and this

      would add a profit shifting element which is ruled out here.



15.   One might think another case exists where                 PM(V)   is so much below

      PV(VF) that L*(V)          L**(V).    This is not possible.           In this case L is

      between L*(V) and L**(V)        PX(V)      PV(V)    — L   <   PM(L) which      would imply

      that   at P'(V)     — L, ñc.)   >   0 which is not possible.
