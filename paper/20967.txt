                                               ABSTRACT

While both cultural and legal norms (institutions) help foster cooperation, culture is the more primitive
of the two and itself sustains formal institutions. Cultural changes are rarer and slower than changes
in legal institutions, which makes it difficult to identify the role played by culture. Cultural changes
and their effects are easier to identify in simpler, more controlled, environments, such as corporations.
Corporate culture, thus, is not only interesting per se, but also as a laboratory to study the role of societal
culture and the way it can be changed.
