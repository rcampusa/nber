                               ABSTRACT

      Current and      planned measures liberalizing the                 external

capital accounts of     France and        Italy call       into question the

continued viability of        the   policy       of    periodic exchange-rate

realignment followed to     date     in   the    European Monetary System

(EMS).   This   paper is intended as a first step in studying the real

and monetary effects of EMS-style realignments in               a   setting of

free cross-border financial flows.              The    first set    of    results

derived concerns a situation in which there are                no   fundamental

factors behind domestic inflation. Under a policy regime in which

domestic inflation automatically triggers devaluation, the economy

can   undergo      self-fulfilling    depreciation-inflation spirals,

triggered by speculative attack on the exchange rate. Such spirals

do not occur when realignments do not offset past inflation fully.

The second set of results shows how an exchange rate collapse can

occur after inflation is set off by         expansionary fiscal policy.

Sometimes, but not always, the crisis will be preceded by a period

of capital inflows and real currency appreciation.             In other cases

fiscal expansion may set off an immediate crisis.

Introduction

      Since its     inauguration in        March    1979,       the     exchange-rate

mechanism of the European Monetary System                (EMS)     has     functioned

with the aid of frequent currrency realignments--to date,                             more

than one per year on average. In the eyes of many                     observers,        the

strategy of frequent realignment has allowed the system to survive

in spite of the rather divergent macroeconomic policies pursued by
                                                                                  I
the   "Big Three" of the    EMS,     France,     Germany,        and     Italy.         An

apparently critical element in minimizing the financial disruption

caused by realignments has         been    the   control over            cross-border

financial flows      maintained by         France and       Italy.         The        large

onshore-offshore interest differentials            that have       emerged        during

currency crises suggest that            capital controls have              played an

important role in insulating the            French and          Italian financial

systems from the full force of speculative              capital movements.
      Current   and planned measures liberalizing the                          external

capital accounts of      France    and     Italy call       into       question the

continued viability of a widely-understood EMS policy of                       periodic

realignment.    Yet the speculative        response of          capital       flows     to

expected parity change is          an     area   that    has     received little

attention in the academic literature.2           The     relative        neglect of
the role parity changes     play     in    balance-of-payments crises is

puzzling:    empirically,   devaluation fears are           a    leading- -perhaps

the leading- -factor behind currency flight,             just     as     speculative

inflows are often inspired by hopes of             revaluation.           A    further

shortcoming of the existing literature is that, for the most part,

it stops    short   of   analyzing the       possible real             macroeconomic

effects of exchange-rate crises.

      This paper is intended as a first step in studying the                          real
and monetary effects of EMS-type realignment policies in a setting

of free cross-border     financial flows.            A   simple model that serves

as the paper's analytical framework is sketched in Section 1.                         The

precise question then asked        is:        What   kinds    of   equilibria can

arise when markets expect a loss of home                 competitiveness       against

foreign goods to lead to realignment?                Although much work        remains

to be done, the results of a preliminary investigation are                        quite

suggestive.

     The first set of results, described in Section 2, concerns a

situation in which there      are        no    fundamental     factors        (such    as

fiscal expansion) behind domestic inflation.                 Instead,    Section         2

                                                                                      that
analyzes the economy's behavior under exchange-rate rules

allow cumulative inflation to trigger realignment automatically.

The key finding is that such rules can induce multiple equilibria.

Specifically,    if realignment is expected to maintain                 or     enhance

external competitiveness,     the economy has two equilibria.                   One     of

these involves an inflationary spiral in which speculators                      force a

collapse of the fixed exchange rate              and a       depreciation of           the


currency to its new peg.      When realignment is expected to aim at a

real appreciation of the domestic currency, however, there is only

one equilibrium:     the inflation-depreciationspiral cannot occur.

     These     results   suggest     that       under     conditions of         capital

mobility,     a systematic realignment policy                may have        disruptive

effects--in financial markets, in the output and                   labor       markets,

and on domestic inflation. Although the results are model-specific

and therefore should not be taken too literally, they also provide

a   rationale for      the   recent EMS          practice of       only partially

offsetting differential      inflation through currency realignment.3

     A   second set of results,          explained in        Section     3,     studies
                                                                               inflation
expected realignment in a setting where domestic price

is already being driven by fundamentals               (here, fiscal         expansion).

The possible equilibria of the economy depend on                      how    fully       the

authorities attempt to          offset past      inflation through currency

depreciation.     If devaluation is large relative to past inflation,

an exchange-rate collapse occurs as soon as an expansionary fiscal

policy is enacted, but before any real appreciation has                       occurred.

In the face of smaller devaluations,            the fixed exchange rate                  can

coexist with      domestic inflation for               some    time     before           the

inevitable collapse occurs.




1. The Mode].


       A   simple model with sticky output prices is the                    setting      for

the discussion;     in line with the      likely evolution of                  financial

arrangements within the EMS, perfect capital mobility is                           assumed.

Three basic hypotheses are (1) that the exchange rate                         is     pegged

entirely through the interventton of the home                  central bank,               (2)


that the home central bank has only a limited capacity                        to     defend

the exchange rate (in      a sense to be        made precise        below),        and     (3)

that    the    fixed exchange rate must               be    abandoned        (at      least

temporarily)      once   this     capacity has         been    exhausted.             These

hypotheses do not square perfectly with the facts of the EMS,                            but

they lead to a useful benchmark           model       on    which     more     realistic

analyses can be built.

       The    analytical framework is           the        overshooting model              of

Dornbusch (1976) and Mussa (1977), as set out                  in     the     survey by

Obstfeld and      Stocknian     (1985).    In    the       following description,

variables other than interest rates are natural logarithms,                          and     a
variable such as Dz(t) is the (right-hand) time derivative of                                      z at


time t.     Perfect        foresight is assumed, so no distinction is                             made

between actual and expected rates of change.

       With free capital mobility and perfect                            substitution between

domestic- and          foreign-currency bonds,                     the         onshore         domestic

interest rate, i(t), is related by interest parity to the                                       (fixed)

foreign rate,        i*,   and        the       expected rate           of     domestic currency

depreciation,        De(t):



(1)      i(t)   â€”   i* + De(t).

The exchange rate e(t) is the price of foreign currency in                                       terms

of domestic.

      If m(t) is the home                 money     supply,    y       the     (fixed)        level   of

domestic output, and p(t) the money price of                                 output,     equilibrium

in the money market occurs when



(2)     m(t) -      p(t)   â€”   -yy    -
                                           Ai(t).

       Let p* be       the       (fixed)          foreign-currency price                 of    foreign

output, which is distinct from domestic output.                                 Aggregate demand

for domestic output is



(3)     d(t)    â€”   [p* + e(t) p(t)]       -          -
                                                          [i(t)    -
                                                                         Dp(t)].


Because the price of home output is sticky, aggregate demand                                          and

supply can differ in the short run.

        Imbalances in                the       output market contribute                  to      price

adjustment,     however,        and the model's             final element is an               equation

to describe price dynamics.                     Let   (t)     denote the output price that
                                                       5


would currently clear the goods market; as in Mussa                                          (1977),          this


price is defined as the solution to


(4)     y â€”   p* + e(t) (t)]       -              -    o'[i(t)      -   Dp(t)J.


Then the inflation rate is given by



(5)     Dp(t)    â€”    9[d(t)   -
                                   yl   +    Dp(t),

where   9    measures the sensitivity of                           inflation to          excess output

demand. The          second term             in                                  is    central          to     the
                                                      equation            (5)


discussion below, as it captures the pure effects of                                          inflationary

expectations         on the price level.

        Assume now (for notational simplicity)                                  that i*, y, and p* are

zero. Then for        a constant money                 stock,       in,    the stationary values of
the exchange rate and price level are                              e()      â€”   p(')    â€”     in,       and    the

stationary       value   of the real exchange rate, x(t) â€”                                  p*      +   e(t)
p(t),    is therefore x(v) â€”             0. Under a floating exchange                               rate,      the

                                                     are given
dynamics of convergence to this long-run equilibrium                                                            by

the pair of differential equations



(6)      De(t)    â€”      [p(t)     -




(7)      Dp(t) â€”      9[e(t)       -
                                       e()J        +
                                                           (   -   9)[p(t)        -
                                                                                      p()}

        Figures la and lb show the two possible configurations                                            of the

system described by the preceding two equations.                                       In each case the

model has the familiar saddlepath property:                                      for any initial price

level p(O), there is a unique equilibrium exchange rate                                                 on     SS,

                                                                                                               its

saddlepaths      AA, which play         an       important role           in   the     analysis

below.

       The two roots of the system are 1/A and                      -9;    it can be      shown

that   a general solution takes              the form



(8)      e(t) -       e(o) â€” k1exp(t/))      -    (l/A9)kexp(-8t),

(9)    p(t) -         p()   =    kexp(t/X) + kexp(-9t),


where k     and k       are parameters determined by                initial      conditions

Setting k â€” 0 gives the equation for                     SS:




(10)      p(t)    -
                      p()     â€”   -A9[e(t)    -   e()].

Setting k2    â€”   0 gives the equation for AA:



(11)      p(t)   â€”    e(t).

The unstable path AA thus              coincides with           a    450       ray    from   the


origin.

                                                                                 disturbances
policy, the model abstracts in this section from all

that might        alter the         long-run equilibrium level                   of    external

competitiveness.            The model thus concentrates             on    monetary factors

alone, and asks             if    even under these relatively uflcomplicated

conditions,       expected realignments can have disruptive effects on

the macroeconomy. In particular,                   can expected realignments lead
                                                  7


to   equilibria that look like inflation-devaluationspirals?

         The answer depends on the                mechanism in             place       to        fix      the


exchange rate.         Here I assume that the policy authority allows the

exchange rate to float once private capital outflows have                                         reduced

the domestic money stock to a positive lower bound of m0.                                        Such          a

situation would arise, for example, if the central bank's external

credit lines provided insufficient foreign                             exchange to             purchase

outstanding domestic credit and if other tools                                for     reducing the

domestic component of the monetary base were unavailable.

         The realignment rule followed by the                         policy authority must

now be     specified.     Imagine that the                exchange rate               is       initially

fixed at the level          and that             the   corresponding long-run price

level is p.       <To these prices there                  corresponds an               endogenously

determined money stock        in   â€”        p    + 7y      -    Ai*       â€”   .)           The        policy

authority's     rule is to devalue the currency to an exchange rate of

e'   >     if the price level reaches the trigger value of                                     > p.

         Suppose first that        e'             .       The        interpretation              of       this

condition is           that when        p       reaches        the     trigger         point,              the

authorities     devalue the currency to a level that                            <at        a     minimum)

restores current external competitiveness                            to its     long-run value.

Clearly, one equilibrium of the model is the one in which                                         nothing

happens and the economy remains at the initial equilibrium,                                           e   â€”

p â€”   .     With no shocks disturbing markets, there                           is no reason                for

p ever     to reach its trigger level and bring the realignment policy

into play.

         There is,     however,     a           second equilibrium,                 illustrated in

Figure     2.   <The    analysis henceforth assumes,                           without           loss         of

generality,     that the configuration of Figure la                            is     the        relevant

one.)       In this equilibrium,                speculators mount an attack                       on       the

currency   as soon as the realignment            rule becomes              known.         Private
capital outflows reduce the money supply to                         m      and      force    the

central bank to withdraw from the               foreign exchange market:                     the


economy is know on an unstable path of                    the     floating-rate system

associated with a money supply equal to the minimal level m.                                 The


collapse results in a sharp currency depreciation [to e(O)], after



When p reaches      ,   e â€”   '
which e and p rise together in an

                                  and
                                               inflation-depreciation spiral.

                                        the central bank can peg the exchange

rate at this new level if no            further realignment is                      expected.5

Subsequently,    rising domestic prices erode any short-term gain                             in

competitiveness as p rises to its new long-run level, p' â€”

       This second equilibrium is driven entirely by self-fulfilling

expectations that there will be a crisis followed by inflation and

a   realignment.6    Since a speculative attack causes a                      depreciation

of the domestic currency, each speculator has an incentive to join

in if he believes an attack is about to occur.                          The immediate real

currency depreciation helps pull              domestic prices                up     until    the

trigger price level is reached.               In this alternative equilibrium,

the exchange rate reaches its new peg just as                       the      trigger price

level is reached,       so there is no need for             a     discrete anticipated

jump in the     exchange rate,          which would be                   inconsistent       with

asset-market        equilibrium         (Krugman          1979).            Although         the


exchange-rate collapse causes an immediate real depreciation,                                the

currency subsequently appreciates                    in    real      terms        during     the

transitional    float that precedes the              return         to     realigned fixed

rates.

       Perhaps surprisingly,        there       is    only        one      equilibrium- -the

first of the two described above- -when               '     <   ,   so     that the       policy

authority realigns without attempting to offset fully                               the    price

inflation that has occurred in the past.                          To     see    this,    consider

                                                                                                     an
avoiding a discrete jump at the moment of realignment call for
                                                   that drives the
appreciation of the currency just after the attack

central bank         from    the                               market.         This      immediate
                                           exchange
                                                                                                     in
appreciation means that the                 hypothesized speculative attack

fact never       occurs:            no     individual          speculator would              find    it


profitable to participate.                 The economy thus remains at e â€” e, p â€”

  if it is believed that the realignment policy                                will     not    fully

offset past inflation.

        To understand the difference between the present case and the

last one, observe that the post-attack change in the exchange rate

is influenced by two factors,                 the initial drop in the money supply

(from     to         the expectation that                 the     exchange rate          will       be
               m0)

pegged at the level         ' in the          future.          The first factor pushes the

price of foreign currency downward after the                             attack,       the    second

pushes it upward upward.7                 The second factor              dominates when             the


realigned exchange rate is more competitive because it is only by

depreciating initially that the real exchange rate can be                                     higher

also when the central bank re-enters the foreign exchange market.

        The case       â€”     is      a borderline case             in which both equilibria

are possible.         In this case, the                 authorities       peg     at    a nominal

               rate      that            maintains         the         original        level         of
exchange

competitiveness,        given that p               is     at     the     trigger point.             The

initial speculative attack leaves the floating exchange                                      rate    at

its pre-attack level            ,    after    which e and p rise together along AA

until p reaches p.          At this point the currency is again pegged and

the economy is at a new stationary position.8

3.    Attacks that Are   Justified by     Fundamentals


       The previous section established the          existence of          multiple

equilibria under an accommodative realignment rule.                     Central     to

the    discussion was     the   precise     form     of     the        authorities'


exchange-rate rule: under alternative rules the              multiplicity can

disappear.     If the policy rule is to realign only after                 the    real

                                                                                   the
exchange rate has appreciated by a given amount, for example,

inflationary paths of the previous section are no longer supported

by the policy rule, because the attack that sets off the inflation

leads to   a temporary gain     in competitiveness,        not a   loss.

       This   section demonstrates        how     speculative          attacks     can

nonetheless occur when realignment is prompted by                  a    current      or


prospective loss in external competitiveness               due    to    fundamental

factors.      (In contrast,   the inflations prompting the             realignments

described in the previous section were entirely the result of                       the

prospect of accommodation.)        Once again, the behavior of the model

turns on the degree to which the          authorities       attempt       to     offset

inflation through devaluation.

       Under the posited conditions of a           fixed    exchange rate          and

interest parity,       continuing domestic-credit expansion by                      the

authorities would lead to steady foreign reserve loss rather than

to real currency appreciation.       I therefore assume that the                 source

of real appreciation is, instead, fiscal.             With a      fixed exchange

rate and a sticky price level, fiscal expansion induces temporary

excess output demand and thus        a    gradual price-level rise                 that


appreciates the currency in real          terms     and    eventually restores

output-market equilibrium.       The specific scenario analyzed is                 one

in which fiscal expansion sets off          domestic       inflation,       but     the

market expects the policy authority to devalue some                     time     before
                                                        i-i




the full upward adjustment of the home price level is complete.

      The model used in the previous sections can                                        be    extended to

allow for aggregate-demand shocks such                                as        fiscal-policy         shifts.

Write the aggregate-demand equation                            (3)    as



          d(t)     â€”   [p*   +    e(t)      -
                                                p(t)]     -
                                                              o'j:i(t)     -
                                                                                Dp(t)J    +   g,


where g is         a    demand-shift              factor.            The        steady state         of       the

floating-rate model becomes                      p() â€” m, e()                  â€” m -   g/,     x()         e()
-
    p()    â€”   -g/,     for any constant money supply m. (Recall that                                     p     â€”

0.)   The equation of the unstable linear path AA is now p(t)                                              e(t)

+   g/:    a rise in         g   causes         a parallel leftward shift of AA                                in

Figures Ia and lb.

      Figure 4 shows one example of how the economy can react to                                                a

fiscal stimulus followed by realignment.                                   Initially g â€” 0 and                the

long-run values of the price level and exchange rate are shown                                                 as

p and     e;   a   rise in g sets               prices moving upward.                         (The    nominal

money supply must also rise over time, as                                      a   result of         official

intervention,          to maintain equilibrium in the                              money      market.)         So

long as the exchange rate remains fixed at                                     ,    the economy moves

vertically toward point                  E, the     new long-run position that                            would

eventually be reached In the absence of an                                      exchange-rate change.

Point E lies on A'A'              ,   the       "anti"        saddlepath associated with                        a

permanent level g of the demand-shift parameter.

      Assume now that the market expects the authorities to realign

the exchange rate at                   once the price level reaches                           .      In    this

case an attack occurs at point F, so that the economy is placed on

a path of the floating-rate system                             associated with                 the   minimal

money supply m0 <and the saddlepath 5' S'). The equilibrium path is

the unique one with the property that a                       reaches           ' just             as    p

reaches     .       No discrete     jump in a takes place                 at     the    moment           of

re-pegging (though there is a sharp capital inflow that raises m),

and the economy converges afterward to point C as inflation falls
                                                                                              on        the

real exchange rate, but it does                cause a          higher           long-run price

level.

       Two features of the path             just      described deserve emphasis.

First, even though the              eventual      attack        is     perfectly foreseen,

there is an initial period following the                         fiscal          impulse       during

which prices rise, the capital account is                            In    surplus,        and          the


exchange rate remains fixed.               The pattern of capital                      inflows and

real     currency appreciation followed by                           external           crisis           is

reminiscent of events that                accompanied the              stabilization plans

undertaken in Latin America's Southern Cone                           in       the     late    l970s.

Second,     competitiveness           continues         to     deteriorate             during           the

transitional period of floating (since p is rising faster                                      than       e

below A'A'      ,   which itself has a 45Â°                   slope).        Thus,       realignment

occurs     after        a   steady deterioration in                   competitiveness,                   in

contrast to the example of the                 last      section.              There,     the       real

exchange rate first depreciated (as a result of                                 collapse),           then

appreciated as realignr3nt approached.

       As Figure 5           shows,    however,         other        adjustment paths                   are

possible. In Figure           5, the authorities'             realignment            policy calls

for    a devaluation so           large that competitiveness is                      (temporarily)

restored to its original, pre-fiscal-expansion,                                level.         In     this

case the fiscal expansion sparks                   an        immediate collapse                    and    a

nominal currency depreciation to                  point F.            The       associated real

transitional float that brings the economy to e                               e'   ,   p      p. After

re-pegging,     there        is    a     further       loss     in     competitiveness                 as

inflation brings the economy to point                    G.     Once again, there is                   no

ultimate gain in competitiveness as a result of the                                    exchange-rate

change.

     The lesson of this example is                     that     the     expectation of                 an

over-energetic attempt              to     restore       competitiveness despite                        a

structural shift        in        the    real    exchange rate            can           set     off    an

immediate run on the currency. Such runs                        occur     even           before       any

real appreciation emerges, and                  thus    may     appear         to        be    without

foundation in market fundamentals.                      Nonetheless,               they       are     the

result of rational anticipations of future exchange-rate policy.

     The fiscal policy shock analyzed here is                          not         the        only    one

calling for a change in the long-run real exchange rate.                                       A     very

plausible situation involves expected devaluation after an adverse

shift in the demand for domestic exports.                             (Such        a devaluation

could have the advantage,               n principle,          of shortening the                 period

of recession that results from the shock.)                      A     puzzling result                  is

easy to verify using the techniques employed above:                                    In many cases

an equilibrium does not exist.

     Obviously, much of the analysis above rests                           heavily             on     the

assumption of    continu,us-time trading.                       A     discrete-time model

would allow devaluations            that were not             preceded by               transitional

floats, although paths similar to those analyzed above would still

be possible.    Arguably,          the continuous-time trading assumption                              is

reasonably close to reality.

4.   Implications and Extensions

        The model examined above is simple, but its implications                              are

stark.   A    policy of attempting to         accommodate           domestic inflation

through        real        devaluation        can        lead              to          multiple

                              equilibria.       One     of     these            involves       an
rational-expectations

exchange crisis and           a   subsequent spiral of                     inflation          and

depreciation that ultimately leave the economy with a                               permanently

                                                      In contrast,                             of
higher price level and exchange rate.                                           a    policy

partial       accommodation--if credible--precludes the                             inflationary

equilibrium.      As noted in the        introduction,           this       reasoning may

provide one rationale for the failure of EMS realignments                              to fully

accommodate differential inflation in recent years.9

        Exchange-rate crises can            also       arise         in         response       to

realignments that attempt to offset inflation due to                                expansionary

fiscal policy.        Inflation and real appreciation may                   continue for

some time before       a    collapse occurs,           even though an                  eventual

collapse is anticipated by            the     market.        A      sufficiently large

anticipated devaluation may, however, cause                    an        immediate attack

that itself postpones the inevitable real appreciation.

        The   model used      above    clearly         leaves            many        unanswered

questions. For example, is a single-country analysis applicable to

situations in which several EMS             members may             be     intervening to

defend a parity?10 A related question concerns the equilibria that

arise when the authorities'           ability to         defend a               rate     is   not

limited in the manner assumed above, so that the                          authorities can

and do purchase the entire money supply to                     defend the              exchange

rate.     This possibility would appear to               rule        out        the    multiple

equilibria of Section 2, but not obviously to preclude the attacks

of Section 3, since the public could reduce its money holdings                                 to
                                 15



zero just before devaluation.

     At a deeper level, one must ask whether there      are   plausible

policymaker preferences that     might   generate     the     types   of

realignment rules examined in this paper.   All of these       questions

raise difficult problems   for   economic analysis,     but    they   are

central to understanding the present and prospective functioning

of the EMS,
Appendix:        Algebraic Analysis of Self-fulfilling Equilibria

       An      algebraic analysis of                    the      inflationary            equilibrium

discussed in Section 2 clarifies some aspects                             of      self-fulfilling

paths.         Such an analysis can be based on equations                          (8)     and        (9),

the general           solutions for             the        dynamic   system describing the

floating-rate model.

       To construct an inflationary equilibrium,                            one        must     find         a

transition time T and constants k 1 and k2 such that e(T) â€”                                     e'     and


p(T)   â€”        when e(t) and p(t) follow the equations



         e(t)     -   m    â€”   kexp(t/A)        -
                                                    (l/AO)kexp(-9t),

         p(t)     -   m    â€”   kexp(t/))        +
                                                    k2exp(-Ot),


that            when the post-attack floating rate                     is      determined            in      a
         is,


system with money supply m.                         One initial condition is               given by

the    stickiness of              prices:           p(O)     â€”   ,    So       there      are        three

conditions--one initial, two terminal--to determine the                                         unknown

parameters T, k1               and k
                                     2

       The solution for T                  is    given       implicitly by         the        nonlinear

equation


(12)            A(T) â€”


where

                          ( - in )     - (p     -

                  (e'                                       m0)exp(-9T)

                          exp(T/A)     -   exp(-9T)
   (T) â€”
                  exp(T/A) + (l/A8)exp(-9T)

Figure 6 illustrates how T is determined by (12).                                        Note that as     T

realignment rules such that
                                                       '
                                                                   at   least one       intersection of

A(T) and B(T) is guaranteed.                           Intersections           are also       possible for

some nonacconunodative realignment rules, of course,                                      but these      do

                                                                                                         to
not     define equilibria because                                the    currency would            have

appreciate immediately after the speculative attack that sets                                            off

the inflation.

            One case that is easy to analyze explicitly is the borderline

case referred to in the text, in which                                  '      .    In    this    case   the

solution to (12) is


        T   â€”   Xlog[(         -              -
                                   ni0)/(p0           is )].


Direct        calculation shows that the appropriate                                initial      conditions

are     k    â€”      - ni       and        â€” 0,             which       imply     that    the     equilibrium
                                     k2

floating exchange rate immediately after the attack is


            e(O)   â€”


the original           peg.         After the attack, the exchange rate                            therefore

moves toward its new peg along the                                 path     AA     in    Figure    2.    The

adjustment process is in this case a pure inflation that does                                            not

affect relative output prices.

suggestions I received in a seminar at the Research Department

1.   Among recent         reviews         of the EMS   experience     are Collins (1987),

Giavazzi and Ciovannini (1986), Rogoff (1985), and Ungerer et                             al.


(1986).



2.   Exceptions include Blanco and Garber (1986), Feenstra (1985),

Gros (1987),   and Obstfeld                (1984).   As will become apparent below,

some of Feenstra's conclusions,                  although reached        in   a     financial

setting more descriptive of                   some     developing economies than of

Europe, are quite relevant for analyzing prospective developments

in the EMS.



3.   See, for example, Giavazzi and Pagano (1988).



4.   Equations      (6)    and      (7)    follow from (1), (2), and the fact             that

under     price-adjustment rule                 (5),     the   real    exchange rate          is

driven to its long-run value of zero                      according to        the    equation

Dx(t)      -Ox(t).



5.   A similar response to anticipated devaluation                       is    analyzed by

            (1QS', 4r,         f      vihl     nr,' mndel      of currency     substitution
based on utility maximization.           Notice that, in       contrast to       the

case discussed in Obstfeld (1984), the length of the                  transitional

period of floating is endogenous here.            This is also true       of     the

transitional       float analyzed in the next section.




6.    The alternative equilibrium provides another              example of       the

type of self-fulfilling crisis studied in my 1986 paper.                  The role

of    self-fulfilling accommodative policies is                 studied     in     a

different context by Corden (1986).



7.    See, for example, Flood and        Garber     (1983)     or    Obstfeld and

Stockman (1985).


8.    An algebraic analysis is given in the Appendix.


9.    A natural question        is   whether   capital        controls    preclude

multiple equilibria by          preventing,    or     at     least    minimizing,

speculative reserve outflows.           Models of     anticipatory wage          and

price setting, such as Calvo (1983), suggest a tentative negative

answer.      The question deserves a thorough analysis, however.
