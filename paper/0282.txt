                                ABSTRACT

      Black Economic Progress After 1964:   Who Has Gained and Why



      This paper examines the incidence and causality of black economic

gains in the decade of the 1960's and 1970's.   It finds that the relative

economic position of blacks, measured by ratios of black to white earnings

or ratios of measures of occupational position, rose sharply post-1964.

The greatest gains accrued to black women relative to white women; to

highly educated and skilled young black men; and to those from more ad-

vantaged homes.   The traditional lack of a strong relation between family

background and education or economic position found among blacks was altered

in the period, as background factors came to play a more important role in

the socioeconomic success of young blacks and in explaining differences

between young blacks and whites.   The continued advance of blacks in the

worsened job market of the mid-1970's makes it clear that cyclic factors

do not explain the post-1964 gains.   Regression analysis of time-series

data and surveys of corporate personnel policy suggest that equal oppor-

tunity activity, initiated in response to antibias laws and regulations,

is the main cause for the improved economic position of black Americans.

                   Black Economic Progress After 1964:

                        Who Has Gained and Why?



    After decades of little or no economic progress relative to whites,

black Americans made substantial advances in the job market after 1964

and, to a lesser extent, in earlier post-World War II years.         Studies based

on diverse data sets and analytic models report sizeable declines in
                                                     1           .
traditional discriminatory differences in the 1960s--dec1ines which appear

to have been maintained in the seventies.      While some may (and some have)

objected to my 1973 characterization of the gains as "dramatic," heralding

the "decline of market discrimination," i t is clear that beginning in the

1960s     the job market for black Americans diverged sharply from the historic

pattern of persistent and unchan3ing black-white differentials.

        The change in the market raises many important questions about the

economic well-being of black Americans and the economics of discrimination

in a market economy.     On the one hand are questions regarding the nature

of black economic gains--their magnitude, incidence, permanence, and their effect

on the economic well-being of the black community.       On the other side are

questions of causality--of the effect of factors like governmental anti-

discriminatory activity and social programs on the demand for and supply

of black labor.     Because of the complexity of major social changes,

controversy over programs like affirmative action, and the importance of

reductions in discriminatory differences to the black community, questions

regarding the nature and cause of black'economic progress in the post-World

War II period have generated considerable scholarly work and controversy         and will

undoubtedly generate more in the future.

        This study uses three types of evidence to analyze the nature and cause

of black economic progress in post-World War II years:       aggregate

evidence on the timing and incicence mnong skill groups of changes in

the relative earnings or occupational position of blacks; cross-sectional
                                                                     2



evidence on the family background determinants of the socioeconomic achievement

of blacks; and information from company personnel offices     regardin~   personnel

policies toward black (and other) workers affected by civil rights legislation.

      Section one of the paper summarizes aggregate evidence on the timing

of black economic gains and on the incidence of gains by demographic and skill

groups.   It finds that gains have been concentrated in the post-l964 period;

have not dissipated in the 1970s despite high rates of unemployment; and have

been largest among more educated   or skilled workers, younger workers,

and female workers.   Section two examines the effect of family background

factors on black educational, earnings, and occupational attainment.        It

finds that young blacks from more advantaged family backgrounds have

made especially large gains in   th~   market, to the extent that family

background has become a much more important determinant of black socio-

economic position than in the past.      As a result of the decline in black/white

economic differentials and the enhanced impact of family background on

black educational and economic attainment, background differences appear to

have become a more important impediment than market discrimination to

attainment of black-white economic parity among the young.       Section III

turns to the issue of causality.       It argues that the timing and incidence

of gains and the information on company personnel and employment practices

supports the proposition that governmental antibias activity played a major

role in the change in the job market.      The evidence from company studies is

given great weight in evaluating causality in light of the usual problems

of interpreting econometric results.



 I.   Measuring Black Economic Gains

       Analysis of the nature of black economic gains depends at least in

 part on the statistical measures used to evaluate the economic status
                                                                    3




of blacks relative to the economic status of whites.      In this paper I am

concerned with patterns of labor market discrimination and choose measures

of relative economic status designed to reflect market discrimination.          In

the framework of the standard economic analysis of discrimination, dis-

criminatory differences will be defined as differences in wages, employment,

or occupational attainment between otherwise comparable workers that can

be traced to the effect of prejudiced employers, employees, unions, or

consumers on the demand for labor.      The conceptual experiment which measures

such discrimination would be to change the race (religion, sex, etc.) of

the individual and observe what happens to his economic position.       A

possible practical experiment   wou~d   be to present employers with a set of

job applications from workers that differ solely in, say, their race and

find out who would in fact be hired.     Discrimination could be inferred

from a deviation in the selection process from that predicted by random

sampling.    In the absence of such experiments, discriminatory differences

will be measured as a "residual" from comparisons of economic position
                                                                            2
corrected for productivity-related or incoma--related characteristics,

including diverse measures of pre-labor market factors.      Since labor market

discrimination involves shifts in demand schedules, which depend on ratios

of productivities and wages, the analysis will concentrate on relative

rather than absolute economic differentials between blacks and whites.

Since individuals rather than families are employed in the job market, the

analysis will deal solely with measures of the economic position of individuals,

and not with family incomes.



The Decline in biscriminatory Differences

     Evidence that the labor market position of black Americans improved

significantly after 1964, and to some extent earlier, is substantial and

growing.    Aggregate statistical measures of individual incomes or occupational
                                                                       4



position reveal a sizeable "twist" in the trend line for the incomes and

occupatiortal attainment of blacks relative to the incomes or occupational

attainment of whites after 1964 (R. Freeman, 1973a; W. Vroman; S. Masters).          Cross-

sectional and longitudinal data, available from computer tapes on thousands

of individuals, corroborate this finding.        Comparisons of earnings functions

estimated       with   data from the Census of Population of 1970 to earnings functions

estimated with data from the Census of Population of 1960 show a sharp drop in the

effect of race on earnings (J. Smith & F. Welch).        Detailed investigation of the

National Longitudinal Survey has found the occupational position of young

black men entering the market after 1964 to be essentially the same as that

of young whites with similar pre-market background characteristics (R.

Hall and R. Kasten).        The 1973 Occupational Change in a Generation Survey

has shown marked advances in the relative position of blacks, particularly

those aged 25-34, compared to the comparable 1962 survey (R. Hauser & D~

Featherman).       Several studies oriented toward other labor market problems

have found that the traditionally large negative impact of being black on

economic status has become much smaller than in the past (K. Viscusi,

~.   Epstein,     A. Astin, R. Meyer and D. Wise).   Finally, in contrast

to earlier studies which showed that blacks had relatively small gains

from additional schooling (G. Hanoch, R. Weiss), evidence for the late

19608 show a marked convergence in the return to black and white male

investments in schooling, especially among the young(L. Weiss and

J. Williamson, F.Welch, R. Freeman, 1974a).

       Some of the statistical evidence on the improved labor market position

of black (or nonwhite)3 workers is given in table 1, which records ratios

of the income or earnings of nonwhite workers to the income or earnings of

white workers.' Columns 1 and 2 give ratios for 1949 (except where noted) and

for 1959, respectively; column 3 gives ratios for 1964, when the Civil Rights Act
                                                                     5



was passed but prior to its becoming effective; column 4 records ratios for

the peak year of the late sixties boom, 1969; while column 5 records ratios

for the latest year for which data are available.      Because the Bureau of the

Census did not publish incomes by race and occupation or by race and age until 1967

and did not ask for "usual weekly earnings" until then, the figures for those

categories in the 1964 column relate, as noted in the table, to 1967.

     Columns 6 and 7 present average annual changes in the ratios for the

period preceding 1964 and the period following 1964.      In the lines where

data is not available until 1967, the pre-1964 changes cover the period

1949 to 1959 while the post-1964 changes are from 1967 to the final year.

If, as seems reasonable, declines in market discrimination move income

ratios toward an asymptote of unity, annual percentpge point changes can
                                    4
be expected to decline over time.       Hence, any acceleration in rates of change

should be viewed as evidence (all else the same) of significant structural

change in the market.

     Lines 1-5 present figures for male workers, decomposed by occupation,

education, and age.     Lines 6-9 treat women.   As the average female income

ratios approach unity by the end of the period and exceed unity within

disaggregate skill groupings by the early 1970s (Freeman, 1973), I

have not decomposed these earnings.ratios into the detailed groups used

for men.

     There are three basic findings in the table.      First, contrary to

the fears of several analysts that the advances of the late 1960s were due

to cyclical rather than     more fundamental market changes (see the comments

to my 1973 Brookings paper), the gains in the relative income of blacks

did not erode through the severe recession of the mid seventies.         Indeed,

except for the figures in line 1, the data give little evidence of

deceleration in the rate of gain after 1969.      Of particular interest·
                                                                       6



is the large increase in the ratio of black to white median usual

weekly earnings from 1969 to 1976, which suggests that black wage rates

rose rapidly even when unemployment was sizeable.         Among Women, the

income ratios   ri~e   sharply in the seventies to approach unity by 1976.

     The second finding of the table is that in all of the comparisons

given, the rate of increase in the black/white income ratio is greater

after 1964 than before 1964, despite the fact that the "income gap" to

be closed tends to be smaller in the latter period.         Larger increases

post-1964 are a necessary "first fact" (other factors held fixed) for any case

to be made regarding the impact on the job market of the diverse anti-·bias
                                                      5
activity which became intense in the mid sixties.

     Third, with regard to     incide~ce,   the income ratios in table 1 reveal markedly

different rates of progress for various groups of black workers.           Among men,

greater gains were made by younger black workers than by older black workers with,

for example, the income ratio for 20-24 year old full-time and year-round workers

rising by 13 percentage points from 1967 to 1976 compared to almost no change for
                                                                                  •
those aged 45-54.      Greater gains were also made by the more highly qualified,-

such as professioRals, managers, and (to a lesser extent) craftsmen.

Perhaps most importantly, the income ratios in line 6, which focus on persons

with the same education and age, show larger gains for young black college

graduates than for young black high school graduates.         In 1976, 25-29 year

old black male college graduates earned almost as much as white male college

graduates.     The ratio of black to white earnings for college men was much higher

than that for young high school graduates, a result which contrasts markedly with

that found in earlier years (Hanoch).        Studies of other data sets also find that

better educated and young black men obtained greater advances in the post-1964

period than did less educated and less skilled older workers (see J. Smith

& F. Welch).     Black women, as noted earlier, had especially large gains
                                                                     7



in relative income, due in part to their movement from household service

jobs to factory and clerical positions (Freeman, 1973a).

     Table 2 turns to evidence on the occupational attainment of black and

white workers.   The occupation data have two advantages in analysis.       First,

occupation may be a more permanent indicator of economic status than incomes,

which tend to be sensitive to cyclical ups-and-downs and other transitory

fluctuations.    Second, unlike income comparisons, which could be biased by

investments in newly available opportunities to attain higher lifetime

income streams,6 occupation is likely to reflect the result of relatively

enduring movements into higher or lower paying jobs.      Even if the income gains

of black men had slackened in the seventies (which does not appear to be the

case) evidence of continued occup<:ttional advance might be taken as indicative

of continued declines in discriminatory differences.

     The position of blacks in the occupational structure is measured in two

ways in the table.   Lines 1 and 2 record ratios of fixed income weighted indices

of the value of the nonwhite and white occupational structures.      These are ca1cu-

lated by weighing the proportion of   ~onWhite   or white persons in an occupation by

the median income of all men or women in the occupation reported in the Census'

of Population of 1960.    When the job distribution of nonwhites shifts toward

higher income occupations relative to the occupational distribution of

whites, these statistics will rise, and conversely when the black job

structure deteriorates compared to that of whites.      During the period

covered, the data show a marked improvement in the relative occupational

position of nonwhites, particularly after 1964.      Froml964 to 1969 the ratio

of occupational indices rises by .04 points for nonwhite men and .11 points for

nonWhite women; from 1969 to 1977, the increases were .05 and .12 points respect-

ively.   Overall, the rate of nonwhite advance accelerated by 0.4 points for both

sexes after 1964.    For men, it increased by 0.7 points per annum in the post-

1964 period compared to 0.3 points per, annum in the earlier period.     For women

it increased by 1.8 points per annum from 1964 to 1977 compared to 1.4 points

from 1950 to 1964.

     The second measure of the relative occupational position of nonwhites is

the "relative penetration ratio."    This is defined as the ratio of the proportiC'n

of all nonwhite    workers   in an occupation to the proportion of all white workers

so employed.    When it is unity, nonwhites and whites are equally represented in an

occupation; when it is below one, nonwhites are less than proportionately representecl

and conversely, when it is above one.    The statistics in lines 3-8 show a marked

post 1964 improvement in the relative proportion of nonwhites in th~ "goo~" jobs

covered in the table and indicate that the movement continued, in some instances

at an accelerated rate, into the 1970s recession.    Among men, the rate of advance

into professional and managerial jobs accelerates sharply from 1964-1969 to

1969-1977.     Of particular importance is the large flow of nonwhite male college

graduates into managerial positions in the latter period, presumably the result

of changes in educatl.on and career training induced by new opportunities

(Freeman, 1977).

     The apparently strong "new market" for high level black workers is

pursued in table 3, which presents data relating to the relative income of

selected groups of highly educated or skilled black workers.     Lines 1 and 2

show that among Ph.D. 's and faculty blacks earned roughly as much as comparable

whites in 1973, which contrasts sharply to long standing patterns of market

discrimination.     The evidence in line 3 shows that the starting pay of black

male college graduates was roughly equal to the starting pay of white male

college graduates as early as 1969, a finding corroborated through 1973 by

analysis of the National Longitudinal Survey (Grasso).     Line 4 gives

affirmative action pressures on business and industry," (Astin, p. 155).     Any

explanation of the improved market for black workers must come to grips

with the pattern of change in which young and more qualified men appear

to have made especially large gains relative to other black men.

      There are two basic conclusions to be reached from this review

of black economic progress.   First, the advances in the 1960s and to some

extent earlier which motivated my 1973 Brookings paper have not been eroded

by the weakened job market of the 1970s and thus cannot be readily attributed,

as some argued, to the late 1960s boom.    More is involved than simple

cyclical patterns.   Second, the rate of black economic advance has differed

significantly by sex, education, age, and skill groups.    Black women attained

approximate parity with white women having similar skills, though both groups

trail white men by considerable amounts.    Among men, where sizeable economic

differences remain overall, the differences declined most and/or became

smallest among the highly educated and skilled.    Large advances were made by

the young, especially those going on to higher education, possibly because

the young were not hampered by past discriminatory practices and human capital

investment decisions, which effectively "lock" experienced personnel into

particular career paths and seniority ladders from which change is difficult.



II.   Changed Social Mobility Patterns and Discriminatory Differences Among

      Young Men

      The extent and incidence of economic advance among young black men is exam-

ined in greater detail in this section with data from the National Longitudinal
.            8
Survey (NLS), which contains information on the labor market position, family

background and diverse other variables for about 5,200 young men.    The analysis

concentrates on the family background determinants of educational and labor

market attainment and on the contribution of background factors to differences

between blacks and whites in years of schooling, earnings, and occupational position.
                                                                  13


For the purpose of determining whether there have been changes in mobility

patterns, the effect of -background factors on young men in the NLS sample is

compared with the effect of background factors on older men from the comparable

NLS survey of 45-59 year olds in 1966 pn the assumption that the socioeconomic

status of the older men was essentially determined years earlier) and with

the 1;"esults of studies covering the pre-1964 period.

     The principal finding is that, in contrast to the pattern of social

mobility before 1964, when family background was found to have relatively

small effects on black achievement and when only a modest fraction

of black/white economic differences could be attributed to the "burden of

background", 9 in the late 1960s background factors became an important

determinant of black socioeconomic advancement and the major cause of economic

differences between black and white young men.    The implication is that blacks

from more advantaged backgrounds made greater gains in the market than those

from less advantaged backgrounds.


Measures of socioeconomic position

     This study examines the effect of family background and other variables

on four measures of socioeconomic achievement:    the years of schooling

attained by an individual; weekly earnings; annual earnings; and an index

of occupational position, the median income of male workers in the individual's

3-digit occupation in 1969.   The weekly earnings variable (obtained by division

of yearly earnings by weeks worked over the year) is designed to measure rates

of paylO while the yearly earnings variable depends on time worked over the

year as well as on the rate of pay.   The index of occupational position uses

the same incomes for blacks and whites in an occupation despite differences

in earnings within occupations so as to focus on occupational attainment.
                                                                      14


Measures of family and other background variables
                                                                       11
     The following variables are used to measure family background:

     Years of schooling of the head of the parental family, which is entered

in regressions explaining the individual's years of schooling but not in

the regressions explaining labor market attainment, since parental education

appears to affect individuals through schooling rather than directly.

     Living in a one parent/female home at age 14, a 0-1 dummy variable

entered to control for differences in the economic resources between

households which include a male head and those which do not and for the

possible effect of the absence of a male "role model" on the young.

     The occupational attainment of the head of household at age 14,

measured by the logarithm of the median income of male workers in the

three-digit occupation in which the parent worked, as given in the     u.s.
                                2
Census of Population of 1960:       Because black workers have traditionally been

lower paid than whites in the same occupation, the occupational attainment of

black parents is measured by nonwhite median incomes while that of white

parents is measured by total median incomes.      Measuring parental status

in this way yields     larger differences between the family backgrounds of

blacks and whites than those obtained in sociology studies which use the

same figures for the occupations of black parents and the occupations of
                 13
white parents.        Separate indicators for blacks and whites provide a closer

fix on economic differences between them, as opposed to differences in

socioeconomic status.

     Three indicators of household reading resources when the individual

was 14 years old:     presence of magazines, presence of newspapers, and

presence of library cards in the home, entered to try to capture SOme

of the more explicit activities or resources by which family background

influences the young.     While by no means optimal, these measures provide
                                                                   15



some indication of activities in the home beyond the crude standard measures

of parental schooling and occupation.

     In addition to the measures of family background, the calculations

also contain measures of the region and type of residence of the person at
      14
age 14. These measures are entered because of the traditional importance

of "regional background" in black/uhite economic differences due in part to

the extraordinary discrimination in schooling in the South (Welch, 1973;

Freeman, 1974b), especially in rural areas.

     The National Longitudinal Survey data reveal sizeable black disadvantages

in each of the background variables.    In the young male sample the parents

of blacks averaged 7.9 years of schooling, whereas the parents of whites

averaged 10.5 years.    The log of the median income of the occupation of

parents of blacks was 7.7 compared to a log of the median income of the

occupation of parents of white of 8.5; 40% of the young blacks were from

one parent/female homes at age 14 compared to 12% of the young white

men; 45% of the black youth reported having magazines in their homes com-

pared to 80% of white youth; 69% of the blacks reported the presence of

newspapers   compared to 92% of the whites; 47% of the b:ack youth reported
                                                    15
having library cards compared to 74% of white youths. In terms of the

regional variables, young blacks were more likely to have been hrought

up in the South and in rural areas than young whites.

     The sizeable differences between the family background resources of

young blacks and "those of young whites suggest that, if background factors

"matter" in attainment, they are likely to be a major cause of economic

inequality between young blacks and young whites.    To what extent does the

educational and labor market attainment of young blacks and young whites

depend on background factors?
                                                                      16


Background and schooling

     Table 4 presents least squares estimates of the effect of family

background and region and type of residence on the years of schooling

of young black and white men and, for comparison, estimates of the

effect of these variables on the years of schooling of older black

and white men as well.     Since measures of household reading
resources are unavailable for the older men, these variables have been

excluded from the calculations;     their effect on the attainment of the

young is analyzed separately in table 5.     Because many of the young men in

the NLS were still enrolled in school in 1969, the year for which the analysis

was conducted, they could not report their final years completed.          The

attainment of these men was estimated by the number of years they "expected

to complete."    Experiments with other methods of estimC3.ting years completed,

ranging from limit±ng the sample to the out of school population to

assigning the enrolled their current years, were also made, with results
                                       16
similar to those given in the table.




     With respect to family background, what stands out in the table is

the differential effect of parental occupation on the attainment of blacks

and whites in the young male sample compared to its effect in the older

male sample.    Whereas among older men, the coefficients on parental

occupation, as well as on parental years of schooling, are smaller for

blacks, among the young, parental years of schooling has a       ~lal1er   effect

on blacks than on whites but parental occupation has a larger effect.            Given
                                                                       17


the differences in the coefficients on the two variables, it is necessary to

"average" the coefficients in some way to evaluate whether background factors

have a more or less powerful effect on young blacks than on young whites.         One

reasonable way to form such an average is to multiply the regression coeffi-

cien;s by their standard deviations in the sample, divide by the standard

deviation of years attained, and sum the resultant     B weights    to get the

effect of a standard deviation increase in each.      With this metric, family

background is estimated to have about the same effect on the years of

schooling of young blacks as on the years of young whites:         the one standard

deviation changes alter schooling by .46 standard deviations for whites
                                             17
versus .40 standard deviations for b1acks.

     The estimated coefficient on the region and size of place of residence

dummy variables also reveal striking changes between the younger and older

male samples, with the enormous deterrent effect of Southern and regional

locale on black schooling in the older male sample (-1.8 years for the

South and -1.6 years for rural residence versus the deleted groups)

dropping to 'insignificance among younger men (.13 years for Southern

residence and -.5 years for rural residence).      Among whites, there is a

smaller decline in the negative effect of Southern and rural residence

on years of schooling between the young male and older male samples.

Presumably because of the decline in the discriminatory allocation of

school resources in the rural South, the "burden" of Southern and rural

background was greatly reduced for blacks to be about the same for whites.

     Analysis of the converging effect of family background factors

on the years of schooling of blacks and whites between the time

when the younger men were educated and the time when the older men were

educated can be pursued by focusing on the effect of parental education

and occupation on what has become the "cutting edge" in investment in

education decisions, enrollment in college.       Accordingly, I estimated the
                                                                     18


effect of the family and regional background variables treated in table 4

model, P   = 1/(1- expESiX i ), where P = the probability of going to college and Xi
are the explanatory factors.      In this functional form, the effect of X.
                                                                            1

different changes in probabilities depending on the starting point.        The

advantage of this functional specification over the linear probability

model is that i t correctly bo:unds the estimated P between 0 and 1 and

takes account of the binomial structure of the errors.

     The results of the logistic curve estimation are summarized below in

terms of the coefficients and standard errors for the logistic curve

These calculations show little difference in the impact of parental years

of schooling or parental occupational attainment on the logistic curve parameters

for young blacks and for young whites but show that the parental occupation variable

has a much greater effect on older whites than on older blacks.      This confirms the

finding of a much smaller difference between the effect of background on black

and white attainment among vounger than among older men.

       Table 5 examines the effect of adding the 'household reading

resource' variables to the years of schooling regressions for the young

men.    Columns (1) and (3) record the coefficients on parental occupational

status and   p~'rental   years of schooling from table 4, while columns (2) and

(4) give the coefficient on those variables and on the presence of magazines

newspaper~ and   library cards.    The decline in the coefficients on parental

occupation and years of schooling upon addition of the new variables provides

some indication of the extent to which the traditional background variables

operate through provision of an environment with reading materials.

       The calculations show that the household reading resources significantly

influence educational attainment and are an      importa~t   intervening factor

in the link between family background and educational attainment.             The

coefficients on parental education are reduced by 2 to 3 standard errors and

the    coefficient~   on parental occupation are reduced by 1 to 2 standard

errors by addition of the new variables. Crude though the calculations

are, they suggest a potentially important role for provision of household

reading resources as a determinant of years attained and as a major

intervening variable in the usual       background-education relation.        They

direct attention to the absence of reading material in black homes (which

might be ameliorated by special school programs) as a likely casue of

differences in years attained among the young in the 1960s.


The Gap in Educational Attainment

        Despite the significant increase in black educational attainment in

the post-world war II period and the sharp influx of blacks into college

in the late 1960s (Freeman, 1977, chapter 2), a substantial difference in

years attained remains among the young in the NLS sample in 1969.             To

what extent do differences in schooling among the young reflect differences

 in family background?      Have background differences, which traditionally were

               Estimates of the contribution of family background differences to

    the difference in years of schooling of blacks and whites can be obtained

    by multiplying the estimated regression coefficients from tables 4 and 5

    important cause of black-white differences in years of schooling among

    young men than among older men, indicative of considerable change

      percentage contribution of the ithvariables is a.~x./ data in line 1.

     bYears of schooling differences have been adjusted for the effect of age by multi-
       plying the difference in the mean ages of blacks and whites by the coeff icient on
       age in the schooling equations. As age has a positive effect on years of schooling
     . in the equation for blacks but not in the equation for whites, this adjustment
       produces a smaller difference in the analysis based on the equations for blacks
       than in the analysis based on the equation for whites.
                                                                    24



to weight the different factors.   According to column 1 and 2, for example,

only 35% of the difference between the years of schooling of older black

men   and of older white men is attributable to family background factors

whereas 81% of the difference in years of schooling between younger

black and white men is attributable to family background factors.

This reflects in large part the increased effect of background

factors in the schooling attainment equation for blacks between the two

samples.

      In contrast to the increased importance of differences in family

background   factors as causes of differences in years of schooling, the

table shows sizeable reductions in the impact of differences in the

distribution of persons by geographic area between the two samples.      This

is largely due to the convergence in the coefficient on the geographic

variables between blacks and whites shown in table 4.

      Columns 3 and 6 of the table, based on regressions which include

"household reading resources" as explanatory   variable~   show that essentially

all of the difference in educational attainment between young black and white

men in 1969 can be attributed to family background factors.     Even with the

family resources excluded, 80+% of the difference is accounted for by back-

ground factors.   Similar findings are reported by Epstein using the National

Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972 and by Hauser and Featherman

in their analysis of the 1972 Occupational Change in a Generation data file.       For

young black men the disadvantages in family background have become the deterrent

to attainment of parity with whites in years of school completed.


Background and labor market attainment

      To analyze the effect of family and other background variables on the

labor market position of men, the three measures    ·)f market attainment

described earlier, hourly earnings, yearly earnings, and the median income
                                                                             25


of men in the individuals 3-digit occupation were regressed on the family,

regional and size of place variables used earlier and on years of work

experience.     For young men years of experience is calculated using a complex

algorithm designed to measure, as best as possible, actual time worked.                   For

older men, years of. experienc'e is measured by two variables:            years of tenure

 in a job and by age minus years of schooling minus 5.           Parental years of schooling

Years of schooling of the individual was first excluded from the regressions

 to obtain estimates of the full or reduced form impact of background factors

and then included as an additional measure of 'pre-labor market' determinants

of labor market position.       In the regressions for young men, those still

. enrolled in sclmol were deleted from the calculations.

      Table 7 summarizes the results in terms of the estimated coefficients

on   thel~of    the index of parental occupational standing.          It shows a marked

difference between the effect of parental occupation on the labor             ~qrket


position of young       blacks and whites compared to the effect of the

variable on the labor market position of older blacks and whites.                 Among

 the older men, the background variable has a much smaller and generally

negligible effect on the position of blacks compared to the position of whites.

This is consistent      with the traditional finding in the sociology literature

 (Duncan) that parental      status    has a more modest effect on the attainment

of blacks than on the attainment of whites.           Among younger men, by contrast,

 the coefficients on the background variable for blacks are sizeable and

 significant in all of the calculations.         In the hourly earnings regressions

 and in the occupational status regressions the coefficients in the black

 equations are roughly comparable in magnitude to the coefficients obtained

 in the equations for whites.         In the annual earnings regressions, however,

 the coefficient on black parental occupation is still noticeably smaller
                                                                        26



than the coefficient on white parental occupation.

    As there are no apparent life cycle changes in the effect of family
                                                        21
background factors on the attainment of individuals,         the' greater

coefficient on parental occupational variable obtained for young blacks

as opposed to those for older blacks would appear to reflect a trend over

time in social mobility patterns, with young black men from more advantaged

homes making greater economic advances in the job market than those from

less advantaged homes.   Presumably as a result of the decline in market

discrimination, the pattern of social mobility among blacks seems to have

converged towards that found among whites.    Since Duncan found little

activity and of sizeable black economic advance relative to whites.

In contrast to the past, when "stratification within the Negro population

(was) less severe than in the white" (Duncan, p. 88) what sociologists

call "intergenerational status transmission" has become quite similar for

young persons in the late 1960s.


Background vs. 'residual discrimination'

     Given that family background has become more important in black economic

attainment and that black/white economic differences have diminished,

differences in the background resources of blacks and whites can be expected

to explain a greater fraction of racial economic differences and "residual

market discrimination"   to explain a lesser fraction of the differences

than in the past.

aThe regressions include the following control variables: 3 dummy variables for
 region of residence at age 14; 5 dummy variables for type of place of residence
 at age 14; dummy variable for living in one parent/female home at age 14. These
 variables are described in table 4.
     In addition the regressions include measures of years of work experience:
 for younger men, years of experience is determined by algorithm based on weeks
 worked in each year since 1966 and on years since first post-school job;
 for older men, years of tenure with current employer and years since leaving
 school minus 5 are used to measure experience.
     Parental occupational status measured as the log of income in the parents'
 3-digit occupation as described in the text.

bThe sample sizes are: young black men, 634; young white men, 1607; older black
 men, 947; older white men, 2131. The samples are restricted to persons not
 enrolled in school in 1969 and reporting data for all of the variables in the
 regressions.

c Index of occupational status is measured by the log of the median income in the
  individuals' three-digit occupation in 1969, as reported in the u.S. Bureau of
  the Census, 1970 Census of Population, PC 2-7A Occupational Characteristics,
  tables 16 and 17.

differences in   la~or   market position using the procedure described on p.22--

that is, by multiplying differences in the mean value of the explanatory

variables by the regression coefficient estimate of its impact on attainment.

     The effect of differences in parental occupational position on

differences in labor market position are given in line 2 using the regression

coefficients from table 7.      The effect of differences in a "full" set of

pre-labor market variables--parental occupational position, region and

type of place, and of years of schooling--are given in line 3, using

coefficients obtained by including the person's years of schooling in

the regressions of table 7.      Line 4 estimates the extent of "residual"

discrimination, defined as the log differential not attributed to differ-

ences in the background variables and in schooling.      Columns 1-6 use

regression coefficients from attainment equations for blacks while

columns 7-12 use regression coefficients from attainment equations for

whites.

     What stands out in the table is the dominant role of pre-market factors

in accounting for black-white economic differentials among the young

compared to the modest role of these variables in explaining economic

differences among older men.      With the regression weights from the attainment

equations for blacks, differences in parental occupation account for 40%

of the difference in occupational attainment between young black and white

men, and account for 36% of the difference in hourly earnings, and 39%

of the difference in yearly earnings.      By comparison, differences in

parental occupational attainment make only a negligible contribution to

differences in the labor market position of older black and white men.

With the regression weights from the white attainment equations, the results

are less dramatic but similar.

      The calculations for the full set of pre-labor market factors show that,

 as expected, differences in these factors have become more important deterrents

 to the attainment of black/white economic parity among the young than residual
                                                                   29


market discrimination.   The black attainment equations attribute from 72%

to 88% of the differences among the young to differences in pre-labor market

factors.   The white attainment equations attribute from 71% to 111% of

the differences among the young to differences in pre-labor market factors.

By contrast, in the older male sample, with the attainment equations for

older black or for older white men, the contribution of background factors

to economic differences are noticeably lower.

     The final column of the table records the 'residual' difference in the

dependent variables which may be attributable to market discrimination.

It shows strikingly lower discriminatory differences between young blacks

and whites than between older blacks and whites, with virtually no differ-

entials among the young in occupational position or in weekly earnings.

Large discriminatory differentials do however remain in yearly earnings,

which highlights the importance of differences in time worked in causing

black/white economic differences among the young.

     We conclude that, while residual market discrimination has not dis-

appeared, the changing job market of the 1960s reduced the importance of

residual discrimination in economic inequality between young blacks and

whites and made disadvantages in pre-labor market factors, particularly

in family background resources, a more important cause of economic

inequality.   The decline in the importance of discriminatory differences

and heightened role of family background differences in racial economic

inequality raises a host of new questions for policy regarding black/white

economic differences.    What responsibility should the society take for

helping blacks to overcome long-run disadvantaged backgrounds?    Since part

of the background disadvantage of blacks results from past discrimination,

should they merit special compensatory    or redistributive programs?      If

the developments delineated in this section persist, these issues may

Come to the fore in the debate on how to eliminate economic differences

between blacks and whites.

     The figures adjusted for y.ears of experience differ between young blacks and young whites because of different

     are "below 23 years of age compared to 50% of whites in the sample. Another reason is that blacks experience more

 VI •. Why?

        What factors under1y the improvement in the relative economic position

of black workers found in this and in other studies?

        From the perspective of the basic economic ana1y&is of demand and supply,

the observed increases in the relative income and occupational status of blacks

could be due, ceterus paribus, either to      increased demand for black labor

relative to white labor or IDshifts in the supply of black labor relative to

white labor.

        On the demand side, the principal force likely to have increased demand

for black labor was the intense antibias activity which followed the Civil

Rights Act of 1964 and which caused significant changes in corporate recruitment

and personnel policies.     Prior to the Act, there was no federal law against

discrimination and no serious effort to increase minority or female employment

in sectors of severe underrepresentation.     Beginning in lfurch, 1965, the Equal

Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC), which was set up by 7it1e VII of the

Act, became increasingly active; EEOC expenditures rose from modest amounts to

$55 million dollars by 1975 while cases handled increased from about 9,000 in 1966

to 77,000 in 1975. /24    Following Executive Order 11246 the Office of Federal

Contract Compliance and related agencies exerted considerable pressure on    enter~

prises' to develop affirmative action programs to increase minority and female employ-
ment.   Most important, from the mid 1960s to the early 19708 federal courts interpreted

the law in ways     that tended to favor active equal employment and affirmative

action programs.     In the mid 1970s, however, a change in the tone of decisions

is evident./ 25    At the state level, the activities of state fair employment

practice commissions (FEPC) grew markedly, in part because of EEOC deferral of cases

to state agencies:     state FEPC expenditures grew from about $2 million in 1964
                                 26
to about $34 million in 1975./
                                                                                           32




             On   the supply side, two very different sets of factors have been 5ug-

gested as contributing to the improved economic status of blacks.                Some have

cited increases in the quality of schooling afforded blacks, which have been

immense over the long run, as causing the improvement in economic status (F.

Welch & J. Smith).        While there is no denying the long-term improvement in

the relative quality of black schooling (see Welch, Freeman 1974a), many have

argued that changes in quality of schooling have made only a modest contribution

to the post-1964 changes in black earnings (Polachek, Kneisser, Padilla 1978a,

1978b; Garfinkle; Padilla; Levin; Freeman 1977).               Others have hypothesized that

the gains in black economic status are the result of a decline in black labor

force participation rates allegedly due to expanded social programs, which
reduced the relative quantity of black labor and removed those with especially

low earnings from the work force (R. Butler & J. Heckman).                While there is

no denying the decline in black             parti~ipation   rates, the evidence does not

support the argument that welfare induced changes in the relative supply of

black labor caused relative earnings to rise.               On the one hand, because the

black population has increased more rapidly than the white population, the

ratio of nonwhite workers to white workers increased, rather than decreased

since    1964~lr which     would reduce rather than increase relative earnings by

causing a"movementdown rather up the demand curve.                On the other hand, there

is no evidence that the lower tail of the black earnings distribution               diminished~~
as would be expected if the earnings increase were due to withdrawal of low

earners and no evidence that labor force withdrawal is closely linked to expan-

        This section shows that the evidence on the timing and incidence of gains,

while not ruling out potentially important supply side effects, is consistent

with an explanation of black economic gains post-1964 that stresses the role
                                                                               33



of national antibias activity in raising the demand for black labor.    Because

of the problems in interpreting limited time series, which underlies contro-

versies over the causal forces at work, the section also reviews evidence on the

effect of the law on c0mpany personnel and employment practices.    This evidence

makes it difficult to gainsay the impact of federal equal opportunity and

affirmative action pressures on employer behavior.



Evidence on Timing

        Since the national antibias effort was initiated following passage of

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a sine qua non for any case to be made

re~arding   the impact of that effort is that increases in the ratio of black to

white economic position be greater post-1964 than prior to 1964.    While such a

pattern was found in tables 1 and 2, the post-1964 acceleration in black economic

gains could be only weakly statistically related to the antibias activity or due

to other correlated patterns of change that commenced in the mid 1960s.     To see
whether there is, in fact, a statistically significant post-1964 improvement

in the relative economic position of blacks which could be attributed to changes

in demand or whether the post-1964 changes are due to other measurable factors,

measures of the relative economic position of blacks were regressed on an indi-

cator of federal antibias activity and several other factors that might cause

the relative economic position of blacks to improve.    The dependent variables,

measured in logarithmic form, are:    the median wage and salary earnings of

nonwhite workers relative to white workers from 1948 to 1975; the

median wage and salary earnings of nonwhite workers employed full-time year-round

to the earnings of comparable white workers from 1955 to 1975; the ratio of

the    fixed weight index of the occupational position of nonwhite workers to the

index for white workers from 1958 to 1975.
          The explanatory variables are:

          TREND, a time trend which takes the value 1 in the first year of the

regression and increases by one unit in each succeeding year.        This variable

is designed to control for overall trends in the relative earnings of nonwhites.

          CYCLE, a business cycle indicator which is obtained as the deviation of

the log of real gross national product from its trend level.

          EEO, real cumulated expenditures by the equal employment opportunity

 agency per nonwhite worker, measured in        log units, with the value 1 used for

 the period prior to   th~   Civil Rights Act of 1964 and as cumulated real spending
                                         /3f)
 per nonwhite plus 1 in later periods. This variable is essentially a post-19.64

 trend variable, which has the value 0 until 1965, when the Act became effective

 and which trends upward thereafter.       It is to be viewed as an indicator of the

 shift in demand for the period and not as a measure of the effectiveness of

 the EEOC or of any specific governmental activity.        If in the fu.ture    the ?attern

of demand changed due, say, to court rulings reducing the efficacy of the affir~

mative action effort, a more complex variable would be required.

          RED, the ratio of the median years of schooling of nonwhite workers to the

median years of schooling of white workers, entered to control for the increased

educational attainment of nonwhite relative to white workers.       Because this

variable has a very strong trend, however, its effect cannot be readily

distinguished from the trend.     It is entered only in a limited number of equations.

          REMF, the log of the ratio of nonwhite employment to white employment,

which is designed to test for the possibility that changes in relative earnings

are due to movements along a relative demand schedule as a result of shifts in

estimated by instrumental variables, with the following instruments:           the ratio

of Dependent Children (AFDC) payments and unemployment compensation.

        RPART, the log of the ratio of the nonwhite participation rate to the

White participation rate.   This variable is entered to test the possibility that

the reduction of the ratio of nonwhite to white participation rates raised the

ratio of nonwhite earnings relative to white earnings by removing nonwhites with

low earnings from the work fotce.   Since relative participation rates are endo-

genous, the effect is estimated by instrumental variables, with the two social

welfare program measures used as instruments.

        Regressions for men are given at the left hand side of the table while

regressions for women are presented at the right hand side.     All of the variables

except the relative employment and participation rates are the same for the two

groups; those variables relate to men or women, respectively.

        Lines 1-3 record the results of least squares regressions of the three

measures of relative economic position on TIME, CYCLE and EEO.     If the post-1964

changes in the relative economic position of blacks were due to past trends or

cyclical changes rather than to post-1964 antibias activity, the coefficient on

the EEO variable would be insignificant while the other variables would dominate

the calculations.   If, by contrast, post-l964 changes in the relative economic

position of blacks were in fact due to post-1964 antibias activity the coefficient

on the EEO variable would be significant and positive.

        The regressions comparing the economic position of nonwhite men to that
of white men accord the EEO indicator a positive significant coefficient in each

case.   The regressions comparing the economic position of nonwhite to white women

tell a similar story for women, with the EEO variable obtaining a highlv

significant coefficient on the median wages and salaries of all workers and

on the index of occupational position but a much smaller and less significant coeffi-

cient in the regression for the year-round and full-tfme workers.      Recause the
                                                                           36



ratio of the earnings of nonwhite women working year-round and full-time

to the earnings of white women working year-round and full-time became

relatively high in the 1960s, the small estimated effect of EEO on year-

round and full-time relative earnings could result from the particular

functional form used, which requires that the EEa variable (and other

variables) have the same effect on relative earnings even when the potential

asymptote of equality is approached.   An alternative more appropriate func-

tional form when earnings ratios approach 1. 00 is the logistic or log odds

ratio, which allows for differential effects of variables depending on the

level of the nonwhite-white differential.   Regressing the log odds ratio of

nonwhite to white earnings of year-round and full-time women on the indepen-

dent variables yields:


        Log~odds ratio of Nedian Hages & Salaries
        of Year-Round and Full-Time Homen, = -.11 + .036TIME - 9.34CYCLE + .61 EEO

With the logit specification, the t-statistic on the EEO variable is 5.0, compared

to the value of 2.2 in line 2.   The reason for the increased significance of the

EEO variable is that the logit form requires, all else the same, slackened growth

in the rat;io of earnings as it rises toward unity and "attributes" the continued

increase in the ratio in the 1970s to the EED variable.      Comparable   regres~ions


with log odds-ratio of other dependent variables show that the logit form

generally yields stronger results on the EEO variable, presumably for the

same reasons.

        An additional experiment is to compare, as some civil rights activists

have suggested, the position of nonwhite women to that of white men rather than

to another group protected by the law, white women.   Regressions of log (earnings ,

of nonwhite women/earnings of white men) on EEO, TIME and CYCLE, as in lines 1
                                                                             37

and 2 of table 9, yield the following regression coefficients and standard

errors on EEO: for median wages and salaries, .16(.02); for median salaries

of year-round and full-time workers, .07(.02).

          The possible effect of changes in relative supplies due to expanded social

welfare programs on relative earnings is estimated in lines 4-7, using two stage
                                                                      /31
 least square regressions, along lines set out by Butler & Heckman.--             Lines 4

 and 6   examine the effect of the relative employment of nonwhite workers (REMP)

 on relative earnings.   If the increased    relative earnings of   blac~s   is due largely

to movements up a demand curve due to expanded welfare programs rather than to

increased demand for black labor post 1964, the relative employment measure should

obtain a negative coefficient in the regressions and "knock out" the EEO indicator.

Lines 5 and 7 examine the effect of the ratio of nonwhite to white participation

rates (RPART) on relative earnings.   If the main reason for increased median

earnings of blacks was the removal of low wage earners from the working population,

the relative participation variable would obtain a negative coefficient in the

regression and "knock out" the EEO indicator.     All of the calculations include

the ratio of nonwhite to white median years of education to make sure that the

changes under study are not due to increased demand for black labor due to in-

creased education.   The effects of relative employment and relative participation

rates are estimated, as noted previously, by instrumental variables.         Given the

limited variation in the time series, however, there is good reason to be leary of

the regression estimates, as they are making great demands on weak data.

          The resultant calculations for male workers tend to support the demand-

 shift hypothesis and to reject the supply-shift explanation of improvements in

 the ratio of black to white .earnings.     In all of the calculations the EEO variable

 obtains a positive sign while     the coefficients on relative employment or

 participation have insignificant positive signs in three of four cases and an

 insignificant negative sign in one case.      Relative years of schooling, which
                                                                            38



trends upward over time, has an insignificant positive or negative coefficient

in the regressions.   The positive signs on REMP or RPART in 3 of 4 cases does

not, of course, mean that either the labor demand curve is wrongly shaped nor

that low wage workers were not withdrawing from the labor force, but rather that

these factors have too weak an effect in the time series to be discerned.        The

data reject the model based on supply shifts.

         For women, the    pic~ure   is more complex.   With relative median wages and

salaries as the dependent variable in lines 4 and 5, we find that relative em-

ployment has a positive coefficient while the relative participation rates ob-

tain a negative insignificant coefficient, which again rejects the supply shift

story.   By contrast, the coefficient on the EEO variable remains sizeable and

significant.   When the relative median wages and salaries of year-round and

full-time workers is the dependent variable, however, results are mixed:         the

relative employment variable obtains the expected negative coefficient and "knocks

out" the EEO variable, while the relative participation varible obtains a positive
                                                                    \

sign and does not remove a significant EEO effect.        Since the ratio of the earnings

of year-round and full-time workers is close to unity, however, the result on the

relative employment term could reflect improper functional form.        Regressing

the logit of relative earnings of year-round and full-time workers on the

variables in line 6 yields a positive coefficient on EEO and a positive

coefficient on REMP. /32

         All told, with the exception of the regression for females in line 6

the calculations show that the supply side factors neither explain the post-

1964 gains nor eliminate the indicator of post-1964 equal employment activity

        The time series data in table 9 can, it should be stressed, be analyzed

in other ways.     In earlier work Vroman and Masters used simple post-1964    trend

variables to pick up the presumed shift in demand for black labor following the

initiation of EEO activity and obtained positive coefficients on their post-l96 1+

variable.   Similar results in the post-1964 trend can be obtained using the data

underlying table 9.     Since the EEO indicator is   essentially a post-1964 trend,

results with the trend measure must, of necessity, give similar statistical

                 Burstein has developed a more complex model, including measures of

changes in taste, and found that his additional variables also left a sizeable

positive coefficient     to a measure of post-1964 EEO activity.

        While it is still possible that some unmeasured factor that changed sharply

after 1964 is, in fact, the true causal force, it is difficult to say what that

other factor might be.     In the absence of contrary evidence, the data appear

consistent with a demand side explanation of black economic gains post 1964.       As

the time series really consists of only a single fact, namely that black economic

gains were more rapid after 1964 when serious federal antibias activity commenced

than before 1964, however, other types of evidence should also be examined to

minimize the chances of misinterpreting the causes of observed changes.


Evidence on regional incomes

         Because time series changes in the ratio of nonwhite to white incomes

by region have occasionally been viewed as running counter to a demand-shift

explanation of black economic progress post 1964, it is of some value to examine

regional patterns of change.     While the regional evidence is not one-sided,

 smaller positive coefficients in the Northeast and North Central areas.     The

 data for the West (where less than 10 percent of blacks are locate~ run counter

 to the demand hypothesis.

          For women, the picture is quite different, though for an interesting reason.

 In the South, the calculations for the median incomes of all women yield a large

 significant positive EEO coefficient, but in the Northeast, North Central and West,

 the coefficients on the EEO variable for earnings are negative.     In each of these

 regions, however, the ratio of nonwhite to white median incomes     for women exceeded

 unity long before 1964:     the ratio exceeded unity in 1956 in the Northeast;

-in 1959 in the North Central; and in 1961 in the West.     As measured by these data,

 there was no nonwhite-white income      inequality among women to be remedied by EEO,

 and thus no reason to expect a positive coefficient on the variable.     For the two

regions where sufficient data exist on the incomes of year-round and full-time

workers to merit investigation, the South and the Northeast, the EEO'variab1e

obtains   a significant positive coefficient.    The rejection of the demand hypothesis

when the nonwhite/white income ratic     exceeds unity and "acceptance" of the

hypothesis when the nonwhite/white income ratio is below unity, and the strong

EEO effects in the South where discrimination has been most severe, lends additional

support to the hypothesis.     These results suggest that the positive coefficients

on EEO do in fact reflect declines in discrimination rather than some correlated

general shift in demand for black labor.



 Evidence on Incidence

          One additional type of evidence which can be used to evaluate alternative

 explanations of the post-1964 economic gains of blacks is information on which

 groups of black workers made the most significant progress.     The analysis in

 this and in other studies indicates that the largest relative economic gains
44
                                                                                   45



which make them more adept at responding to new opportunities than those from

less advantaged homes.

        Since the number of young and educated or skilled black workers has

increased in the period under study, it is difficult to explain the incidence

of economic gains in terms of an autonomous decline in supply.        Improvements

in the quality of black schooling, on the other hand, may have played a role

in the rate of advance.       Among college students, for example, the increased

opportunities for young blacks in the higher educational system and in the

job market led many to enroll in primarily white national coileges and uni-

versities, as opposed to the traditional black college of the South.         Since

the national institutions offer higher quality education than the primarily

black colleges, there was undoubtably an improvement in the quality of black

college graduates in the period.        This improvement was in large part induced

by the same civil rights and antibias activities as the changes in the job

market and should not be viewed as an autonomous development (Freeman, 1977, chapter 3).



Evidence from Personnel Departments and Studies of Company Employment

        The most telling evidence on the effect of antibias activities on'demand

for black labor and thus on black economic progress post-1964 comes from studies
                 ~




of the personnel and employment practices of individual companies.        Such evidence

is critical in evaluating the role of demand forces in black economic progress post-

1964 for two reasons.        First, because the appropriate statistical materials, while

useful, do not       py themselves provide information on the actual activities of
employers, and thus permit alternative interpretations, as evidenced in the

controversy over causality.       Second, because in the absence of widespread changes
                                                                                      46



in company personnel practices, it is difficult to see how antidiscrimination

policies could cause sizeable aggregative effects, given the small number of

workers likely to benefit in specific antidiscrimination cases.

        The evidence that personnel policies have, in fact, been greatly

altered by federal equal employment opportunity and affirmative action pressures

is overwhelming.      In the market for young college graduates there was a remarkable

upsurge in corporate recruitment visits to the traditionally black college of

the South, with accompanying hiring of graduates whose previous opportunities

were limited to segregated professional services, especially teaching.           In

1960 almost no firms recruited from the traditionally black Southern colleges;

in 1965 a sampling of colleges averaged 50 recruitees per school; in 1970, they

averaged 277 recruitees (Freeman     1977~    p. 35).   A recent Bureau of National Affairs

survey of personnel and industrial relations executives documents the far-reaching

impact of the federal equal employment pressures on corporate labor market behavior.

According to the B.N.A., "Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Programs complete with

Affirmative Action Plans (AAP) are viewed as 'a fact of life' by nearly all employers,

and the personnel 'function has changed in a variety of ways as a result of the

government's efforts to enforce the employment provisions of the act" (p. 1).              As

table 10 documents, in the BNA sample eighty-six percent of the companies have formal

EEO programs; 96 percent of those subject to OFCP regulations have AAP's; 63 percent

have been investigated under Title VII.         Most of the firms in the survey report

changing their selection procedures (line 3) and introducing special recruiting

programs (line   4)   for minority workers.     One third of the companies have made EEO

achievements a criterion in performance appraisals of managers while many also ini-

tiated special training programs.      The attention given by personnel officials to the

"Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (1978)" and its predecessor

guidelines; the weekly publication of a Fair Employment Practices newsletter;

the creation of the Equal Employment Advisory Council to advise businesses

about equal employment issues, and diverse other activities         make it clear

that governmental EEO and AAP pressures have revolutionized personnel and

employment selection practices.     Unless company personnel policies are totally

ineffective or a complete sham, there would appear to be a substantial upward

shift in demand for black labor as a result of these changes.         This type of

evidence provides a strong prior for evaluating aggregate data on black economic

progress.

           Studies of the effect of federal contract compliance pressures on emp1oy-

ment of blacks by individual companies also yield results consistent with the

demand-shift hypothesis.     In the earliest such study,   o.   Ashenfelter and J.

Heckman estimated that the federal pressures raised black male employment in

specific companies by 12.9 percent.     G. Burman, using different modelling pro-

cedures, estimated that OFCC pressure caused an increase in black employment in com-

panies of 5.6 percent.     Later work by J. Heckman and K. Wo1pin estimated that

the federal pressures raised black male employment in specific companies by 10.4

percent.    Only the study.by R. Goldstein and R. Smith did not find such effects.

Since none of the studies allow for "spillover" effects, by which one company's

policies are altered as a result of pressures on a neighboring enterprise, nor

for the effects of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, or of Fair

Employment Practices commissions, nor of court cases, these figures are likely to

understate the full effects of the changes induced by such pressures.
as can be told from the data, if Title VII were repealed and equal employment

efforts ended, the rate 0f black advancement would fall.



IV.   Conclusion

        The improvement in the relative economic position of blacks documented

here and in other papers does not mean that sizeable gains have been obtained

along all dimensions of economic well-being nor that black/white economic dif-

ferences are likely to disappear in the future .

        For one, the relative economic position of the black family did not

improve as rapidly as that of individual earners, in large part because of

the continued increase in the relative number of female headed homes.

         Second, the enormous pre-labor market disadvantage of blacks -- the

burden of coming from families and neighborhoods of low socio-economic con-

ditions which fail to provide the background resources that facilitate economic

success -- remains.   In the 1970s black youngsters trail whites greatly in a

wide variety of background resources which discrimination aside, can be expected

to produce black/white labor market differences ranging from 10 to 20 percent.

These differences cannot, by their nature, be eliminated by antibias policy in

the labor market and promise continued racial income inequalities into the

foreseeable future.

        Third, large groups of black workers, notably experienced men, have

benefitted only modestly from the decline in job market discrimination.

Because many "male occupations" require considerable investment in skill and

cumulated experience and often have lengthy formal seniority promotion ladders,

these men face the problem not simply of equal opportunity today but making

up the deficit of education and work skills of the past.   Perhaps most striking,

the labor force participation rate of experienced black men has declined sharply,

perhaps as a result of the growth in female-headed families among blacks, and of
                                                                              50




Social Security Disability Insurance and related welfare programs.      Whatever

the causal connections, the fact is that the job market position of a large

group of black workers has been only modestly improved by reducing market dis-

crimination.

         Fourth, the initial gains for young blacks in the period may dissipate

over time, if discrimination in promotions reduces their advance in corporate

hierarchies.     While present values of lifetime income would still be higher than

in the past, the extent of the gains would be less striking than if young blacks

maintain their relatively strong starting position compared to young whites.

         Fifth, unemployment remains a much more serious problem in the black

than in the white community, particularly among younger persons.

         The common thread running through most of the problem areas -- family

income   a~d   composition, the burden of poor backgrounds, and the lack of sharp

progress among older black male workers -- is that simply ending job market

discrimination and guaranteeing equal employment opportunity has not and is

unlikely to achieve black-white parity.      Other programs or activities (private

as well or instead of public) are needed.

                 The best tests of discrimination would be in areas where individual

productivity is measurable, such as athletics.            The "productivity" of academic

faculty can be at least crudely measured by numbers of publications, as in

Freeman (1977, chapter 8).

             3
                 Some of the published data refers to nonwhites.   As about 90 percent

of nonwhites are black, it is legitimate to use data on nonwhites to make in-

ferences about the position of blacks.            In the text I use the term black except

where data specifically refer to nonwhites.

             4
              With an asymptote of unity, the ratio of the earnings of black workers

to the earnings of white workers might be fit bya logistic growth curve:

                   R   =   1/(1 - exp at)

where R = ratio of earnings

         t   =    time, to measure 'trend over time

         a = logistic curve parameter

With this functional form, dR/dt = aR(l - R) so that dR/dt falls as R approaches

unity.

             5
                 1964 is chosen as the year in which to break the data because        the

Civil Rights of 1964, which made discrimination in employment on the basis of

race illegal, became effective on March 1, 1965.            Hence 1964 is the

appropriate year for estimating before/after effects.
                                                                                52



          6
              If young blacks made less investments in the on-the-job training

relative to young whites, than in the past, black gains in incomes would be

overstated.      ~onversely,   if young blacks made greater investments in on-the-

job training relative to young whites than in the         past~   black gains would be   underst~ted.

          7
           The ratios are termed approximate because the published survey data

are based on small samples.

          8
              For a detailed discussion of the survey, see    u.s.   Department of Labor

(1970).

          9
              The finding that family background factors do not greatly affect the

socioeconomic position of blacks was first developed by Duncan, who used data

for 1962, a year just preceding the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and thus providing

valuable "before" data for before/after analyses.

          10
               The NLS does have direct questions on rates of pay but on examination

of these data suggested that except for hourly workers there were considerable

reporting problems.       Hence the Meekly earnings data were used.

          11
               In the younger male NLS   sa~ple   the questions relating to background

refer to the position of the individual at age 14.           In the older male NLS sample

the questions refer to the position of the individual at age 15.            For heuristic

purposes,I refer to the position of persons at age 14 throughout the text, al-

though the older male data relate to age 15.

          12
               In one parent/female homes, a potential problem with the use of the

median income of men is that male incomes are unlikely to be a good measure of

the economic position of the family.         To deal with this, the interaction between

the measure of occupational attainment of the head of the household and the dummy
                                                                             53



variable for one parent/female homes was added to some calculations, but the

interaction variable obtained small and insignificant coefficients suggesting

that a dummy variable for the one parent/female home suffices to measure the

differences in resources between those homes and homes with two parents.          For

example, in the equations for years of schooling the interaction variables

obtain a coefficient and standard error of -.19(.31) for whites and .09(.43)

for blacks.     The results in the text exclude the interaction variable.

         13
              The difference in the parental occupation of youn g blacks and of young

whites obtained from using the median income of nonwhites for blacks and the

median wage of all men for whites     i~   0.8 In points.   The differences in the

 parental occupation of young blacks and of young whites obtained from using the

 median income of all men for both groups is about half as large.

         14
              The region of residence at age 14 was not reported in the young male

 sample and was inferred from region where the individual went to high school

 or   (for those nor reporting region of high school attendance) current residence.

         15
              The differences in these background variables in the older male NLS

 were also sizeable.     Among older men, the parents of blacks has 5.1 years of

 schooling compared to 7.8 for the parents of whites; the log of the occupational

 status was 7.2 for blacks compared to 8.3 for whites; 39 percent of the blacks

 were brought up in houses without a male head compared to 19 percent of the whites.

         16
              For example, the effect of the parental occupation index on the years

 completed by persons out of school was .48 for young whites and .80 for young

 blacks, which are comparable figures to those in table 4.

         17
              If we.take account of the greater impact of the one parent /female

 home on whites than on blacks the difference is increased marginally.

         18
              These calculations use the same median income measures as in table 4.
                                                                                54




        19
             The algorithm adds weeks worked in a year/52 to an initial estimate

of yeats of experience obtained from data on year of first post-school job.

        20
             The problem of potential sample selection problems due to inclusion or

exclusion of persons not reporting parental education is discussed in detail in

Freeman (1976), where all calculations are estimated on two samples, one excluding

those not reporting parental education, and one including those not so reporting.

           21
             Duncan, Featherman, and Duncan obtain roughly similar parental regres-

sion coefficients for the link between occupational status of the first job and

(OCG) surveys of 1962 and 1973 also reveals no clear patterns of change in the

impact of father's or son's occupation by age groups.

           22
             The Hauser-Featherman analysis of the OCG surveys yields results con-

sistent with a change over time interpretation of the NLS cohort differences:

their analysis shows essentially no effect of parental occupation on son's

occupation among 25-34 year old blacks in 1962 compared to a sizeable effect in

1973,.much like that for nonblacks.

           23
             If differences in background variables had become smaller over time,

background might not become a more important contribution to racial economic

inequality.     In fact, comparison of the differences in   backgro~nd   measures

among young men reported on p. 16 with those among older men reported in foot-

note 14 shows no such decline.

               The changed attitude of courts toward affirmative action is evinced

in several successful reverse discrimination suits by those injured by affirmative

action.        The Weber case currently before the Supreme Court represents the most

important such suit.

                Specifically, one might expect a decline in the lower tail of the wage

and salary distribution if large numbers of flow wage earners left the job market.

In fact, no such pattern is observed, at least from 1968, when the Current Popula-

tion Survey published the distributions, to 1974.        Among black men, for example,

the ratio of the lower quintile of the wage and salary distribution to the median

was .28 in 1968 when the labor participation rate was .78 and was .28 in 1974

when the participation rate was .73.        The data are from:     U.S. Bureau of the

      30This is a better measure than the compaxab1,e yar;i.ab:I,e u~ed 1:.11 my 1,973

Brookings Paper.     In that paper I failed to note that the ratio of expenditures

to numbers of nonwhites was below unity in the first two years after passage of

Title VII, which in log form produces· a negative value for the variable.                  This biases

.results against finding a positive EEO effect.           It    should be stressed that the

cumulated EEO variable is roughly comparable to a trend variable beginning in 1965.

      31
           These results differ greatly from those reported by Butler & Heckman,

who performed identical regressions over slightly different years to those in

lines 5 and 7.     The reason for the differences is that Butler and Heckman inad-

vertently used data with numerous keypunch errors.              I want to thank them

for providing me with the data and helping to obtain a corrected set of data.

      33
           Related regressions for median incomes, which depend on non labor market

earnings as well as on wages and salaries yield roughly comparable results, with

most but not all of the calculations giving large positive coefficients on the EEO

variable and insignificant positive or negative coefficients on the relative supply
                                                                             57



variables.   The logit form generally yields higher EEO effects.    Related regressions

using other measures of EEO activity also yield comparable results.      See Freeman

(1978).   Also Burstein (1978).

      34It is also possible that the passage of the Civil Rights Act caused a

once-and-for-a11 increase in the relative earnings of blacks.      If this were the

case, a dummy variable that takes the value 1 in 1965 (or 1964) and each year

thereafter would capture the effect.   Addition of such a dummy variable tO,the

regressions does not support the hypothesis of aonce-and-for-a11 jump in

relative black earnings.
