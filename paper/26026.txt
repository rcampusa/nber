                                        ABSTRACT

We compare risk sharing in response to demand and supply shocks in four types of currency
unions: segmented markets; a banking union; a capital market union; and complete financial
markets. We show that a banking union is efficient at sharing all domestic demand shocks
(deleveraging, fiscal consolidation), while a capital market union is necessary to share supply
shocks (productivity and quality shocks). Using a calibrated model we provide evidence of
substantial welfare gains from a banking union and, in the presence of supply shocks, from a
capital market union.

   Failures of risk sharing lie at the heart of many economic crises, including the one that recently


threatened the survival of the Eurozone.    A comparison of macro-economic dynamics in Europe to


those of the United States reveals the importance of risk sharing. Private leverage cycles are volatile


and heterogeneous across U.S. states, just as they are volatile and heterogenous across E.U. countries.


They aect output and employment in similar ways. In Europe, however, private leverage cycles are


amplied by sudden stops and spreads in funding costs between countries. As the spreads widen, the


weaker countries sink deeper into recession. These are clear signs of inecient risk sharing.


   The creation of a banking union is a deliberate response to these issues. Focusing on banks is a


natural step because banks intermediate most of European nancial ows. The funding cost of banks


has a direct impact on the credit conditions of households and rms. The main purpose of the banking


union is to guarantee that funding conditions remain the same across regions within Europe, and in


particular that they are not directly aected by domestic sovereign risk. There is broad agreement


that some form of banking union is necessary to ensure the stability of the currency union, even as


disagreement persists about its required features, such as deposit insurance, bail-ins, and the funding


of resolution.


   A capital market union, on the other hand, can improve risk sharing via nancial markets - i.e.,


equity and xed income ows apart from cross-border bank ows. There is no agreement, and little


academic analysis, of the gains from adding a capital market union to a banking union. This raises


two questions that we aim to answer in this paper. First, what are the gains from building a banking


union? Second, are there additional gains from building a capital market union in addition to a banking


union?


   We model a currency union with nominal (wage) rigidities under four degrees of nancial integra-


tion: (i) segmented markets as observed during the Eurozone crisis; (ii) a banking union where funding


costs are equalized across regions; (iii) a capital market union with optimal cross-border equity hold-


ings; and (iv) a complete markets economy. We then ask how these four model economies respond to


two types of shocks: domestic-demand shocks (triggered by public or private deleveraging) and other


shocks (TFP shocks, quality shocks, and foreign demand shocks).


   We take a resolutely macro-economic perspective on what constitute a banking union and capital


market union. We study the consequences of an    ideal   banking union. In our model, a banking union is


an institution that guarantees that (risk-adjusted) private funding costs remain the same in all regions


irrespective of the shocks that hit these regions. In an ideal banking union private funding costs depend




                                                   2
neither on the health of the domestic sovereign  a no-doom-loop condition  nor on the health of local


banks  a no-sudden-stop condition.            It is important to understand that this assumption captures


precisely the stated policy goals of the banking union. It is, in fact, the           denition     of an ideal banking


union that local banking conditions do not matter. This is not as counter-intuitive as it sounds: it is


just like saying that the details of nancial intermediaries are not necessary to compute the complete


market allocation.      Similarly, we can study the macro-economic gains from an ideal banking union


without actually modeling the banks.            Modeling banks explicitly would of course be required if we


wanted to estimate the relative importance of various features of an                 imperfect   banking union.       We


would then need to take a stand on the details of deposit insurance (EDIS), the funding of resolution


(MREL, TLAC, ESM back-up, required bail-in ratios), the composition of sovereign exposures in


banks' portfolios (which are strongly time-varying), the implicit guarantees on retail products sold by


banks (a rst order issue in Italy), and the capital requirements for sovereign exposures (a new and


complicated debate).
                         1   These are issues of rst order importance for the design of a banking union,


but they are not necessary to answer the questions we have posed, and they would obscure the key


macroeconomic insights.


    We model a capital market union as a market structure that allows frictionless sharing of risk to the


market value of private capital. In our model claims to the value of capital most closely resemble traded


corporate equity.     In reality, the trading of private credit instruments (corporate bonds, securitized


loans, etc) plays a crucial role in most proposals related to the capital market union.                     Just like in


the case of an ideal banking union, however, we can study an ideal capital market union without


taking a stand on the details of risky debt versus equity. The key point is that negative shocks cause


equity and risky debt to fall in value. We could allow our rms to issue debt and equity, or we could


repackage their claims, without changing our macro-economic insights. In other words, we can assume


a form of Modigliani-Miller theorem Modigliani and Miller (1958) at the rm level and study the


macroeconomic consequences of risk sharing across countries. Finally, it is important to note that we


consider a particular denition of complete markets: each country in the currency union is populated


by borrowers and savers. Our borrowers are subject to credit constraints, and by complete markets


we mean that the marginal utilities of consumption of            savers   are equalized across borders.


    We then ask whether such a banking union or a capital market union can replicate a complete


markets economy, and we show that the answer depends on the types of shocks under consideration.

                                    Table 1: Summary of Results



We nd that a banking union is enough to deal with leveraging/deleveraging shocks, both public and


private. However, a capital market union is necessary to attain (or approximate) the complete markets


outcome when there are supply shocks.


   For deleveraging shocks we nd that the banking union provides the same level of risk sharing as


a complete markets economy. Deleveraging has real consequences: it creates an aggregate drag on the


economy, and it aects output and employment. One of our main ndings is that borrowing and lending


across regions allows an ecient sharing of the burden of adjustment created by the deleveraging. This


result is based on a surprising symmetry in the demand eects induced by deleveraging. In our model,


deleveraging initially lowers the labor income of savers. However, the lower debt burden of borrowers


leads to higher demand in the future, which increases the future income of savers. These two eects


exactly oset each other so that neither the net present value of savers income nor their consumption


expenditure changes as long as funding costs remain equalized.


   We nd that a capital market union is necessary for the ecient sharing of other shocks (supply


shocks). These shocks have a rst order eect on market values of assets and can only be shared with


cross-border claims on private capital. This also underscores the limitations of a banking union: even a


perfect banking union cannot share supply shocks. Moreover, we also show numerically that part of the


welfare gains of a CMU are not properly internalized because of aggregate demand externalities induced


by nominal rigidities similar to those in Farhi and Werning (2017), but also because of pecuniary


externalities. Greater risk sharing by savers stabilizes the economy and implies welfare gains also for


borrowers. Table 1 summarizes our results.


   Existing papers in international macroeconomics, such as those in the sudden stop literature (e.g.,


Mendoza and Smith (2006)), focus on modeling net foreign ows.           Our two agent setting instead


accounts for both domestic and external credit ows.        This also allows us to study how borrower


specic deleveraging shocks aect the behavior of savers. Our paper is a step forward in extending the


borrower-saver model and, more generally, two agent New Keynesian models (TANK) (see e.g. Bilbiie




                                                   4
(2008)) to an open-economy framework.


   Finally, while our baseline model assumes a xed stock of capital, in an extension we include in-


vestment and capital accumulation. After estimating the model, we nd that it does a good job in


describing the key data moments. We use this extended model to quantitatively evaluate the welfare


benets of a banking and capital market union. We nd that a banking union clearly lowers consump-


tion volatility, especially during a crisis period.   A capital market union can also bring substantial


welfare benets through more ecient allocation of ownership of capital.




Related Literature      Our paper is related to several lines of research in international macroeconomics


as well as studies of the causes and consequences of the Eurozone crisis.     Cole and Obstfeld (1991)


analyze a two-country, two-good endowment economy with exible prices and show that adjustments


to the terms of trade provide insurance against country specic shocks. Heathcote and Perri (2002)


analyze production economies and nd that models with asset market segmentations match cross-


country correlations better than the complete markets model. Kehoe and Perri (2002) endogenize the


incompleteness of markets by introducing enforcement constraints that require each country to prefer


the allocation it receives by honoring its liabilities rather than living in autarky from any given time


onward.


   Obstfeld and Rogo (1995) introduce nominal rigidities in the style of New Keynesian business cycle


models into the open economy framework. Ghironi (2006) provides a discussion of this literature and


emphasizes the diculties in modeling market incompleteness. Gali and Monacelli (2008) circumvent


the issue by assuming complete asset markets. This is also the approach followed by Blanchard et al.


(2014) who model the Eurozone as a two-country (core and periphery) model.


   There is a large literature on risk sharing in currency unions. Bayoumi and Masson (1995) discuss


the issue of risk sharing and scal transfer before the creation of the Euro, and Asdrubali et al. (1996)


provide evidence for the US. The Eurozone crisis spurred interest in this topic. Lane (2012) provides


a detailed account of the principal drivers of the Eurozone crisis; the specic role of the boom/bust


cycle in capital ows is analyzed by Lane (2013) and Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012). Martin and


Philippon (2017) provide a framework and an identication strategy to study the Eurozone crisis. They


decompose each country's dynamics into three components: private leverage cycles, sovereign risks, and


sudden stops/banking crises. They nd that credit spreads play an important role in exacerbating the


Eurozone crisis. We extend their analysis to study spillovers across countries, by modeling aggregate


demand spillovers and monetary policy, and to analyze the desirability of capital market integration



                                                      5
within a currency union. Bolton and Jeanne (2011) analyze the transmission of sovereign debt crises


through the banking systems of nancially integrated economies. Hepp and von Hagen (2013) provide


evidence from Germany. Allard and Brooks (2013) summarize the existing evidence. Schmitt-Grohe


and Uribe (2013) emphasize the role of downward wage rigidity. Farhi and Werning (2017) analyze


risk sharing in a currency union in a model with nominal rigidities. They show that xed exchange


rates increase the value of risk sharing and that complete markets do not lead to constrained ecient


risk sharing. Using a similar model, Auray and Eyquem (2014) argue that complete markets can lead


to lower welfare than nancial autarky. Homann et al. (2018) nd that the introduction of the euro


led to a more integrated interbank market, yet had little eect on cross-border bank-to-rm lending.


   A common thread in both IRBC and NOE research is that the composition of nancing ows


is not discussed in detail beyond distinguishing between complete markets and non-contingent bond


economies, as explained in Devereux and Sutherland (2011b) and Coeurdacier and Rey (2012). The


authors provide a simple approximation method for portfolio choice problems in general equilibrium


models that are solved using rst-order approximations around a non-stochastic steady state.           A


few papers address specically one of the enduring puzzles in open economy macroeconomics, the


home equity bias puzzle. Coeurdacier and Gourinchas (2011) solve jointly for the optimal equity and


bond portfolio in an environment with multiple shocks.     In Heathcote and Perri (2013), home bias


arises because endogenous international relative price uctuations make domestic assets a good hedge


against labor income risk. Coeurdacier et al. (2010) emphasize trade in stocks and bonds: domestic


equity hedges labor income risk while terms of trade shocks are hedged using domestic and foreign


bonds.   Sihvonen (2018) studies the aggregate eects of equity home bias in a model that features


nominal rigidities and xed exchange rates. Fornaro (2014) and Benigno and Romei (2014) study the


eect of deleveraging shocks in open economies with nominal rigidities. Fornaro (2014) compares the


consequences of a tightening of the exogenous borrowing limit in Bewley economies with and without


nominal rigidities and xed exchange rates. Benigno and Romei (2014) consider a two-country model


in which one country is a net debtor and the other is a creditor. They analyze the eect of a tightening


in the borrowing limit.   The literature on sudden stops in emerging markets (Mendoza and Smith


(2006); Mendoza (2010); Chari et al. (2005)) focuses on the imposition of an external credit constraint.


However, these models are couched in representative agent frameworks and do not account for domestic


credit ows. On the other hand, the borrower-saver models, (see e.g. Eggertsson and Krugman (2011)),


and more generally the two agent New Keynesian models (Bilbiie (2008), Debortoli and Gali (2017))




                                                   6
lack the international dimension.           Our paper instead presents a model that can account for both


domestic and external capital ows, which is important for our results.




1 Model
We consider a currency union composed of several regions, each of which is populated by a (potentially


dierent) measure of innitely lived households. Each region produces a tradable domestic good and


households consume both domestic and foreign goods. We will consider two main specications: one


with two regions, home and foreign, as in standard models of international trade; and another with


a continuum of countries, each one of which is small relative to the union, as in Gali and Monacelli


(2008). Some results are easier to establish in one setup than in the other.


    Following Mankiw (2000) and Eggertsson and Krugman (2012), we assume that within each region,


households are heterogeneous in their degree of time preference. Specically, in each region there is a


fraction       of impatient households and       1-     of patient ones. Patient households (indexed by            i=s   for


savers) have a higher discount factor than borrowers (indexed by                    i=b      for borrowers):      s > b .

We also consider the case in which the borrower's discount rate is stochastic. We denote the regions


home and foreign and indicate foreign variables and parameters with superscript                         .   The economies


dier with respect to the menu of traded assets that aect savers' budget constraints.
                                                                                                            2
    We leave time subscripts out of the model parameters, although we consider (anticipated or unan-


ticipated) shocks to many of them later.




1.1 Preferences and technology
Households of each type and in each region derive utility from consumption and labor:


                                         
                                               t
                                    Et         i [log Ci,t -  (Ni,t )] ,   for   i = b, s,
                                         t=0


where   Ci,t   is a composite good that aggregates goods produced by the home (Ch ) and foreign (Cf )


countries


                                  log Ci,t = (1 - ) log (Ch,i,t ) +  log (Cf,i,t ) ,
   2 For ease of exposition the equations presented below are valid when the two regions' populations are of equal measure;
we consider dierent country sizes in the appendix.

bias in consumption.

where   Ph,t      and   Pf,t   are the time   t   producer price indices (PPI) in the home and foreign countries,
                                                                                                                        1-          
respectively. Assuming the law of one price, the foreign price index is                                     Pt = Pf,t
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                             Ph,t      . The


home and foreign goods, in turn, are compositions of intermediate goods produced in each of the


countries; intermediate goods are aggregated into the nal consumption goods using the following


constant elasticity of substitution technologies:

ANt ,   where     A   is total factor productivity.




1.2 Wage setting
We assume that wages are sticky and we ration the labor market uniformly across households. This


assumption simplies the analysis because we do not need to keep track separately of the labor income


of patient and impatient households within a country. Not much changes if we relax this assumption,


except that we lose some tractability.
                                                   4    Wage dynamics are determined by a Phillips curve with slope

   3 With   discount rate shocks the borrowers problem is
                                                           t
                                                  Et             b,k log Cb,t -  Nb,t
                                                       t=0 k=0

   4 In response to a negative shock, impatient households would try to work more. The prediction that hours increase
more for credit constrained households appears to be counter-factual however. One can x this by assuming a low
elasticity of labor supply, which essentially boils down to assuming that hours worked are rationed uniformly in response
to slack in the labor market. Assuming that the elasticity of labor supply is small (near zero) also means that the natural
rate does not depend on scal policy. In an extension we study       the case where the natural rate is dened by the labor
supply condition in the pseudo-steady state  ni = (1 - j ) x     wj
                                                                  i,j
                                                                      . We can then ration the labor market relative to their
natural rate: ni,j,t = nin(() ) nj,t where ni ( ) is the natural rate for household i in country. This ensures consistency
                       i i
and convergence to the correct long run equilibrium. Steady state changes in the natural rate are quantitatively small,
however, so the dynamics that we study are virtually unchanged. See Midrigan and Philippon (2010) for a discussion.


                                                                            8


                                              Wt = Wt-1 (1 +  (Nt - Nss )) ,


where   Nss   is steady-state employment.           The assumption that wages are sticky is not important for


the theoretical results, but it matters for the numerical welfare benets of BU and CMU. The monop-


olistically competitive intermediate goods producers set their prices exibly every period. It follows


that:
                                                                     Wt

                                                                     A
                                                                          Wt
where   µ  / ( - 1)          is a markup over the marginal cost
                                                                          A .     Since intermediate goods producers


charge a markup over marginal cost, they earn prots




                                          t = (APh,t - Wt ) Nt = (µ - 1) Wt Nt .



1.3 Borrowers' budget constraint
The budget constraint of impatient households (borrowers) in each country is given by



                                            Bt+1
                                                 + Wt Nt - Ttb = Pt Cb,t + Bt .
                                             Rt

Where   Bt    is the face value of debt issued in period         t-1   by borrowers,   Rt   is the nominal interest rate


between   t   and   t + 1,   and   Tt   are lump sum taxes. Borrowing is denominated in units of the currency


of the monetary union and is subject to an exogenous limit                 ¯:
                                                                           B


                                                              ¯
                                                        Bt+1  B.


In the numerical calibrations we assume that the borrowers are impatient enough that they always


borrow up to the constraint, so                   ¯.
                                           Bt+1 = B    However, this assumption is not required for most of the


theoretical results.




1.4 Monetary and scal policy
The monetary policy rule is not important for the theoretical results. However, in the calibrations we


assume that it takes the form of a Taylor rule. That is, the nominal interest rate in the currency union

where   Rss , Yss   and   ss   are the steady state interest rate, output and ination, respectively.                        The


government budget constraint is:
                                              g
                                             Bt+1                   g
                                                  = Ph,t Gt - Tt + Bt ,                                                      (1)
                                              Rt

The rate on government debt is        Rt   and tax receipts are              Tt = Ttb + (1 - ) Tts .


1.5 Savers' budget constraint in each of the economies
Segmented Markets (SMU) and Banking Union (BU)                                      Savers save at the rate   Rt .   The savers'


budget constraint is
                                                                t             St+1
                                   St + Wt Nt - Tts +             = Pt Cs,t +      ,
                                                               1-              Rt

where   t   are per-capita prots from intermediate good producers. Only savers in each country have

                                  t
claims to these prots, so
                                 1- are prots per saver. Under BU, the interest rate at home is always

equal to the interest rate in the union:           ¯t
                                              Rt = R       for all      t.   Under SMU, on the other hand, we can have

     ¯t
Rt = R    and we will need to specify how          Rt   is determined.




Capital Market Union (CMU)                 In a capital market union savers can trade a non-contingent bond,


a home stock and a foreign stock. The savers' budget constraints in the home region is

where   t   are the home savers' aggregate holdings of the home stock and                        t   are the foreign savers'


holdings of the foreign stock.       Moreover,      Vt   and    Vt      are the prices of the home and foreign stock,


respectively, that represent claims to the aggregate prot streams in the countries.




                                                               10
Complete Markets                 In the complete markets economy, savers have access to a full set of state


contingent securities. We denote purchases at time                     t   of securities paying o one unit of currency at


time   t +1 contingent on the realization of state st+1            following history    st   by   Dt+1 (st+1 , st ); this security

has a time    t   price   Qt (st+1 , st ):

1.6 Equilibrium conditions
Demand functions for the home and foreign consumption bundles by savers and borrowers are given


by




                                                Ph,t Ch,i,t   =    (1 - ) Pt Ci,t                                              (2)

Savers are unconstrained and their consumption is determined by their Euler equation and budget


constraint (which diers across economies, as presented in section 1.5):



                                                     1                1

When the borrowers' are unconstrained their savings is characterized by a similar Euler equation.


Market clearing in goods is given by

where   Gt   is spent on home goods only. Substituting in for demand functions and expressing in nominal


terms, nominal output is




        Ph,t ANt = (1 - ) (Pt Cb,t + (1 - ) Pt Cs,t ) +   Pt Cb,t

Finally, market clearing for bonds requires




                                                                         g    g

2 Banking Union
2.1 Small Open Economies in a BU
In this section we study demand shocks under BU: specically, shocks that come from private borrowing


or scal policy. We rst derive analytical results for the impact of these shocks on a small open economy.


We then study the case of two regions. Finally, we also study the eect of a deleveraging shock large


enough to make the zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate binding.
                                                                                         5
   Under BU, the funding cost is the same in all regions. Let us rst dene the                  k -period discount rate

from the savers' perspective as    Rt,k  Rt × .. × Rt+k-1 ,     with the convention          Rt,0 = 1.     We also dene

~t  Ph,t Nt - Tt
Y                   as private disposable income and      Ft   as nominal exports (in the case of two regions


this is simply
                           
                 Ft =  Pt Ct ).


   The rst step is to write the current account equilibrium in market values.                        We then have the


following Lemma:



Lemma 1. The inter-temporal current account condition for country j is

               (1 - ) St - Bt + Et                      = (1 - ) St - Bt - Bt + Et                         .         (6)
                                                 Rt,k                                                 Rt,k
                                           k=0                                                 k=0


Proof.   See Appendix.



   On the left we have the net present value of all future imports, which is a share                  of private wealth,

which itself equals nancial wealth plus the value of disposable income.                  On the right we have net


foreign assets plus the present value of exports (Ft ). The key point here is that the inter-temporal


current-account condition pins down the NPV of disposable income as a function of current assets and


foreign demand. With unit demand elasticity (log-preferences) nominal exports are exogenous to the


small open economy.


   The next step is to consider the program of the savers.             With log-preferences, we can write the

arbitrary, there is of course very little that we can say. Therefore, we restrict our attention to a class


of scal policies where the following condition holds.


   Condition 1.           The present value of savers' income is a simple function (linear, ane, etc.) of that


of average disposable income
                                                              ~s                ~t+k
                                                              Yt+k              Y
                                                   Et               Et               .
                                                              Rt,k              Rt,k
                                                        k=0               k=0

Condition 1 imposes some restrictions on scal policy, but it holds in many natural settings and all


the applied models that we have studied. The simplest example is uniform at taxation of all income


at rate   t ,   i.e.,   Ttb = t Wt Nt    and    Tts = t Wt Nt +            t
                                                                                 .    In that case,   ~tb = (1 - t ) Wt Nt
                                                                                                      Y                              and
                                                                          1-

~ts = (1 - t ) Wt Nt +             t                                  µ-1
Y                                 1-    = (1 - t ) Wt Nt 1 +          1-    . Therefore, all taxes, income and prots are

                                                     ~t = µ (1 - t ) Wt Nt ,                         ~s =   1           µ-1   ~t .
proportional to         Wt Nt .   In particular,     Y                               and therefore   Yt     µ    1+     1-    Y      All


disposable incomes are directly proportional, period-by-period. This is stronger than what we need


for Condition 1. Note that markups are constant: we will return to this issue in the next section.


   If we combine Lemma 1 and Condition 1, we obtain the following result.



Lemma 2. Under Condition 1 and log-preferences, nominal spending by savers (P C                             t   s,t   ) does not react
to private credit shocks (B
                          ¯t+1 ), to borrowers' discount rate shocks (b,t ) or to scal policy (neither Gt

nor Tt ). Spending only reacts to interest rate and foreign demand shocks.

Proof.    Lemma 1 shows that the net present value of disposable income is a function of exactly four




                                                                  13

                                            Rt,k                                Rt,k
                                      k=0                                 k=0

where the rst three variables (saving, household debt, public debt) are predetermined at time                    t   and


the last one (exports in euros) is exogenous under log preferences. Therefore, equation (7) is, in fact,


                                                 
                                                       Pt+k Cs,t+k
                                            Et                      St + t .
                                                          Rt,k
                                                 k=0


So the current spending of savers only depends on              t   and the path of interest rates. In particular, for


given   t   and interest rates, it cannot depend on contemporaneous or future private credit, borrowers'


discount rate, or scal policy.



      Lemma 2 claries the behavior of savers. Their nominal spending reacts neither to credit shocks


nor to scal shocks. Such deleveraging shocks aect the savers in two ways. First, if this debt was held


by domestic savers, deleveraging results in repayments of debt.                  However, the savers can substitute


these repayments by lending more to foreign countries. The fact that this direct eect does not aect


the   net present value   of savers income and therefore their spending is perhaps not surprising.


      However, deleveraging also lowers the demand of borrowers which creates a bust in the country.


This lowers the labor income and prots received by savers. Intuitively, the consumption expenditure


of savers should therefore fall.       But the lower debt of borrowers increases their demand in future


periods, which increases the savers' future income. What is surprising is that for any distribution of


deleveraging shocks this future increase in income exactly osets the initial fall so that the NPV of


savers income does not change. As a result, patient agents keep their nominal spending constant.


      The exact theoretical result relies on our assumption of log-preferences as in Cole and Obstfeld


(1991). In our simulations, however, we nd that the theory provides a good prediction even when


the demand elasticity diers from one.                  Finally, it is worth emphasizing that our results refer to


expenditures, not real consumption.              Even when expenditures remain constant, real consumption


moves with ination. In realistic settings, ination responses are relatively small and our theoretical


benchmark is quite accurate. We can now state our rst main result.



Proposition 1. For a small open economy subject to private and public demand shocks (B
                                                                                     ¯                     t+1   , b,t ,
Gt , Tt ), the Banking Union achieves the Complete Markets allocation.

Proof.   Under BU, the interest rate is the same in all regions and is independent of idiosyncratic shocks




                                                              14
to the SOE. Given interest rates, savers' spending   Pt Cs,t   is constant. On the other hand, the complete


markets outcome is characterized by the Backus-Smith condition, which, with log preferences, takes


the form
                                               
                                              Cs,t Pt
                                                    ,
                                              Cs,t Pt

for arbitrary foreign country.   Since shocks to an SOE do not aect foreign prices or quantities, it


follows that the complete markets condition is also that       Pt Cs,t   remains constant. Hence, in response


to deleveraging shocks coming either from a change in the borrowers' credit constraints or the discount


rate, the BU replicates the complete markets economy. Moreover, these shocks can occur simultane-


ously.



   Proposition 1 shows that a banking union is sucient to deal with any cross-sectional distribution


of debt deleveraging and scal shocks in a currency union. Martin and Philippon (2017) show that


segmented markets, in contrast, can be very inecient. They nd that spreads go up during episodes of


private deleveraging, mostly because of stress in the banking sector. This leads savers (or rms under


Q-theory) to cut spending precisely when the economy is in recession, exacerbating the downturn. We


quantity the welfare gains from BU in Section 4.


   Proposition 1 is dierent from previous hedging results in the international macroeconomics litera-


ture, such as those in Coeurdacier and Gourinchas (2011) and Coeurdacier et al. (2010). They consider


two country models with trading in two real bonds as well as equity claims. They nd that countries


can share risks using static positions in the real bonds. In contrast, we consider a setting with trading


in one nominal bond with a common interest rate. We show that countries can share risks using an


essentially dynamic cross-country borrowing strategy with this bond. Our result also diers from the


results in Engel and Matsumoto (2009), who show that agents can hedge risks through a static forward


position in foreign exchange.




2.2 Two Countries and ZLB
Our next task is to study the case of shocks hitting a large economy. Proposition 1 is exactly correct


in a small open economy; with two economies, foreign demand depends (partly) on domestic demand


and, therefore, on domestic deleveraging. In addition, the central bank reacts by changing the risk


free rate.


   In spite of these dierences we nd that the result of Proposition 1 remains essentially correct. The




                                                     15
intuition is as follows. First, we know that savers do not react in a SOE. With two countries, foreign


demand is endogenous, but this eect is small because it depends on two consecutive cross-border


spillovers: the pass-through of domestic demand onto foreign income and then from foreign income


back to foreign demand for home goods. The spillover is quantitatively small. Proposition 1 is also


approximately correct for reasonable values of the elasticity of substitution other than one.


   The second important dierence is the Taylor rule. Of course, the reaction of the monetary author-


ity has a direct impact on the dynamics of the currency union. But the key point is that this impact


is the same under BU and under complete markets. Why? Because savers face the same interest rate


in both countries.


   Figure 1 depicts the impulse responses to a domestic deleveraging shock (credit shock) in each of


the two regions of the currency union. The responses of all variables except    St   are virtually the same


under BU and under complete markets. Domestic savings       St   need to adjust more in the BU than in


the complete markets economy because of the lack of explicit state contingent contracts.


   The aggregate (currency union-wide) response to a deleveraging shock obviously depends on how


monetary policy reacts.   Our results show that, irrespective of the central bank's reaction, the BU


and complete markets economies behave in virtually identical ways after the deleveraging shock. One


might wonder, however, if this result could be over-turned if the central bank was constrained by the


zero lower bound. We nd that this is not the case: our result also holds when the ZLB binds. Figure


2 depicts impulse responses to a deleveraging shock large enough to make the ZLB bind. Naturally,


when the ZLB binds the central bank is unable to lower the interest rate enough to stabilize aggregate


employment in the currency union.


   We conclude that an ideal banking union  a union that guarantees that funding costs are equalized


across regions  is enough to deal with all domestic demand shocks, both private and public.




3 Capital Market Union
In this section we focus on the benets of a capital market union above and beyond an ideal banking


union. We pay special attention to technology shocks in the form of quality shocks to the goods sold


by domestic rms. Formally, we model these shocks as a change to        ,   or the preference of foreigners


for domestic goods. In response to these shocks, domestic rms become more protable, while foreign


rms become less protable. The banking union will not be able to share this kind of risk, but the


capital market union could, at least in principle. The following proposition characterizes the types of

Proposition 2. Assume borrowers are impatient enough to borrow up to the borrowing constraint.
Using static equity positions and no-cross country borrowing, it is possible to replicate the complete
markets allocation in a capital market union subject to (home or foreign) quality (t , t

                                                      (2 - 1)(µ - 1)

                                                          1-

We can then simply solve
                                                    1 11-
                                          =  =       -     .
                                                    2 2µ-1

With these stock positions the complete markets condition holds for arbitrary labor income realizations.


The complete markets condition also ensures that the Euler equations for stocks and bonds hold.


Therefore, the above stock positions and no-cross country borrowing constitute an equilibrium that


replicates the complete markets outcome.



   To eciently share quality shocks, savers should underweight home stocks.           In practice various


frictions might lead savers to do the opposite and overweight home stocks. This type of capital market


union with partially segmented equity markets is able to share some but not all of the risks associated


with the shocks.


   Note that the proposition holds for various dierent types of shocks, including quality shocks, TFP


shocks and monetary policy shocks. It also holds for all types of preference shocks that do not alter




                                                    19
the complete markets condition. This includes shocks to the disutility of labor that could aect the


Phillips curve for wages. Moreover, the number of shocks can be higher than the number of assets;


this is in contrast to the usual niding that obtaining the complete markets outcome requires at least


as many assets as shocks. As with Proposition 1, the exact theoretical result hinges on Cole-Obstfeld


preferences as well as the assumed form of the production function.
                                                                             6
   The assumption that the borrowers borrow up to the constraint rules out cases in which a supply


shock would indirectly induce leveraging or deleveraging. We relax this assumption in Proposition 3.


   Figure 3 shows the outcome to a quality shock in a banking union, a partial capital market union


(with equal weights on home and foreign stocks), and complete markets (equivalently, a CMU with


optimal weights). With complete markets savers' spending in the two countries is equalized. Propo-


sition 2 shows that if stock positions are chosen correctly, the capital market outcome coincides with


the complete markets case. With equal weights on home and foreign stocks, savers' spending in the


home country increases relative to that in the foreign country. This increase, however, is smaller than


in a banking union without cross-border equity claims.


   Note that our denition of a banking union implies perfect home bias in equity, whereas we dene a


capital market union as featuring optimal cross-border holdings of equity. We have in mind a situation


in which some friction prevents savers from optimally diversifying their equity holdings, and a capital


market union can be thought of as the removal of this friction. We do not explicitly model such frictions


in this paper; for more elaborate micro-foundations of equity home bias and related discussions see,


for example, Coeurdacier and Rey (2013) and Sihvonen (2018).




Simultaneous Supply and Demand Shocks                    Proposition 1 shows that by using dynamic borrow-


ing a banking union is able to share demand shocks. Proposition 2 argues that by using static equity


positions a capital market union can share quality shocks. In a rst-order approximation these results


add up in a fairly straightforward way. In our framework we also obtain the following exact result:



Proposition 3. When each country is small, using static equity positions and dynamic cross-country
borrowing it is possible to replicate the complete markets allocation in a capital market union subject
to (idiosyncratic) deleveraging as well as arbitrary foreign quality, productivity, monetary policy, and
various preference shocks.
   6 The production function implies a perfect correlation between dividends and labor income. The result would also
hold in a model with a xed capital stock but not in a model with investment. However, it holds approximately in a
model with investment with realistic investment adjustment costs.

Shocks that Can Be Shared Neither in BU or CMU                          We have provided results for the types


of shocks that can be shared perfectly either in a BU or CMU. We have covered a broad array of


shocks including credit, discount rate, taxation, government spending, quality, productivity, monetary


policy and disutility of labor shocks. Are there shocks, then, that cannot be shared in an ideal CMU?


Generally, the answer is yes, especially if one insists on perfectly replicating the complete markets


outcome. The key counterexample would be a redistributive shock such as a mark-up shock that alters


the relative share of labor and dividend income. In case of such shocks one can show that neither a


BU nor a CMU exactly obtains the complete markets outcome.




4 Numerical Welfare Gains
In this section, we extend the model to include physical capital.             We use this extended model to


quantitatively assess the welfare benets of a banking and capital market union. Adding capital does


not alter the key results of the paper but it aects the welfare benets of a banking and capital market


union.    This occurs partly because investment lowers the correlation between dividends and labor


income, which reduces the hedging benets of foreign equity.




4.1 Model Structure
Final goods producers         As before, competitive nal goods producers produce the consumption


good using a CES technology that aggregates intermediate goods:


                                                     1        -1   -1

                                        Yt =             Yj,t dj        .
                                                 0


Intermediate goods producers           Intermediate goods, however, are produced by monopolistically


competitive rms using a Cobb-Douglas technology with labor and capital as inputs:




                                                      1- 
                                           Yj,t = At Nj,t Kj,t .


Where    At is an aggregate, country-specic productivity shock.         Intermediate goods producers are owned


by shareholders in the home and foreign country and maximize dividend payos to shareholders (dj,t ),


discounted using the average discount factor (m
                                              ¯ 0,,t ) of savers in the two countries


                                                         22
                                                                   
                                                        max Et           m
                                                                         ¯ t,t+s dj,t+s
                                                                   s=0

The weights for the discount factors are given by the stock positions. For example if home savers hold


most of the equity of home rms, home rms put more weight on the discount factor of home savers.


The rms can transfer the aggregate consumption good into capital through investment. Dividends


are:


                                            dj,t = Pj,t Yj,t - Wt Nj,t - Pt Ij,t - Pt f (Ij,t ).


Where     Ij,t , Pj,t , Nj,t   and   Yj,t   are intermediate producer             j 's investment,         price, employment and output


at time    t   and   Wt   is the wage rate in the country. Moreover,                        f (Ij,t )is   the investment adjustment cost.


Here we set



                                                                                             2
                                                                          It,j
                                                     f (Ij,t ) =                     -1          .
                                                                   2     It-1,j

Firm    j 's   capital evolves according to:




                                                     Kj,t+1 = (1 -  )Kj,t + Ij,t .


And it faces a downward sloping demand curve from producers of the nal good:


                                                                                 -
                                                                       Pj,t
                                                          Yj,t =                     Yt .
                                                                       Ph,t

Intermediate goods producers set prices exibly.                           It follows that they all set the same price, labor


demand and investment level.




                                        Nt = Nj,t , It = Ij,t , Ph,t = Pj,t , Kt = Kj,t .


Optimal investment is determined by the following equation:

4.2 Numerical Welfare Benets of a Banking Union
In this section we use the model with capital to estimate the welfare benets of a banking union.


Under segmented markets, the private costs of funds are not equalized across regions.                      Martin and


Philippon (2017) and Gourinchas et al. (2016) quantify the extent of the dispersion in funding costs


during the Eurozone crisis. The simplest interpretation is that domestic banks intermediate savings


and investment, and, thus, the private cost of fund is pinned down by the banking system. Formally,


in log-deviations from steady state, we have



                                                               b
                                                         rt = rt


         b
where   rt   is the banks' funding cost. We can then consider a small island subject to a spread shock

 b
rt   and a private leverage shock       ¯t
                                        B    . We estimate these shocks using data from the Eurozone as in


Martin and Philippon (2017). The basic idea is to model the joint dynamics of spreads and private


debt. Debt is well described by an AR(2) process and spreads by an AR(1) process. The processes




                                                           24
are correlated because negative shocks cause spread to rise and banks to cut lending. Our calibration


uses data from a volatile period, the eurozone crisis, so our welfare calculations capture the value of a


banking union during periods of heightened nancial risks.
                                                                             7
    Table 2 summarizes our quantitative results.                Spread dierences between countries increase con-


sumption volatility and lower welfare. The volatilities in the segmented markets case are fairly high


since the model is calibrated to a volatile period. The banking union reduces consumption volatility


by equalizing interest rates between countries. Table 2 shows the volatilities of (annualized quarterly


log changes) consumption for savers and borrowers as well as for aggregate consumption. The banking


union eliminates almost all of the consumption volatility of savers. This is consistent with Proposition


1, according to which the banking union attains the complete markets outcome subject to deleverag-


ing shocks. It also suggests that the Proposition holds well in the extended model with capital. The


banking union also leads to a substantial reduction in the consumption volatility of borrowers and a


clear decline in the volatility of total consumption.
                                                                8

    Table 3 describes the volatilities when adding supply shocks modeled as quality and productivity


shocks. The estimation of these shocks is described in the next section. Now the banking union does


not lead to zero volatility for savers but still implies a clear reduction in all consumption volatilities.

The investment adjustment cost is estimated in the next section.
   8 With CRRA log-preferences the welfare benets of these changes are still relatively small. However, we could increase
this welfare gain by raising savers' risk aversion, for example through the use of recursive preferences (Epstein and Zin
(1989)).
   9 Note that the point that eliminating market segmentation improves welfare is not entirely obvious. For example
Devereux and Sutherland (2011a) and Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2015) nd that free bond trading can reduce welfare
relative to nancial autarky. However, spreads tend to increase precisely when it would be ecient for countries to
smooth shocks by borrowing.

4.3 Numerical Welfare Benets of a Capital Market Union
In this section we argue that the welfare gains of moving from a banking union to a capital market


union can be large.   As before we employ the model with capital but now with two countries.         We


assume three dierent kinds of shocks: deleveraging, quality and productivity shocks.


   The benets of CMU depend on the relative importance of these shocks. First, in line with Proposi-


tion 1, deleveraging shocks can be shared well using a bond and, therefore, require little equity market


diversication. Second, due to Cole-Obstfeld preferences, TFP shocks do not create large changes in


the total value of output or dividends in each country, consistent with Lemma 3. Sharing such shocks,


therefore, requires fairly little equity market diversication, and consumption volatilities in each coun-


try are generally insensitive to the level of diversication. On the other hand, using such shocks only


tends to lead to a counterfactually low correlation between dividends and labor income.       Moreover,


these shocks imply high correlations between the consumption levels in the two countries, in contrast


to the low levels of international risk sharing seen in the data.


   However, sharing quality shocks eciently requires diversication in equity positions. We estimate


the model with consumption and export data from France provided by Eurostat.             We also match


the relative correlation between dividends and labor income. The estimation details are given in the


appendix.


   We estimate the shock processes using a stock position of         = 0.8.   After that we numerically


solve for the optimal home stock position from an individual saver's perspective using the method


described by Devereux and Sutherland (2011b). The optimal home stock position is constant up to


second order and given by    =  = 0.08.      We do not model the friction that leads agents to choose


a larger-than-optimal home stock position. As in Tille and van Wincoop (2010), for example, we can


think of this friction as a second-order term that aects macroeconomic conditions through its impact


on stock positions. We then compare the volatility of (log rst dierences in) consumption under the


two dierent levels of equity market diversication. The results are given in Table 4. Note that we




                                                   26
have slightly modied the denition of banking union to match the empirical extent of equity home


bias instead of assuming perfect home bias. Further, the numbers are not directly comparable with


the previous tables because we use the two country version of the model to produce Table 4.



                      Consumption         Banking Union       Capital Market Union
                        Volatility             = 0.8              =  = 0.08
                         Savers                1.52%                 0.88%
                        Borrowers              3.46%                 2.96%
                          Total                2.04%                 0.85%


        Table 4: Consumption volatilities under a banking union and a capital market union



   The rst order eect of increasing equity market diversication is a 62% reduction in savers' con-


sumption volatility. Interestingly, through general equilibrium eects, increased risk sharing by savers


also leads to a reduction in the consumption volatility of borrowers, and therefore a greater reduction


in aggregate consumption volatility than would be implied by a reduction in savers' volatility alone.


Table 5 illustrates the positive externalities of a CMU. Savers do not internalize the gains that accrue


to borrowers, so the reduction in borrowers' consumption volatility amounts to a positive externality.


However, there are also positive externalities for savers. If a single saver lowers her stock position to


 = 0.08,   she would face a consumption volatility of 0.94%.      That is, roughly 10% of the volatility


reduction gains accruing to savers are not internalized. This is due both to pecuniary and aggregate


demand externalities.



                                          Uninternalized          Share of Total
                                       Volatility Reduction    Volatility Reduction
                        Savers                0.06%                   10%
                      Borrowers                0.5%                   100%


                                 Table 5: Positive Externalities of a CMU




Sensitivity Analysis     The results depend on the types of shocks that we assume. Table 6 shows the


results if we estimate the model with deleveraging and productivity shocks only. Because home equity


provides a good hedge to shocks to labor income, stock positions are mildly biased towards home stocks


even absent frictions. More specically, the frictionless equilibrium stock position is    = 0.6.   Overall,


consumption volatilities are less sensitive to equity market diversication in line with Lemma 3. We


can see from the table that now the CMU brings essentially zero benets. The deleveraging shocks


can be shared using the bond. Moreover, the productivity shocks do not create large dierences in the




                                                      27
value of output in the two countries. Similar results have been found in the literature on equity home


bias, where it has been shown that equilibrium stock positions can be biased towards home stocks even


absent frictions (e.g. Coeurdacier and Gourinchas (2011), Heathcote and Perri (2013)). However, as


also discussed in Section 4.3, the calibration with quality shocks matches important features of the


data that cannot be matched with productivity shocks alone.



                     Consumption        Banking Union       Capital Market Union
                       Volatility         =  = 0.8                =  = 0.6
                         Savers              1.92%                  1.94%
                       Borrowers              3.2%                   3.2%
                       Aggregate              2.2%                   2.2%


Table 6: Consumption volatilities under a banking union and a capital market union, no quality shocks



   Finally, note that if the quality shocks are transitory rather than persistent, they can also be


partially shared using the bond. However, the estimation implies a fairly high persistence requiring


diversication in equity positions.




Pareto Ecient Solution        Our results highlight the cases in which a BU or a CMU can replicate the


complete markets outcome for savers. This equilibrium might still not be Pareto ecient, however, for


two reasons. First, it does not attain the complete markets allocation between borrowers in dierent


countries or between borrowers and savers. The allocation can therefore feature pecuniary externalities


as the marginal rates of substitutions between all agents are generally not equalized.


   The second reason is that we assumed that wages are sticky. This is not important for the main


results of the paper. However, as explained by Farhi and Werning (2017) such rigidities can give rise


to aggregate demand externalities. This can imply that even the full complete markets allocation is


not Pareto ecient.


   Providing an analytical solution for the Pareto ecient allocation in our setup seems infeasible.


However, using a somewhat simpler model Sihvonen (2018) shows that absent frictions the equilibrium


stock positions tend to be socially optimal even despite aggregate demand externalities. Numerically


this property seems to hold well in our model.       In the baseline model, the frictionless equilibrium


stock position is 0.08. Aggregate consumption volatility is minimized with a stock position of -0.18.


However, this volatility is fairly at in the region of the socially optimal stock position so that the


equilibrium stock position attains 94% of the total volatility reduction gains. This suggests that the


complete markets/equilibrium stock positions are close to the socially optimal ones in a setting where




                                                  28
all stock market frictions have been removed (a CMU).


   We also show numerically that a BU and a CMU tends to improve welfare. Moreover, we numeri-


cally evaluate the positive externalities of a CMU. Here we nd that these externalities are fairly large.


That is a substantial part of the gains from moving from an equilibrium given frictions to a frictionless


equilibrium are uninternalized.




5 Conclusion
Failures of risk sharing lie at the heart of many economic crises. Such crises are particularly acute in


the context of a currency union in which constituent countries are hit by large, asymmetric shocks;


the Eurozone crisis of 2009-12 stands as a particularly striking example.


   This paper presents two main theoretical ndings. The rst is that in the case of demand shocks


- for example, private or public deleveraging - an idealized banking union in which borrowing costs


are equalized across constituent members of the currency union provides the same level of insurance


as complete markets.   The second nding illustrates the limitations of this ideal banking union: in


the case of supply shocks, the banking union does not provide full insurance, but an idealized capital


market union, in which savers frictionlessly choose optimal portfolios, does.


   Using a calibrated version of our model, we nd that large reductions in consumption volatility


result from moving from segmented markets to a banking union and from banking union to a capital


market union.   We also nd that a large part of the reduction comes from uninternalized general


equilibrium eects.

C Proof of Proposition 3
Step 1: Extending Propositions 1-2                 To begin, we need to extend some of the earlier results. First


we extend Proposition 2 to include multiple symmetric countries. Given that there are                          I   symmetric


countries, the complete markets condition is            Ct,s,i Pt,i = Ct,s,j Pt,j , i, j = 1, ..., I. With symmetric stock

positions and uniform tax rate on labor and capital income, the budget in each country is




                                                        Pt,i Cs,t,i =
             1                           (µ - 1)Wt,i Nt,i (1 -  )                   (1 - ) (µ - 1)Wt,j Nt,j (1 -  )
    B (1 -      ) + Wt,i Nt,i (1 -  ) +                           +                                                 .
             Rt                                  1-                                  I -1          1-
                                                                             j =i


Deducting the conditions for two countries          i   and   j=i   we obtain




                                               Pt,i Cs,t,i - Pt,j Cs,t,j =
                                                    (µ - 1)Wt,i Nt,i - (µ - 1)Wt,j Nt,j
                (Wt,i Nt,i - Wt,j Nt,j )(1 -  ) +                                       (1 -  )
                                                                    1-
           Wt,i Nt,i - Wt,j Nt,j   1-                                                   µ-1 1-µ-1
-(µ - 1)                                (1 -  ) = (1 -  ) (Wt,i Nt,i - Wt,j Nt,j ) 1 +         -                               .
                  1-               I -1                                                 1-       I -1 1-

Imposing the complete markets condition and ignoring the indeterminacy case, we need



                                                µ-1 1-µ-1
                                         1+        -         = 0.                                                        (8)
                                                1-   I -1 1-

From this one can solve
                                                        1 I -11-
                                               =          -       .                                                      (9)
                                                        I   I µ-1
                                           1       I -1 1-                    1               1 1-
Savers in each country should invest
                                           I   -     I µ-1 in home stocks and I           +   I µ-1 in the stocks of each

foreign country.    Savers should overweight foreign stocks.             Next we need to extend proposition 1 to


include static equity positions. Using manipulations similar to those in the proof of Lemma 1, we can


write



                                                                                                 Bt+1,i
        Wt,i Nt,i (µ - (1 - )(1 + (µ - 1))) = Ft,i + Gt,i + (1 - )(1 - )                                - Bt,i
                                                                                                  Rt
                                                                                           g
                             St+1,i                                                       Bt+1,i    g
               -(1 - )              - St,i     + (1 - )(1 - )t,i + (1 - )                        - Bt,i    .
                              Rt                                                           Rt




                                                              33
Here   t   is the savers' income from foreign stocks. For simplicity assume labor income as well as home


and foreign capital gains are all taxed at the same rate      and that the government does not take new


debt. From this we obtain



                                                    (µ - 1)                               Bt+1,i
     Wt,i Nt,i (µ - (1 - )(1 + (µ - 1)) -  -                ) = Ft,i + (1 - )(1 - )              - Bt,i
                                                     1-                                    Rt
                                                                                  g
                        St+1,i                                                   Bt +1,i    g
           -(1 - )             - St,i   + ((1 - )(1 - ) +  ) t,i + (1 - )                - Bt,i   .
                         Rt                                                       Rt

From this it is possible to write labor income as a function of exogenous variables.           Then one can

                                                                                      g          Ft+k
write the value of savers' spending as a function of exogenous variables   St , Bt , Bt , Et    k=0 Rt,k and
        t+k
Et     k=0 Rt,k as in the proof of Lemma 1. This generalizes proposition 1.



Step 2: The Main Argument               Given symmetric borrowing patterns the above stock positions


perfectly share shocks aecting labor income such as quality shocks.        These shocks need not be id-


iosyncratic. Idiosyncratic deleveraging shocks do not distort symmetry. This is because the savers hold


a constant amount in non-contingent savings. If borrowers pay back debt, the savers can substitute this


by lending more to foreign countries. While the proof assumes that the home quality stays constant it


also goes through with unanticipated home quality shocks. Moreover, it works for preference shocks


that do not alter the complete markets condition such as shocks to the disutility of labor that might


aect the Phillips curve for wages. While this proof assumes that home quality stays constant, the


Proposition also holds for unanticipated home quality shocks.

E Only Productivity Shocks
Due to Cole-Obstfeld preferences, price adjustments give a natural hedge against productivity shocks.


This can be formalized in the following lemma that generalizes the famous Cole and Obstfeld (1991)re-


sult to a borrower-saver agent economy with rigidities.       Note also the limitations of the lemma: it


considers a setting with only productivity shocks. That it does not hold for example in an environ-


ment with both productivity and quality shocks in which case the CMU still attains the complete

Lemma 3. Cole-Obstfeld 91 Result with Borrowers Consider a symmetric two country economy
similar to that in the baseline model but subject to productivity shocks. The optimal stock positions are
indeterminate and the equilibrium always attains the complete markets allocation for both borrowers
and savers.

   Proof.    The production functions for the intermediate goods are           At Nt   and    A   
                                                                                               t Nt .   Firms set prices
              
             Wt
µW
 At and µ
   t
             A    . In this model
              t

   yt pt = At Nt pt = µWt Nt

   and

     
   yt p t = A             
             t Nt pt = µWt Nt .

   Moreover, rm prots are as before.                 Conjecture that the model attains the complete markets


outcome for both savers and borrowers. That is

              
   Cs,t Pt = Cs,t Pt

   and

              
   Cb,t Pt = Cb,t Pt .

   Now we have,
                                                                   
   yt        (1-)Cs,t Pt /pt +Cs,t Pt /pt +(1-)Cb,t Pt /pt +Cb,t Pt /pt
    
   yt   =          P  /p +C
            (1-)Cs,t               P
                               s,t t  /p  +(1-)C  P  /p +C            .
                                                              b,t t /pt
                                                                  P
                       t   t             t      b,t t     t

   Then applying the complete markets conditions, we obtain

   yt       Cs,t Pt +Cb,t Pt p        p
    
   yt   =                     t
            Cs,t Pt +Cb,t Pt pt   =   pt .
                                       t



   That is prices and output levels moves inverse one-to-one. But this implies


   Wt Nt - Wt Nt = 0.

   Now one can see that the budget constraints support the complete markets conditions for both



                                                            35
savers and borrowers for any symmetric stock positions. Note that                      can be arbitrary so the result


also holds with respect to symmetric quality shocks. However, it does not hold with respect to arbitrary


quality shocks such as shocks that only aect the foreign country.


   What is the intuition behind the result? Assume that markets are complete. Now due to Cole-


Obstfeld preferences relative output levels and prices must move one-to-one.                    This means that the


value of output in each country must be the same. Higher production implies lower prices. But the


assumption for production technology implies that labor income is a constant fraction of the total


value of output in each country.                This means that total labor income in each country must be the


same. Finally, this implies that the budget constraints support the complete markets allocation.




F Asymmetries
We now generalize the results concerning equity to asymmetric initial stock positions, mark-ups, shares


of savers and country sizes. The complete markets condition is
                                                                                        
                                                                          Pt Cs,t = Pt Cs,t , where  is the relative


Pareto weight. The budget constraints are

   ¯ + Nt Wt - T +  (µ-1) Nt Wt + (1 -  ) µ -
   B                                         1                                    B¯
                     1-                   1- Nt Wt = Pt Cs,t +                    Rt

   ¯ + Nt Wt - T + (1 - ) (µ-1) Nt Wt +  µ -
   B                                        1                                       B¯
                           1-            1- Nt Wt = Pt Cs,t +                       Rt

   Deducting the budget constraints and imposing the complete markets condition yields

                      (2-1)(µ-1)                       (2 -1)(µ -1)
   Nt W t 1 +            1-           - Nt Wt 1 +         1-
                                                                                  
                                                                      = ( - 1)Pt Cs,t

   or

                      (2-1)(µ-1)                       (2 -1)(µ -1)       -1
   Nt W t 1 +            1-           - Nt Wt 1 +         1-          =   1+ (µNt Wt     + µ Nt Wt )

   From this we can solve

                      (2-1)(µ-1)                       (2 -1)(µ -1)       -1
   Nt W t 1 +            1-           - Nt Wt 1 +         1-          =   1+ (µNt Wt     + µ Nt Wt )

   or

                      (2-1)(µ-1)         -1                    (2 -1)(µ -1)       -1 
   Nt W t 1 +            1-          -   1+ µ    - Nt Wt 1 +      1-          +   1+ µ     =0

   From this we solve

         1       1 1-         1 (-1)µ(1-)
   =     2   -   2 µ-1   +    2 (1+)(µ-1)

   and
                                             
                     1 1-         1 (-1)µ (1- )
    =        1
             2   -   2 µ-1    -   2 (1+)(µ -1)

   The relative Pareto weight                 depends on initial conditions and can be solved numerically.          is


increasing in           and        decreasing. The result can be generalized to dierent tax rates. The above


derivations generalize Proposition 2. Proposition 3 can be generalized similarly.

G Benets of CMU: Calibration
As explained in the text, our baseline model for the CMU assumes quality, productivity and delever-


aging shocks. Most of the parameters take standard values (see Appendix D). However, we calibrate


the quality and deleveraging shock volatilities and persistences to match consumption and export data


from France obtained from Eurostat. We also match the correlation between relative dividends and


labor income (Home - Foreign values,       Corr(Wt Nt - Wt Nt , dt - dt )).   We take the persistence of the


productivity shocks from Heathcote and Perri (2013) but estimate their volatility. These parameter


values are given in Table 8. Moreover, Table 9 compares the key model simulated moments to those


seen in the data.


   As explained in the text, we calibrate the model with a home stock position of 0.8 and then later


solve for the frictionless equilibrium home stock position.         The implied correlation between relative


dividends and labor income is roughly 0.8, which is close to that for France as well as close to the


average number for EU countries calculated by Coeurdacier et al. (2010).             If we match a smaller


correlation value, the welfare benet of a CMU is somewhat lower but still signicant.
