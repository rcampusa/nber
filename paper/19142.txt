                                             ABSTRACT

This study aims to measure the causal effect of informal caregiving on the health and health care use
of women who are caregivers, using instrumental variables. We use data from South Korea, where
daughters and daughters-in-law are the prevalent source of caregivers for frail elderly parents and
parents-in-law. A key insight of our instrumental variable approach is that having a parent-in-law with
functional limitations increases the probability of providing informal care to that parent-in-law, but
a parent-in-law's functional limitation does not directly affect the daughter-in-law's health. We compare
results for the daughter-in-law and daughter samples to check the assumption of the excludability of
the instruments for the daughter sample. Our results show that providing informal care has significant
adverse effects along multiple dimensions of health for daughter-in-law and daughter caregivers in
South Korea.

1. INTRODUCTION

       While much economic research on informal care focuses on the health and health care

use of an elderly parent, informal care may also adversely affect the health of the caregiver.

Several mechanisms may lead to this effect (Schulz et al., 1995). Caregiving can worsen health

through increased emotional stress and physical strain. Caregiving also inevitably involves

observing a loved one’s decline and anticipatory bereavement, which itself may affect the

caregiver’s health (Bobinac et al., 2010; Amirkhanyan and Wolf, 2006). Through these negative

health effects, caregiving may increase a caregiver’s health care use.

       The provision of informal care may, however, be endogenous to caregivers' health,

making the modeling of the endogeneity problem important to uncover the true effect (Coe and

Van Houtven, 2009). Health status may affect the individual and family decisions on who

provides informal care ("selection in") as well as whether the caregiver continues or ceases

caregiving ("selection out") (Coe and Van Houtven, 2009). The selection criteria may not be

monotonic in health. While a healthier family member is more likely to take up the caregiving

role because of the burdensome nature of caregiving, it is also possible that a less healthy or less

productive family member may choose to provide informal care instead of participating in paid

employment. Selection out may arise when less healthy caregivers are more likely to stop

providing informal care. This endogeneity issue makes it difficult to untangle the causal effect of

informal caregiving on caregivers' health in observational data.

       This study aims to measure the causal effect of caregiving on caregivers' health and

health care use, using instrumental variables (IVs). We use nationally representative data from

South Korea, where daughters and daughters-in-law are the prevalent source of caregivers for

frail elderly parents and parents-in-law. A key insight is that having a parent-in-law with one or



                                                 1
more Activity of Daily Living (ADL) limitations increases the probability of providing informal

care to that parent-in-law, but a parent-in-law's ADL limitation does not directly affect the

daughter-in-law's health. We focus, therefore, on daughter-in-law caregivers and use the health

of their parents-in-law as our instruments. We begin with a simple Wald estimator and perform

careful robustness and falsification tests of the instruments to show that our instruments are

theoretically and empirically valid in their application to informal caregiving in South Korea.

       This paper makes several contributions to the empirical literature on caregiver health.

First, we estimate the causal effect of caregiving on the health of the caregiver, controlling for

the endogeneity between informal care and health using empirically strong instrumental

variables. Second, we estimate how caregiving affects a caregiver’s own health care use and

expenditures to provide policy-relevant information about how the health effects of caregiving

may translate to public health care costs in an aging society. Third, we use data from South

Korea, which has a unique cultural context about filial duty and caregiving as well as an

emerging strong market of publicly provided long-term care. The unique data source allows us to

estimate caregiver health effects separately for daughters and daughters-in-law, the latter being

an important source of informal care in South Korea. The comparison between daughters and

daughters-in-law is interesting empirically.

       We find that informal care has adverse effects on health and health care for daughter-in-

law and daughter caregivers in South Korea. Caregiving has significant spillover effects to

caregiver health care expenditures. For example, compared to their non-caregiving counterparts,

caregiving daughters-in-law annually spend on average 47 percent more out-of-pocket on their

own outpatient costs among those who use any outpatient care.

2. BACKGROUND

       A large body of research has found negative health effects of caregiving (for reviews and

meta-analyses see Schulz et al., 1990; Schulz et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1995; Bookwala et al.,

2000; Yee and Schulz, 2000; Dilworth-Anderson et al., 2002; Pinquart and Sörensen, 2003;

Vitaliano et al., 2003; Pinquart and Sörensen, 2006; Pinquart and Sörensen, 2007). Despite

considerable differences in the study design and outcome measures, the literature finds that,

compared with non-caregivers, caregivers experience overall poorer psychological and physical

health (Schulz et al., 1995; Pinquart and Sörensen, 2003; Vitaliano et al., 2003).

       The main empirical challenge of the literature on caregiver health effects has been that

caregiving (or care intensity among caregivers) is potentially endogenous. In their critical review

of the earlier literature, Barer and Johnson (1990) point out that much of the literature uses self-

selected samples. Schulz (1990) also suggests that health status may determine who will provide

informal care in the family. While well acknowledged, this methodological challenge has not

been adequately addressed in the caregiving literature, with one recent exception (Coe and Van

Houtven, 2009). Coe and Van Houtven (2009) address the endogeneity of both selection in and

selection out of caregiving using different sets of instrumental variables. They use the death of a

parent to instrument for selection out of caregiving, and sibling and family characteristics to

instrument for selection into caregiving. In their longitudinal study, they find no evidence of

endogeneity for selecting into caregiving, but do find evidence of endogeneity for selecting out

of caregiving.

       We extend the literature by taking into account the endogeneity of informal caregiving in

the instrumental variable framework, using data from an Asian cultural setting — South Korea.

South Korea provides a particularly interesting setting for our empirical work. Although South



                                                  3
Korea has become one of the fastest aging societies in the world, its strong tradition of filial piety

means caregiving for frail elderly parents is the responsibility of adult children. Informal

caregiving for disabled parents is embedded as an inseparable component of old-age support in

traditional Korean culture (Sung, 1990), as in other East Asian cultures (Hsu and Shyu, 2003;

Yamamoto and Wallhagen, 1997). Filial piety, an essential element of Confucianism, served as

the major principle for the everyday lives of ordinary people, helping to keep the family as well

as society in harmony (Chee, 2000). In an agrarian society until the 1960s, the Korean extended

family served as a production unit as well as a communal living unit. Traditional Korean

extended families continued with the eldest son’s marriage and intergenerational co-residence

with his parents. An eldest son inherited a larger share of bequests than his siblings would, in the

form of house, farming land, and other real estate assets. The disproportionately larger bequest to

the eldest son implied that the eldest son assumed the greatest role in familial responsibilities,

which included co-residing with, supporting, and caring for elderly parents. The daughter-in-law

married to the eldest son played a central role in familial responsibilities, including caring for ill

and disabled parents. In a sense, the extended Korean family started with a designated future

caregiver, the daughter-in-law, for aging parents (Choi, 1993).

       Although the traditional form of parental caregiving is care by the eldest son's wife,

recent decades have seen important changes in attitudes towards parental support. Eldest sons'

wives now are less likely to assume their traditional role of parental caregiving than they were in

the historically patrilineal society; at the same time, daughters increasingly play a greater role in

caring for their own parents. Traditionally, daughters were viewed as leaving their family to join

their husband’s family after marriage, and therefore did not receive equal bequests from their

own parents. A trend toward gender equality coupled with weakening traditional norms has



                                                   4
changed this pattern. Therefore, when a woman has both parents and parents-in-law who need

care, it is now less clear for whom she will provide care than in the past. Still, older women,

especially those married to an eldest son, are more likely to uphold the traditional practice of

daughters-in-law sharing the responsibility of caregiving in the husband’s family. A younger

woman who is the eldest daughter in her pre-marriage family and lives close by her parents tends

to play an increasingly greater role in parental caregiving than in the past, suggesting potential

heterogeneity among women who serve as caregivers to their parents or their parents-in-law.

When faced with the competing demands for caregiver time (i.e., a woman has both a parent and

a parent-in-law with limitations), the decision for whom a woman will provide care involves a

more complex set of factors, including her birth order, her husband’s birth order, the availability

of substitutes (e.g., whether both parents-in-law are living together), and geographic proximity.

       It is also less clear who should provide parental care in an extended family with several

adult children. Economic theory suggests that the primary informal caregiver selected is more

likely to be the one with the lowest opportunity cost of time, which in turn may be correlated

with poorer health and other socioeconomic disadvantages. There is, however, a growing

consensus among Koreans that “more able” children, who have higher incomes and spacious

houses, should take care of their parents. Despite these changes, parental caregiving by

daughters-in-law and daughters remains the major form of elderly long-term care in South Korea.

       In this cultural and institutional context, functional limitations of elderly parents and in-

laws can be a strong predictor of caregiving by daughters and daughters-in-law, and therefore a

good source of instruments. However, parental care needs may have direct influences on adult

children's psychological health (Amirkhanyan and Wolf, 2006). Having a functionally dependent

parent may adversely affect the health of adult children, which is termed as "the family effect"



                                                  5
independent of "the caregiving effect" (Bobinac et al., 2010). For example, an extra-residential

daughter with a demented mother may still suffer psychological consequences even though she is

not providing informal care to her mother. In the same vein, Amirkhanyan and Wolf (2003)

distinguish non-caregiver stress from caregiver stress. Moreover, parents' functional limitations

may also be correlated with adult children's (but not children-in-law’s) health outcomes through

genetic and behavioral similarities. For example, a 55-year-old daughter of an 85-old-year

mother bedridden with stroke may share an increased susceptibility to many chronic diseases.

There is less concern with instrument validity in models of physical health effects for the sample

of daughters-in-law (where the instruments are functional limitations of parents-in-law, who

obviously have no genetic link to the caregiver). The relatively high prevalence of caregiving by

daughters-in-law in South Korea allows for studying daughter-in-law caregivers separately from

daughter caregivers.

       The foregoing discussion provides a conceptual framework for a woman’s caregiving

decisions. Although the functional limitations of elderly parents and parents-in-law are the

primary determinant of this decision, the availability of alternative sources of care, as well as

location and the opportunity cost of time, are also likely to influence the decision process.



3. METHODS

       We estimate several models to predict a woman’s adverse health outcome or health care

use (y) as a function of whether she provides informal care to her parents (or parents-in-law) and

other personal characteristics (X).

                                      y = f(Informal care, X)




                                                  6
The test of the main hypothesis is whether the coefficient on the informal care variable is

statistically significant. We hypothesize that the coefficient on informal care will be positive,

indicating that women who are informal caregivers have worse health and greater health care

use. The goal is to obtain causal estimates of this relationship.

         There are two main econometric issues. First, the dependent variables (health and health

care use) are multifaceted, and therefore can be measured in several different ways. We estimate

two models of health and we estimate both extensive and intensive models of health care use and

costs.

         Second, informal care may be endogenous in a model that predicts health. Informal care

is not provided randomly. The decision to provide informal care will depend in part on

unobservable dimensions of health. Whether selection occurs in or out of caregiving, informal

caregivers are likely selected, at least partially, based on health status. We need instrumental

variables to correct for the potential endogeneity of informal care. These instruments must be

correlated with the decision to provide informal care but unrelated directly to the potential

caregiver’s health. We use indicators of any ADL limitations of the mother-in-law and of the

father-in-law as two instruments for the sample of daughters-in-law. Having a parent-in-law with

ADL limitations is highly predictive of providing informal care for that parent-in-law.

         Counter examples are instructive. Infectious diseases can spread within families, but we

are not measuring infectious disease. Some health problems are inherited, but in-laws are not

typically closely genetically related. Assortative mating could lead to a correlation in the health

and health behaviors of daughters-in-law and parents-in-law; however, this link cannot be as

strong as the link between daughters and parents. While some women may develop strong

emotional bonds with their in-laws, in general the daughter-in-law will be less emotionally



                                                  7
vested in the health decline of the parent-in-law. In short, we argue that a parent-in-law’s health

problems primarily affect a daughter-in-law’s health through caregiving, rather than directly. The

exclusion argument is harder to make for daughters caring for their parents due to heritability

and closeness, but for completeness and comparison we also estimate models with daughters as

caregivers.

       Before running the full IV models, we first obtain Wald estimators for each of our health

outcome measures to show the plausibility of the proposed instruments and the rough estimate of

the magnitude of the effect. The simple Wald estimator is calculated as follows (Angrist and

Evans, 1998). Consider the following regression model.

                                          y = α + βIC + ε

where y is a health outcome measure, and IC is the endogenous binary variable of interest,

whether the respondent provided any informal care. Let α be the constant term and β be the

coefficient of interest. The random error is ε. Now we consider a binary instrument (z) for the

sample of daughters-in-law  whether either parent-in-law has any ADL limitations (z=1 if any

ADL limitations, 0 otherwise). The IV-Wald estimate of β is the ratio of two differences. The

numerator is the difference between the expected value of y for those whose parents-in-law have

ADL limitations ( y1 ) and for those whose parents-in-law do not have ADL limitations ( y 0 ).

The denominator is the difference between the expected value of informal care for those whose

parents-in-law have ADL limitations ( IC 1 ) and for those whose parents-in-law do not have

ADL limitations ( IC 0 ). The estimate βIV-Wald is the average treatment effect of informal

caregiving on a particular health outcome in question (y) for the subgroup of individuals whose

probability of providing informal care (IC) has been affected by having a parent-in-law with any

ADL limitations (z).

                                                 8
                                                        ( y1  y 0 )
                                        IV Wald 
                                                      ( IC 1  IC 0 )

In this sense, βIV-Wald can be interpreted as a local average treatment effect (LATE) (Imbens and

Angrist, 1994; Angrist et al., 1996; Angrist and Evans, 1998). Robust standard errors for these

Wald estimators can be easily obtained by running regression models with the only endogenous

explanatory variable of informal care for parent(s)-in-law and one IV of whether either parent-in-

law has ADL limitations. In a similar way, we also calculate Wald estimators for the samples of

daughters, using a different binary instrument of whether either mother or father has any ADL

limitations.

       As a next step, we conduct falsification tests of the Wald estimator by using the wrongly

matched instrument for each sample; namely using the instrument of whether either mother or

father has any ADL limitations to predict the probability of providing informal care for parents-

in-law for the sample of daughters-in-law, and using the instrument of whether either the mother-

in-law or father-in-law has any ADL limitations to predict the probability of providing informal

care for parents for the sample of daughters. The Wald estimators from these falsification tests

should not produce sensible results.

       We then estimate the full IV models controlling for other observable characteristics.

These other characteristics include daughter(-in-law)'s age, education, wealth, home ownership,

health insurance, and whether both parents(-in-law) are living together. In this step, we use two

instruments for each sample, allowing for overidentification: whether the mother-in-law has any

ADL limitations (z1) and whether the father-in-law has any ADL limitations (z2) for the sample

of daughters-in-law, and whether the mother has any ADL limitations (z1) and whether the father

has any ADL limitations (z2) for the sample of daughters. We use specification tests to assess the

instrument validity and the exogeneity of the potentially endogenous variable of informal care.
                                                      9
       Another potential method of dealing with endogeneity is to use longitudinal data and

exploit within-individual variations while also possibly controlling for baseline health status

(Coe and Van Houtven, 2009). Our data from South Korea have only three waves and thus have

limited variation between waves in key variables. We estimated random- and fixed-effects

models as well as models including lagged health variables, but found most estimation methods

show signs of insufficient variation and limited sample size, particularly for the models with a

binary dependent variable. Given the data limitations, our preferred method is the IV model

using repeated observations.

       As a sensitivity test, we repeat our analysis using logged informal care hours instead of

the indicator variable of informal caregiving, and examine whether accounting for the extent of

caregiving changes our main results. Because the results from the alternative specification

remain largely similar, we present our results using the specification of the indicator variable of

informal caregiving. Other results are available upon request.



4. DATA

       This study uses data from the first three waves (2006, 2008, and 2010) of the Korean

Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA). The KLoSA is a nationally representative study of non-

institutionalized South Korean adults aged 45 or older in 15 large administrative areas. The

KLoSA is designed to be comparable to aging panel studies from other regions, including the US

Health and Retirement Study and the European Survey of Health and Retirement in Europe (Boo

and Chang, 2006). The KLoSA contains detailed information on the respondents as well as their

children, siblings, and parents. In its first wave, conducted in 2006, 10,254 individuals (5,788

women) in 6,171 households were interviewed face-to-face using the computer-assisted personal



                                                 10
interviewing method. In the second (2008) and third (2010) waves, 84.7% and 77.2% of the

original sample were respectively followed up without replacement.

       We restrict our study sample to women with any living parents-in-law and women with

any living parents, leaving 2,531observations in the daughter-in-law sample and 4,110

observations in the daughter sample. Because information on parents-in-law can only be

identified among currently married women in our data, the daughter-in-law sample is smaller in

number than the daughter sample. There are 1,348 observations with both “any living parents-in-

law” and “any living parents.” After removing five observations with missing values for the

study variables, our main statistical analysis uses the final daughter-in-law (N=2,528) and

daughter (N=4,108) samples.



4.1. Outcome Variables

       Various outcome measures have been used to capture the effects of informal caregiving

on psychological and physical health as well as on health care use and medication (Schulz, 1990;

Haley et al., 1987; Pang, 2000; Yong and McCallion, 2003). In this study, we focus on physical

health outcomes, and health care use and costs, rather than psychological health outcomes,

because of the concern that psychological outcomes are likely prone to the family effect

(Bobinac et al., 2010).

       First, we define a dichotomous variable indicating pain affecting daily activities.

Caregiving often involves physical efforts and may produce physical pain. Moreover, individuals

with psychological distress often present with physical symptoms, which is known as

somatization (Pang, 2000). While this argument for somatization may raise the concern that pain

can result from the family effect, we believe this concern is lessened among daughter-in-law



                                                11
caregivers. Second, we construct a binary variable of fair to poor self-rated health to capture

overall subjective health. Although additional health variables are available from the data, most

of these variables are excluded because their psychological or disease-specific nature fails to

meet two criteria: being able to capture physical health and being sufficiently generic.

       Our health care use and costs variables are derived from information on outpatient care

use and regular prescription drug use in the past 12 months. We define a binary indicator

variable of any outpatient care use = 1 if the respondent reported having visited a doctor’s office

and hospital outpatient office, including the emergency room, at least once in the past 12 months.

For those with any outpatient care use, we create a continuous variable of the total out-of-pocket

spending for outpatient care paid by the respondent during the same period. We also create two

variables for regular prescription drug use in the same way as for outpatient care use: any regular

prescription drug use and out-of-pocket spending for regular prescription drug use conditional

on any use during the past 12 months. We focus on the use of outpatient care and prescription

drugs, rather than inpatient care use and other types of health care use that may be limited in

capturing the patient’s overall health status. Although our measures of health care use and costs

may reflect influences other than health status itself (e.g., insurance status and health seeking

behavior) and possibly pose concerns over the accuracy of reporting, we choose to use these

measures because they are relatively objective and they allow for summarizing multiple sources

of the negative health effects of caregiving. In presenting the potential effect of caregiving on

health care financing, the use of these measures becomes highly policy relevant. Because the

distribution of out-of-pocket spending shows the typical right-skewed pattern, we tested for the

most appropriate Box-Cox transformation and use the natural logarithm of these two cost




                                                 12
variables.



4.2. Explanatory Variables

       The key explanatory variable is a binary indicator variable of any informal care provided

to parents-in-law (daughter-in-law sample) or a binary variable of any informal care provided to

parents (daughter sample). In the KLoSA, ADL care was asked regardless of co-residential status,

but IADL care was only asked about care provided to non-co-residing parents(-in-law).

       Our statistical models control for a set of demographic and socioeconomic factors,

including age, education, home ownership, health insurance status, whether both parents(-in-law)

are living together, type of residential area, and survey year. In South Korea, every Korean

citizen is insured by either National Health Insurance or Medical Aid. Medical Aid, which is a

public assistance program for the poor and other specified groups, has two types. Medical Aid

Type 1 is for the poorer among the poor, and charges lower out-of-pocket costs than Type 2. In

addition to these statutory medical security programs, individuals can purchase supplemental

voluntary private health insurance for protection from the financial burden of out-of-pocket

medical expenditures.



5. RESULTS

       The main instrument is largely balanced across other covariates, providing evidence that

the instrument is unlikely to be correlated with anything other than the probability of being a

caregiver. Comparisons of the daughters-in-law by having at least one parent-in-law with ADL

limitations (Table 1A) show that the women are similar on all measured characteristics except

age, home ownership and, of course, caregiver status. Women with at least one parent-in-law



                                                13
with ADL limitations are slightly older on average (55.3 years versus 53.3 years) and are more

likely to own a home; 60.0% of these women provided informal care to their parents-in-law

compared with only 0.2% (4 out of 2,433) of the women who had parents-in-law without ADL

limitations. These four caregivers are non-residential caregivers who provided IADL care only.

Thus, parent-in-law ADL limitations satisfy one criteria for a good instrument, namely that it be

highly correlated with the potentially endogenous variable. The Wald estimators based on ADL

limitations for at least one parent-in-law show statistically significant adverse health effects

(p<0.1) in the outcome measures except for any outpatient care use and the log of out-of-pocket

prescription drug costs, conditional on any regular prescription drug use (see Table 1B). The

basic results also hold for the estimates that control for other covariates, as will be shown later.

       Group comparisons and Wald estimators for the daughter sample show similar patterns

(Table 2), although daughters having parent(s) with ADL limitations are also less educated, more

likely to be on the Medical Aid program, and are slightly older. Among daughters having

parent(s) with any ADL limitations, 26.3% provided informal care to their parent(s), while

informal caregiving was reported by only 0.3% (=10/3850) of women whose parent(s) had no

ADL limitations (last row of Table 2A). The Wald estimator for the difference in outcomes

measures based on parental ADL limitations show significant adverse effects (p<0.05) for all

outcome measures except the log of out-of-pocket prescription drug costs, conditional on any

regular prescription drug use (Table 2B).

       The falsification tests for the Wald estimators in Table 3 (based on the effect of parental

ADL limitation on the probability of providing informal care for parents-in-law in the daughter-

in-law sample and that of parent-in-law ADL limitation on the probability of providing informal

care for parents in the daughter sample) show no statistically significant adverse health outcomes



                                                  14
(p<0.10), even suggesting beneficial effects. The estimated differences in outcomes are

extremely large for many measures and have large standard errors. The erratic results from using

a “nonsensical” instrument for each sample, combined with the Wald estimators shown in Tables

1B and 2B, suggest that the differential probabilities of providing parental care induced by

conceptually appealing instruments (i.e., the presence of functionally dependent parents or

parents-in-law for the corresponding sample of daughters or daughters-in-law) can be used to

identify the estimated health effects of caregiving. Therefore, the main limitation of the Wald

estimators in Tables 1B and 2B is the fact that they are based only on the allocation into groups

according to ADL status of parents (for the daughter sample) and parents-in-law (for the

daughter-in-law sample) and do not adjust for any of the observed characteristics of the women.

       The relatively high proportions of women (daughters or daughters-in-law) who respond

to the corresponding instruments of ADL status (for parents or parents-in-law) by providing care,

and the negligible proportion of women providing care for parents or parents-in-law without

ADL limitations suggest that the instruments should have a strong predictive power in the first-

stage regression (Angrist et al., 1996). Indeed, the indicators of ADL limitations among parents

or parents-in-law are essentially the most important predictors of informal caregiving by

daughters or daughters-in-law (Table 4), which is not surprising since those IVs are the reason

for providing parental care. The F-test at the bottom of Table 4 indicates the instruments are

strong (F-statistics 86 and 37). In contrast, most other factors have small coefficients and fail to

reach statistical significance at the 10% level. All else being equal, having both parents(-in-law)

living together reduces the probability of a daughter(-in-law) providing care by 0.8 (1.4)

percentage points, and these effects are statistically significant despite the small magnitude. The




                                                 15
surprisingly small magnitude is likely reflected in the small proportion (<20%) of daughters(-in-

law) with both parents(-in-law) living together in our study sample (Tables 1 and 2).

       Table 5 provides the IV estimates of the effect of caregiving on health outcomes and the

results from specification tests (for overidentification and exogeneity) for the separate samples of

daughters-in-law and daughters. The tests for overidentification (column 8) show support for

valid identification in all models. The tests for exogeneity are more equivocal, with statistical

evidence of endogeneity in five of the 12 models estimated.

       For the daughter-in-law sample, the models show an adverse impact of caregiving on

caregiver health for the following outcome measures (p<0.10, the magnitude of effect in

parenthesis): having pain affecting daily activities (13 percentage points), having fair or poor

self-reported health (16 percentage points), and out-of-pocket outpatient care costs if any use (47

percent), although the specification test does not reject exogeneity of the IV-Probit estimates.

       For the daughter sample, the models show an adverse impact of caregiving on caregiver

health for the following outcome measures (p<0.10, the magnitude of effect in parenthesis):

having pain affecting daily activities (41 percentage points), having fair or poor self-reported

health (56 percentage points), having any outpatient care use (30 percentage points), out-of-

pocket outpatient care costs if any use (75 percent) and having any regular prescription drug use

(34 percentage points).

       No beneficial and statistically significant impacts on health outcomes from caregiving

were estimated for any model, as expected. Therefore, although controlling for additional

covariates in a full IV framework reduced the number of health measures with adverse impacts

from caregiving, adverse impacts from caregiving appears to have occurred for a number of

measures. We find that most of the coefficient estimates on the alternative specification of



                                                 16
logged informal care hours do not change qualitatively from the coefficient estimates on the

indicator variable of caregiving (Table 6), suggesting the robustness of our results.



6. DISCUSSION

          Our results suggest that informal care has adverse health effects along multiple

dimensions for daughter-in-law caregivers in South Korea. Our study has carefully tested for the

possibility that selection into caregivers by health status might affect the estimation results of

caregiver health effects. In doing so, we show IV estimation can help control for endogeneity,

starting with more intuitive Wald estimators.

          The main methodological contribution of this paper is that our IV approach solves the

problem of endogeneity and allows us to estimate causal parameters. The LATE interpretation is

directly meaningful because the instruments are directly related to why most informal care is

provided. Informal care is more likely provided when an elderly family member has more ADL

limitations. Finding appropriate instruments has been a problem in this literature, making most of

the published results inconclusive about the causal effects of informal caregiving on caregivers'

health.

          This study has limitations. First, because of the multiple eligibility criteria required for

our IV estimation (e.g., currently married women aged 45 and over with any living parent-in-

law) combined with the strict definition of caregiving in the data (i.e., not including co-

residential IADL caregiving), our daughter-in-law sample has a modest size with a small number

of caregivers, even after three waves of data are combined. One related concern is that our

estimates may have been influenced by possible outliers when outcome variables are continuous.

Further examining our data, however, excludes this possibility because extreme outliers for the



                                                    17
two continuous outcome variables were observed in the comparison group (i.e., non-caregiver)

rather than the treatment group (i.e., caregiver). Second, we focus on obtaining valid population-

level estimates of the health effects of informal care, and our models do not account for specific

caregiving contexts. Our data do not allow for examining contextual factors: whether the care

recipient showed problem behaviors often seen in patients with Alzheimer’s dementia; how

important the caregiver’s choice was in the caregiving decision; what the quality of the dyadic

relationship between caregiver and care recipient was; what the main type of caregiving tasks

was; and whether the caregiver had role conflict. These limitations, of course, apply to all studies

that use large national data sets. Although many of these factors may moderate the health effects

of caregiving, several subgroup analyses attempted were limited by small sample sizes even

when necessary variables were available. Third, our data do not allow for examining potentially

differential effects by phase and duration of caregiving. On the one hand, caregiver health effects

can be more pronounced in the earlier phases than later phases. New caregivers may experience

numerous changes in their lives and suffer adverse health effects. On the other hand, it is also

possible that caregivers who have provided care for an extended period may have poorer health

outcomes than new caregivers. The accumulation of longitudinal data would help in accounting

for this heterogeneity in future research.

       Despite these limitations, we found statistically significant effects of providing informal

care on the health of caregivers. In addition to effects on specific measures of health, we found

that health care costs of caregivers increased. Thus, given the public financing of health care in

South Korea, there are potential tradeoffs between encouraging informal care over long-term

care for elders and expending more on the caregiver’s health care.




                                                 18
       Our study has two policy implications. First, the results support the perspective that

informal caregiving is an emerging public health issue (Talley and Crews, 2007). Our results

suggest that caregivers may suffer multiple negative health effects across many domains of

physical health. Given the demographic trends in South Korea and a strong tradition of informal

care, the number of female informal caregivers will likely grow sharply.

       Second, our results on increased health care costs among informal caregivers suggest that

informal caregiving also has direct economic costs that partially offset any savings from lower

formal health care costs for elderly. Estimating the costs of informal care has traditionally

focused on the opportunity costs of caregivers’ time (Arno et al., 1999; Van Houtven and Norton,

2008). Our results, however, suggest that cost-effectiveness analyses related to long-term care

policies also need to take into account the health care costs associated with informal caregiving.

Notes: NS denotes 'not significant' at the 10% level. Logarithm of weekly care hours was used. F-statistics for first-stage
regressions were 26 in the four IV-Probit models and 23 and 12 in the two conditional IV-2SLS models. The same set of
control variables were used as in Table 5. One observation was dropped because of missing value for caregiving hours.
