                    Acknowledgments

I am grateful to the aid of Professors John R. Meyer, Anthony C.
Oettinger, and Robert A. Leone for guiding this research and
reviewing earlier drafts of this paper. Errors are, of course,
mine alone.
     Usually transportation/communication (tic) considerations appear as only

two in a long list of factors which determine headquarters location patterns.

The research reported here singles out tic considerations as the logical

basis for headquarters location decisions. The primary probe -is: to what

degree    do transportation/communication consideration explain the patterns of
headquarters location? The case of manufacturing firms with five or more
establishments and no manufacturing activity at the headquarters location was
examined. The tic considerations were studied in terms ofd the advantages of
close     proximity between the headquarters of        a firm   and   the manufacturing
establishments of that firm and the advantages of close proximity between the
headquarters of one firm and the headquarters of other firms. The findings
of this research show that the logic of headquarters location patterns is
heavily dependent on t/c considerations.
      An   understanding of the implication of tic considerations for headquarters
logistics is a prerequisite for assessing the            potential impact of changes in

 informationand transportation technologies on headquarters location patterns
 and for developing policy in this area. Since industrial logistics play such             a

large     role in   determining the shape of cities1,      this probe also has wider
public    policy interest.



 Introduction

      There are essentiafly two approaches to the analysis of the location of

manufacturing firms in the logistics literature. First, progress has been made

 in actually describing patterns of manufacturing location, especially for urban

 areas.     For example, Hoover and Vernon2 identify three locational zones —— core,

 inner ring, and      outer   ring ——   for   the New York Metropolitan Region. They go on

 to classify certain special industry clusters, such as communication—oriented
industries,aid begin t investigate factors in the dynamics of location decisions ——

agglomeration, the incubator hypothesis, and the search for space. An important
spur to the quantification of these portrayals has been the development and

exploitation of massive data banks.    Descriptive   and exploratory studies which

make heavy use of data have added new dimensions to the discussion of manufacturing

location. Leone's time series analysis of marginal establishments3 and the

Regional Plan Association's project on the office industry in New York are

examples of this new breed of descriptive logistics study.
                                                             U
     The second direction of research takes a comparative cost approach to

determining where industrial establishments should locate on the basis of

varying factor prices. These studies create prescriptive models based on

microeconomic theory and decision analysis and compare the predictions of those

mo.els with actual locational patterns. Isard follows the comparative cost

approach on the national level by looking at regional cost differentials for

the petrochemical, iron and steel, and aluniinim industries. 5   Similarly, Kemper

uses regression analysis to relate the locations of industry births to sixteen

industry characteristics in five zones of the New York Metropolitan region.6

Daly and Webber review much of the prescriptive models literature dealing with

industrial distributions in cities7.

     Both of these approaches to logistics stress the importance of t/c considera-

tions. Some examples from each approach will be presented. On the descriptive

side, Leone conjectures that8:

          communication advances appear to be weakening the spatial ties
          between establishments in multiëstablishment firms, thereby
          facilitating the process of land use specialization.

He goes on to write9:

          An important technological factor has been the improvement in
          communications made possible by expanded low—cost intercity
          telephone service and electronic data processing and transmission.
          Within urban areas, this has been a force for decentralization.
        In contrast with Leone?s fin.ings, the report   of the   Regional Plan Association

        points out the enduring importance of personal communication which encourages a

        high concentration of offices10:

                  There is a clear preference of headquarters for the Manhattan
                  Central Business District, where 80 percent of the Region's —
                  and nearly 20 percent of the nation's —— headquarters jobs are
                  located... The determining locational factor here certainly
                  would seem to be the facilitation of face—to—face communication
                  by executive decision—makers in an "environment" of high intention.

             Transportation/communication considerations have also been handled by the

•       prescriptive modelers of manufacturing logistics. The folThwing passage from

        Daly and Webber shows how changes in transportation and communication technologies
    •
        have affected the comparative cost approach to logistics11:

                  Up to the third decade of the twentieth century the Weberian
                  least—cost location models could be applied to the intra—city
                  case; there were considerable savings in transport costs for firms
                  which located close to the city center and the major rail terminals...
                  The situation has changed drastically over the past 30 years:
                  factories have dispersed over broad areas of the city; the types of
                  manufacturing have diversified; technological change has been
                  rapid; the marketsof metropolitan-based firms have multiplied
                  throughout states and nations; and the manufacturing labor force
                  has spread from the central city to the suburbs. All of this
                  has weakened the importance of transport. costs in the firm' s
                  decision on where to locate within the city.

        As a result of these changes, the locational effects of least—cost modeling

        had to be re—examined and the role of t/c demands in those models had to be

        reassessed. It should be noted here that this paper will look at how t/c

        considerations affect the decision of where headquarters locate within the

        United States and not within a city. Entire cities will be used as units of

        analysis, with no concern for location within cities.

             This study will examine the t/c considerations in light of the basic

        structure of the firm. A multi—establishment firm is made up of branch and

        headquarters establishments, and each establishment does or does not carry on

        manufacturing activities. Most previous studies ignore the str'icture of firms
and deal solely with establishments. The spatial configuration of establishments
of   a firm   is   thereby neglected. However, in the study of the tic considerations

in the location of the headquarters of a firm, the location of the manufacturing

branches of the firm are clearly important.

       The   remainder of this paper is organized in four sections. The first
section      develops the location theory with regard to headquarters of multi-

establishment manufacturing firms. The specific hypotheses which will undergo

empirical testing are derived and. explained       in this section. The next section
explains the data base used in this study. This description should make the
reader aware of the possibilities and problems of the ensuing empirical analysis
using this data base. Third, the empirical aialysis is reviewed. Three
topics are covered: (A) Procedural decisions which serve as a bridge from the
ab'stract location theory to the use of data to test the hypotheses; (B) Empirical
evidence regarding the hypotheses and various        approaches to assessing the

significance of       the empirical results;   and (C) Empirical   evaluation of the macro—

bTpothesis      that the logic of headquarters location patterns is heavily dependent

on transportation/communication considerations. Finally, a brief conclusion

section      reviews the major findings of this research and       suggests   directions
for future      studies.


I Derivation of Five Specific Headquarters Location Hypotheses

       The macro—hypothesis of this research is that there exists an underlying

logic in the logistics of the multi—establishment firm and that the role of t/c

considerations in that logic can be assessed. This research will emphasize

the logic of the location of headquarters of multi—establishment firms.

The following diagram presents an overview of the hypotheses examined by

this research:

                Considerations in Headquarters Location Decisions


                                 Macro—Hypothesis:
                             Transportation! Communication
                             considerations are intrinsic
                             to the logic of headquarters




Weak Intrafirm hypothesis:                               Weak Interfirm Hypothesis:
Headquarters will locate with                            H&adqua.rters will locate with
regard to the spatial con-                               regard to the location of other
figuration of their, manufacturing                       headquarters of manufacturing
establishments.                                          firms.
                                                                        I
Headquarters will locate "near" at                       Headquarters  will locate in major
least one manufacturing establish-                       cities with the headquarters of
ment of the firm.                                        many other manufacturing firms.


                             Headquarter    will    locate
                             in the "center" of the
                             spatial configuration of
                             the manufacturing
                             establishments.

Strong Intrafirm hypothesis:                             Strong Interfirm Hypothesis:
Headquarters will locate "near"                          Headquarters will locate in the
the "largest" manufacturing                              major  city with the most other
establishment of the firm.                               headquarters of manufacturing
                                                         firms.



     The choice of location for the headquarters of the firm must take into

account both intrafirm and   interfirm   motives. These motives have been explained

in a number of qualitative analyses of headquarters logistics. Leone in

Location of Manufacturing Activity in the New York Metropolitan Area points out

the tension between intrafirm and interfirm motives12:
              Whereas the advantages of a New York City location for the
              control function in a business have always been great, given the
              proximity to the financial community, access to the educational
              and legal establishment, and so on, in the past these advantages
              have frequently been counterbalanced by the diseconomies of
              separating control functions from operating functions.

To make   the   association between Leone's terms "control functidns" and. "operating

functions"     and   the   distinction between headquarters and manufacturing establish-
ment activities, assume that the headquarters is concerned with control functions
and the manufacturing establishments are concerned with operating functions.
This   point   will be returned     to later in   the decision to look only at non—
manufacturing headquarters, that is firms which have no manufacturing activity
at their headquarters        locations. The Regional Plan Association study called

The   Office Industry: Patterns of Growtth and Location points to the         same two motives'3:

           Manufacturing tends to be directed from a detached front
              office and has both strong inward (production) and strong
              outward (market) linkages.
       Both   motives depend on tic considerations as       factors in the logistics of
the   headquarters. Before characterizing these motives more explicitly, it will

be helpful to introduce one piece of logistic jargon here. The tendency for the

headquarters of many        firms   to group together in major cities, with the headquarters

of any given firm locating in a major city primarily because the headquarters

of many   other      firms are located there, is called the agglomeration effect. The

agglomeration effect has an important role in the interfirm motive.

       An explicit definition of the two motives, with the appropriate inter-

pretation of the tic considerations, can now be stated:

       Intrafirrn Motive: the purpose of the headquarters is to tie together and

coordinate      the manufacturing establishments of the      firm. In this case, one

would   be    interested in the location of the headquarters with respect to the

manufacturing establishments of the firm. The exchanges and information flows
     are between the headquarters and the. manufacturing establishments of the firm.
     The cost and effectiveness of these exchanges and information flows can be

     influenced by the location of the headquarters.

            Interfirm Motive: the purpose of the headquarters is to solicit business

     for the firm, secure necessary inputs for the firm, and. provide connections with

     other firms. Here one would be interested in the location of the headquarters

     with respect to major cities where there will be an agglomeration of headquarters.

•    The exchanges and    information   flows are between the headquarters of the given
 •
     firm and the headquarters of other     firms. The cost and   effectiveness of these

     exchanges and information flows can be influenced bj the location of the

     headquarters of the given firm.

           The statements of two hypotheses follow directly from the definition of

     the intrafirm and interfirm motives. These hypotheses will be referred to as

     the weak hypotheses derived from the two motives.

           Weak Intrafirm Hypothesis: headquarters will located with regard to the

     spatial configuration of their manufacturing establishments. The patterns of

     headquarters locations will show that the location of the headquarters of a firm

     is chosen to be either in close proximity to at least one of the manufacturing
     establishments of the firm or toward the center of the spatial configuration of
     the manufacturing establishments.
           Weak   Interfirm Hypothesis:    ladquarters will locate   with regard to the
     location of headquarters of other manufacturing firms. The patterns of headquarters
     locations will show    that the location of the headquarters of a firm    is chosen to
     be   in close proximity to many other manufacturing headquarters and hence in
     one of the major commercial cities of the country.
           Each of these weak   hypotheses can   be strengthened in specificity. If the
    intrafirm motive is a valid primary interpretation ofthe logic underlying the

    location of the headquarters for multi—establishment firms, then the headquarters

    should   be located either "near" at least one of the manufacturing establishments
    of the firm or toward the "center" of the spatial configuration of the manufacturing
    establishments. (The research approach to the concepts of distance and
    centrality, given the limitations of the available data base, will      be discussed
•

    in section Ill—a.) If the headquarters must be "near" at least one of the

    manufacturing establishments, is there any particular estalishment it should be

    "near" more often than any other? If one establishment must be chosen, the most

•
    obvious justification on the conceptual level exists for assuming that it must

    be the "largest" manufacturing establishment. (The handling of size will be

    discussed in section Ill—a.) Two lines of reasoning are presented for the

    derivation of this strong intrafirm hypothesis:

           Infrafirm Consideration Justification: this pattern may yield closer

    contact between administration personnel and the      most important and/or greatest
    number of operation personnel with lower exchange and information flow cost and

    higher effectiveness. The cost and effectiveness are related to the trans—

    porttion and communication of: (1) services provided by the headquarters for

    the   manufacturing establishments; and   (2) Information   demands made of the
    manufacturing establishment by the headquarters. Other characteristics of the
    manufacturing   establishments being equal, both of these regards should increase

    with the size of the   manufacturing establishment. Furthermore, the cost should
    increase   and the effectiveness decrease with the distance from the manufacturing

    establishment to the headquarters.
        Interfirm Considerations Justification: the need to interface with other

firms    in   the supply of inputs and the marketing of outputs will be greater for

the   largest manufacturing      establishment. These are the types of services

provided by the headquarters. Also, the firm's demands for interfaces with

other firms will more likely center about the largest manufacturing establisbmen—

than any of the smaller manufacturing establishments.

      Note that in this case the interfjrni considerations justification operates

on a secondary level and has nothing to do with the agglomeration of headquarters.

Instead, the interfirm considerations here recognize the need of the operating

functions     of   a manufacturing establishment to interface with         other firms, with
this interface      usually carried out via the headquarters.

      Other    stronger forms of the intrafirm motive, such as that the firm will
locate its headquarters "near" the highest concentration of its manufacturing
establishments,      are   possible   but will   not   be explored in this paper.
      Next, examine the stroner form of the interfirm motive. Following the
agglomeration effect leads to this hypothesis: the major city with the most
headquarters       of manufacturing firms will have        many more headquarters than   any

other   major city. From the logic of the agglomeration effect, the process

resulting in this situation is as follows: let A and B be two major cities

with the number of      headquarters of manufacturing firms         in A greater than the

number   in B. Firm X has to decide where to locate its headquarters. If X
emphasizes the interfirm motive, it         will       choose to locate its headquarters in
some major city to be close to the headquarters of firms with which it interacts15

Assume that X has only A and B from which to choose for the location of its

headquarters in a major city. Then, all other               factors such as the distribution of
headquarters by industry and size being equal for A and B, X will choose to

locate in A because, under the interfirm motive, X wants its headquarters to be

near as many other headquarters as possible. Hence, the number of headquarters

in A has increased both absolutely and relative to B. Finally, there will be a

tipping phenomenon,and several headquarters in B may choose to move to A for

the same reasons of the interfirin motive, while any reverse flow would be unlikely.

      Of course in the real world major cities do offer certain regional

advantages, and they do differ in the distribution of.-headquarters by industry.

These aspects also influence the super—agglomeration forces, that is the forces

which lead to an extremely heavy concentration of headquarters in one city. This

form of the strong interfirm motive can also be analyzed from the perspective

of models of micromotives and macrophenomenal6 and gravity and potential models17.

      The   statements of the strong hypotheses derived from the intrafirm and
interfirm   motives will be suinniarized as follows:
      Strong   Intrafirm hypothesis: headquarters will locate with regard to   the
location    of their "largest"xnanufacturing establishments. The patterns of

headquarters    locations   will show that the location of the headquarters of a firm

is   chosen to be in close proximity to the "largest" manufacturing     establishment.

      Strong Interfirm Hypothesis: headquarters will locate with regard to the

location of the greatest number of headquarters of other manufacturing firms.

The patterns of headquarters locations will show that the location of the

headquarters of a firm is chosen to be in the major city with the greatest

number of headquarters of other manufacturing firms, which will have     far more
headquarters    of manufacturing firms   than any   other city.
    II      The Data Base

•           The data provided by Dun   &   Bradstreet's Marketing Services Division called

    Dun's Market Identifiers (DM1) enable micro—analysis of multi—establishment

    manufacturing     firms. The DM1   contains essentially five types
                                       file                                        of   information
    on establishments relevant for the analysis of this paperl8:
            (1) Line of Business: by Standard Industrial Classification (sic) number
            (2) Size: by nnua1 Sales Volume, Number of Employees, and. Net Worth
            (3) Location: by State, Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA),
                           County, City, or Zip Code
            ()   Activity: by manufacturing or non—manufacturing establishment
            (5) Relation of this establishment to a firm:           by single establishment
                            firm, headquarters,       or branch
    Without the support of the DM1         file,   it would have been impossible to pursue this
    research. No her computer analysis oriented data source provides such detail
    on manufacturing    establishments      and    allows   the researcher to deal with   establish-

    ments both     individually and grouped by firms. Nevertheless, it is important

    to keep three shortcomings of the DM1 file in mind when reviewing the research

    design and conclusions of this study. The three problem areas are: (i) file

    accuracy; (2) the concept of distance; and (3) the nature of the multi—establishment

    firm.

            (1) File Accuracy: Spot checks of corporate annual reports and Moody's

    Industrial     Manual show that the DM1 file misses some establishments but has no
    establishments     not reported in the other sources. Part of          the problem    may be

    in the hazy definition of what constitutes a manufacturing establishment.

    Different sources use different criteria. For example, an establishment that

    is primarily a warehouse may be called a plant by Moody's but not qualify as a

    manufacturing establishment for DM1. It is hard to say which is the more

    reliable source and how exactly a plant differs from a manufacturing establishment.
       Although potential file inaccuracy is a serious difficulty, the basic

findings of this research would    not   be adversely affected by the types of

discrepancies found. All     reporting   of headquarters and branch locations in the

DM1 file agrees exactly with statements of corporate annual reports and Moody's.

Any additions   of manufacturing establishments to the file data on a firm would
strengthen   the statistical results, as will be seen in section 111—C.

(2) Concept of Distance: although the DM1 file codes the location of each

establishment byfive different spatial units, no ready means of calculating
the distance between establishments is built into the file. Beneath the technical
problems of adding to the file geographical distances or coordinates lies a level
of conceptual difficulties. Does it make sense to use geographic distance to
measure how "near" one establishment is to another? Why not use air         or   land
                                    .            .
travel time?19 Why not use transportation or counication costs as indicators
of   the readiness for   inter—establishment linkage? More thought is required on
this   problem, and it is probably true that no simple addition to the DM1 file

could completely satisfy the requirement for a useful measure of distance.

This problem will limit the evaluation of the intrafirm motive, as will be seen

in section 111—A.

       (3) Nature of the Multi—establishment Firm: the SIC     codes of   the establish-

ments in a multi-establishment firm give some indication of whether a firm is

vertically or horizontally integrated. However, there is no information about

the inter—relationship of the manufacturing establishments in a firn, the

interaction   between the headquarters and each establishment of the firm, or the

linkage between the headquarters of one firm and the headquarters of other firms.

Certainly, the degree of linkage between the headquarters and a manufacturing

establishment of the firm varies across manufacturing      establishments   and is not

solely   dependent on the size of the manufacturing establishment. However, no
information on these relationships exists in the DM1 file. Once again, this is

as much a conceptual problem as a data problem. Difficulties arising from this

limitation are noted in sections 111—A and 111—C.


III. Empirical Testing of the Locational Hypotheses

A. Procedural Decisions

       The transition from the construction of hy-potheses for headquarters location

to   the testing of   the hy-potheses via the DM1    file required   four procedural

decisions.      Those decisions   concerned:     (1) which manufacturing firms   to
include      in the analysis; (2) handling of subsidiaries; (3) use of spatial or

geographic units instead of distances; and (4) measurement of the size of

establishments. Each of these decisions will          be briefly reviewed.
       (1)   Which manufacturing establishments to include in the analysis:

a multi—establishment firm is defined as any firm with two or more establishments.

This study only looks at a subset of multi—establishment firms, those with five

or more establishments and d.th non-manufacturing headquarters. The decision to

look at those firms with non—manufacturing headquarters was made in order to

strengthen the association between headquarters location and solely the location

of t1e control functions of the firm. One can conjecture without too much

abstraction from reality that the firms with non—manufacturing, or separate,

headquarters      locations respond purely     to the intrafirm and interfirm motives and

the   t/c considerations   therein. On the       other hand, the analysis of those firms
which do some manufacturing at their headquarters location must include

questions dealing with where to locate a manufacturing establishment. Leone

includes      in the questions fo4he location of a manufacturing       establishment
                20
measures of
       (1) Material assembly requirements;
       (2) Labor assembly needs by skill;
       (3) Land assembly needs with specification of any topographic
           requirements;
       (4) The reletive importance of face—to—face interaction with
           suppliers and customers;
       (5) inter- and. intra—city transportation requirements; and.
       (6) Service assembly needs.

Although   some of these location factors overlap with the TTp.Ljre?t headquarters
location factors,    they are far from the logic of the intrafirm and interfirm

motives. To rephrase this point, the goal of this research project is to find

out to what degree simple t/c considerations can explain headquarters location.

It is understood that these considerations are not tie only location factors for

any headquarters, non—manufacturin or manufacturing. Nevertheless, it will be

much   simpler to   assess the importance of t/,c considerations in headquarters

location decisions in the case of non—manufacturing headquarters where these

considerations should have a much greater weight than in the case of manufacturing

headquarters. If they are minimal under these "pure" restrictions, they are

even less likely to be important in the "mixed" case. Finding a significant

effect in the pure case leaves open the option to assess the mixed case.

       Unless the sample size were intolerably reduced by the assumption of

separate headquarters, it would be unwise to pollute the t/c considerations at

this time. As a result      of this decision, 1568 manufacturing multi—establishment
firms with separate headquarters locations were selected.

       The other component of the restriction is the limitation to firms of five

or more establishments. The underlying proposition is that multi—establishment

firms with large numbers of establishments are fundamentally different from

those of a small number of establishments. Firwith a large number of

establishments are, in general, less localized, have a more dispersed spatial

configuration of establishments, and have a higher magnitude of intrafirm and
interfirm demands on the headquarters. The role of t/c considerations seems

likely to assume a greater weight in the location factors for the headquarters

of   a large multi—establishment firm.      The decision to use five as the dividing

line   between small and large multi—establishment firms      was somewhat   arbitrary
and intuitive. Once again, unless the sample size would become          intolerably
small,   it   would be advantageous to limit   the   sample in this analysis to those
firms having a heavier dependence on t/c considerations in the choice of

headquarters location. This decision reduced the total sample of 1,568

multi—establishment    manufacturing firms   with    separate headquarters in the DM1
file   to a aample of 263 firms   with   five or more establishments for the rear    1971.

       (2) Handling of subsidiaries: the data of the DM1 file allow the researcher
to   distinguish establishments of a non—affiliated firm, a subsidiary       firm,   and   a
parent   firm. The analysis which follows combines these three types of firms.

If a firm of any one of these three types has five or more establishments and

a separate headquarters location, it was included in this analysis. The findings

show that it may have been wiser to limit the analysis to non—affiliated firms

or to find an alternative way of regarding the location of the headquarters of

a subsidiary or parent firm. This aspect of the findings will be pointed out

later in section 111—C.

       (3) Use of spatial units instead of distances: as was ex.p1.ned in

section II, the concept of distance between establishments is very tricky on

the theoretical level, and no measures of distance or locational coordinates are

included in the DM1 file. Yet, it was noted in the section on locational theory

that some approach to the closeness of two establishments is vital for testing

the hypotheses, especially those dealing with the intrafirm motive. As a

surrogate for distance, this analysis will ask whether or not two establishments

are in the same spatial unit. Recall that the DM1 file codes each establishment
by five spatial units —— state, SMSA, county, city, and zip code. Analysis
of whether the headquarters of a firm is "near" any manufacturing establishment
of that firm was conducted on two levels: (1) Is any manufacturing establishment
in the same state as the headquarters? and (2) Is any manufacturing establishment
in   the same city as the headquarters? Obviously, disproportionate weight is

given to the boundary lines between states and cities by this method. This

proôedure is far from totally satisfactory for an exact analysis of the logistics
of headquarters, but it will suffice for the present initial analysis of the
                                                               S

intrafirm and interfirm motives.
       In order to compensate for the spillover of certain metropolitan areas
beyond city and state boundaries, two special units were defined. If two
establishments are in the same special unit, then they are counted as being          in

the same state and in the    same city. The first special unit encompasses the
New   York Metropolitan Area. The twenty—two counties in New York, New Jersey,
and Connecticut named by Hoover and Vernon in Anatomy of a Metropolis21 were
combined to comprise this special unit. The     second special unit   covers   the

Chicago   Metropolitan Area. This area extends over eight countries, six in
Illinois   and   two in Indiana. Additional special units, to cover such interstate
metropolitan areas as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania —    New   Jersey and Kansas   City,

Missouri — Kansas, may be useful in future research.
            One consequence of the replacement of measures of distance by       spatial
units   is that it is not possible to analyze centrality. Analysis of whether

headquarters follow the form of the weak intrafirm hypothesis stating "locate

in the 'center' of the spatial configuration of manufacturing establishments"

is beyond the scope of this study. Hence, it will only be possible to identify

those firms with headquarters in the same spatial unit as a manufacturing establish-

ment as firms follodng the t/c considerations of the weak intrafirm hypothesis.

This approach may affect the evaluation of that hypothesis.
            (it) Measurement of the size of establishments: section II mentioned that

    the DM1    file   has three types of size indicators ——      annual sales volume, number
    of employees, and net worth. However, annual sales volume and net worth data

    only apply on the firm level. For multi—establishment firms, the only size

    indicator on each establishment is the number of employees. Still, this

    indicator is quite saitsfactory for present purposes. Given this indicator

    of   size, the "largest" establishment in the firm refers to the establishment of
•   the largest employment size.
•
    B. Empirical Results
            Four   hypotheses derived from   the intrafirm and   interfirm   motives in
    section    I and further defined in   section 111—A will be empirically examined
    here.    The macro—hypothesis will be tested in section 111—C. Before proceeding

    with the findings, it is important to       make one additional distinction clear.
    Each of the four hypotheses      makes certain predictions about the locational

    patterns of headquarters. However, finding that the behavior of a firm

    corresponds to the prediction of one of the hypotheses does not necessarily mean

    that the firm is consciously locating with regard to the t/c considerations of

    the hypothesis. In other words, there is a certain element of randomness of

    behavior which may be mistaken for sensitlyity to t/c considerations. The

    headquarters      of a firm may just happen to be in the same state as a manufacturing
    establishment of the firm with no regard for the intrafirm motive. Likewise,
    the headquarters of a firm may just happen to be in a major city wi•th no
    regard for the interfirin motive. Use the phrE.se behaving inacord. with the
    predictions of an hypothesis to refer to any firm whose behavior corresponds
    to the predictions of aihypothesis, regardless of intent. Use the phrase

    following      an hypothesis to refer to any firm whose   behavior corresponds to the
                                            —.10—




predictions   of an h-pothesis by design rather than by random chance.. Various

null models will be proposed in the analysis of the findings to try              to   distinguish

firms following an hypothesis from all others.

      The mode of presentation of each hypothesis has three components. First,

the hypothesis is stated and a table of the empirical findings which will be

used to test the hypothesis is shown. Note that the findings are not an

adequate test in and of themselves. Next, a null model or set of mull models

is used to distinguish firms following the hypothesis fromthose behaving in

accord with the hypothesis but by chance. Finally, some general conclusions

about the hypothesis will be stated based on the comparison between the null

models and the actual occurrences of firms behaving in accord with the

predictions of an hypothesis. This order will be modified slightly for the

joint testing of the weak and strong intrafirm hypotheses.

      This research will show that there is convincing support for all four

hypotheses —— weak intrafirrn, strong intrafirin, weak inerfirm, and strong

interfirm. The tic considerations of those hypotheses play major roles in

headquarters location decisions.

      Hypothesis I:     (Weak Intrafirm Hypothesis) Headguarters will, locate "near"

at least one manufacturing establishment of the firm. Two              levels   of spatial

units, state and   city,   are   used   in the analysis   of   whether the headquarters is

close   to a manufacturing establishment of the firm. Recall that the two special
units   for the New   York and Chicago Metropolitan Areas are used in           this analysis.

Table 1 displays the results for the 263 manufacturing firms with five or more

establishments and a separate headquarters location, with firms             distributed
by   the ni.nber of establishments in the firm.

                                 A
          it is tempting to jump to the conclusion that the hypothesis is

satisfied for both spatial units. It seems to be especially obvious that

firms with a high number of establishments behave in accord with the predictions

of the hypothesis. However, to conclude that firms with a high number of

establishments have a greater propensity to follow the weak intrafirin motive

just from these figures may be misleading since firms in the higher categories

simply have more establishments spread around than those in lower categories.

A strong null model, based on these figures, and the results for the next

hypothesis together will help estimate the number of firms following the

weak intrafirni hypothesis. The data for the next hypothesis will be presented

before the application of the null model and statement of general conclusions

about the weak intrafirni hypothesis.


     Hypothesis II:   (Strong Intrafirm Hypothesis) Headquarters will locate

"near" the manufacturing establishment of the largest size of the firm.

       A combinatorial argument will be used to develop a more exact approach

to the evaluation of the results for hypotheses I and         II.   The point of this

approach is that not all firms behaving in accord with the predictions of the

hypotheses need necessarily be following the intrafirm motive. Also, it is

not possible by casual observation to determine which firms are only following

the   weak intrafirm hypothesis and which      are also following the strong intrafirm

hypothesis.

       The argument starts by assuming that there are    possible decision
                                                            three

rules which a firm may use with regard to the intrafirm motive:
      Decision Rule #1. Locate the headquarters randomly, without regard
                         for the location of the manufacturing establishments
                            of the firm.
      Decision   Rule #2. Locate the headquarters in the same state as any
                          manufacturing establishment, without regard for the
                          size of the manufacturing establishment.
      Decision Rule   #3.   Locate the headquarters in the same state as       the
                            manufacturingestablishment of the largest
                            employment size.
The state was chosen as the spatial unit because       it   facilitates   the ensuing
combinatorial    argument. Mathematical details of the null model are presented

in Appendix A. The null model estimates the number of firms following each of

the three decision rules for firms grouped by the number of establishments per

firm. The   model works on the type of      data presented in Tables 1 and    2.
Results   of the null model estimates for firms with five to nineteen establishments

per firm are given in Table 3. Due to the small sample size for firms with

more than nineteen establishments, the model tended to break down for the higher

establishments per firm     categories22.

     Two conclusions will be drawn fromthis analysis.         First,   the weak intrafirm

motive las a great deal of influence on location decisions for headquarters.

According to the null model, a mean of 64.7%     of   the firms with five to nineteen

establishments and   separate   headquarters follow the weak intrafirm hypothesis.

In only four of the fifteen size categories does a majority 'of firms behave

randomly, i.e. without regard fthe basic intrafirm motive. Note also that the

correspondence between the percent of firms following Decision Rule #1 and

the number of establishments per firm is weak. Second, the strong intrafirm

motive also has a large role in the logic of headquarters location. In fact,

the null model shows that in six of the fifteen size categories the percent

of firms following the strong intrafirm motive, Decision Rule #3, is higher

than the percent of firms following the weak but not strong intrafirm motive,

Decision Rule #2. Once again, there is no powerful correlation between the

percent following Decision Rule #3 and the number of establishments per firm.

More analysis in the direction of determining the mean percent of establishments

in the same state as the largest establishment of a firm would be necessary

in further evaluation of the strong intrafirm hypothesis.

     This concludes the analysis of results pertaining to hypotheses I and II.

       Hypothesis III: (Weak Interfirni Hypothesis) Headquarters will     locate     in

major    cities with the headquarters of many other   firms.   The following   ten
cities   with the highest number of headquarters of manufacturing     firms with five
or   more establishments and separate headquarters will be used as the major -
cities    for this analysis. Listed by frequency of headquarters location in

that city, these ten are:

             (1) New York Metropolitan Area
             (2) Pittsburgh
             (3) Chicago
             (4) Cincinnati
             (5) Dallas

             (8) St. Louis
             (9) Houston
            (iO) Boston
The actual    frequencies of headquarters location in each major city will be
given as part of the analysis of hypothesis IV. Table 4        displays   the results

of the analysis which used these ten cities:

            As in   the analysis   of   hypotheses I   and II, it   can   be very misleading to
    make claims from these data without an adequate null model. Two slightly

    different      null models   will be   applied   in testing hypothesis III.

            The   first null model proposes that the behavior of the manufacturing
    establishments can be taken as a predictor of headquarters behavior. In other
    words, this null model ignores the t/c considerations which, by the interfirm
    mo:tive,   are especially important to headquarters and, guide headquarters          to
•   locate in the ten major cities. A fourth decision rule for headquarters
•
    location is derived from this null model:

            Decision Rule #1. Locate the headquarters in major cities with the
                               same frequency as manufacturing establishments.

            The second model assumes that the headquarters behave like the average

    establishment, regardless of the presence o± absence of manufacturing activity,

    with regard to location in the major cities. Here the t/c considerations of

    the interfirm motive are        assumed to apply equally to both types of establishments,
    manufacturing     and non-manufacturing headquarters. A fifth decision rule to
    cover   this situation is:

         Decision Rule #5. Locate the headquarters in major cities with the
                            same frequency as any establishment.

         Appendix B provides the details of the construction andapplication of
    these null models. Although the null models could have been applied by
    category for number of establishments per firm, only the aggregate findings
    will be shown here. Null Model I estimates that there are 11.3 firms following
    Decision Rule #1k. Null Model II estimates that there are 20.5 firms following
    Decision      Rule #5. This    chart summarizes the results of this analysis:

     The   conclusion is that well over a majority of firms, either 69.0% or
65.6%, follow the weak interfirm motive. Headquarters are strongly attracted
to the major cities for the types of t/c considerations of the weak interfirm

motive.

     Now proceed to hypothesis IV, the strong form of the interfirm motive.

     Hypothesis IV: (Strong Interfirm Motive) Headquarters will locate such

that the major city with the most headquarters of manufacturing firms will have

many more headquarters of manufacturing firms than any other major city. Table

5 shows the tabulations for each of the ten major cities used to test the

extended   interfirm motive in bypothesis IV.

     The evidence definitely suggests accepting the strong form of the interfirm

motive. In fact, an interesting reflectionon the strength of the super—

agglomeration effect is that of the lL9 headquarters in the twenty—two counties

of the New York Meropo1itan Area, 14l are located in Manhattan. This evidence

supports the importance of face—to—face counication in the interfirm motive.

Is the strong interfirm hypothesis as well supported when the appropriate

null models are applied to the data? The null models used here are analogous to

the ones developed in Appendix B and   applied   to the data from hypothesis III.

Slight modifications of Decision Rules #4 and #5      are necessary to test hypothesis IV.
The new Decision Rules state:

     Decision Rule #I—a. Locate the headquarters in the city with the most
                         headquarters with the same frequency as
                         manufacturing establishments.

     Decision Rule #5—a. Locate the headquarters in the city with the most
                         headquarters with the same frequency as any
                         establishment.

Note that the null models have changed their focus from asking how many

headquarters of the 263 firms will randomly locate in the ten major cities to

asking how many headquarters of the 193 located ii the major cities will

randomly locate in New York. The modified version of Null Model I estimates

that 21.5 of the 193 headquarters located in the ten major cities will be

randomly distributed in New York by Decision Rule #4—a. Similarly, the

modified version of Null Model II estimates that 36.1 of the 193 headquarters

will end up in New. York by Decision Rule #5—a. The following chart presents

the results of this analysis:

Under either null   model,   a very high percent of the 193 firms, 61.5% or 58.3%,

follow the strong interfirm motive in locating their headquarters. The prediction

of the strong interfirm hypothesis, that the largest major city will be far

larger than any other in terms of number of headquarters of these firms, is

obviously definitely supported by the data in Table 5.

C. Examining the Macro—Hypothesis

       This research attempts to estimate the degree to which simple transportation!

conunication considerations can explain headquarters location. Of all the

locational factors important to the choice of headquarters location, we want

to discern whether simple hypotheses derived from only one type of locational

factor, t/c considerations, can be used to explain the patterns of headquarters

lopation. In the preceding section the empirical evidence concerning each one

of   the fouz hypotheses was   examined. The final question deals   with   the macro—

level   hypothesis. That hypothesis is:                             -



       Macro—Hypothesis:   Thansportation/Communication considerations are intrinsic
to the logic of headquarters location and can be used to explain patterns of
headquarters location. This hypothesis states that all firms will include in
their logistics logic the t/c considerations of headquarters location. Furthermore,
the macro—hypothesis predicts that the motives derived from these considerations
will explain patterns of headquarters location. In other words, the macro—
hypothesis predicts that every firm with five or more establishments arid a

separate headquarters will follow the intrafirm and/or interfirm motives for
headquarters   location. Table 6 shows    the data used to examine the macro-hypothesis.

NOTES:

4   Firms with headquarters not in one of the ten major cities whose headquarters in not in the same state

               These results are startling in the power of the t/c considerations which

        they indicate. Only 6 of the 263 firms, or 2.3%, do not behave in accord with

        the predictions of either the intrafirm or the interfirm motives derived from

        the t/c considerations. Of course, as the combinatorial and null models

        developed in the testing of botheses I to IV have shown, the percent of firms

        not following either the intrafirm or interfirm motives is definitely higher

        than   the 2.3%. A certain        percent   of the headquarters   seeking neither to locate

        in   the same state as one of the manufacturing establishments of the firm nor
        in a major city will end up in the same state as one of            the manufacturing

        establishments     of the firm and/or in a major city anyway. An appropriate null
        model for this situation is beyond the scope of this analysis. Still, it is
        extremely powerful for any single set of considerations to be directly related

        to the location patterns of so manyfirms.
               The six firms behaving in accord with neither the intrafirm nor the interfirin
        motives are:
                     (1) Hercules Inc.
                     (2) Marathon Oil Inc.
                     (3)   Textron Inc.
                     (1)   National Gypsum
                     (5)   CRA   Inc.
                     (6)   Colorado     Mnfg. Corp.
        wo characteristics        of this oup relate      o   aspects of the data base and   the
        procedural   decisions. First, the DM1 file          definition of a manufacturing
•       establishment excludes certain plants of these firms. For Hercules Inc., both

        the headquarters and a research center are located in Wilmington, Delaware.
4
        Similarly, Marathon Oil Co., with headquarters in Findlay, Ohio, has oil and gas
        lands located in Ohio. If research centers and mineral lands had been classified
        as manufacturing establishments by DM1, both of these firms would be in accord with
the intrafirm motive. Certainly, many of the same t/c considerations embodied
in the intrafirm motive apply to the types of plants not classfied as manufacturing
establishments by DM1. Second, the cases of subsidiary and parent firms appear
three times   in the list of six firms.     CRA Inc.   and   Colorado Mnfg. Corp. are

both subsidiaries   and   Taxtron   Inc. is a parent firm. The logic of the location
of headquarters for subsidiaries and parent firms is more complicated than
that   of non—affiliated firms. The role of tic considerations in the headquarters

location patterns for subsidiaries and parent firms should be reconsidered.

       Finally, it is interesting to look at the locationbf the 138 firms

which behave in accord with both the intrafirm and the interfirm motives.

A distinguishing characteristic of the New York Metropolitan Area emerges

in the data in Table 7.

every firm with headquarters in Pittsburgh, Dallas, Denver, San Francisco,

St. Louis,       and Houston   also has some manufacturing establishment in the

corresponding states. The New York Metropolitan Area is the major city where

50 of the 55 firms in accord with the interfirni but not the intrafirm motive

have their headquarters. The headquarters locations and. names of the five other

firms with headquarters in one of the ten major cities but no manufacturing

establishment in the corresponding state are:

                 (1) Chicago —- Brunswick Corp.
                 (2) Cincinnati —— Procter & Gamble Mnfg. Co.
                 (3)               Buckeye Callulose Corp.
                 (4)                      Folger Coffee Co.
                 (5) Boston —— Cabot Corp.

Note that the three firms with headquarters in Cincinnati are all subsidiaries of

Procter    &    Gamble,   a firm that has other subsidiaries with many manufacturing
establishments in Ohio. Here again, we encounter the problem of how to handle
subsidiaries discussed in section 111—A. The concentration of headquarters in
New York of firms with no manufacturing establishment in                  that state is further
evidence       of the super—agglomeration effect resulting from t/c nsiderations.

IV Conclusion

     Transportation/communication considerations have been shown to explain or,

at least, be associated with the headquarters location patterns of a high percent of

the manufacturing firms with five or more establishments and separate headquarters

location. Both the intrafirni and the interfirm motives were found to be very signficant

factors   in the logic of headquarters location decisions. One natural extension of this

research involves applying the same hypotheses to the case of manufadturing head—
                                                                                                      a

quarters.       Tto other particularly intriguing paths of research are encouraged by the

strength of these results. First, from the technology point of view, it                     will be
interesting      to    learn how   the   role of   t/c    considerations in the logic   of head-.

quarters location decisions ras changed                  over time. Have changes in t/c
technologies affected   the importance of proximity to a manufacturing establish-
ment of the firm for the headquarters, the intrafirm motive? How about the
importance of proximity to the hea.dquarters of other firms, the interfirm
motive? Second,   from the public policy point of view, it will be important to

learn   how the close association between t/c considerations and   headquarters

location patterns affects what government can do to influence business
logistics. Do the various strategies used to attract the headquarters office
industry to a particular area make sense in light of the importance of t/c
considerations?   Can the central business districts of major cities continue

to thrive on the importance of face—to—face communication?

       and space factors of interpersonal communication via face—to—face, telephone, and
       postal media, and of transportation of personnel and goods at various locations
       for the headquarters.

15. Only data on the number of headquarters of manufacturing firms iii a major city
     are available in this segment of the DM1 file. It is certainly true that the
     presence of major financial and legal firms in a major city is of great importance
     in influencing the location decisions of a manufacturing firm for its head-
     quarters. Hopefully, the presence of many headquarters of manufacturing firms
     in a major city would indicate the presence of the appropriate financial and
     legal services in the major city.

22.   The model will yield a negative number of firms following one or two of the
      decision rules for many of the distributions of total firms, firms in accord
      with the basic intrafirm motive, and firms in accord with the extended
      intrafirm motive in the higher establishments per firm categoreis. This
      problem is more likely statistical, i.e. due to the small sample sizes in
      those categories, than a fault  inthe construction of he null model or a behavior
      pattern of firms in those categories.

            S = number of firms behaving in accord with the predictions
                of the extended intrafirm hypothesis for firms of size n

First look at the probability of A occurring for firms behaving without regard for

the basic intrafirm motive, P(A). Two        different   derivations of the formula for

P(A) will be presented. Both rely on simple coinbinazoric arguments of the type
                                                                           23
found in Liu, C. ,Introduction to Combinatorial Mathematics. chapter 1          .   In   both

cases the two special spatial units are treated as corrections for overlaps rather

than as distinct states and rio states, such as Alaska or Hawaii, are deleted. Hence,

we work with fifty possible states for location.

     (I) A firm with n establishments has (n-i) manufacturing branches and the

headquarters. There are 50n—1 ways to distribute the manufacturing branches.

in the fifty states, treating each establishment as distinct. Ther are 49n1

ways for all (n—i) manufacturing establishments to be outside the state of the

headquarters. So, P(A) = 1 -   49ru      =       098n-1
                               50n-l

     (11) The same result can be established by use of the binomial theorem.

If there are i    manufacturing establishments in the same state as the headquarters
    j =l,...,n-l), those j establishments could be chosen from the (n-i) manufacturing

  establishments in C(n—l,j) ways. Further, the remaining (n—j—l) establishments

  outside of the state in which the headquarters is located can be distributed in the

  remaining 49 states in 49nj1 ways. Using the rule of product and sunaning over
                                                                            n-i
  all feasible j, the number of possible ways of obtaining A is:                  C(n-l,j) (49fl      )•

  So, the probability of A is: P(A) =
                                                 1C(n-l,j) (49)            But, by the binomial

                                                         50n—l

  theorem, the numerator is just (50n1 —             49n1)    Hence, onc again, P(A) = 1     —
                                                                                                   098n1
      Next evaluate P(B) for firms           behaving   without regard for the basic intrafirm

• motive —- i.e. randomly. For all ii, there is only one largest establishment,

 only one headquarters, and fifty states. Then, the probability that the largest

 establishment will be in the same state as the headquarters is: P(B) = 1/50 =                0.02.
 Note that we here disregard the case in which the separate headquarters is the

 largest   establishment.
      Finally, P(BIA) is by definition equal to P(B)/P(A) since P(BflA) = P(B).
 Then, P(BIA)         50n-2
                 50n—l — 49n—l

      The   real power of this null model comes in the ability to solve for X, Y, and
 z in three simultaneous linear equations. These equations are set up as:
                (1)     P(A) (x) + Y +   Z   =   R

                (2)     P(B) (x) +   P(BIA) (Y) + Z = S

                            Null Models for the Interfirm Hypotheses



                 Let: X = number of firms following the basic interfirin hypothesis

                        Y = number of firms following decision rule #4

                        Z = number of firms following decision rule #5

    There are 4,851 total establishments in the file of firms with five or more

establishments and a separate headquarters location. Of those 4,851 establishments,

263 are headquarters and the remaining 4,588 are manufacturirg branches. Additionally,

there are 828 total establishments located in the ten major cities -- 193

headquarters and 635 branches.

    The first null model specifies that the percent of firms not following

the basic interfirm hypothesis which behavejin accord with its predictions is

equal to the ratio of manufacturing branches in the major cities to all manufacturing

branches. In other words,               or 13.8% of the headquarters located randomly,

i.e. not following the basic interfirm hypothesis, should end up in major cities

anyway   according      the the first null model. We then have two simulataneous

equations:

                  (1) Y = 0.138(263 — x)

                  (2)   X+Y=   193

Solving       yields:
          -

                  x=181.7
                  Y= 11.3
     The second null model states that the percent of firms not following

the basic interfirm hypothesis which behaves in accord with its predictions is

equal to the ratio of all establishments in the major cities to the total number

of establishments. In other words,                  or 17.1% of the headquarters located

randomly, i.e. not following the basic interfirrn hypothesis, should end up in major



                                                                                           )
cities anyway according to the second null model. While equation (2) applies to

this model also, equation (1) is modified with the new ratio:

            (3) Y = 0.171(263 — X)

Solving yields:

            X=172.5
            Y= 20.5
