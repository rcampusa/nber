Blind Tigers and Red-Tape Cocktails: Liquor Control and Homicide in Late-Nineteenth-Century

                                          ABSTRACT

In 1893 South Carolina prohibited the private manufacture, transportation, and sale of alcohol and
established a state monopoly in wholesale and retail alcohol distribution. The combination of a
market decline in the availability of alcohol, reduced variety, and monopoly pricing at state-
operated outlets encouraged black markets in alcohol. Because black market participants tend to
resort to extra-legal mechanisms for dispute resolution, including violence, one result of South
Carolina’s alcohol restriction was an increase in homicide. A continuous-treatment difference-in-
difference approach reveals that homicide rates increased by about 30 to 60 percent in counties
that more vigorously enforced the law.

1. Introduction

       Nineteenth-century Americans imbibed freely. Contemporary temperance
organizations, such as the Anti-Saloon League, highlighted its extent and excesses. In
1890, 63 million Americans consumed 87 million gallons of distilled liquor, 29
million gallons of wine, and 856 million gallons of malt beverages, or the equivalent
of 1.4 gallons of pure alcohol per person (Copeland 1892). What troubled
temperance advocates more than the amount consumed was where it was consumed.
Middle-class Americans were troubled by the increasingly ready availability of alcohol
at saloons, where drinking, gambling, whoring, and brawling were virtually de rigueur
(Timberlake 1966). Nationally, there were 2.2 saloons per thousand people and a
total of 3.3 per thousand licensed sellers, which included saloons, liquor stores, and
apothecary shops. Temperance proponents contended that the ready availability of
alcohol produced “not only pauperism, crime and insanity, but also death, divorces
and bad government” (Sheen 1910, p. 129). Government was complicit in the
drinking problem because of the revenues raised at all levels of government through
excise taxes and license fees. Prohibitionists argued that government would be better
served by cutting its cord to alcohol because it spent more in prosecuting and
punishing alcohol-induced crime than it took in through alcohol taxes and fees.
       There is little doubt that crime and alcohol were related. Carroll D. Wright,
director of the Massachusetts Bureau of Labor Statistics, found for Boston in 1880
that 72 percent of all magistrate court convictions were for public drunkenness and
illegal or unlicensed vending. Of the other crimes, which ranged in seriousness from
adultery up to aggravated assault, Wright found that 45.5% were committed under
the influence and 28.6% were committed by known drunkards and others with a
history of drinking problems. Prohibition and strict regulations on alcohol found
broad public support because people believed that alcohol fueled violence and other
bad behaviors.
       But Miron (1999, 2004) and O’Flaherty and Sethi (2010) contend that
prohibitions can have a countervailing effect on violence. Prohibition or any binding
restriction on highly desired goods encourages the emergence of black markets.


                                          2
Black markets tend to generate turf wars, which are extralegal attempts to create local
geographic monopolies, and substantial cash holdings, which encourages robbery,
especially armed robbery (Miron and Zweibel 1995; Burrus 1999). Black markets, like
other markets, also generate commercial and contractual disputes that give rise to
resolution mechanisms. Absent the usual dispute resolution mechanisms available to
participants in legal markets (negotiation, lawsuits, and arbitration) and the usual
dispute resolution institutions (courts and government agencies), participants in
underground markets resolve disputes through violence. Courts will not enforce
agreements involving the manufacture, transportation, and distribution of prohibited
or tightly regulated goods, and participants have no access to these institutions
without incriminating themselves. Black market participants then rely on guns rather
than lawyers to resolve commercial and contractual disputes. As Clarence Darrow
observed when asked about the 215 liquor-related killings in a three-year period in
Prohibition-era Chicago, broken contracts in markets for prohibited goods do not
“lend themselves to polite resolution” (Okrent 2010, p. 275) At the limit, a
combination of drug prohibition and ineffective law enforcement can generate “war
zones,” in which fears of violence fuel preemptive violence (O’Flaherty and Sethi
2010).
         Theoretical modeling, however, generates ambiguous predictions concerning
the connection between prohibitions, enforcement activities, and violence. Burrus
(1999) models illegal drug distribution as Cournot competition between dealers who
use violence to secure geographic markets. One implication is that intensified law
enforcement efforts reduce the profits from territorial monopolies, which reduces
the marginal benefit of violence. A second implication, however, is that if demand
for the prohibited good increases, turf war violence intensifies in the short term.
Burrus’s (1999) second implication is relevant in the South Carolina experience. Like
other states along the southern Appalachians, South Carolina had a long-standing
culture of moonshining, or the distillation of inexpensive, small batches of corn
whiskey sold informally to avoid federal taxation (Busemann 2002). The
establishment of the dispensary system likely increased the demand for moonshine,



                                          3
which may have perturbed a low-violence equilibrium among established producers
by encouraging entry. Entry then elicited a short-term increase in violence as new
and established producers battled over market share.
         Flores (2016) also adapts a traditional model of Cournot competition
between rival producers of an illicit good that can sabotage each other and a
government that can punish to raise costs. His model predicts that increased
enforcement unambiguously reduces production/consumption and consumption-
based external costs such as domestic violence.1 Enforcement’s effects on violence
are ambiguous, depending on how closely interdiction efforts resemble interfirm
sabotage. The more interdiction resembles extralegal sabotage, the greater the
external violence costs. This result, too, has implications for South Carolina. Its
interdiction efforts were sometimes arbitrary and often violent (Hendricks 1945b).
As Flores (2016, p. 80) concludes, it remains an empirical issue whether violence
increases in enforcement efforts.2
         This paper exploits a unique liquor control experiment adopted in South
Carolina in the 1890s to disentangle the countervailing effects of alcohol regulation
and control. Because the South Carolina regulation of 1892/93, which did not rise to
prohibition, was contested and differentially enforced across counties, it is possible
to invoke a continuous difference-in-differences estimator in the spirit of Acemoglu,
Autor and Lyle (2004) and Adorno (2007) to sort out the hypothesized deleterious
enforcement effect (more market-based violence) from the salutary regulatory effect
(less alcohol-induced violence).
         The South Carolina results, which are robust to alternative specifications,
control variables, and treatment windows, reveal that in the four years prior to the
state’s establishment of a monopoly in wholesale and retail alcohol sales there were,
on average, 122 homicide prosecutions per year. In the subsequent decade the
average number of prosecutions jumped to 212 per year. When county-level

1
  Boulding’s (1947) simpler model yields the same conclusion regarding equilibrium consumption.
2
  Other models of drug markets also yield ambiguous predictions. Caulkins et al (2006), for example,
show that if the largest economic rents are earned by the most violent sellers, any intervention that
raises prices increases the incentives to use violence.



                                                 4
homicide prosecution rates are regressed on county-level liquor law enforcement
rates in a difference-in-differences approach, the results imply that a one standard
deviation increase in enforcement prosecutions increased the homicide prosecution
rate by about six per hundred thousand people, or 60% of the pre-monopoly era
homicide prosecution rate of 10.1 per hundred thousand people.
        The estimated 60% increase is robust to a number of alternative
specifications and robustness checks. It persists with the inclusion of state
prosecutor fixed effects and time trends. It persists with the inclusion of several
demographic and contemporaneous criminal activity controls. It is also persists after
controlling for what might be characterized as police “rousts,” defined here as cases
in which a defendant is arrested for an alcohol violation but a grand jury either
refuses to indict or the prosecutor refuses to prosecute. Although the evidence does
not directly address O’Flaherty and Sethi’s (2010) war-zone hypothesis, it is
consistent with their finding that modern drug prohibitions lead to more lethal
violence.
        The South Carolina experience adds to a handful of studies that attempt to
sort out the countervailing effects on violence of Prohibition-era (1920-1933)
policies in the United States. Miron (1999) and Jensen (2000) employ time-series
models that regress murder rates on enforcement expenditures. They find that
greater enforcement is associated with increased murder rates. These studies find a
positive net increase in murder due to prohibition enforcement, but the results
cannot be viewed as causal even though federal prohibition expenditures were
independent of or exogenous to local murder rates.
        Owens (2011, 2014) and Livingston (2016) exploit differences in the timing
of state-level prohibitions, which predated federal prohibitions, to estimate more
plausibly causal relationship using difference-in-differences approaches. Owens
(2011) reports that state-level prohibition reduces the murder rate. Livingston (2016),
too, finds that the murder rate declined in the first and second year after prohibition,
and he finds no statistically significant effect at year four and beyond. He infers, but
does not show, that this effect reflects consumer stockpiling of alcohol in



                                           5
anticipation of prohibition. Market-based crime occurred, if at all, only after
stockpiles were exhausted. Owens (2014) investigates whether aggregate murder
rates confound reduced alcohol-induced violence among some groups and black-
market-based violence among others. Using age-disaggregated data she finds that
murder rates increase for men in their twenties and decline for other age groups
during prohibition. Because black-market-based violence is more likely among young
men, Owens argues that the evidence is consistent with both the alcohol-induced
and market-based violence hypotheses. The results reported below provide added
support for her finding.


2. South Carolina’s dispensary system
        In 1893 South Carolina controlled liquor sales through a local-option law in
which counties and incorporated municipalities determined by referendum whether
saloons or taverns, separate from restaurants and hotels, would be licensed. No
license could be granted outside an incorporated city, town, or village and saloon
owners were made civilly liable for any injury to person or property by any minor,
known alcoholic, or insane person served at a licensed saloon. Saloons were required
to close at 6:00 P. M. In 1887 30 municipalities adopted the no-license rule (Blakey
1912, Plate 3). An estimated 700 to 800 saloons and taverns – independent of a
restaurant or a hotel – operated across South Carolina in the late 1880s (Eubanks
1950, p. 57), or about 0.7 saloons per thousand people, which was less than one-half
the national average. An unknown number of hotels, which were exempt from the
license law, served alcohol, as well.
        Eubanks (1950) claims that, despite the ready availability of alcohol through
saloons and taverns, liquor and apothecary shops, and restaurants and hotels,
bootlegging was rampant and “blind tigers” (Carolinian slang for illegal taverns) so
common that liquor dealers themselves urged more rigorous enforcement to rid
them of the competition. Evidence from the state’s county court reports suggests
that enforcement was spotty, at best. The state attorney general reported only four
convictions and two mistrials statewide for selling liquor without a license in 1888;



                                          6
fewer than 10 cases were discontinued by state solicitors (SC Attorney General
1888).
         Temperance societies and prohibitionists alike were dissatisfied with existing
law and lax enforcement. A series of prohibition laws and amendments to the license
system were proposed. Governor Benjamin Tillman opposed prohibition, in part
because he considered it unenforceable and, in part, because he wanted to capture
the profits of the alcohol trade for the state treasury. Tillman out-maneuvered the
prohibitionists when he convinced his rural voting base that cities and towns took in
license revenues but the costs of alcohol-related crime were paid by all taxpayers,
including those residing in rural areas without (legal) saloons (Eubanks 1950).
Instead of either a so-called high license system, which priced licenses beyond the
reach of small taverns, or outright prohibition, Tillman offered an alternative
Dispensary System in which the state itself would be the monopoly wholesaler and
retailer of alcohol.
         The principal feature of the original Dispensary act included a state board of
control that appointed county control boards that, in turn, appointed a single
dispenser for each county, except Charleston (10 dispensaries) and Richland (3
dispensaries) counties (Hendricks 1945a). The original act placed each county’s
dispensary at the county seat. Subsequent amendments allowed for additional
dispensaries in some counties. The state commissioner purchased from domestic
distillers, brewers, vintners and importers all liquor to be sold at the dispensaries.
Liquor was delivered in bulk to the central dispensary in Columbia. The central
dispensary then packaged the liquor into specially designed bottles in quantities not
less than one-half pint and not greater than five gallons. The central dispensary then
sold the sealed containers to local dispensaries at a maximum 50% markup of net
cost. County dispensers were appointed by the county dispensary board and paid a
salary. Any profits generated at local dispensaries were divided equally between the
county and the municipality in which the dispensaries were located.
         Any person wanting to purchase alcohol had to file an application at a local
dispensary. Dispensers were prohibited from selling to minors or known drunkards,



                                           7
or to people whose legal guardians or spouses requested that they be denied. Buyers
could not open bottles on the dispensary premises. Sunday sales were prohibited, as
were sales between 6:00 P.M. and 8:00 A.M. on other days. Tillman’s purpose was
not prohibition. His stated intentions were to eliminate sales of adulterated liquor, to
increase state revenues, to eliminate the private profit motive from alcohol sales, and
to reduce crime by taking alcohol sales out of saloons, gambling dens, and brothels.
Opponents argued that the dispensary would do little to reduce consumption, raise
little revenue for the state and municipalities, and it would encourage smuggling,
moonshining, and bootlegging (Hendricks 1945a; Eubanks 1950).
        The dispensary law went into effect on July 1, 1893 and the control board
scrambled to get the system going. The state control board contracted with several
distillers and breweries for product, and leased a warehouse in Columbia where the
product was delivered by rail, repackaged, and distributed to county dispensaries.
The control board later adopted some regulations not included in the original act.
Sales were cash only; buyers could make only one purchase each day; and dispensary
store fronts had to be open and well-lit so that anyone standing outside could see
what was happening inside (Eubanks 1950, p. 71).
        Resistance to the law took many forms. Some state, county, and local
officials refused to enforce the law. Charleston’s mayor publicly announced that he
would not. City officials continued to issue licenses to private clubs and previously
licensed saloons went underground and operated as blind tigers. Upscale blind tigers
charged an entry fee, served drinks, and provided entertainment (Smith 2005).
Downscale tigers were simple barrooms with entrances on alleys. One local
newspaper editorial noted that the only real consequence of the law was that
Charlestonians were now forced to “imbibe the red-tape cocktail” (quoted in Smith
2005, p. 204).
        Two of the more controversial features of the dispensary act were that it gave
the governor authority to appoint a state constabulary, which reported only to him,
and the constabulary could engage in warrantless searches of homes and businesses
if suspected violators might flee or easily dispose of contraband liquor (Christensen



                                           8
1908). If a raid resulted in evidence of a violation, a warrant could be obtained after
the fact. During the first few years of the system, the governor appointed 75
constables at an annual cost of $66,000 (Hendricks 1945b). Tillman responded to
Charleston’s mayor’s refusal to enforce the law by dispatching several constables to
do so. The mayor and police chief instructed city police to not assist the constables,
but to not interfere either. The constables’ enforcement efforts were further
frustrated by grand juries that did not indict, state attorneys that did not prosecute,
and juries that did not convict. Table 1 shows the disposition of liquor cases
following arrests in Charleston and Spartanburg, two comparably populated counties
that differed in public support for the law.

Notes: No bill = grand jury chose not to indict defendant arrested for violation. Nolle prosequi is
loosely interpreted as “I will not prosecute,” and occurs when state solicitor informs the court at trial
that he is unwilling to try the case. Population in Charleston County in 1900 was 88,000; Spartanburg
population was 65,000. Attorney general did not report prosecution data in 1898 report.
Sources: author’s calculations from South Carolina. Attorney General (1893-1902).




         In the first decade of the dispensary system grand juries in Charleston chose
not to indict more than 432 defendants held over for arraignment by a county
magistrate. In 413 cases the prosecutor entered a nolle prosequi (commonly shortened



                                                   9
to nol or nol pros and loosely interpreted as “I will not prosecute”), after which the
case was discontinued. In South Carolina the nol determination was entirely at the
discretion of the prosecutor; judges played no part in the decision and typically
accepted the prosecutors’ decisions to nol without question (Clary 2016). Nolled
cases could be revived later, but rarely were. Compared to Spartanburg, Charleston’s
grand juries and prosecutors were less likely to indict or prosecute violations of the
dispensary law. Of the cases actually prosecuted, petit juries were less likely to
convict. In 1896 the governor was so frustrated by Charleston’s unwillingness to
enforce the law on its own, that he sent several constables with instructions to close
the city’s blind tigers.
        In response to the difficulty of securing indictments and convictions in cities
and counties in which the law was unpopular, the state legislature amended the
original act. The amendments pushed the state attorney general’s office to prosecute
cases when local state prosecutors refused to do so. They also made it easier for
prosecutors to secure a change of venue when grand juries refused to indict
(Eubanks 1950).
        While some Carolinians resisted the law through nonenforcement and others
met its enforcement with violence (reports of violent constable-bootlegger
interactions are readily found in the state’s newspapers), the real challenge to
Tillmans’ dispensary law was constitutional. A majority of the state’s three-member
Supreme Court found the 1892 act unconstitutional within a few months of passage.
The legislature responded in the 1893 session by passing a new law with only modest
changes. In the interim one of the justices who considered the 1892 unconstitutional
retired and the governor nominated a dispensary supporter to the bench. When the
1893 act was challenged, a majority of the reconfigured court found it constitutional
and the dispensaries reopened on August 1, 1894 after a brief hiatus.
        Unable to find relief in the state courts, opponents challenged the law in
federal court. In early 1895 Federal Circuit Court Justice Simonton issued a
temporary injunction because the dispensary act, which prohibited common carriers
from transporting alcohol across state lines even if it was not intended for sale in the



                                          10
state, interfered with interstate commerce in alcohol (SC House and Senate 1894).
Governor Evans directed dispensary officials to ignore the injunction and continue
as before and for constables to be particularly vigilant because he believed the
injunction would encourage the importation of liquor and still more legal challenges
to the dispensary (Eubanks 1950, p. 324). In 1896, Judge Simonton further
undermined the law when he ruled that the law was unconstitutional insofar as it
prohibited the importation of alcohol for personal use. Because the dispensary was
neither a prohibition nor an inspection law, it did not fall under the general police
powers of the state to regulate imports. Dispensary constables continued to enforce
the law. Dozens of fresh challenges worked their way through the state and federal
courts, but the state prevailed in most when it was shown that the confiscated liquor
was destined for resale rather than personal use.
        Judge Simonton’s 1896 decision prompted the legislature to amend the act
requiring the state chemist to test all imported liquor, including that for personal use.
The law was challenged and, again, Judge Simonton struck down the sections that
applied to personal use as an unconstitutional restriction on interstate trade.
Simonton’s decision effectively enjoined the dispensary constabulary, and after
several constables were jailed for contempt, the governor temporarily disbanded the
force (SC House 1899). Some counties resumed issuing saloon licenses and the
governor reported more than 300 licensed establishments in June 1897 and 650
licensed establishments in June 1898.
        Meanwhile challenges continued in the courts. In 1897 Judge Simonton had
found that the sections of the law that limited sales to daylight hours, no sales by the
drink in unsealed containers, no drinking on the premises, no Sunday sales, and no
sales to minors and drunkards to be constitutional. The issue was finally closed on
May 8, 1898 when Chief Justice of the United States Melville Fuller, in Vandercook v.
Vance, wrote the majority opinion that upheld the constitutionality of the dispensary
system nearly in its entirety. The court did, however, uphold Simonton’s private-use
exception. The dispensary constabulary was reorganized, licensed sellers were closed,
and the dispensaries again became the monopoly distributors of alcohol in the state.

                   Temperance and prohibitionist groups pushed their agenda on the premise
that limiting public access to inexpensive alcohol would reduce poverty and crime.
Temperance groups were quick to note that restrictions reduced arrests for public
drunkenness, but some recognized the perverse effect might be to increase binge
drinking. As Eubanks (1950, p. 191) notes, people took their bottles home and were
“prone to get on more serious [drinking] sprees and commit more crimes of violence
than if her had taken a few drink at a saloon and carried none away.” Public concern
with violence prompted the Attorney General to investigate and he produced a table
(summarized in Figure 1) that reported the total number of homicide cases disposed
of in the pre-1894 and dispensary (post-1893) eras. He reported a 75% increase in
the number of homicide cases (average of 122.6 before and 212.9 after) and a 40%
increase in the average number of assault cases.

                   “It was pointed out,” writes Eubanks (1950, p. 191), “that the seeming
decrease in [public] drunkenness and the actual increase in serious crime could be



                                                       12
alike traced to the Dispensary’s door.” The increase in violence was attributed to the
increase in bootlegging and moonshining, but Dispensary proponents expressed
confusion over why this should be so. The official narrative concerning the
dispensary system was that it sold unadulterated liquor at reasonable prices. And
while it is likely that the dispensary sold chemically pure spirits, critics alleged it
watered its liquor to increase profit margins. Moreover, it is not clear that the
monopoly dispensary sold the liquor people wanted, in convenient locations, at
competitive prices. Table 2 reports gross sales, net profits and the net margin on
sales for the local dispensaries for selected years. Net margins were high by modern
standards in the wholesale trade (approximately 2% to 4%) and increased 2.4 times
between 1897, when the law’s constitutional status was still uncertain, and 1905,
when the only meaningful legal limit on the dispensary was the personal-exemption
exemption. Margins at the local dispensaries are indicative of market power.
Bootlegging followed from the dispensary’s monopoly pricing. Monopoly prices
invite competition when entry is difficult to deter and black market activity is
remunerative.
        An additional incentive for bootleggers to enter the illegal liquor sector was
the dispensary’s failure to provide the types and qualities demanded. The central
dispensary bought domestic rye, bourbon, gin, and rum in bulk then packaged,
labeled, and priced them on a three-grade scale. In 1896 a pint of X-grade bourbon
sold for 20 cents; XX for 25 cents and XXX for 30 cents. The central dispensary
paid $1 per gallon at wholesale, or 12.5 cents per pint for grade X (New York Times
1896). A legislative investigation into dispensary corruption uncovered two systemic
problems. First, demand was greatest for the lowest grade, lowest-priced liquor, but
margins for both distillers and dispensers were also lowest on X-grade alcohol.
Distillers paid legal rebates and illegal kickbacks to the dispensary’s purchasing agents
in return for purchases of grade XX and XXX liquors. But local dispensers
complained that they faced shortages of low-cost liquor and ended up with excess
inventories of higher grades. Second, when the dispensary did purchase X-grade
liquor, they watered it. Further, they sometimes distributed less-watered X-grade as



                                           13
XX-grade. Local dispensers paid the central dispensary $1.60 per gallon for watered
X, which widened the central dispensary’s margins, but increased demand for higher
quality bootleg liquor.

        South Carolina’s dispensaries were also insulated from legal liquor imported
from neighboring states. Georgia enacted a county-level local-option law in 1885
(Szymanski 2003, p. 144). By 1887 every Georgia county bordering South Carolina
was dry (Blakely 1912). The nearest wet counties in Georgia were in the
northwestern corner near the Tennessee-Alabama border. In 1883 North Carolina
adopted local option. Although few counties went completely dry, by 1887 nearly
every sizeable municipality in the counties contiguous to South Carolina or near the
border were dry. By contrast, only 30 of South Carolina’s municipalities prohibited
liquor sales under its 1882 local-option law, 21 of which were located in the western
up-country counties.
        Various ruses were used to legally circumvent the dispensary but few
succeeded. In 1913 the state chemist reported that his office had tested 19 different
beverages labeled as “cider” and “near beer” that claimed to be alcohol free. Of
these, just five beverages were 1% or less alcohol by volume; 12 were 5% or more,



                                            14
and two were 12% or more alcohol by volume (SC Commissioner of Agriculture
1913, p. 158).
        South Carolina’s dispensary system, by limiting the availability of a highly
desired good, created a system in which corruption and law-breaking were rife. An
upcountry moonshining culture expanded during the era. Smuggling and bootlegging
were common and various ruses, such as mislabeling alcohol as cider and near beer,
were employed to circumvent the law. Physicians prescribed and drug stores sold
medicinal alcohol as treatments for everything from the common cold to cancer.
Restrictions also increased violence at all levels of society. In one notable instance, J.
Dudley Haselden, a member of the State Board of [Liquor] Control, was accused by
newspaperman Ben Sellers of running a private saloon in his own home stocked with
free liquor provided by the distillers’ salesmen (New York Times, December 24, 1899).
Haselden took exception to Sellers’ exposé, gathered two friends and some weapons
and visited Sellers. Sellers emerged from the fight with a gunshot wound to the
stomach, his father was wounded in the arm; Haselden suffered a rifle shot to the leg
and one of his friends took a nonfatal shotgun discharge in the back.
        If disputes over the dispensary system elicited potentially deadly violence
between government officials and newspapermen, it is not unreasonable to expect
violence among those engaged in the illicit distribution of alcohol in an area of the
US long-recognized for its reliance on extralegal violence to resolve disputes (Ayers
1984). Monopoly pricing, in addition to the adulteration and dishonest labeling of
alcohol, invited bootleggers who offered different, cheaper, or honestly labeled
goods into the market. The Charleston News and Courier (February 24, 1898), a long-
standing critic of the dispensary system, labeled the entire system a “breeder of
lawlessness, crime and unending strife.”


3. Data and empirical strategy
        To investigate the relationship between alcohol restriction and violence, data
on homicide and liquor law violations are gathered from annual reports of South
Carolina’s Attorney General (AG). Each year the AG asked district State Solicitors



                                           15
(the equivalent of a district attorney in other jurisdictions) to forward information on
the prosecution of felony cases handled in their circuits. For nearly a half-century
beginning in 1888 the AG tabulated the information and reported it in a largely
unchanged format. Appendix Figure A1 reproduces a representative page.
        Rows in the tabulated crime reports listed the principal criminal categories of
cases coming before the court. Common entries included arson, assault and battery,
burglary, larceny, murder, robbery, and so on. Rows of principal interest for this
analysis are those related to homicide, specifically murder and manslaughter, which
are combined to form a variable labeled homicide prosecution. Murder and manslaughter
are combined for two reasons: because some solicitors’ reports combined them and
they cannot be separated from the available information; and because many, if not
most, manslaughter convictions originated as murder cases in which the defendant
pleaded guilty, presumably to avoid the risk of a capital conviction. The tabulated
crime reports include three columns of interest: Not Guilty, Mistrial, and Guilty.
(The tables also include information on the disposition of convictions, namely, jail,
penitentiary, death sentence, but these data are not used in the analysis.) Row-
column cells provide the number of relevant cases. Thus, a cell might report 10
murder convictions, or three liquor law acquittals.
        A second set of rows of principal interest are those related to liquor law
prosecutions. Before 1893 the most common liquor law violations are for unlicensed
sales, sales to minors, and Sunday sales. After 1893 prosecutions were grouped
together in a catch-all category labeled “Dispensary law” by most solicitors. To make
the homicide prosecutions and liquor law prosecutions comparable across counties and time,
the numbers are converted to a rate per hundred thousand from interpolations of
annual populations from the decennial federal censuses.
        The variables studied in the existing literature are the murder rate and
enforcement expenditures (Miron 1999; Jensen 2000; Owens 2011; Livingston 2016).
The data used here differ from these standard variables, but are no less useful for an
investigation of any connection between alcohol control and violence. One
difference is the measure of violence. Typically, the dependent variable is the murder



                                           16
rate, or the number of reported murders per hundred thousand people. Information
included in the AG reports is not the murder rate; rather, it is the homicide
prosecution rate, which equals the number of individuals who stood trial for murder
or manslaughter. The homicide prosecution rate may reveal more about participation
in lethal violence than the murder rate in that the homicide prosecution rate includes
all individuals for whom prosecutors and grand juries believed the evidence
established a preponderant likelihood of the defendant’s culpability. A preliminary
search of local newspapers reveals that many homicides involved more than one
defendant, so that, unlike the murder rate, which is based on a body count, the
homicide prosecution rate is a participation rate rather than an outcome rate.
Available data preclude construction of a murder rate, but the prosecution rate and
the murder rate are likely to be highly correlated.
        Two additional columns in the AG’s reports also offer information into
liquor law enforcement. The tables also include “No bill” and “Discontinued”
columns. A case was “no billed” if a grand jury failed to indict based on the evidence
presented by the prosecutor. A case was discontinued or nolled if a grand jury indicted
a defendant, but the solicitor charged with prosecuting the case chose not to pursue
it. No-bill and discontinued cases are combined to capture a “rousting” effect, where
roust is defined as an act of harassment by the police (Oxford English Dictionary
Online 2011). It is known, for example, that Charleston’s local authorities engaged in
little enforcement. Frustrated by Charleston’s inaction, Governor Tillman declared
that his liquor constabulary would turn the city dry and in 1894 and 1896/97
conducted liquor sweeps that resulted mostly in unprosecuted arrests (see Table 1).
Some arrests during these sweeps surely represented legitimate violations, but the
constables may have rousted suspects. These cases are included separately because
enforcement efforts need not result in trials to alter the nature of black market
relationships and dispute resolution mechanisms if rousts helped push the trade
underground. Police sweeps may sufficiently disrupt black markets to induce
violence.




                                           17
        The history of the dispensary system also reveals that care must be shown in
how the dispensary era is defined. The original act established the dispensary in mid-
1893; the 1893 revision reestablished the dispensary monopoly in legal sales in
summer 1894; and the final US Supreme Court determination in 1898 upheld the
law, nearly in its entirety. But it must also be recalled that, despite court injunctions
instructing the dispensary constables to stand down, Governor Evans directed the
constables to ignore the injunctions and to continue with enforcement activities until
federal marshals jailed some constables for contempt in 1898. Between mid-1893
and 1898 the law was enforced, if differentially across time and space.
        Given the time it took to get the dispensary operational, to hire and deploy
the constabulary, and to resolve the legal challenges to the law it may appear that the
dispensary does not provide the sharp, well-defined regulatory break typically
invoked in a standard difference-in-difference approach. Table 3 parses the data
based on four dates when it would be reasonable to expect a break in the liquor
enforcement and liquor rousts series: (1) following passage of the original act in
1892, which took effect in mid-1893; (2) following passage of the amended act in
1893, which took effect in 1894; or, (3) following passage of the amended 1893 act
reinforced by passage of the federal Whiskey Tax in 1894, which led to increased
federal enforcement of federal tax law; (4) following Judge Simonton’s personal-use
exception in 1895; or (5) instead of two regimes, there may be three: one prior to the
original act; one between the original act and the final Supreme Court finding; and
one following the finding that law was constitutional.
        The liquor prosecution, liquor roust, and homicide prosecution rates
reported in Table 3, all point to a break in 1893, following July 1, 1893
implementation of the late-1892 act. The average liquor prosecution rate increased
nearly fourfold in the first decade of the dispensary’s operation relative to the five
preceding years. The roust rate increased by more than 6.5 times; the homicide
prosecution rate increased almost 1.5 times relative to the pre-dispensary period. If,
instead of imposing an immediate effect, we allow a year to fully implement the
dispensary and allow some time for households to consume stockpiles of alcohol,



                                           18
the before and after differences are approximately the same as using 1893 as the
break point. Imposing a three-regime structure does not alter the interpretation of
the dispensary era. Compared to the five years prior to the establishment of the
dispensary, enforcement efforts, rousts and homicides all increased almost
immediately afterwards.

3.1 Empirical strategy
         Early studies of prohibition and violence used time series methods (Miron
1999; Jensen 2000), but recent studies adopt alternative strategies that consider
temperance regulation or outright prohibitions as treatment effects that lend


                                                  19
themselves to difference-in-differences (DiD) approaches (Owens 2011; Livingston
2016). This paper follows the latter strategy to take advantage of different levels of
treatment in a post-regulatory change environment (Acemoglu, Autor and Lyle 2004;
Adorno 2007) to estimate the effect of liquor law enforcement on the homicide
prosecution rate in South Carolina.
        Adorno (2007) shows how a continuous DiD approach can be implemented
and interpreted. Let hi(L) represent the set of potential realizations of the homicide
prosecution rate for each county indexed by i, given a random continuous liquor
enforcement rate. It is assumed that homicide realizations in a county are
independent of liquor enforcements and homicides in neighboring counties; that is,
there are no spillovers in which enforcement in one county influences the homicide
rate in other counties. For each county there is also a vector of covariates, X i, that,
as well as the level of liquor enforcement, ℓi ϵ [0, ℓ] = L, influences the homicide
prosecution rate.
        Following the DiD literature, the sets of potential outcomes can be separated
into two groups hi(L) for all counties with positive treatment, L ϵ ]0, ℓ], and hi(0)
otherwise. The equations describing the set of potential homicide outcomes can be
represented by the following:
(1) hi(ℓi) = fL (Xi, ℓi) + εi(ℓi) for L > 0

(2) hi(0) = f0 (Xi, ℓi) + εi(0) for L = 0

the εi (• )are mean zero error terms uncorrelated with Xi and ℓi.
        Adorno (2007) shows that estimation of an empirical specification consistent
with Equations (1) and (2) provides an estimate of the average treatment effect,
which can be written as:
(3) ATE = αi = E[h(L) – h(0)],
Thus, the ATE can be estimated by:
(4) αi = f(L, X, ε).
        The standard DiD equation is then modified and takes the following form:




                                              20
(5) homicide prosecution ratetc = β0 + β1 liquor prosecution ratetc + β2 dispensarytc

        + β3 liquor prosecution ratetc * dispensarytc + β4 Circuitc+ β5Xct + εtc,


where c indexes the county and t indexes time. The homicide participation rate is, as
discussed in the previous section, the number of murder and manslaughter cases
prosecuted per hundred thousand people in year t and county c. The liquor
prosecution rate is the number of liquor law violations prosecuted per hundred
thousand. As in any differences-in-differences-type estimation, β3 is the coefficient
of principal interest. Under certain general conditions, it will provide consistent and
unbiased estimate of the effect of dispensary enforcement on the population subject
to enforcement (that is, it will estimate the average effect of the treatment consistent
with Eq. (4)) (see also Lechner 2010 for a discussion of standard DiD estimation).
        Baseline regressions are estimated with circuit fixed effects and with standard
errors clustered on county. Circuit, rather than county, fixed effects are implemented
because state solicitors oversaw prosecutions in their circuits, which included
between three and five counties. Although local attitudes surely influenced
enforcement efforts, it was the solicitors and their assistants who worked (or not) to
secure grand jury indictments, chose which indicted defendants to prosecute, and
chose the level of resources to devote to the prosecution of liquor cases. Thus, the
circuit fixed effect captures differences in solicitor and, perhaps, judicial behaviors.
        The X vector includes several county-level variables that may have influenced
the homicide rate: population density, the fraction of the population that was black,
the fraction of the population that was Baptist, and whether the county shared a
border with North Carolina or Georgia. Population density is included because crime
rates tend to be higher in cities (Glaeser and Sacerdote 1999). The percent black is
included to account for the violence directed toward blacks in the Jim Crow era. The
Historical American Lynching (HAL) Project (2016) documents an average of five
known lynchings per year in South Carolina between 1882 and 1900. More than one-
third of the lynched individuals were charged with murder or attempted murder,




                                            21
which supports the contention that South Carolina operated under a culture of
violence and violent extralegal retribution, often directed toward blacks. The fraction
of the population Baptist is included to capture any indirect effect between a
preference toward abstinence and violence. Contemporary accounts emphasized the
sharp religious and cultural distinctions between the Baptist upstate and Episcopalian
Charleston, which was more tolerant of moderate alcohol consumption (Smith
2005). Border effects are included to account for the long history of moonshining
culture in the southern Appalachians (Buseman 2002). In addition to repeatedly
targeting Charleston’s blind tigers, the dispensary constabulary maintained a visible
presence at the borders, especially the Georgia border along the upstate counties.
Heightened enforcement in border counties may have increased the number of black
market disputes and increased violence in those counties.
        Table 4 provides summary statistics for the five years before (1888-1892) and
nine years after (1894-1902) passage of the dispensary act (1893 is dropped given
that the initial law went into effect on July 1, 1893 and full establishment in July
1894). Homicide prosecution rates increase by nearly 4.5 per 100,000 after passage of
the law, which represents a statistically significant and economically meaningful
32.5% increase. Liquor law prosecution and roust rates also increase in the decade
after the system was put in place. The other characteristics, which, given their
definition, evolve gradually (or not at all) over time are not significantly different in
the two eras.

3.2 Threats to identification
          Regulatory reforms most well suited for DiD approaches are those adopted
as if at random with respect to the outcome under study. A principal concern with
the DiD approach is that regulatory reforms are responding to different trends in the
outcome variable between treated and untreated units of observations. While it
seems unlikely that the motivation behind temperance supporters and prohibitionists
was a belief that alcohol restrictions would reduce the incidence of murder, some
argued that by making alcohol less available alcohol restrictions might reduce the
incidence of violence, especially domestic violence (Eubanks 1950). The AG reports



                                             23
                          provide no insights into domestic violence because prosecutions were not separately
                          identified in the tables.3 A typical test for different trends in the outcome variable
                          that may have elicited the regulatory response is to check the pre-treatment period
                          for evidence of non-parallel trends.

                                   To test for non-parallel trends, quintiles of liquor law enforcement rates were
                          calculated for South Carolina’s counties. Figure 2 compares movements in homicide
                          prosecution rates for the two lowest and two highest quintiles. Although homicide
                          rates are more variable in the two highest quintiles of liquor enforcement counties,
                          there is no evidence that rates were following different trajectories either before or
                          after the establishment of the dispensary. It seems safe to conclude that the state did
                          not institute the dispensary system as a response to homicides.

                          3
                            Most “wife beating” and “child beating” cases were handled in municipal courts so that only
                          particularly egregious instances of domestic violence were prosecuted in state courts as “Assault and
                          battery.” Information on municipal courts is unavailable, but assault prosecutions in state courts do
                          not change after the dispensary goes into operation. The pre-dispensary assault prosecution rate is
                          22.8; the dispensary-era rate was 24.3. The change is small and statistically insignificant (p-value =
                          0.32).



                                                                            24
       Given the continuous rather than dichotomous nature of the treatment
variable, a second concern is whether enforcement varied in a systematic fashion that
mimics a meaningful treatment. Figure 3 maps the average annual liquor law
prosecution rate by county in the dispensary era. South Carolina can be divided into
three distinct enforcement zones: the lightly enforced counties in the Low Country –
Pee Dee regions (the counties on or near the Atlantic coast); the barely enforced
Midlands or Santee district; and the relatively heavily enforced Upcountry counties
surrounding the cotton-mill district of the modern Anderson-Greenville-Spartanburg
MSA. Thus the counties and solicitor’s circuits that devoted more resources to
enforcement are not geographically random, and there is sufficient systematic,
persistent difference in enforcement to identify an average treatment effect. Some
counties were more heavily treated than others.

       Enforcement in South Carolina reflects national trends in that temperance
movements gained more traction in less urbanized places and in places with more
evangelical Christians (Owens 2011; Okrent 2010). And although public opinion
toward saloons was overwhelmingly negative, places with more taverns and saloons



                                                  25
were less likely to support temperance regulations or prohibitions. The concern here
is whether dispensary enforcement was endogenous to the level of violence or some
third variable correlated with both. If officials, for example, stepped up liquor law
enforcement in response to increases in violence, the resulting estimates will be
biased.

           Table 5 reports a simple test for the endogeneity of liquor prosecutions to
contemporaneous and lagged homicide prosecutions, in addition to other covariates
likely to influence the demand for liquor enforcement. Columns (1) and (3) report



                                                     26
the summary statistics for the independent variables for all years and for the
dispensary era alone, which include the proportion black, the proportion Baptists,
the proportion of a county’s state representatives that voted in favor of the
dispensary act, and population density. The average county was 56% black, 16%
Baptist, had about 46 people per square mile, and nearly two thirds of its
representatives voted for the dispensary. Columns (2) and (4) report estimated
marginal effects from probit regressions in which the dependent variable equals zero
if there are no liquor prosecutions in a county-year, and one if there are any
prosecutions. The estimated marginal effects reveal that the liquor enforcement
efforts were generally unresponsive to current and lagged homicide prosecutions.
Columns (3) and (6) report OLS estimates of liquor enforcement rates on current
and lagged homicide prosecutions. The estimated coefficients on lagged prosecutions
are not statistically significant at standard levels (p<0.05) and the estimates imply a
modest effect. A one standard deviation increase in lagged homicide prosecutions
increases current liquor enforcement by just 15% of its standard deviation.
        A third point of concern is the appropriate length of the estimation period. A
DiD approach provides unbiased estimates of the effect of a regulatory change so
long as no other confounding factors change in the relevant window. A long window
is likely to allow confounding effects to bias the estimates. Yet, regression analysis
requires a sufficiently large number of observations to generate precise estimates of
any true effect of a regulation. The unit of observation used here is the county; South
Carolina had 41 in 1900, but there are fewer than 41 in some years because some
state solicitors failed to report to the attorney general. The main results use relatively
narrow two- and three-year windows before and after 1893, which is excluded
because the law went into effect on July 1, 1893.




4. Alcohol control and homicide prosecutions
        Figure 4 provides a scatterplot of the liquor-law and homicide prosecution
rates before and after the adoption of the dispensary system. It illuminates the

                      differential effects of enforcement efforts under alternative regulatory regimes. In the
                      pre-dispensary era, when liquor was readily available, increased enforcement efforts,
                      which were mostly aimed at suspects who sold on Sundays, without a license, or to
                      minors, reduced the homicide prosecution rate. In the pre-dispensary era, moonshine
                      interdiction was a predominantly federal effort, whose officials were more interested
                      in collecting taxes than in shutting down production (Buseman 2002, p. 18). In the
                      dispensary era, by contrast, increased enforcement efforts, which were mostly aimed
                      at disrupting production and distribution, increased homicide prosecution rates.

                      4.1 Baseline estimates
                               Figure 4 illustrates the identification strategy for the formal empirical analysis
                      in which post-dispensary enforcement is a continuous rather than dichotomous
                      variable. Table 6 reports baseline estimates with different control variables and over
                      two windows. Columns (1) through (3) use the two years prior and the two year after




                                                                                         28
the full implementation of the dispensary. Columns (4) through (6) use three years
before and after implementation. The issue is whether and to what extent increased
liquor law enforcement led to an increase in the homicide rate. The results suggest a
relatively large effect. In a traditional DiD approach with a simple on/off treatment,
the coefficient of interest is the interaction term Post*Enforcement, which captures the
effect of the treatment on the treated. But a continuous treatment accounts for the
fact that some county-years experienced zero treatments (e.g., Charleston in most
years), other county-years experienced intensive treatment (e.g., Spartanburg in most
years), while other county-years experienced moderate but variable treatments. Thus,
a continuous approach offers some subtleties of interpretation that a dichotomous
treatment does not.
       Coefficients on the Post*Enforcement variable in the two-year window,
Columns (1) through (3), imply that a one-standard deviation change (19.4
prosecutions per hundred thousand) in enforcement in the dispensary era increases
the estimated homicide prosecution rate by between 5.0 and 7.2 per hundred
thousand. But the coefficient on Post also implies an increase in the homicide rate by
an additional 0.9 to 1.9 per hundred thousand. The net marginal effect of the
dispensary on homicides [∂(•)/∂post|enforcement=k] in the first two years after full
implementation, by which time consumer stockpiles were likely to have been
exhausted was to increase the homicide prosecution rate by between 6.8 and 8.1 per
hundred thousand. Given an unconditional mean homicide prosecution rate of 10.1
per hundred thousand in the pre-dispensary era, the human costs of the dispensary
were high. Reducing the availability of alcohol and thereby encouraging an expansion
of a violent moonshining and bootlegging culture led to an increase in the homicide
prosecution rate (and, by implication, the murder rate) by about 60% to 80%.

                  Columns (4) through (6) report estimated coefficients for the three years
      prior and the three years after full implementation of the dispensary, recognizing that
      the system was in full operation for only part of 1897. Despite its only partial
      operation, the number of dispensary prosecutions is approximately the same as in
      subsequent years, by which time enforcement efforts remained at levels about one-
      half of those in the peak year of 1896. Here, again, the estimated coefficients imply
      an economically meaningful effect of liquor law prosecutions on homicides. A one
      standard deviation increase in the liquor law enforcement rate after implementation
      of the dispensary increased the homicide prosecution rate by between 3.6 and 5.5 per



                                                     30
hundred thousand, or a one-third to one-half increase over the pre-dispensary rate. If
we take into account the full post-dispensary effect by adding estimated coefficients
on post, the estimated effect is to increase the homicide rate by 6.4 to 7.8 per
hundred thousand.


4.2 Was there a “rousting” effect?
         To this point, the analysis associates liquor law prosecutions with homicide
rates and is consistent with the market-based violence hypothesis in that greater
enforcement leads to greater violence. But it is not uncommon for police and other
enforcement agencies such as the dispensary constabulary to engage in coordinated
raids and neighborhood sweeps of suspects fully aware that some (potentially
substantial) fraction of those arrested during the sweep will not be prosecuted. In
common parlance, police engage in rousts designed to preempt or disrupt criminal
activity. One issue surrounding rousts is whether they have net beneficial effects in
reducing crime or whether they generate unintended consequences. It is possible,
given Flores (2016) theoretical result, that if coordinated raids and sweeps disrupt
black markets, the disruption may lead to increased violence.
         Table 7 introduces Rousts an additional independent variable in the homicide
rate regressions. A county-year roust value equals the sum of cases in which a grand
jury failed to indict (no bill) and those in which a prosecutor failed to prosecute
following an indictment (nolles), expressed as a rate per hundred thousand
population. The principal coefficient of interest in Columns (1) and (2) are those on
Post*Roust, which is statistically significant and economically meaningful in each
specification. A one standard deviation increase in rousts (=47.87) in the two year
post-establishment period implies an increase in the homicide prosecution rate of
11.8 to 14.1 per hundred thousand. The 11.8 value represents a doubling of the pre-
dispensary homicide prosecution rate. Inclusion of the Roust variable in the two-year
before and after window, however, reduces the magnitude and statistical significance
of the Post*Enforcement coefficient, which may be due to collinearity between the
Liquor and Roust variables (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.35, p-value = 0.00).



                                          31
Moreover, the null hypothesis that the two coefficients are equal cannot be rejected
(Z statistic = 0.33), or that the violence-inducing effect of rousts and prosecutions
are equal.

         Column (3) then combines the Liquor and Roust variable into a single Arrest
variable, which represents the total number of dispensary violations that led to an
arrest in a county-year. In the two-year period after establishment of the dispensary,
a one standard deviation increase in liquor violation arrests increased the homicide
prosecution rate by 14.4 per hundred thousand, or 142% of the pre-dispensary rate.


4.3 Robustness analysis – fixed-effects estimates



                                                    32
       Given the panel nature of the data and the paucity of time varying controls, a
fixed-effect approach can be used to estimate the effect of liquor enforcement on
homicide prosecutions. The identifying assumption for fixed effects models is that
unobservable factors that might simultaneously affect the left- and right-hand side of
the regression are time-invariant. In this case, the assumption appears to be
innocuous in that it is unlikely that public preferences toward alcohol changed
abruptly. Counties in which a majority of voters voted in favor of prohibition in the
1880s were counties for which a majority of their state representatives voted in favor
of the dispensary in the 1890s (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.52, p-
value<0.001). But liquor law enforcement did change abruptly after 1893. In such
instances, fixed-effects models can be used to control for time-invariant differences
between individual counties, and the resulting estimates provide estimates of the
within county consequences of increased liquor enforcement.

variable, which accounts for potentially abrupt changes coincident with the
establishment of the dispensary. Models are estimated with and without individual
year effects. Individual year effects should be included when unexpected variation or
special events may affect the outcome variable (Torres-Reyna 2007), but it may be
that the establishment of the dispensary is the single most important event during
this period. The models are estimated with and without Charleston County in the
panel because enforcement in Charleston was contested, highly variable, and
motivated by partisan rivalries not present (to the same extent, at least) in other parts
of the state. The regressions exclude 1893 because the dispensary opened in July, so
the data from that year confounds pre- and post-dispensary effects. Standard errors
are clustered on county; bootstrapped standard errors are not notably different.
        The fixed-effects estimates offer a slightly different interpretation of the
effect of the dispensary system on homicide prosecutions, but are broadly consistent
with the DiD interpretations. Although the coefficients on liquor enforcement per
hundred thousand are not precisely estimated, the coefficients imply that a one-
standard deviation increase in enforcement is consistent with an increase in the
homicide prosecution rate of between 0.25 and 0.70 per hundred thousand, or
between 2.5% and 7.0% of the pre-dispensary rate. But, like the DiD estimates,
estimated coefficients on the After1893 variable implies a discrete and permanent
increase in the homicide prosecution rate of 3.9 and 6.2 per hundred thousand
coincident with the establishment of the dispensary, or 39 to 62 percent of the mean
pre-dispensary homicide prosecution rate.


4.4 Robustness analysis – instrumental variables
        An alternative approach to estimating the effect of increased liquor law
enforcement on homicide is to employ an instrumental variable or two-stage least
squares approach. Due to omitted variables, reverse causality, or the possibility that
some unobserved factor is causing both increased liquor enforcement and increased
homicide prosecutions, estimates will be potentially biased if the independent
variable of interest is correlated with the error term. One way to generate a



                                               34
consistent estimate of the enforcement-homicide effect is to identify one or more
instrumental variables correlated with the enforcement variable, but uncorrelated
with the error term. The issue is whether such an instrument is available.
        To be a valid instrument a variable must satisfy two conditions: relevance
(corr[disp/sqmilei , liquor enforcementi] ≠ 0) and exogeneity (corr(disp/sqmilei , ui)
= 0, where ui is the error term from the regression of enforcement on homicide
rates. A valid instrument must also satisfy the exclusion restriction in that it is
correlated to the homicide rate by way of its correlation with the enforcement rate.
        One possible instrument for the liquor law enforcement variable is a variable
defined as dispensary per square mile. Between 1893 and 1896, each county except
Charleston and Richland counties, were allowed one dispensary located at the county
seat. The dispensary per square mile variable is expected to be relevant because
having a single dispensary not necessarily located in a county’s most populous town
increases the cost of obtaining legal alcohol more in large than in small counties. And
the more costly it is to obtain alcohol legally, the more will be acquired illegally
holding population and demand constant, which should elicit an enforcement
response from officials interested in maximizing the returns to their enforcement
efforts (Knowles, Persico and Todd 2001). The Pearson correlation coefficient
between dispensary per square mile and liquor law enforcement rate is 0.14 (p-value
= 0.002). The instrument should also satisfy the exclusion restriction because the
choice of county seat was made years before and the legislature’s choice to allocate
one dispensary per county was a political concession unlikely to have been made in
anticipation of a change in the homicide rate. The one exception may be the decision
to allocate 10 dispensaries to Charleston in which it was well known that the majority
of the population was opposed to any type of liquor control. Instrumental variables
regressions, therefore, are estimated excluding Charleston from the analysis. The
analysis is also restricted to 1894/95 and 1894-1896 because the dispensary
commission began authorizing additional local dispensaries in late 1896, perhaps in
recognition of the increase in crime attributable to the increased cost of obtaining
legal alcohol.

        Table 9 reports the first- and second-stage coefficient estimates of the
instrumental variables models. Because the IV models rely on smaller samples than
the DiD and fixed-effects models, the coefficients are less precisely estimated. Still,
the results are consistent with earlier estimates and may imply that they were subject
to some downward bias. With only one instrument, we cannot perform a test of any
over-identifying restrictions, but the F-statistic on the first-stage regression in the
larger (1894-1896) sample satisfies the rule-of-thumb of 10, and the dispensary
variable itself is barely significant at standard levels.
        Although they are not precisely estimated, the second-stage regression
coefficients on the Liquor enforcement variable imply an effect about twice the
magnitude of those estimated using DiD and about 10 to 15 times the fixed-effect



                                                  36
estimate. The statistically insignificant Wu-Hausman test statistics fail to reject the
null hypothesis of exogeneity for the instrumented variable, so we may be reasonably
confident that the liquor enforcement variable is determined exogenously. Regardless
of the statistical procedure, the basic result holds. By increasing the costs of
acquiring and consuming legal alcohol, South Carolina’s dispensary system indirectly
increased the homicide prosecution rate. The likely channel was that increased
enforcement efforts squeezed black markets and fostered a culture of violence.


5. Discussion and conclusions
       In 1921 Samuel Hopkins Adams, a critic of Prohibition, offered a rather
prescient assessment of how it might unfold: “Under the old local-option plan a
community decided whether or not it would have liquor. Under the new [prohibition
law] it decides whether or not it will have the law” (Okrent 2010, p. 256). And not
just the Prohibition law, but rather the rule of law more generally. Okrent (2010, p.
373) concludes that prohibiting alcohol promoted a culture of bribery, corruption,
and violence. It may be time to set aside romantic notions of bootleggers as early 20th
century Robin Hoods for the more realistic portrayal of a ruthless Enoch “Nucky”
Thompson in HBO’s Boardwalk Empire. Any assessment of Prohibition needs to
balance the benefits of the reduced availability of alcohol, including lower rates of
alcoholism, alcohol-related decreases in long-term health, and increase productivity,
against the human costs, which include consumers harmed by consuming adulterated
liquor and those caught up in turf wars (Cook 2007; Warburton 1932). Calculating
the benefits to South Carolinians of reduced availability is beyond the scope of this
paper, but the human costs were not trivial. Homicide rates increased, which has
generally detrimental welfare consequences.
       A common thread that connected such disparate accounts of prohibition as
the cinematic accounts of Elliott Ness’s team of untouchables to serious journalistic
accounts such as Wainwright’s (2016) Narconomics to academic analyses such as
O’Flaherty and Sethi’s (2010) account of modern urban “war zones” is that well-
meaning but serious restrictions on highly desired goods are fraught with unintended



                                          37
consequences. Progressive Era reformers, including the prohibitionists, believed that
the rise of urban violence in the late nineteenth century was fueled not just by rapidly
increasing urban densities, but by the rapid proliferation of the saloon. Reformers
considered saloons the problem and worked to outlaw or at least place onerous
restrictions on them. The reformer’s efforts, however, did little to reduce violence
and, as Miron (1999) argued, may have exacerbated already high rates of urban
violence.
       South Carolina’s liquor control experiment between 1893 and 1907 offers a
unique opportunity to investigate the link between liquor control and violence. The
results, which are robust to alternative specifications and control variables, reveal
that average annual homicide prosecution rate, a reasonable measure of the murder
rate, jumped by 75% after the opening of the dispensary. When county-level
homicide rates are regressed on county-level liquor-law enforcements rates, the
results imply that a standard deviation increase in enforcement increased the
homicide prosecution rate by about 6 per hundred thousand people; this is more
than one-half the pre-dispensary era homicide prosecution rate of 10 per hundred
thousand people. Liquor law prosecutions, however, had a trivial effect on the
assault rate. Although the evidence does not directly address O’Flaherty and Sethi’s
(2010) war-zone hypothesis, it is consistent with their finding that modern drug
prohibitions lead to more lethal violence.
