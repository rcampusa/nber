                                         ABSTRACT

In this paper we evaluate the degree to which the adverse parental divorce effect on university
education operates through deprivation of economic resources. Using one million siblings from
Taiwan, we first find that parental divorce occurring at ages 13-18 led to a 10.6 percent decrease
in the likelihood of university admission at age 18. We then use the same sample to estimate the
effect of parental job loss occurring at the same ages, and use the job-loss effect as a benchmark
to indicate the potential parental divorce effect due to family income loss. We find the job-loss
effect very little. Combined, these results imply a minor role played by reduced income in driving
the parental divorce effect on the child’s higher education outcome. Non-economic mechanisms,
such as psychological and mental shocks, are more likely to dominate. Our further examinations
show that boys and girls are equally susceptible, and younger teenagers are more vulnerable than
the more mature ones, to parental divorce.

1   Introduction

Research across economic and demographic fields has consistently found that parental

divorce adversely affects children’s education outcomes. Little evidence, however, has

been provided to shed light on the underlying mechanisms behind these effects.

Theoretically, parental divorce may affect education through reduced economic resources

that limit the investment in children’s education (the economical mechanism), or through

diminished psychological well-being of children (the psychological mechanism).

Evaluating the relative importance of the two mechanisms advances our understanding as

to effective supports for children experienced parental divorce. For instance, if the

psychological mechanism dictates, professional counseling and other supportive services

should be more productive than financial support. Empirically, however, it is very

challenging to estimate the two effects separately because data rarely provide orthogonal

variations in income and psychological shocks caused by parental divorce. Indeed, we

know of no rigorous study that distinguishes between the two mechanisms.

       This paper fills this evidence gap by investigating the extent to which the adverse

divorce effect operates through loss of economic resources. Using a sample of around one

million siblings in Taiwan, we start with estimating the effect of parental divorce occurring

at the age of 13 to 18 on the likelihood of university admission at the age of 18. We employ

the mother fixed-effects (FE) model to mitigate selection. We then move on to

investigating the extent to which the adverse divorce effect operates through loss of

economic resources, which has been widely considered as a major mechanism that

delivers the divorce effect. To this end, we use the same sibling sample to estimate the

effect of parental job loss (due to firm closure) on university admission. The job-loss effect

is then used as a benchmark to assess the role of the economical mechanism in driving the


                                              1
parental divorce effect. Finally, we examine whether any specific ages of adolescence are

more vulnerable to the shocks caused by parental divorce, adding evidence on the age-at-

parental-divorce effects.

       Parents’ decision on divorce is potentially endogenous; thus, the OLS estimate of

the divorce effect on the child’s education outcome is often plagued by selection. In this

paper we adopt two strategies to address the endogeneity. First, we estimate the mother

FE model, which relies on comparing the university admission outcomes between siblings

who experienced parental divorce before age 18 and those who experienced it after age

18. Under Taiwan’s education system, the age of 18 is the expected timing for individuals

to make the first attempt for university admission by taking the national university

entrance test. While the within-mother comparison removes confounders that are invariant

across siblings, it cannot fully eliminate the omitted variables bias if the confounders vary

across siblings. Thus, our second strategy is to follow Sigle-Rushton et al. (2014) to

control for a set of idiosyncratic characteristics in our mother FE model. These include

birth weight, birth parity, year of birth, county of birth, mother’s age at birth, and gender.

      One concern about the validity of our FE model arises because the expected timing

for the child to take the university entrance test might be an important consideration for

parents contemplating divorce. For example, parents might strategically postpone divorce

until a specific child or all their children complete the test to avoid any negative impact

on test performance. In either case, our FE model is unable to return an unbiased estimate

of the divorce effect. In Section 3.3 we address this concern by examining our data. The

results suggest that the monthly divorce rate does not exhibit any sharp change between

right before and right after the children’s test dates. In addition, the demographic

characteristics of divorced parents are balanced between right before and right after the

test dates. Both findings imply little parental manipulation of the divorce timing.

                                              2
     When estimating the job-loss effect, we follow Charles and Stephens (2004), Doiron

and Mendolia (2012), Eliason (2012), and Chen, Liu, and Wang (2016) to exploit firm

closure as the variation source of job loss. We apply the same mother FE model used for

estimating the parental divorce effect to estimate the job-loss effect. Here, our FE model

exploits the difference in university admission between siblings who experienced parental

job loss before age 18 and those who experienced it after age 18.

     The effect of parental job loss on university admission offers a benchmark to evaluate

the role of the economical mechanism behind the parental divorce effect. For the

benchmark to be valid, however, it needs to meet two requirements. First, parental job loss

has to cause a significant family income reduction, as parental divorce does. Second, the

psychological impacts on children caused by parental job loss need to be less severe than

those due to parental divorce. In section 3.4, we provide supporting evidence for the two

requirements. For the first requirement, we use administrative data to show that parents in

our sample suffered a significant and long-lasting income loss after losing a job due to

firm closure. For the second requirement, we provide evidence showing that job loss due

to firm closure did not predict family dissolution; the implied psychological impact on

children is therefore unlikely to be comparable to that caused by parental divorce. A

comparison between the parental divorce effect and parental job-loss effect indicates the

importance of reduced income behind the adverse divorce effect.

     Our estimation results suggest that children who experienced parental divorce at ages

13 to 18 suffered a 10.6 percent decrease in the likelihood for university admission at age

18. However, parental job loss occurring at the same ages did not have any negative effect

as such. Combined, the two findings imply that the adverse divorce effect was unlikely to

be driven by reduction of economic resources for children. Rather, non-economic

mechanisms, such as psychological trauma, might have played a more important role.

                                            3
Further evidence suggests that younger adolescents are more vulnerable to parental

divorce: Every 100 days younger in the age at parental divorce implies a 1.2 percent

decrease in the likelihood of university admission at age 18. Finally, we estimate the

parental divorce effects for sons and daughters separately; the gender difference is found

to be little.

      Our findings make several contributions to the literature on the effects of marriage

dissolution or family structure on children’s outcomes. The principal contribution is the

adding of causal evidence regarding the divorce effect on children’s higher education

outcomes. Previous studies tackling endogenous divorce mainly used three different

strategies – (1) a family or mother fixed-effects model that relies on within-sibling

comparison (Ermisch and Francesconi, 2001; Page and Stevens, 2004; Bjorklund and

Sundstrom, 2006; Bjorklund et al., 2007; Steele et al., 2009; Francesconi et al., 2010), (2)

a differences-in-differences method with the design relying on amendments of marriage

law (Gruber, 2004; Cáceres-Delpiano and Giolito, 2012), and (3) an instrumental variable

(Frimmel et al., 2016). 1 Our findings support these earlier works in showing significant

effects of parental divorce on children’s outcomes.

      To our knowledge, we are the first to assess the weight of the economical mechanism

behind the adverse divorce effect on children’s education outcome. The opportunity to

make this assessment is granted by our unique administrative data that provide both

marriage and job history of the parents in our sample. Our finding of non-negative effects

of parental job loss implies that the economical mechanism takes a smaller weight on

adverse parental divorce effect than the non-economic mechanism.

      We are also the first to meticulously examine parental selection on the timing of

1
  One strand of studies estimated the effect of parental death on children and considered the effect as a
benchmark for exogenous parental absence. See Corak (2001), Lang and Zagorsky (2001), Fronstin,
Greenberg, and Robins (2001), and Amato and Anthony (2014).

                                                   4
divorce, which poses a threat to the validity of the family or mother FE model. Previous

FE studies ignored or just mentioned the potential selection without carrying out any

empirical analysis to assess the extent of such a threat. Our finding of little parental

manipulation over the timing of divorce lends support to the validity of the FE models.

     This paper is also related to a prior literature that examines whether the exact age at

which a child experienced parental divorce matters. The age at parental divorce should be

a vital factor determining the impacts, but the existing statistical evidence is extremely

scarce. As rare examples, Kravdal and Grundy (2019) and Ermisch and Francesconi (2001)

both found that preschool ages are more vulnerable than later ages to the shocks from

parental divorce. Focusing on teenagers, our findings are generally consistent with these

earlier works by showing that younger adolescents are exposed to more impairment

caused by parental divorce.

       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 overviews the university

admission system and the laws concerning divorce in Taiwan. Section 3 describes the data,

sample selection, and sample statistics. Section 4 introduces the mother FE model and

then discusses its validity. Section 5 presents estimation results and examines the

robustness. Finally, we draw some conclusions in Section 6.



2   Background
2.1 Higher education in Taiwan

In Taiwan, students begin their primary school education at the age of six. Primary school

takes 6 years to complete, followed by junior high school that takes 3 years. Thereafter,

the path goes into two tracks – academic versus vocational. Academic-track students study

at an academic senior high school for three years, whereas vocational-track students study

at a vocational high school for three or five years.

                                              5
        The sole starting date for primary schools in Taiwan is September 1st. A child is not

permitted to enter elementary school until reaching the 6th birthday prior to September 1st

of the relevant year. Throughout this paper, the age of an individual is measured by years

since the date of birth, rather than the calendar year. An individual born in year y is

considered to be n years old during the period from the nth birthday to the date just before

the (n+1)th birthday.

        During the third year of academic high school, students can make two attempts for

university admission through taking two different university entrance tests. 2 The first is

the General Scholastic Ability Test (GSAT), which is scheduled in late January or early

February during the third year of high school; the second is the Advanced Subjects Test

(AST), which is scheduled for July 1 to July 3 of the same year. All third-year high school

students are required to take the GSAT, but only a portion of them will qualify for the first

round of university admissions, which are based on GSAT scores and high school

performance. Unsuccessful applicants and those who were not satisfied with their

admission outcomes move on to taking the AST in July for the second round of admissions,

which are exclusively determined by the AST scores. Each student, admitted or not, is free

to take both tests again and apply for admission in the following year and any later year.

        Given the timing of the elementary school starting date and the age requirement for

starting school, the age of 18 is the expected age for an individual to make the first attempt

for university admission. To see this, we consider children born between September 1979

and August 1980. This cohort was expected to start elementary school in September 1986,

after they reached the age of 6. If they followed the academic track in high school, they

would have been expected to take the GSAT and AST for the first time in 1998 and, if



2
    Very few students who graduated from vocational high school were admitted to university.

successful, been enrolled in a university when they were age 18. 3

      To make within-sibling comparisons, we need a clear cutoff date to identify whether

a child experienced parental divorce before or after the completion of the university

application process. For the purpose of this paper, we consider the timing of the AST (July

1-3) at the expected age for university admission as the cutoff. It is a better cutoff than that

of the GSAT (late January or early February) for two reasons. First, the number of students

admitted through the AST is significantly more than those admitted through the GSAT.

Luoh (2018) shows that, prior to 2002, over 90 percent of all fresh university students

were admitted through the AST. The proportion decreased but remained high in 2002

(78.4%) and 2003 (80.7%). 4 Because our sample consists of students taking the GSAT

and AST between 1998 and 2003, these statistics imply that the AST was the major

university admission channel for students in our sample. Second, regardless of the first-

round admission outcome after taking the GSAT, all students, admitted or not, are free to

move on to take the AST. For all students, therefore, the period between the two tests

remains susceptible to parental divorce. The dates of the AST provide a ‘clean’ cutoff that

marks the end of any potential divorce effect on university admission.



2.2 Divorce

Traditionally, married couples in Taiwan were reluctant to divorce due to common beliefs

in Confucianism, which emphasizes family values. However, the crude divorce rate

increased from 1.01 in 1984 to 2.51 in 2010, which was already higher than the average



3
  To be sure, the expected age for university admission might be different from the actual age for university
admission due to an early start (entering elementary school before reaching age 6), a late start (entering
elementary school after reaching age 7), grade retention, or grade skipping. These cases are uncommon in
Taiwan. The proportion of early starters during 1999 to 2006, for example, was 2.42 percent, whilst late
starters accounted for only 2.20 percent during the same period of time.
4
  The GSAT was established in 1994, but it was operating as a test run before 2002.

     Divorce in Taiwan takes two forms – consensual and court-granted. Divorce by

mutual consent is made in writing, witnessed by two people, and registered with the

Household Registration Bureau. No court action or cooling-off period is required for

mutual-consent divorces. Any couple failing to reach an agreement on divorce can resort

to the court system. However, divorce will only be granted by a court on grounds such as

bigamy, adultery, and intolerable ill-treatment and humiliation. Compared to consensual

divorce, court-granted divorce is uncommon. In 2010, for example, the number of court-

granted divorces (4,898 cases) accounts for only 8.4% of the entire divorce cases (58,118).



3    Data and samples
3.1 The four administrative datasets

We use four different national administrative datasets. The subjects are males and females

born between September 1980 and August 1985. These subjects were linked to their

parents’ divorce record, and siblings are identified by mother’s citizen identification (ID)

number. All four administrative datasets are population wide and thus are virtually free

from the problem of sample attrition. This constitutes a strong advantage of administrative

data over longitudinal survey data, which often suffer from serious attrition.

        The first administrative dataset is Birth Registry records, ranging from 1978 to

1999. The dataset reports ID number, birth date, birth parity, birth type (singleton or

multiple births), birth weight (in grams), and both parents’ ID numbers and characteristics

at the time of the childbirth, including age, marital status, education level, and residential

county. We link siblings by their mother’s ID.


5
  The statistics are from the Department of Statistics in the Ministry of the Interior, Taiwan. The crude
divorce rate is the number of divorces per 1,000 mid-year total population during a given year.

                                                   8
     Our second dataset is the University Entrance Test records from 1998 to 2003. They

report ID, GSAT and AST scores, and, if successfully admitted, the name of the university

admitted to. We are interested in two margins of higher education outcomes – admission

to any university at age 18, and admission to a public university at age 18 (we use two

separate dummy variables to indicate the two different outcomes). In Taiwan, with better

education quality and more financial resources, public universities are more selective than

private ones. We utilize these two outcome variables to shed light on the effects of parental

divorce on the likelihood of being admitted to any university at all, as well as the

likelihood of being admitted to a university of better quality.

       We obtain information of parental divorce from Divorce Registry records (1998-

2003), our third administrative dataset. The records report each divorced person’s ID

number, date of divorce, date of marriage, and date of birth. Using this dataset, our

treatment variable is defined as a dummy variable indicating the experience of parental

divorce prior to the AST at age 18 (= 1) or otherwise (= 0). Given the time windows of

our data, 13 is the youngest age at which a child in our sample experienced parental

divorce.

       The last set of administrative data is the Unemployment Insurance Payment

records (1998-2003). The dataset provides ID number, date of job loss, and the reason for

job loss. The reasons include firm closure (due to relocation, suspension, or bankruptcy),

layoff, and involuntary job leave. We use these data to define another treatment variable

as a dummy variable indicating whether an individual experienced parental job loss prior

to the AST at age 18 (= 1) or otherwise (= 0).



3.2 The sibling sample

We restrict our sample to siblings born between September 1, 1979 and August 31, 1985.

                                             9
These individuals were selected because they were expected to take the university

entrance tests for the first time between 1998 and 2003, the time window of the University

Entrance Test records.

       In order to ensure that our estimates could be more readily interpreted, our sample

excludes families with any sibling born to an unmarried mother (0.5%), families with half-

siblings born to different fathers (2.5%), and all step-siblings. In our sample, half-siblings

born to different mothers are considered as belonging to different families. Our sibling

sample is finalized with 1,073,833 individuals from 481,459 families.

       We carry out the main estimation using a pooled sample that combines both male

and female siblings, with a gender dummy being included in the regression as a control to

allow the education outcome to differ between genders. Later in Section 5.5 we estimate

the parental divorce effects separately for males and females.



3.3 The Endogeneity of Parental Divorce

Parents may choose the timing of divorce. Particularly, parents might deliberately delay

divorce until the child completes the AST to avoid any negative influence on the child’s

performance. In such case, the timing of parental divorce relative to the expected AST

dates is endogenous, and the resulting selection bias cannot be removed by within-sibling

comparison. To gauge the degree of such selection, we examine whether parental divorce

risk increased shortly after the child completed the AST. Such an increase signals parental

selection. We use our sibling sample to calculate monthly divorce rates, measured as the

number of divorce cases per 100,000 individuals in a month, over the entire sample period

(from 1998 to 2003). We adjust the divorce rates by multiplying the rates by 30/31 for 31-

day months, by 30/28 for 28-day months, and by 30/29 for 29-day months. To remove the

seasonality and time trend of divorce rates, we obtain the residuals from regressing the

                                             10
adjusted divorce rates on the full set of calendar-month fixed effects and a time trend

variable measured in months to the AST dates at age 18.

       Figure 1 presents the residual divorce rates, with t = 0 indicating July of the year

the child is expected to take the AST. The following months, August, September, and

October, are respectively indicated by t = 1, t = 2, t = 3, and so on; the months prior

to July – June, May and April – are respectively indicated by t = −1, t = −2, t = −3,

and so on. The curve does not exhibit any sharp increase in the residual divorce rate right

after t = 0. If anything, the rate follows a mild increasing trend before t = 0, and a

deceasing trend after t = 0.

       Furthermore, we examine the mean of observable parental characteristics right

before and right after t = 0, using all divorced parents in our sample. Any significant

change in these characteristics right after t = 0 implies that parents with particular

characteristics are able to manipulate the timing of divorce around t = 0. The

examination results are presented in Figure 2, where Figure 2-A shows the average ages

for parents who divorced between t = −12 and t = 12. The two curves show that both

mother’s (blue curve) and father’s (red curve) ages at the time of divorce follow a smooth,

increasing pattern throughout the time period. No significant change can be detected right

after t = 0. Figure 2-B presents the proportions of mothers (blue curve) and fathers (red

curve) with a high school diploma. Although both curves fluctuate across months, neither

curve exhibits any obvious change right after t = 0. Finally, Figure 2-C shows no abrupt

change in the proportions of parents living in urban areas at t = 0.

       Combined, Figures 1 and 2 suggest that the expected timing for the child to take

the AST is unlikely an important consideration when parents are contemplating divorce.

At least within the time window between one year before and one year after expected

timing of the AST, parents do not seem to strategically delay divorce.

                                            11
3.4 Parental job loss due to firm closure

As we have mentioned earlier, the second goal of the paper is to estimate the effect of

parental job loss on university admission at age 18. We then compare this effect to the

estimated divorce effect to shed light on the extent to which the adverse parental divorce

effect on the child’s university admission was driven by reduction of family income. We

hypothesize that (1) parental job loss caused a significant reduction of family income, and

(2) the psychological impact of parental job loss on children is less severe than that due to

parental divorce. In this section, we provide evidence to support the two hypotheses.

     To reduce the concern about endogenous job loss, we exploit job loss due to firm

closure. The effect of firm closure on laid-off employees’ income is twofold. First, firm

closure leads to unemployment, and the resulting income loss can only be partially offset

by Unemployment Insurance benefits. 6 Second, when a laid-off worker finds a new job,

the reemployment wage is often lower than the wage prior to firm closure. Figure 3

presents the effects on the two different margins. Using our sibling sample, we observe all

the parents who experienced a job loss due to firm closure and track their employment

status and wage for 6 years after the firm closed. Because our data only report labor market

outcomes at the end of each calendar year, for those who lost their jobs at any time during

year t, we calculate the average employment rate and wage at the end of years 𝑡𝑡, 𝑡𝑡 + 1, 𝑡𝑡 +

2, … , and 𝑡𝑡 + 5. Here, we mark these years as year 1, year 2, …, and year 6, respectively.

     Figure 3-A shows the average reemployment rates for fathers (blue curve) and

mothers (red curve), separately. The blue curve suggests that, at the end of year 1 only 70

percent of the laid-off fathers were reemployed. The rate kept decreasing in the following


6
  The Unemployment Insurance program provides 60 percent of the wage prior to the job loss. The benefits
terminate at the end of the first six months of unemployment or whenever the workers are reemployed.

                                                  12
5 years, showing no sign of bouncing back. For laid-off mothers, 67 percent found a new

job by the end of year 1. The proportion climbed back to 72 percent in year 2 and further

to 75 percent in year 3, then started declining for the remaining years. These dynamic

patterns indicate a severe, long-lasting family income loss caused by firm closure. The

picture is even dimmer if we weigh in reemployment wage. Figure 3-B presents laid-off

fathers’ and mothers’ reemployment wages from the year they were reemployed to year 6.

Note that the observations here are not panel-balanced: Reemployed workers enter the

sample on a rolling basis, starting at the time of reemployment. The blue curve suggests

that the reemployed fathers suffered a NT$10,000 (35 percent) reduction from their

monthly wage just prior to firm closure. Worse, the average wage continued to fall in the

following 5 years. The wage loss for laid-off mothers (red curve) is less severe and seems

mitigated over time, but the reemployment wage failed to return to the prior-to-firm-

closure level even at the end of year 6.

     We now turn to the potential impact of parental job loss on the child’s psychological

well-being. Theoretically, the effects can be both positive and negative. On the one hand,

the financial and mental pressure caused by job loss may intensify conflicts among family

members and increase the risk of family dissolution. On the other hand, laid-off parents

may be able to spend more time with their children, which can have positive effects on the

children’s development and well-being. Moreover, children exposed to family adversity

may learn to take more responsibility for the family and turn more serious about school

education and time use. The combined effect, therefore, is ambiguous and may differ

across children with different characteristics. 7

     Because our data lack any information to measure psychological status, we are unable

7
  For example, Nikolova and Nikolaev (2018) have recently shown that individuals who experienced
parental job loss at ages 0-5 reported a lower level of life satisfaction at ages 18-31. The effect, however,
was little or even positive for those exposed to parental unemployment at ages 6-10.

                                                     13
to estimate the psychological impact of parental job loss. Alternatively, we take a glance

at this potential impact by examining whether parental job loss is associated with a higher

risk of parental divorce. Obviously, divorce indicates the existence of conflict in the family,

which adversely affects children’s psychological well-being. We use parents in our sibling

sample to run an OLS regression of divorce on past experience of job loss due to firm

closure. The estimation results are presented in Table A1 in the Appendix. Column 1 shows

that, when no covariates are controlled for in the regression, experiencing job loss is

associated with a 0.103 percentage point increase in the probability of subsequent

marriage dissolution. The coefficient is minimal and statistically insignificant. In columns

2 and 3, we present the estimates when we add individual-level and family-level controls

to the OLS regressions. 8 These results do not support the hypothesis that parental job loss

due to firm closure predicts marriage dissolution. To be sure, we are unable to rule out

other channels through which parental job loss would impede children’s psychological

well-being. However, such potential impact is unlikely to be comparable to that caused by

parental divorce.



3.5 Summary statistics

We present the descriptive statistics of our sibling sample in Table 1. Columns 1 and 2

show the means and standard deviations of variables in the entire sample. The observations

are of 1,073,833 children, both males and females. Columns 3 and 4 present the

corresponding statistics for children experiencing parental divorce, which amounts to

22,811 individuals or 2.1 percent of the sample. The statistics for children who did not


8
  Individual controls are gender, birthweight, birth parity, and school year of birth. Parental characteristics
are mother's year of birth, father's year of birth, mother's education level, father's education level, and
mother's age at first birth and its squared term. Household variables are county of residence and number of
siblings.

                                                      14
experience parental divorce are presented in columns 5 and 6.

        Column 1 suggests that around 14.5 percent of the children in the sample were

admitted to a university at age 18 and 5.4 percent were admitted to a public university at

age 18. Both figures are much lower for children experiencing parental divorce: 8 percent

and 2.7 percent (column 3), respectively. For the entire sample, around 1 percent of the

children were exposed to parental job loss due to firm closure during the sample period.

The proportion is nearly doubled (1.8 percent) for children experiencing parental divorce.

For other variables, a comparison between columns (3) and (5) shows little differences

between the two groups of children in terms of sex ratio, birthweight, year of birth, and

family size. However, children exposed to parental divorce are more likely to live in urban

areas, have younger and less educated parents, and be higher order births.



4    Empirical strategy
Our regression is specified as follows:

                    𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼1 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 + 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 𝛾𝛾1 + 𝑭𝑭𝑗𝑗 𝛿𝛿2 + 𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ,        (1)

where 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a dummy variable, taking the value of one if individual i of family j is

admitted to any university (or a public university) at age 18 in calendar year t (𝑡𝑡 =

1998, 1999, … . , 2003). 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 1 indicates that individual i experienced parental divorce

prior to the last day of the AST (July 3) at age 18. 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of idiosyncratic

characteristics comprised of gender, birthweight, birth parity, and school year of birth. 9

𝑭𝑭𝑗𝑗 is a vector of observable family-level characteristics, including parental characteristics

(mother's year of birth, father's year of birth, mother's education level, father's education



9
  A school year in Taiwan operates from September 1 to August 31 in the next year. A child born in school
year 𝑡𝑡 is expected to start schooling in year 𝑡𝑡 + 7. We control for school year rather than calendar year
because the former is more relevant to yearly university admission rates.

                                                            15
level, and mother's age at first birth and its squared term) and household variables (county

of residence and number of siblings). 𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗 measures the unobserved and invariant

characteristics across siblings born to the same mother. Finally, 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the individual

specific error term.

       We start with estimating Equation (1) using the OLS model. The OLS estimation

relies on comparing those who experienced parental divorce prior to the AST at age 18

and those without such experience. The coefficient of interest is 𝛽𝛽1 , which indicates

parental divorce effect. We undertake two different specifications of the OLS regression.

The first is a baseline regression which only controls for the individual characteristics 𝑿𝑿𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒕𝒕

(hereafter, the ‘OLS’ model). The second is the regression extended to control for both the

individual characteristics 𝑿𝑿𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒕𝒕 and the family-level characteristics 𝑭𝑭𝒋𝒋 (hereafter, the

‘OLS+controls’ model). A comparison of the estimates of 𝛽𝛽1 obtained from the two OLS

regressions sheds light on the impact of the observed family-level controls on the

estimated divorce effects.

       Next, we estimate Equation (1) using the mother fixed-effects model (hereafter, the

FE model), and compare the FE estimate to the OLS estimates. The FE estimation relies

on comparing siblings who experienced parental divorce before versus after the AST at

age 18. The advantage of using the FE model is that 𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗 of Equation (1) will be differenced

out by the within-mother comparison. Thus, to the extent that all confounders are at the

family level and invariant across siblings, the FE model produces an unbiased estimate of

𝛽𝛽1.

       One potential limitation of our mother FE model is that some confounders may vary

across siblings, resulting in the FE regression not fully eliminating the omitted variables

bias. To mitigate this concern, we follow Sigle-Rushton et al. (2014) to control for a set of

individual characteristics described as 𝑿𝑿𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒕𝒕 . Among those controls, birth weight and

                                               16
gender are intended to capture the differences in health endowment between siblings; birth

parity and gender are potentially important determinants for differences in family

resources (finance, nutrition, and parents’ quality time) allocated to different siblings;

school year of birth is designed to measure differences in yearly university admission rates,

which mainly depend on the population size of the relevant school year cohort.

       The OLS and FE estimates of 𝛽𝛽1 may be different for the following reasons. First,

the OLS estimates may suffer from omitted variables biases caused by confounders that

are invariant across siblings, whilst the FE estimate is unaffected by such confounders.

Second, parental marriages usually dissolve after a long period of marital discord, which

likely has an adverse impact on children’s education outcomes. If so, both our OLS and

FE estimates capture such a marital discord effect, but the FE estimate takes the effect to

a lesser degree. To see this, consider a family of two children whose parents divorced

when the first child was 19 years old and the second child was 17 years old. Further assume

that the divorce put an end to a bad relationship that lasted for 3 years. Before attaining

the age of 18, the second child experienced 3 years of parental marriage discord, whilst

the first child was only exposed to the first 2 years of the discord. Our OLS estimates,

which compare education outcomes between individuals with and without experiencing

parental divorce prior to age 18, are confounded with the entire 3 years of marital discord

effect. Alternatively, by comparing siblings who experienced parental divorce before and

after age 18, the FE estimate captures only the first 2 years of the marital discord effect.

Making a precise assessment of the effect from pre-divorce parental conflicts is beyond

the scope of this study. However, since the FE estimate captures such effects less, it is

expected to be less biased than the OLS counterparts.

       To estimate the effects of parental job loss on children’s university admission, we

simply replace the covariate of interest (𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) of Equation (1) for a dummy variable

                                             17
indicating that individual i experienced parental job loss prior to July 3rd of the year the

individual turns the age of 18 (𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 1) or otherwise (𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 0). We will first estimate

the effect without distinguishing between maternal and paternal job loss; namely, 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is

set to be 1 when either mother or father was laid off. We then move on to separately

estimate the effects brought about by maternal and paternal job loss, using two different

dummy variables to indicate the two cases.



5    Results
5.1 The effects of parental divorce

Table 2 presents the OLS, OLS+controls, and FE estimates of the divorce effects on

children’s university admission obtained from estimating Equation (1). In column 1, when

only individual characteristics are controlled for, the OLS estimate of the divorce effect

(represented by 𝛽𝛽1 in Equation (1)) suggests that experiencing parental divorce prior to

the AST at age 18 is associated with a decrease of 7.68 percentage points (ppts) in the

likelihood of university admission at age 18. The OLS estimate greatly decreases to 4.82

ppts when parental characteristics and household variables are added to the controls, as

shown in column 2. 10 Column 3 presents the mother FE estimates. The estimate of 𝛽𝛽1

suggests that parental divorce leads to a 1.56 ppt decrease in the odds of university

admission at age 18. Although the FE estimate is markedly smaller than its OLS

counterparts, it is statistically and economically significant, accounting for a 10.8 percent

decrease from the average university admission rate (14.5 percent) for our entire sample.




10
   Individuals characteristics are gender, birthweight, birth parity, and school year of birth. Parental
characteristics are mother's year of birth, father's year of birth, mother's education level, father's education
level, and mother's age at first birth and its squared term. Household variables are county of residence and
number of siblings.

                                                      18
       The difference between the OLS and FE estimates implies that the negative

correlation between parental divorce and education outcomes estimated by the cross-

sectional comparison may be seriously biased by unobserved family-level confounders.

Another implication is that controlling for a rich set of individual and family

characteristics in the OLS+controls model is unlikely to return an unbiased estimate of the

divorce effect.

       The results for public university admission paint a similar picture. The OLS

estimate in column 4 suggests that experiencing parental divorce prior to the AST at age

18 caused a decrease of 3.13 ppts in the likelihood of admission to any public university.

The estimate declines to 1.85 ppts when more controls are added to the regression (column

5), and further reduces to 0.86 ppt as estimated using the FE model (column 6). All three

estimates are statistically significant. The FE estimate accounts for a 15.9 percent decrease

from the average admission rate (5.4 percent) for public universities.

       The FE estimates in columns 3 and 6 of Table 2 suggest that the negative impact

of parental divorce on a child’s higher education outcome may be twofold: it impeded not

only the admission to any university, but the admission to a university with better

education quality and more abundant resources. Given the recent evidence suggesting a

positive return to university selectivity (Hoekstra, 2009; Dale and Krueger, 2014; Li et al,

2012; MacLeod et al., 2017), our finding of the twofold effect of parental divorce is

particularly alarming.



5.2 The role of income loss

Table 3 presents the estimated effects on university admission of parental job loss due to

firm closure. For brevity, we present only the OLS+controls and FE estimates. Ignoring

the OLS estimates without additional controls does not suffer a loss because Table 2

                                             19
(Section 5.1) has shown that such OLS estimates are not very informative. In Table 3,

column 1 shows the coefficient estimate of a dummy variable indicating whether the child

experienced parental job loss prior to the AST at age 18 (= 1 ) or not (= 0), without

distinguishing between maternal and paternal job loss. The estimate suggests that being

exposed to prior-to-AST parental job loss is associated with a significant decrease of 0.96

ppt in the likelihood of university admission at age 18. The mother FE estimate is

presented in column 2. In sharp contrast with the OLS+controls estimate, there is a

positive FE estimate of 0.83 ppt, but it is statistically insignificant.

        The difference between the OLS+controls and FE estimates implies that parental

job loss due to firm closure might not be exogenous. Indeed, it is plausible that individuals

who experienced firm closure may have different characteristics than those without such

experience. Before a firm reaches the shutdown point, it might have experienced hardship

in business and even suffered a long-run loss in profit. Naturally, the employees will catch

the drift of the firm’s dim future, but they may respond in different ways. Those who have

better outside opportunities might choose to find another job before the firm closure; the

remaining workers stay until being laid off at the time of closure. If these two types of

workers are different in unobserved characteristics that affect adversely their children’s

education, our estimated OLS effect of parental job loss is potentially biased. This

highlights the advantage of our mother FE model that removes family-level confounders

and controls for a rich set of idiosyncratic characteristics of siblings.

        Next, we replace the job loss dummy variable for two dummy variables that

separately indicate maternal and paternal job loss. We then repeat the estimation of the

mother FE model, with the results being presented in column 3 of Table 3. Whilst the

estimated effect of paternal job loss is minimal and insignificant, the estimated effect of

maternal job loss is significantly positive – experiencing maternal job loss prior to the

                                               20
AST at age 18 increased the probability of university admission at age 18 by 1.67 ppts

(accounting for 11.5 percent of the sample mean). Columns 4 to 6 present the estimated

effects on public university admission, and the pattern of the three estimates is similar to

those shown in columns 1 to 3. The OLS estimate is negative (column 4), but the FE

estimate turns positive (column 5), and the positive effect was mainly driven by maternal

job loss (column 6).

         Why would parental job loss have a positive effect on children’s academic

performance? Particularly, why is the positive effect of job loss driven by job losses of

mothers? One possible explanation is that parents, especially mothers, who turn

unemployed may increase time spent on their children. Consequently, parents enhance

care of their children and develop effective communication with them. 11 To shed some

light on this point, we use data from the 2000 and 2004 versions of Taiwan’s Time Use

Survey, which reports the exact time individuals spent on various household activities,

including housekeeping, cooking, parenting, and other activities. Here, we observe

married men and women who were at the ages between 40 and 55, parallel to the range of

parents’ ages in our sibling sample. For employed and non-employed females (males)

separately, we calculate the average amount of time they spent on housekeeping and

parenting from 6pm to 9am the next morning, during which all family members are likely

be at home. Table 4 presents the statistics, which indicate that employed females spent an

average of 82.1 minutes on housekeeping and parenting from 6pm to 9am per weekday

(column 1). The average length of time for non-employed females is 106.4 minutes



11
   Our findings about the differential effects of unemployment between fathers and mothers are in line with
some previous relevant studies. Kalil and Ziol-Guest (2008) found that fathers’ involuntary job loss lead to
a high probability of children’s grade repetition and school suspension or expulsion, but the corresponding
effect is insignificant for mothers, even in households with the mother being the major income earner. Rege,
Telle, and Votruba (2011) found that paternal job loss due to plant closure has a negative effect on children's
GPA, but the effect of maternal job loss is not significant.

                                                      21
(column 2), which is around 30 percent higher than that for employed females. The margin

is statistically significant, as suggested by the result of the t test on equality of the two

average numbers (column 3). For males, however, the picture is utterly different.

Employed males spent only 18 minutes per weekday on housekeeping and parenting, and

the time only marginally increased to 21.2 minutes for non-employed males. Being

employed does not seem to make a difference on fathers’ housekeeping and parenting time.

       The statistics in Table 4 have two implications. First, non-employed married

women spent more time than employed ones on housekeeping and parenting, supporting

our parental-time-at-home hypothesis as a possible explanation for our finding of the

positive effect of maternal job loss on university admission. Second, and more important,

we now obtain a more profound understanding of the little effect a father’s job loss has on

university admission. One possible scenario is that the adverse income effect caused by a

father’s job loss was offset by gain in the father’s time at home. This scenario is

implausible because Table 4 shows that employment status does not make a large

difference between the time that married men spend on housekeeping and parenting. This

makes another scenario more plausible: income loss due to a father’s job loss does not

adversely affect a child’s university admission.



5.3 Discussion

In the preceding subsection, we have shown that parental job loss did not hinder children’s

university admission, despite the sizable and long-lasting loss of family income (Section

3.4). One may be wondering why children’s higher education outcomes were impervious

to negative family income shocks – a finding generally at odds with previous studies that

mostly found adverse effects of parental job displacement on children’s outcomes



                                             22
(Oreopoulos et al., 2008; Stevens and Schaller, 2010; Rege et al., 2011; Lindo, 2011). Here,

we provide a discussion on the inconsistency.

       In our sample, more than 90 percent of the parental divorces took place when the

child was between the ages of 15 and 18 (the ages for high school education). It is possible

that parents experiencing firm closure may choose to cut consumption without sacrificing

education investment on children at these ages for high school. It is also possible that

education investment was not as productive for children at ages 15-18 as for younger

children, so whether family income loss causes a reduction in education investment does

not matter. Furthermore, as we have mentioned earlier, it is possible that teenagers exposed

to a family income shock may learn to be more responsible for the family and become

more diligent on school work, offsetting the negative income effect. Finally, higher

education is fairly cost friendly for parents in Taiwan. The average tuition fee was less

than US$2,000 per year for public universities and less than US$4,000 per year for private

universities. In addition, university students from low income families are granted access

to multiple financial aids. It is therefore unlikely that the cost of higher education would

prevent single-parent students from enrolling.

       Our finding of a non-negative effect of family income shocks on the odds of

children’s university admission implies that the adverse parental divorce effect found in

Section 5.1 is unlikely to operate through the economical mechanism. Non-economic

mechanisms, such as psychological and emotional shocks, are more likely dominant.



5.4 Does age at parental divorce matter?

By far we have focused on estimating the effect of parental divorce on the child’s

university admission without considering the exact age at which the child experienced

parental divorce. The age at parental divorce should be an important factor in determining

                                            23
the magnitude of the divorce effects on the child’s outcomes, but the existing evidence on

the effect is extremely scarce.

       The age-at-parental-divorce effect is complex for at least two reasons. First,

younger children may be more susceptible to environmental changes caused by parental

divorce. On the contrary, it is plausible that older children may be more capable of

acknowledging the downside of parental marriage dissolution, and thus are exposed to

more adverse shocks. Second, when the child’s outcome is measured at a fixed age, age at

parental divorce is perfectly collinear with another factor – time lapse since divorce. This

makes the picture more complicated because the effect of time lapse since divorce itself

may be twofold. It is plausible that the divorce effect is acute in the short run, but it fades

out as children becomes accustomed to the status of parental divorce. It is also plausible

that the adverse impact of parental divorce would accumulate over time.

       Our study adds valuable evidence to the literature. Our sibling data provide a unique

opportunity to investigate whether children experiencing parental divorce at different ages

would exhibit any differences in university admission. The availability of the exact date

of birth and the exact date of parental divorce allows for a precise measure of time elapse

since divorce, denoted by TED. Specifically, TED is measured by the number of days

between the date of parental divorce and the last date of the AST (July 3) at age 18 for

children experiencing parental divorce. For those experiencing parental divorce after the

date, TED is set to be zero.

        To conduct the estimation, we extend Equation (1) by incorporating the interaction

term of 𝑇𝑇𝐸𝐸𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 as an additional covariate:

         𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼1 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛾𝛾1 + 𝑭𝑭𝑗𝑗 𝛿𝛿2 + 𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,   (2)

where 𝛽𝛽2 is the coefficient of interest, which is expected to be zero if TED does not matter.

We present the estimation results in Table 5, and, for a more effective comparison, we only

                                                                24
present the FE estimates. Column 1 duplicates the estimates from column 3 of Table 2,

which shows the FE estimate of the divorce effect (𝛽𝛽1) on university admission. Column

2 of Table 5 presents the estimates of 𝛽𝛽1 and 𝛽𝛽2 from estimating Equation (2). The

estimate of 𝛽𝛽1 is -0.79 percentage point, which is markedly lower than the corresponding

estimate (-1.56 percentage points) in column 1. More importantly, the estimate of 𝛽𝛽2 is

significantly negative, implying that the adverse divorce effect was stronger if the parental

divorce occurred at a younger age. Quantitatively, every 100 days younger led to a 0.17

ppt decrease in the likelihood of university admission at age 18. This implies a 1.19 ppt

decrease if the effect is measured at the mean of TED (698 days).

       Columns 3 and 4 of Table 4 present the FE estimates for public university

admission. Again, column 3 copies column 6 from Table 2, while column 4 shows the

results from estimating Equation (2). After inserting the interaction term of the divorce

dummy and time length since parental divorce, 𝛽𝛽1 decreases from 0.86 to 0.67

percentage point and remains statistically significant. Meanwhile, the estimate of 𝛽𝛽2 is

negative but insignificant, suggesting that the age at parental divorce does not matter much

for public university admission.

       We do not have a clear answer as to why age at parental divorce has different

effects on the margins of university admission and public university admission. Our

conjecture is that higher achieving students, who are more likely to gain admission to a

public university, adapted better to the adverse impacts from parental divorce.



5.5 Robustness examinations

We consider two robustness checks. First, we simultaneously estimate the effects of both

parental divorce and parental job loss in one regression. Second, we estimate the divorce

effects for males and females separately.

                                             25
        To complete the first task, we extend Equation (1) to incorporate a dummy variable

(denoted by 𝐽𝐽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ) on the right-hand side to indicate experiencing parental job loss prior to

the AST at age 18 (𝐽𝐽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 = 1) or not (𝐽𝐽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 = 0). The regression is specified as

                    𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼1 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐽𝐽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 + 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 𝛾𝛾1 + 𝑭𝑭𝑗𝑗 𝛿𝛿2 + 𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 .   (3)

Table 6 presents the estimates of 𝛽𝛽1 and 𝛽𝛽2. Column 1 suggests that the OLS+controls

estimate of the parental divorce effect on university admission is -0.0482, which is

virtually identical to the corresponding estimate when the divorce effect is estimated

separately (see column 2 of Table 2). The fact that adding the job loss dummy variable

(𝐽𝐽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ) to the controls of Equation (1) does not make any difference implies that the divorce

dummy variable (𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ) and the job loss dummy variable (𝐽𝐽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ) are uncorrelated. It is

therefore not surprising to find that the estimate of the job-loss effect (-0.0092) is very

similar to the corresponding estimate (-0.0096) when the effect is estimated independently

in column 1 of Table 3. For the remaining five columns of Table 6, the similarity can also

be seen between the pooled-model estimates and the corresponding split-model estimates,

no matter whether the comparison is made for the estimated divorce effects (between

Tables 6 and 2) or job-loss effects (between Tables 6 and 3). These results clearly indicate

robustness of our main estimates.

        Next, we investigate whether the parental divorce effects differ between sons and

daughters. For the estimation of our mother FE model, we construct a ‘male sibling’

sample comprised of males for whom there was at least one observation of a brother in

the sample period (regardless of any sisters he may have), and a parallel ‘female sibling’

sample constructed in the symmetric way. Note that individuals who were the only son or

only daughter of a family are excluded from the two samples, so the sample

representativeness changes. Using the two split samples, we repeat the OLS,

OLS+controls, and FE estimations of Equation (1), and the results are presented for males

                                                             26
(upper panel) and females (lower panel) separately in Table 7. In each of the six columns,

the estimated divorce effect for the males is fairly close to the corresponding estimate for

the females. These results suggest that parental divorce caused similar damages in the

likelihood of university admission for sons and daughters.



6   Conclusions
We have studied the extent to which parental divorce would affect a child’s university

admission. The estimation results from our mother FE model, which relies on within-

sibling comparisons, suggest that children exposed to parental divorce at the ages of 13-

18 suffered a 10.6 percent decrease in the likelihood of university admission at age 18,

and a 15.7 percent decrease in the likelihood of public university admission at the same

age. Our second finding indicates non-negative effects of parental job loss on university

admission, although parental job loss had led to a sizable and prolonged loss of family

income. This finding implies that the detrimental effects of parental divorce were unlikely

to operate through deprivation of economic resources. Therefore, the help of professional

counseling or other supportive service is likely to benefit the teenagers who experienced

parental divorce more than the economic support.

       Our findings also suggest that younger adolescents appear to be more susceptible

than older adolescents to parental divorce. This may be because younger children are

mentally more vulnerable to family dissolution, or the detrimental effect of parental

divorce accumulates over time. In either case, more attention should be paid to younger

children with divorced parents.

       The existing evidence relating to parental divorce and its impacts on children has

been predominantly focused on high income countries. However, divorce has increasingly

become a major concern for middle- and low-income countries, including those in East

                                            27
Asia where divorce was once culturally forbidden due to Confucianism. Using Taiwanese

data, our findings of significantly negative effects of parental divorce and the implied

mental shocks are alarming. Future research that probes into this direction would likely

make valuable contributions towards filling the current gap in the evidence.

                                   Notes: Divorce rate is defined as number of divorce cases per 100,000
                                   individuals in a month. The curve presents residuals obtained from regressing
