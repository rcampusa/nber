Many questions in economics involve long-run or trend variation and covariation in time series. Yet,
time series of typical lengths contain only limited information about this long-run variation. This paper
suggests that long-run sample information can be isolated using a small number of low-frequency
trigonometric weighted averages, which in turn can be used to conduct inference about long-run variability
and covariability. Because the low-frequency weighted averages have large sample normal distributions,
large sample valid inference can often be conducted using familiar small sample normal inference
procedures. Moreover, the general approach is applicable for a wide range of persistent stochastic
processes that go beyond the familiar I(0) and I(1) models.

1       Introduction
This paper discusses inference about trends in economic time series. By “trend” we mean
the low-frequency variability evident in a time series after forming moving averages such as
low-pass (cf. Baxter and King (1999)) or Hodrick and Prescott (1997) filters. To measure
this low-frequency variability we rely on projections of the series onto a small number of
trigonometric functions (e.g., discrete Fourier, sine, or cosine transforms). The fact that a
small number of projection coeﬃcients capture low-frequency variability reflects the scarcity
of low-frequency information in the data, leading to what is eﬀectively a “small-sample”
econometric problem. As we show, it is still relatively straightforward to conduct statistical
inference using the small sample of low-frequency data summaries. Moreover, these low-
frequency methods are appropriate for both weakly and highly persistent processes. Before
getting into the details, it is useful to fix ideas by looking at some data.
    Figure 1 plots the value of per-capita GDP growth rates (panel A) and price inflation
(panel B) for the United States using quarterly data from 1947 through 2014, and where both
are expressed in percentage points at an annual rate.1 The plots show the raw series and two
“trends”. The first trend was constructed using a band-pass moving average filter designed
to pass cyclical components with periods longer than  6 ≈ 11 years, and the second is the
full-sample projection of the series onto a constant and twelve cosine functions with periods
2  for  = 1     12, also designed to capture variability for periods longer than 11 years.2
A glance at the figure shows that the band-pass and projection trends essentially coincide
both for GDP, for which there is only moderate trend variability, and inflation, for which
there is substantial trend variability. This paper focuses on trends computed by projection
methods because, as we will see, they give rise to simple methods for statistical inference.
    Figure 1 raises several empirical questions. For example, the trend in GDP growth has

     Three data series are used in this paper. All are quarterly series from 1947:Q1 to 2014:Q4
for the United States. Real per capita gross domestic product is available from FRED as series
A939RX0Q048SBEA. Inflation is measured using the price deflator for personal consumption expenditures
(FRED series DPCERD3Q086SBEA). Total factor productivity is from Fernald (2014) and is available at

     The low-pass values were computed using an ideal low-pass filter truncated after  2 terms applied

been low for the last decade. Does this portend low average growth over the next decade? Or,
is there mean reversion in the trend so that the next decade is more likely to exhibit faster
than average growth? And, what is the value of the population mean growth rate of GDP?
The plot for inflation shows large persistent variation in its trends over the past sixty years.
Does this suggest that the inflation process is (1)? Or is this behavior consistent with an
(0) process? Alternatively, what about something “between” the (0) and (1) processes?
More generally, the average value of inflation varies considerably over non-overlapping 10- or
25-year time periods; average GDP growth rates show less, but still substantial variability.
How much variability should we expect to see in future 10- and 25-year samples? Section
3 takes up these questions, along with several other questions that can be answered using
univariate time series methods.
    Figure 2 plots both total factor productivity (TFP) and GDP growth rates. The trend
components of the series move together, suggesting (for good reason) that long-run variation
in GDP and TFP growth rates are closely related. But, exactly how closely are they related?
And, by how much is the trend growth rate in GDP predicted to increase if the trend growth
rate of TFP increases by, say, 10 basis points? Section 4 takes up questions like these that
involve multiple (here two) time series.
    The paper begins, in Section 2, with notation and (finite and large-sample) properties of


                                               3
discrete “cosine transforms,” the trigonometric projections used in our analysis.3 Sections
3 and 4 show how these cosine transforms can be used to answer trend-related inference
questions. “Low-frequency” variability conjures up spectral analysis, and Section 5 uses
frequency-domain concepts to explain several facets of the analysis. To keep the focus on
key ideas and concepts, the analysis in the body of the paper uses relatively simple stochastic
processes, and Section 6 briefly discusses some extensions and concludes.

Let  denote a scalar time series that is observed for  = 1      , and let Ψ () =
√
  2 cos(), so that Ψ ( ) has period 2 . Let Ψ() = [Ψ1 () Ψ2 ()     Ψ ()]0 , a
R valued function, and let Ψ = [Ψ((1 − 12) ) Ψ((2 − 12) )     Ψ(( − 12) )]0
be the  ×  matrix obtained by evaluating Ψ(·) at  = ( − 12 ) ,  = 1      . The

where ̄ =  −1 =1  and  are the OLS regression coeﬃcients. Because the columns of
Ψ are orthogonal, sum to zero, and have length  (that is,  −1 Ψ0 Ψ =  and Ψ0  = 0,
where  denotes a  × 1 vector of 1s), the OLS regression coeﬃcients have a simple form

The  th regression coeﬃcient,  , is called the  th cosine transform of [1  2       ]0 .


2.1         Large-sample properties of 
Suppose that  can be represented as  =  +  , where  is the mean of  and  is a zero
mean stochastic process. Because the cosine weights sum to zero, the value of  has no eﬀect
                                                                   P
on  , so cosine weighted averages of  and of  coincide ( −1 =1 Ψ(( − 12) ) =

 −1 =1 Ψ((−12) ) ). Scaled versions of these weighted averages are normally distrib-
uted in large samples if  satisfies certain moment and persistence properties. In Section
5.3 we present a central limit theorem that relies on assumptions about the spectral density
of  . Here we use a simpler argument from Müller and Watson (2008) that relies on the

The elements of the covariance matrix Σ follow directly from the covariance kernel of 
and the cosine weights (see Müller and Watson (2008)). The key idea of our approach to
low-frequency econometrics is to conduct inference based on the large sample approximation

 is a diagonal matrix with elements  = 1()2 , so the  ’s are independent but
heteroskedastic.4 In the following section we present tests for both the (0) and (1) null
hypotheses. Given these scatter plots, it is not too surprising that the (0) null is not
rejected for GDP growth, but the (1) null is rejected, and just the opposite result obtains
for inflation.
    While Σ has a simple form for the (0) and (1) models, it can be more complicated for
other stochastic processes, so it is useful to have a simple numerical method for obtaining
accurate approximations for Σ. As representation (2) suggests, Σ can be approximated by
the large- finite sample covariance matrix Var[ 1−  ] =  2−2 Ψ0 Ξ Ψ where Ξ is the
 ×  covariance matrix of [1  2       ]0 under any (not too heavy-tailed) process for
 that induces the same Gaussian process limit of its partial sums. For example, if  is
(0), then Σ can be approximated using the large- finite-sample covariance matrix of the
cosine transform of an i.i.d. process with variance 2 , Σ ≈ 2  Ψ0 Ψ =  2  . Indeed,
because Σ = 2  for the (0) model, this approximation is exact. When  is (1) Σ can be
approximated using the large- finite sample covariance matrix of the cosine transforms of
a random walk process, Σ ≈  2 Ψ0 Ξ Ψ , where Ξ has ( )th element min( ). In Section
3, we consider the local-to-unity AR model and fractional () model, and the covariance
matrices for these processes can be approximated in analogous fashion.
    While this discussion has focused on discrete cosine transforms, the representation in (1)
is seen to hold for any set of smooth set of weights, Ψ(). Because our interest is focused on
trends, it is important that the weighted averages extract low-frequency variability from the
data, and Figure 1 shows that the cosine transforms do just that (also see Section 5.1 below).
But, low-frequency Fourier or sine transforms are equally well-suited and can be used instead
of the cosine transforms after appropriate modification of the covariance matrix Σ.5
   4
     The asymptotic covariance matrix Σ is diagonal in both the (0) and (1) models because the cosine
functions are the eigenfunctions of the covariance kernel of a demeaned Wiener process; cf. Phillips (1998).
   5
     For example, while the cosine transforms of an (1) process have the diagonal covariance matrix discussed
in the last paragraph, the covariance matrix of Fourier transforms is somewhat more complicated (cf. Akdi
and Dickey (1998)).

    And finally, it is worth stressing that in the asymptotic analysis presented in this section
the dimension of  , which we have denoted by , is held fixed as  grows large. Such
asymptotics reflect the notion that there is only a relatively modest amount of information
about low-frequency phenomena in, say, 65-year realizations of macro time series. In practice,
this translates into using a relatively small number of low-frequency averages from a long time
series. Our empirical analysis uses  = 12 from  = 272 quarterly observations because, from
Figures 1 and 2, this produces a sensible notion of the “trend” in inflation and growth rates
in GDP and TFP, corresponding the periodicities longer than 11 years. The econometric
challenge then is to draw valid conclusions from these  observations. Further discussion of
the choice of  may be found in Section 5.


3      Inference examples: univariate time series
This section takes up five examples of statistical inference involving the low-frequency prop-
erties of a univariate stochastic process. In each case, the normal limit for  discussed in
the last section yields a simple, and standard, small-sample inference problem involving a
normal random vector.


3.1    I(0) inference
The first two examples assume the (0) model and concern inference about the long-run
variance (2 ) and mean () of . These problems are related as both involve  2 , in the first
instance because it is the parameter of interest, and in the second because it characterizes
the variability of the sample mean. There is a large literature on consistent estimation
of 2 , including the important contributions of Newey and West (1987) and others, and
earlier work on spectral estimation (see Priestley (1981) for a classic textbook treatment).
As is now widely understood, consistent long-run variance estimators can perform poorly
in finite samples even for only moderately persistent series. Motivated by these poor finite-
sample properties, a burgeoning literature studies inconsistent long-run variance estimators
(see Kiefer, Vogelsang, and Bunzel (2000) and Kiefer and Vogelsang (2002, 2005), Jansson
(2004), Phillips (2005), Sun, Phillips, and Jin (2008), Phillips, Sun and Jin (2006, 2007)
and Gonçalves and Vogelsang (2011), and Müller (2014) for a recent survey), and estimators
constructed from the cosine transforms as suggested by Müller (2004, 2007) provide a leading

the large-sample log-likelihood is proportional to − 12 [ln ( 2 )+SSX 2 ] and the corresponding
maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for 2 is ̂ 2 = SSX . Because ̂ 2 is computed
using only  observations (and in the asymptotics  is held fixed as  → ∞), ̂ 2 is not
consistent. Indeed, using  = 12,  contains limited information about  2 , so there is
considerable uncertainty about its value. Figure 4 shows the log-likelihood for  constructed
using  for real GDP growth rates. The MLE is ̂ = 48, but the plot shows that
values of  as small as 3.5 and as large as 6.5 have likelihood values within one log-point

squared distribution with  degrees of freedom), and the resulting confidence intervals for
the long-run standard deviation of GDP growth rates and inflation are shown in Table 1.
    Next, consider inference about , the mean of  . The same arguments used in Section
               √

                                                                             √
obtained as in the standard small-sample normal problem. In particular,  (−)̂  ⇒ 
(the Student- distribution with  degrees of freedom), so inference about  follows directly.

rate constructed as  ± 178̂    , where 1.78 is the 95 percentile of the 12 distribution.
    These confidence intervals for 2 and  are predicated on the assumption that  ∼ (0)
and, particularly for inflation, this assumption is suspect. The next inference examples
concern the persistence of the  process.


3.2    Inference about persistence parameters
As discussed in Section 2, the normal limit for  holds under conditions more general
than the (0) model, and the parameters characterizing the persistence of  determine
the covariance matrix Σ. Thus, inference about these parameters can be conducted using
methods for inference about the covariance matrix of a multivariate normal random variable.
This section discusses three classes of examples. First a few preliminaries.
    Some parametric models of persistence. Section 2 discussed the covariance matrix Σ
for (0) and (1) processes. Here we describe three other widely used parametric models
for persistence in economic time series. The first is a sum of (0) and (1) processes: with
appropriate scaling for the components this is a version of Harvey’s (1989) ’local-level-model’
                          P
(LLM)  = 1 + ( ) =1 2 where (1  2 ) is bivariate (0) with long-run covariance
matrix 2 2 . Another is the ’local-to-unity AR’ model (LTUM) in which  =  −1 +  ,
with AR coeﬃcient  = 1 −  and  an (0) process, as introduced by Cavanagh
(1985), Chan and Wei (1987) and Phillips (1987). A third is the ’fractional’ model (FRM)
(1 − )  =  where  is (0) with − 12    32 (cf. Baillie (1996) and Robinson (2003)
for surveys). Each of these processes exhibits diﬀerent degrees of persistence that depend on
the value of the model’s parameter value. For example, (0) behavior follows when  = 0 in
LLM,  = 0 in FRM, and  very large in LTUM. The processes exhibit (1) persistence when


                                               10
 = 0 (LTUM),  = 1 (FRM), and  very large (LLM). Alternative parameter values yield
persistence between (0) and (1), and the FRM with   0 or   1 allows for persistence
beyond these extremes. Excluding their (0) and (1) parameterizations, the models yield
subtly diﬀerent low-frequency behavior as evidenced by their (pseudo-) spectra discussed in
Section 5.2. For now we simply note that this behavior results in diﬀerent values of the
covariance matrix Σ.6
    Scale invariance/equivariance. In many inference problems, interest is focused on the
persistence of the process (say , , or ) and not on the scale of the process (). This
motivates basing inference on statistics that are invariant to scale transformations, which
                                                                  p
in our setting corresponds to basing inference on  =   0  .7 The continuous
                                                   √
mapping theorem implies that  ⇒   =   0 , and the density   ( |Σ) of   is
explicitly computed in King (1980) and proportional to   ( |Σ) ∝ |Σ|−12 (0 Σ−1  )−2 .
    Armed with these preliminaries we are now ready to tackle inference about persistence
parameters. We will construct hypothesis tests, and in some cases invert these tests to
construct confidence sets. We focus on three classes of eﬃcient tests: (i) point-optimal, (ii)
weighted average power (WAP) optimal and (iii) approximately optimal tests constructed
using numerical approximations to least favorable distributions. Each is discussed in the
context of a specific testing problem.
    Point-optimal tests. Let  denote the value of a persistence parameter (say , , or  in
the models described above), so that Σ = Σ (), and the scale of Σ does not matter because
of the form of the density for   . Several problems of interest follow the classic Neyman-
Pearson setup with a simple null and simple alternative, 0 :  = 0 versus  :  =  ,
so the likelihood ratio statistic yields the most powerful test. Given the form of the density
   6
     The scaling factor for  is  12 for LLM,  −12 for LTUM, and is  12− for FRM. The covariance
matrix Σ for each of these models is given in Müller and Watson (2008), and can be approximated using the
appropriate choice of Ξ for the finite-sample methods in Section 2: the covariance matrix for the LTUM
can be approximated using the autocovariances of a stationary AR(1) process with coeﬃcient (1 −  );
and the covariance matrix for the LLM is the sum of the  (0) covariance matrix and 2 times the  (1)
covariance matrix. The covariance matrix for FRM with −12    12 can be approximated using the
autocovariances for (1 − )  =  where  is white noise with variance  2 and the autocovariances for 
are given, for example, in Baillie (1996); for 12    32, Σ can be approximated using the autocovariances
   P
of =0  , where (1 − )−1  =  . Müller and Watson (2008) show that the resulting limiting covariance
matrix Σ is continuous at  = 12 in the FRM.
   7
     Note that the  1− scale factor cancels in  , so the value of  no longer matters for the analysis.

dence intervals for  in the I() model were constructed by inverting WAP-optimal tests for . See

  , this means rejecting the null for large values of the ratio of generalized sums of squares:
(0 Σ(0 )−1  )(0 Σ( )−1  ). Such tests are “point-optimal” in the sense of having best
power against the  =  alternative.8 Two examples are low-frequency ’unit-root’ (LFUR)
and ’stationarity’ (LFST) tests, which respectively test the (1) and (0) null hypotheses,
as previously derived in Müller and Watson (2008). We discuss them in turn.
     Dufour and King (1991), Elliott, Rothenberg, and Stock (1996) and Elliott (1999) derive
eﬃcient Neyman-Pearson tests in the AR(1) Gaussian model with AR coeﬃcient  = 1 and
 =  under the alternative, and the latter two references extend these tests to more general
settings using asymptotic approximations for LTUM where the unit root null corresponds
to 0 = 0 and the alternative to  =  . While a uniformly most powerful test does not
exist, Elliott, Rothenberg, and Stock (1996) show that the point optimal test associated
with a particular value of  exhibits near optimality for a wide range of values of  under
the alternative. The low frequency version of the point-optimal unit root test rejects for
large values of

    Müller (2011) shows that these point optimal tests, viewed as a function of  , are asymptotically point
optimal in the class of all scale invariant tests that control size for all processes satisfying (2).

rejected for inflation (-value = 0.18), but is rejected for GDP growth rates (-value = 0.00).
    Nyblom (1989) and Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, and Shin (1992) develop tests for
the null of an (0) model versus an alternative in which the process exhibits (1) behavior
by nesting the processes in the LLM.9 Under the null  = 0, and under the alternative   0.
As in the unit root problem, a uniformly most powerful test does not exist, but a Neyman-
Pearson point-optimal test using  =  follows directly. Given the special structure of the
(0) and (1) Σ matrices, the point-optimal test has a particularly simple form:
                                                 P       2

Müller and Watson (2013) tabulate critical value for this test using  = 10, and show that
the test has power close to optimal power for a wide range of values of  Table 2 shows
the -values of this test for GDP growth rates (-value = 0.53) and for inflation (-value =
0.03).
    Weighted average power (WAP) tests. LFST and LFUR test the  () model for  = 0
and  = 1, but what about other values of ? And, how can the tests be inverted to form
a confidence set for the true value of ? One approach is to use point-optimal tests for the
null and alternative 0 :  = 0 versus  :  =  for various value of 0 ; the collection of
values of 0 that are not rejected form a confidence set. But an immediate problem arises:
what value of  should be used? A desirable test should have good power for a wide range
of values of  , both larger and smaller than 0 , so that point-optimal tests (which specify a
single value of  ) are not appealing. A useful framework in these situations is to consider
tests with best “weighted average power” (WAP), where the weights put mass on diﬀerent
values of  . As explained in Andrews and Ploberger (1994), for example, optimal WAP
tests are easy to construct. The logic is as follows: Consider an alternative in which 
is a random variable with distribution function  . This is a simple alternative  : 
                       R
has mixture density   (  Σ ()) (), and the optimal test of 0 versus  is the
Neyman-Pearson likelihood ratio test. Rearranging the power expression for this test shows
that it has greatest WAP for  :  =  using  as the weight function.10
    Figure 5 shows the large-sample log likelihood for  using  for real GDP growth rates
and inflation. The MLE of  is near zero (ˆ = −006) for GDP, but much larger (ˆ = 080)
   9
    See Stock (1994) for a survey and additional references.
  10
    As pointed out by Pratt (1961), the resulting confidence set CS() ⊂ R for  has minimal expected
                           R
weighted average length [ 1[ ∈ CS()] ()] among all confidence sets of the prespecified level.

for inflation. But the plots indicate substantial uncertainty about the value of . Using a
weighting function  that is uniform on −05    15, we constructed WAP tests for fine
grid of values of 0 . Inverting these tests yields a confidence set for , and these are shown in
Table 2. For GDP, the 67% confidence sets for  ranges from -0.24 to 0.27, and for inflation
it ranges from 0.48 to 1.01. 90% confidence sets are, of course, wider.
    Least Favorable Distributions. Our final example considers the following question: How
much should we expect the sample average value of  (GDP growth rates or inflation) to
vary over long periods of time, say a decade or a quarter of century? To be specific, let
1: denote the sample mean constructed using observations 1 through  and consider the
variance  2∆ () = Var[+1:2 − 1: ], for large values of . The parameter  ∆ () is the
standard deviation of the change in the sample mean over adjacent non-overlapping sample
periods of length .11 In the large sample framework, let  =  and consider asymptotic
approximations constructed with  held fixed as  → ∞. To conduct inference about
2∆ ( ) using  , we must determine how 2∆ ( ) relates to the value of Σ, the limiting
covariance matrix for  (appropriately scaled). This is straightforward: first an extension
of the central limit result discussed in Section 2 yields
                    Ã                       !   Ã    !       Ã Ã                  !!

                                                                  Σ Σ

Second, because Var[(+1:2 − 1: ) ∆ ( )] = 1,   ∆ ( ) ⇒ N (0 Γ) where Γ =
Σ Σ  . A test of 0 :  ∆ ( ) = ∆0 ( ) against  :  ∆ ( ) 6= ∆0 ( ) may thus
be based on the statistic  =   ∆0 ( ). Under 0 ,  ⇒ N (0 Γ), and under 1 ,
 ⇒ N (0 ( ∆0

                    ( )
                          ) Γ), so the problem again reduces to an inference problem about the
covariance matrix of a multivariate normal.
    The alternative can be reduced to a single alternative  by maximizing a weighted
average power criterion, as above. The problem is still more challenging than the previous
example, however, because the (large sample) null distribution of  ⇒ N (0 Γ) depends
on nuisance parameters that describe the persistence of the  process. In the FRM, for
example, Γ = Γ () with  ∈  for some range of values . In the jargon of hypothesis
testing, the null hypothesis is composite because it contains a set of probability distributions
for  indexed by the value of . The challenge is to find a powerful test of 0 that controls

    Note that  ∆̄ is well defined even for some infinite variance processes, such as the FRM with 12 
  32.

size under all values of  ∈ .
    One general solution to this type of problem uses the same simplification that was used
to solve the weighted average power problem: introduce a weighting function, say Λ () for
                                                                   R
the values of  ∈  and use the mixture density 0Λ :  ∼  (  Γ ())Λ () as the
density under the null. This yields a simple null hypothesis (that is, a single probability
density for the data), so the best test is again given by the likelihood ratio. However, while
the resulting test will control the probability of a false null rejection on average over the
values of  with  drawn from Λ, it won’t necessarily control the rejection probability for all
values of  allowed under 0 ; that is, the test may not have the correct size. But, because
any test that controls the null rejection probability for all values of  automatically controls
the rejection frequency on average over , any test with size  under 0 is also a feasible
size  under under 0Λ , so it must have power less than or equal to power-maximizing test
for 0Λ . Thus, if a distribution Λ can be found that does control size for all , the resulting
likelihood ratio test for 0Λ is guaranteed to be the optimal test for 0 . Such a Λ is called a
“least favorable distribution” (LFD). In some problems, least favorable distributions can be
found by clever reasoning (see Lehmann and Romano (2005) for examples), but this is the
exception rather than the rule. Numerical methods can alternatively be used to approximate
the LFD (see Elliott, Müller, and Watson (2015) for discussion and examples), and we will
utilize that approach here.
    With this background out of the way, we can now return to the problem of determining
the value of  2∆ (). We do this allowing for () persistence, and allow  to take on
any value between -0.4 to 1.4. The weighting in the WAP criterion is uniform on , and,

90% confidence sets for  ∆ () for  ranging from 15 to 70 years. For averages of GDP
growth rates computed over 20-years, the 90% confidence confidence interval for  ∆ ranges
from approximately 0.5 to 1.3 percentage points, and the range shifts down somewhat (to
0.25 to 1.2 percentage points) for averages computed over 60 years. The lower range of
the confidence set essentially coincides with the corresponding (0) confidence set (which
only reflects uncertainty about the value of the long-run variance of GDP growth), but the
upper range is substantially larger than its (0) counterpart, reflecting the allowance for
more persistence than (0) model. The confidence intervals for inflation indicate both large

4      Inference examples: multiple time series
In this section we use the same structure and tools discussed in the last section to study
some inference problems involving multiple time series. Thus, now let  denote an  × 1
vector of time series and  denote the  × 1 vector composed of the  th cosine transform
for each of the  variables. Let  denote a  ×  matrix with  th row given by     0
                                                                                          . In
the multivariate model, the assumption of Section 2 about the large sample behavior of
                                        P c
the partial sum process becomes Υ b·    =1  ⇒ (·), where  is now an  × 1 Gaussian
process and Υ is an  ×  scaling matrix.13 Using the argument from Section 2, this
implies  Υ  ⇒  with vec() ∼ N (0 Σ). In this section we discuss inference problems
in the context of this limiting distribution. We first consider the multivariate (0) model
and inference about its key parameters. We then relate these parameters to population
properties of the trend projections, and return to the empirical question of the relationship
between the trend in GDP and TFP growth rates discussed in the introduction. We end
this section with a discussion of inference in cointegrated models; these are characterized by
linear combinations of the data that are (0) and other linear combinations that are (1).


4.1     Inference in the (0) Model
                                                                                  P c
In the multivariate (0) model  = + , we set Υ =  −12  and assume  −12 b·
                                                                                     =1  ⇒
Ω12  (·), where Ω is the × long-run covariance matrix of  and  is a ×1 multivariate
standard Wiener process. The covariance matrix of vec () then becomes Σ = Ω ⊗  , so
that  ∼ N (0 Ω), where 0 is the  th row of .

    Inference about Ω With   approximately N (0 Ω), standard methods for i.i.d.
multivariate normal samples (see, for instance, Anderson (1984)) can be used to obtain infer-
ence. In particular, the limiting distribution of the multivariate sum of squares is Wishart:
  13
    The scaling matrix Υ replaces the scale factor  1− of Section 2 to allow the partial sum of lin-
ear combination of  to converge at diﬀerent rates, which occurs, for example, if the elements of  are
cointegrated.

By the continuous mapping theorem, ̂ = Ω̂  Ω̂ Ω̂ ⇒ SSX  SSX SSX . This
limiting distribution is known and is a function only of  and  (see Anderson’s (1984)
Theorem 4.2.2), allowing the ready construction of confidence intervals for  based on ̂ .
For example, for the GDP and TFP growth rates, we obtain an equal-tailed 90% confidence
interval for the low-frequency correlation of [028; 086]

A function of Ω of potential interest is the  × 1 vector  = Ω−1      Ω . Since conditional

population regression coeﬃcient in a regression of  on  ,  = 1     . Substantively, 0 
provides the best predictor of  given , so it gauges how low-frequency variability in 
predicts corresponding low-frequency variability of  . The population 2 of this regression
(that is, the square of the multiple correlation coeﬃcient) is 2 = 1 −  2 Ω and it measures
the fraction of the low-frequency variability in  that can be explained by the low-frequency
variability in  .14
    As long as   , inference about these regression parameters follow immediately from
standard small sample results for a linear regression with i.i.d. normal errors:

    Regressions like these using discrete Fourier transforms are familiar the literature on band-spectral
regression (e.g., Engle (1974)). Much of the analysis presented here can be viewed as version of these
methods for a narrow frequency band in the 1 neighborhood of zero.

the regression 2 is 2 = 1 − RSS  TSS ⇒ 2 = 1 − RSS  TSS. By standard ar-
guments (e.g. Anderson (1984) section 4.4.3), the distribution of 2 depends only on 2

̄) = 0  . Thus, the variability and covariability of the projection sample paths, (b           b ),
are determined by the cosine transforms (   ) and the sample means (̄ ̄). Consider the

the large-sample variability and covariability of the projections correspond to the variability

and covariability of ̃ = (0   0 )0 and ̃ = (0   0 )0 . For example, [ 0  ()2 ] =

    Thus,  = Ω  Ω Ω is alternatively interpreted as the population correlation be-
tween the low-frequency trends  () and  (), averaged over the sample fraction . Corre-
spondingly, the regression coeﬃcient  = Ω−1       Ω is the population regression coeﬃcient of a
continuous time regression of  (·) on  (·). The conditionally mean zero error function in
this regression,  (·) =  (·) −  (·), is the part of the variation
                                                                      q of  (·) that is independent
of  (·). Also, the sample correlation coeﬃcient ̂ = Ω̂  Ω̂ Ω̂ is recognized as the
sample correlation between the projections ̂ and ̂ ,  = 1      , and the sample regression
coeﬃcient ̂  can alternatively be computed by a linear regression of ̂ on ̂ and a constant

rate of GDP onto the growth rate of TFP. The OLS estimate of  is 088, suggesting that a
trend increase in the TFP growth rate of 1% leads to a 0.88% increase in the trend growth
rate of GDP. However, this estimate is based on only 12 observations, and the 90% confidence
interval for  ranges from 0.38 to 1.39.15 The regression 2 is roughly 50%, and the 90%
confidence interval for the correlation of the GDP and TFP trends ranges from 0.31 to 0.86,
suggesting that variations in TFP are important, but not the sole factor, behind variation
in trend per-capita GDP growth rates. Figure 9 plots the historical trend growth of GDP,
̂ , along with the predicted values ̂ + ̂ ̂ from the low-frequency linear regression. TFP
explained slightly more than half of the above average trend GDP growth in the 1960s and
nearly all of the below and then above average growth in 1990s, but explains little of low
growth in the late 1950s. More recently, the plot indicates that TFP growth played only a
small role in the slower than average growth in GDP over the past decade.


4.2     Cointegration
In the general cointegration model there are  variables with diﬀerent linear combinations of
the variables being integrated of diﬀerent orders. The notation for the general model can be
taxing, but many insights can be gleaned from a bivariate model with  = [   ]0 , where 
and  are scalar,  ∼ (1) and  =  −  ∼ (0). Denoting the corresponding elements
of  as  = [   ]0 , the partial sum process of  satisfies
       Ã         P c                        !   Ã                                          !

where 1 and 2 are independent Wiener processes and the parameter  denotes the long-
run correlation between the (0) and (1) components. Thus, letting  =  −  ,
[ 12    −12  ] ⇒ [ ] with [ 0   0 ]0 ∼ N (0 Σ). Because  ∼ (0) and  ∼ (1),
the covariance matrix Σ has the partitioned form: Σ  =  21 , Σ =  22 , and Σ  =
 1 2 12 , where  is the (1) covariance matrix defined in Section 2.
     There are a variety of inference questions that arise in the cointegration model, and several
of these are straightforward to address using the low-frequency transforms of the data.16 For
  15
     To put these values in perspective, recall that the standard neoclassical model, which exhibits balanced
growth, implies that a permanent one percentage point increase in TFP leads to a  = (1 − )−1 percentage
point long-run increase in GDP, where  denotes the elasticity of output with respect to capital. Thus
 = 15 if  = 23.

     Also see Bierens (1997) for a related approach.

                                                     23
example, one question asks whether the cointegrating coeﬃcient takes on a specific value,
that is whether  =  0 . Müller and Watson (2013) take up this question using the low-
frequency framework. The idea is straightforward. Write  −  0  =  − ( −  0 ) .
If  =  0 , then the term involving  is absent, but otherwise this component is present.
Thus, [ 12 ( −  0  )  −12  ] ⇒ [ + 0  ] where 0 =  ( 0 − ). The covariance
matrix of [( + 0 )0   0 ]0 is readily computed and depends on 0 . Thus, a hypothesis
about the value of the cointegrating coeﬃcient, say  =  0 or equivalently  = 0 , can
be tested as a restriction on the covariance matrix. After imposing invariance restrictions,
Müller and Watson (2013) show that the scales  1 and  2 can be set to unity, so that  is
the only remaining parameter, and develop an optimal test for  =  0 using a numerical
approximation to the LFD as discussed in the last section. Thus, as in the other inference
examples in the low frequency setting, optimal inference about cointegrating coeﬃcients
becomes a standard problem involving the covariance matrix of normal random vector.
    Perhaps a more interesting question involves the cointegration model’s assumption that
 follows an (1) process. What if  followed another persistent process, perhaps one of the
parametric processes described in the last section? In the context of “eﬃcient” regression
inferences about , Elliott (1998) showed that the (1) assumption was crucial in the sense
that large size distortions could arise if  followed a LTUM instead of an exact (1) process.
The low-frequency analysis outlined in the last paragraph is not immune from Elliott’s
critique: it uses the full covariance matrix for [( + 0 )0   0 ]0 , and therefore utilizes the
(1) property of  (through the (1) covariance matrix  that appears in Σ and Σ  ).
Müller and Watson (2013) study optimal tests for  =  0 under alternative assumptions
about the trend process. In particular, they show that if the  process is unrestricted, then
the (essentially) most powerful test simply involves testing whether  −  0  is (0) using
the LFST test in (4), a solution to the Elliott critique originally proposed by Wright (2000),
although not in the low-frequency setting.17
  17
    The Müller and Watson (2013) result on the near-optimality of the LFST test holds in the cointegration
model with a single cointegrating vector. If there are multiple cointegrating vectors then it is possible to
obtain more powerful tests even absent assumptions on the process for the common stochastic trends.

5       Relationship to Spectral Analysis
This section relates our method to spectral analysis. A first subsection discusses why one
cannot simply use traditional spectral analysis inference tools to answer questions about
low-frequency variability. A second subsection derives the limiting covariance matrix of the
cosine transforms in terms of the spectral density of the underlying time series. A calculation
shows that the covariance matrix is fully determined by the shape of the spectral density
close to the origin, a function we call the “local-to-zero spectrum.”18 In the third subsection,
we present a central limit theorem for low frequency transforms under general forms of the
local-to-zero spectrum.


5.1       Scarcity of low-frequency information and its extraction using
          cosine transforms
Scarcity of low-frequency information. In traditional spectral analysis (see, for instance,
Priestley (1981) or Brockwell and Davis (1991)), the periodogram is the starting point to
learn about the spectral properties of a time series. Figure 10 plots the periodogram for
quarterly GDP growth rates. The shaded portion of the figure shows the frequencies corre-
sponding to periods of 11 years or longer. A mere six periodogram ordinates fall into this
 18
      This subsection largely follows the development in Müller and Watson (2015).

low-frequency region, and this count would remain unaltered if GDP growth was instead
sampled at the monthly or even weekly frequency. Intuitively, 67 years of data contain only
limited information about components with periods of 11 years or longer.
     Traditional inference about the shape and value of the spectral density is based on averag-
ing periodogram ordinates. The asymptotics are driven by an assumption that the spectrum
is locally flat (that is, the spectrum is fixed and continuous), so that as the sample size grows,
eventually there will be more and more relevant periodogram ordinates to estimate the value
of the spectral density at any given point. Under such asymptotics, Laws of Large Numbers
and Central Limit Theorems are applicable and enable asymptotically normal inference.
     But with the relevant number of periodogram ordinates as small as six, such asymptotics
do not provide good approximations. What is more, in any non-(0) model, the spectrum
has non-negligible curvature even within a ( −1 ) band around zero, and this band contains
a fixed number of periodogram ordinates. For these reasons, the traditional inference tools
of spectral analysis are not directly applicable.
     Extracting low-frequency information using cosine transforms. Do a small number of
cosine transforms do a good job at extracting the low-frequency information that is contained
in the sample data? One useful way to answer this question is to consider the a perfectly
periodic time series of frequency ,  = sin( + ) with phase shift  ∈ [0 ]. Ideally, the
low-frequency cosine transforms  would capture the entire variation of  for 0 ≤  ≤ ̄
for small values of ̄ and none of the variation if   ̄. In large samples, with ̄ = ̄ for
fixed ̄, the corresponding 2 of a regression of  on Ψ is well approximated by the 2 of
a continuous time regression of sin( + ) on the  × 1 cosine functions Ψ() and a constant


                                                 26
for  ∈ [0 1]. Figure 11 plots this continuous time 2 as a function of  for ̄ = 12. While
the 2 plot does not follow the ideal step function form, it still provides evidence that the
low-frequency cosine transforms do a reasonably good job at extracting the low-frequency
information of interest.19


5.2     Local-to-Zero Spectra
Because Σ is the limiting covariance matrix of the cosine transforms, which in turn are
weighted averages of the underlying series  , the elements of Σ depend on the autocovari-
ances of the -process. These, in turn, are linked to spectrum of the process, and this makes
it possible to express Σ as a function of the spectrum. Because the cosine transforms extract
low-frequency information in , it should not be surprising that it is the spectrum close to
zero that determines Σ. The remainder of this subsection makes this explicit by showing
that Σ can expressed as a function of the spectrum evaluated at frequencies in a ( −1 )
neighborhood of frequency zero, a function we call the local-to-zero spectrum.
    Local-to-zero spectrum for a stationary process. Suppose that  is a stationary process
with spectral density  ().20 Suppose that in the ( −1 ) neighborhood of the origin, the
suitably scaled spectral density converges (in an 1 sense)

                                           1−2  ( ) → ()                                   (5)

For example, the FRM is traditionally defined by the assumption that  () is proportional
to ||−2 for small , so that (5) holds with  = 12 − . More generally, the function () is
the large sample limit of the shape of the original spectrum  close to the origin, and we
correspondingly refer to it as the “local-to-zero” spectrum.
    Now consider a weighted average of  ,

for some Riemann integrable function  and ̃ =  (−1) (). In light of (1), the
cosine transforms are an example of  . Recalling that the  th autocovariance of  is given
  19
     Low-frequency Fourier transforms perform similarly well for extracting low-frequency variations. See
Müller and Watson (2008) for the corresponding 2 plot.

     The  subscript on  accomodates “double-array” processes such as the LTUM in which the AR(1)
coeﬃcient depends on  . To ease notation, we omit the corresponding  subscript on  =  in this
subsection.

    Local-to-zero pseudo-spectrum. This calculation requires the spectral density of  to
exist. For some models, such as the (1) model, only the spectral density of ∆ is well
defined, so a generalization of (6) to this more general case is required. This is possible when
                                                   R1

second moment, then neither does   ).

of  is well defined, then  ()|1 − −i |2 = ∆ (), and (5) and (7) are equivalent, since
 2 |1 − −i |2 → 2 , so that ∆ () = ()2 . On the other hand, if the spectral density of
 does not exist, then  () = ∆ ()|1 − −i |2 suitably defines a “pseudo spectrum” of
 with local-to-zero limit () = ∆ ()2 , so (8) still applies.

√                              √
   2 cos() and  2 () = 2 cos(), a calculation shows that 12 () =  () = 0 for
1 ≤   ≤  and  +  odd, so that [  ] = 0 for all odd  + , independent of the
local-to-zero spectrum . With 0 the suitably scaled limit of the sample mean ̄ (so that
() = 1), this holds for all   = 0 1 2   .

the covariances  ,  6=  are shown as thin curves. A calculation shows that covariance
weights  ,  6= , integrate to zero, which implies that for a flat local-to-zero spectrum ,
Σ is diagonal. As can be seen from the panels on the diagonal, the variance of  is mostly
determined by the values of  in the interval  ± 2. Further, as long as  is somewhat
smooth, the correlation between  and  is very close to zero for | − | large. For  ,
  0, the weights  put zero mass on  = 0; it is this feature that makes it possible for
Σ to be well defined even if () is not integrable, as is the case if  is only a “pseudo-

 = 0, so the variance of 0 will not exist for processes such as the (1) model.

     Since the local-to-zero spectrum determines Σ,  is the key property of the underlying
process  for the purposes of “low frequency econometrics.” It is instructive to revisit the
three benchmark models LTUM, LLM and FRM introduced in Section 3.2 from this per-
spective. As already noted above, the FRM model has a (pseudo-) spectrum proportional
to ||−2 for  close to zero, so that () ∝ ||−2 , −12    32. In particular  is
constant for the (0) model and it is proportional to −2 for the (1) model. This implies
that the local-to-zero spectrum of the LLM satisfies () ∝ 2 + −2 . Finally, in the LTUM,
a straightforward calculation shows that () ∝ 1(2 +2 ). (Note that ( ) → (∞ ∞) and
( ) → (0 0) recover the (0) and (1) model, respectively). Figure 13 plots the logarithm
of the local-to-zero spectra of the three benchmark models for selected values of ,  and 
     Choice of . The -axes in Figures 11-13 are usefully thought of zooming in on the shaded
area in the periodogram plot of Figure 10: In terms of the original time series, local-to-zero
frequencies of, say, ||  12 correspond to cycles of periodicity  6. Thus, with 66 years
worth of data (of any sampling frequency), the shape of the spectrum for frequencies below
11 year cycles more or less determines the properties of the cosine transforms for  = 12. In
the context of a specific model of low-frequency variability, such as the (0) or (1) model,
or parametric families such as the FRM, LLM or LTUM, the choice of  then governs the
frequencies for which the model’s implications are exploited for inference. The choice of
 is thus a trade-oﬀ between robustness and eﬃciency: a large  enables more powerful
inference, as more cosine transforms are used to learn about model parameters of interest,
but a large  also increases the danger of relying on a misspecified model for this inference,
as the low frequency model must accurately describe the spectrum over a wider frequency
band. Roughly speaking, the low-frequency model is fit to the  observations  , which
suggests that in general, the degree of misspecification is a function of , without any obvious
relationship to the underlying sample size or time span. The choice of  then amounts to a
regularity assumption about the properties of the underlying data (relative to the model of
low-frequency variability) that makes inference possible.21 For instance, conducting inference
about  in the context of the (0) model with  = 12 and 66 years of data implicitly assumes
that the spectrum is approximately flat over all frequencies corresponding to cycles of 11
  21
     Without additional strong cross-frequencies restrictions, it is not possible to systematically select the
appropriate  from data: If one insists on correct inference whenever the crucial central limit theorem (2)
holds for some conservatively small 0 , then no data dependent rule for selecting   0 can improve on
inference that simply uses  = 0 . See Müller (2011), especially page 414, for a formal discussion.

   Multivariate local-to-zero spectra. As a final generalization of the connection between the
second moments of weighted averages and the spectrum of the underlying series, consider
now the case where  is a  × 1 vector. Its spectral density then is a  ×  Hermitian matrix

5.3    A Central Limit Theorem
The inference results presented in Sections 3 and 4 all depend crucially on the large sample
Gaussianity of the suitably scaled cosine transform  , and not just on the value of the
limiting covariance matrix Σ In Section 2, we provided an argument for this asymptotic
normality based on existing results about the large sample behavior of the partial sum
process for some benchmark models. The last subsection identified the local-to-zero spectrum
 as the key feature of  that determines the asymptotic covariance matrix. We now
present a corresponding central limit theorem that takes the local-to-zero behavior of the
spectral density function as its starting point and is applicable to general weighted averages

averages with weights that add to zero, 0 () = 0, which allows for more persistent
processes  (as discussed in the last subsection).

    The proof of Theorem 1 is in Appendix A.
    The scaling of  in the theorem is such that  ( ) converges to the local-to-zero
without any additional scaling by a power of  (so relative to the discussion in Section 5.2,
 in Theorem 1 is multiplied by  12− ).
    To better understand the role of assumptions (ii) and (iii), consider some leading ex-
amples. Suppose first that  is causal and weakly dependent with exponentially decay-

    Corresponding central limit theorems for a vector of weighted averages of one or multiple
time series follow readily from Theorem 1 by invoking the Cramer-Wold device.


6     Concluding remarks
Inference about low-frequency phenomena is challenging because of the scarcity of corre-
sponding sampling information. We suggest extracting this information by computing 
trigonometrically weighted averages of the time series of interest. We then apply an as-
ymptotic framework that explicitly accounts for the scarcity by keeping the number  fixed,
so that in the limit, the inference problem becomes a small sample problem involving 
Gaussian variables. In many instances, this small sample problem is readily solved by classic
results about inference in small Gaussian samples. In other cases, one can apply analytical
or numerical approaches to derive powerful inference from first principles.
    The results presented here did not allow for a deterministic time trend in the  process.
One approach to dealing with deterministic trends is to use inference methods that are
unaﬀected by their presence. Alternatively, for example in the context of measuring the
covariability of multiple time series, one might model the presence of common time trends.
In either case, it is straightforward to isolate the deterministic trend component by using a
suitable set of  weight functions, where one is equal to the (demeaned) trend (and whose
value is potentially ignored in the subsequent analysis), and the other  − 1 trigonometric
weights are orthogonal to both a constant and a time trend. One such set of weights is
derived in Müller and Watson (2008).
    The results presented here were also based on the large sample Gaussianity of the 
weighted averages due to a central limit theorem. The key mechanisms of the approach,
however, can be used to deduce a non-Gaussian limit distribution after suitably adjusting

                                               35
the solution of the now non-Gaussian limit problem. For example, consider a stochastic
volatility model for the scalar series  , where the volatility process is, say, local-to-unity.
Conditional on the volatility path, the cosine transforms have a Gaussian limit, with a
covariance matrix that depends on the realization of the volatility path. The unconditional
distribution thus becomes a mixture of normals, and the corresponding small sample problem
becomes inference about the parameters of this normal mixture.
    More generally, we believe our general approach to low-frequency econometrics to be
useful for issues beyond those discussed here. For instance, in Müller and Watson (2015),
we use this framework to derive predictive sets for very long-run predictions that are valid
for a wide range of persistent processes. We are currently working on inference about the
degree of covariability of potentially non-(0) series. And it would also be of great interest
to connect the low-frequency econometrics approach more directly with structural economic
models, such as asset pricing models that stress long-run uncertainty.


A      Proof of Theorem 1
The proof of Theorem 1 is based on the following Lemmas.
