                      LATIN AMERICA'S INTRAREGIONAL TRADE:
                         EVOLUTION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS


                                      ABSTRACT




This paper analyzes in detail the evolution of Latin America's international

trade patterns,   focusing on intraregional trade and on the formal attempts

made to create free trade zones or custom unions.       In particular, we assess

the role of intraregional     trade in the structural   adjustment required by the

Latin American debt crisis.      The data analyzed show that the success of the

commercial integration process has been quite limited.        They also show that

there has been no significant change in the DECO countries'      share in Latin

American imports or in the volume of intraregional trade flows since the

early l970a.   Furthermore,    the nature of the adjustment   to the debt crisis

of the 1980s indicate that Latin American markets possess a rather limited

capacity to absorb a substantial increase in regional exports in the current

context.   Thus, we conclude that the success of the required expansion      in

Latin American exports will depend more on the region's ability to design

innovative mechanisms to penetrate the markets of industrialized       countries

than on the deepening of any regional trade integration process.

I.   Introduction

     The attempts to integrate Latin American trade date back, at least, to

the days of the independence wars.        Simon Solivar dreamed of a Spanish

America integratedpolitically and economically.           Although no serious

efforts have been made to politically unify the region, throughout            the years

many attempts have been made at generating some sort of integrated economic

zone within which free trade would prevail.          Historically moat of those

atcempta have been less than successful.          Recently, however,   some experts

have argued that renewed efforts towards regional trade integration should

be undertaken as a way to face the debt crisis.

      There is little doubt that a permanent solution to Latin America's

current crisis, and the resumption of sustained          growth, will require a major

effort to increase exports and to enhance the role of the external sector.

It is especially important, then, to determine where thoae exports will go

and who will Latin America import from in the future.           In particular, it is

important to evaluate what contribution could an expansion of intraregional

trade make to this process.

      The purpose of this paper is to analyze the evolution of Latin

America's      international   trade patterns,   focusing on intraregional    trade and

on the formal attempts made to create free trade zones or custom unions.

The analysis also deals with the role of the Latin America's main trade

partner   --    the United   States -- and discusses the role of Japan and the

Asian NICs in the future evolution of Latin America's          trade flows.     The

paper also discusses      the possible future evolution of regional trade.

      The paper is organized aa follows:         Section II provides a general

account of the evolution of Latin America's         commercial policies.      The

section is divided into two parts.         The first provides a broad view of the
                                            2




evolution of protectionism         in the region; the second psrt is s more detailed

analysis of the region's attempts to formally integrate its international

trade.     Here the objectives     snd institutional characteristics     of the most

important multilateral trade agreements         are reviewed and their achievements

are evaluated.       Section III deals with the recent evolution of Latin

America's directions of trade; the origin of aggregate imports and the

destination of aggregate exports are analyzed.          Section IV provides a

significantly more detailed and disaggregated         analysis of the region's

composition of trade with special emphasis on intraregional            trade.   Unfort-

unately, due to the lack of current data this analysis only covers until

1984.     The information available,     however, is detailed enough as to provide

a broad picture of the recent trends.           In Section V we discuss the issue of

protectionism    -   - both in   the rest of the world as well as in the region       -   -
and the future evolution of LatIn America's trade.          Section VI deals with

the possible role of enhanced intraregional trade in the aolution of the

debt crisis.     Finally Section VII contains the concluding remarks.


II.     The Evolution of Latin America's Corercial Policy

11.1 General Trends

        Until the 1930s the external sector in the great majority of the Latin

American countries was highly opened; exchange controls were almost nonexis-

tent, import tariffs were very low, and the "rules of the game" were

strictly followed.       All of this ended with the great depression;       at that

time an epoch of import substitution and protectionism         beganJ
        During the 1950s and 1960a, under the intellectual leadership of the

United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA/CEPAL),2 and its

charismatic    Secretary General Raul Prebisch, most of the Latin American
                                        3




countries embarked on ambitious    industrialization   programs based on import

substitution.     This strategy was based on the premise that high import

tariffs and other impediments to international trade would provide temporary

protection to the domestic manufacturing sector.       According to this approach
after some time the domestic firms would have "learned",      and protection

would not be necessary any more (Prebisch 1984).       Things, however, did not

work out as predicted by the theory, and protectionbecame a permanent

feature.     As a result, in most of the Latin American countries the indust-

rial sector developed under the barriers of protection; this industrial

sector was largely inefficient and used highly capital intensive techniques

(Krueger 1980, 1983).

     During the 1950s and first half of the l960s it became apparent that

the import substitution strategy was losing dynamism.      Although the easier
and more obvious imports had already been substituted,      these countries

remained highly "dependent" on imported intermediate inputs and capital

goods.     At the same time the highly overvalued domesr[c currencies conspired

against the development    of a dynamic export sector, with the consequent

scarcity of foreign exchange.3

     During the late l960s a mild reaction against excessive protectionism

started to take place in some countries.     In Colombia, for example, there

was an important move towards export promotion schemes (Diaz Alejandro

1976).     Also, and as is discussed in greater detail below, during this

period some serious efforts were made to create common markets comprising

either all Latin American countries or subgroups of them.      In that respect

the creation of the Latin American Free Trade Association,     the Andean Group

and the Central American Common Market were
                                            particularly important.

Although in some regards these integrationist schemes were successful, they
                                          4



did not turn around the region's economies, and in many cases the external

sector   --   and the excessive protectionism -- was    still seen as   the "weak

link" by most analysts.4

     During the second half of the 1970s a larger and larger number of

countries began to recognize       the benefits of export promotion,    and some of

them began to rationalize their external sector.         This process was supple-

mented by significant debt inflows from the international banking system.

This opening up process was particularly important in the countries of the

Southern Cone (Edwards 1985, Calvo 1986).         In August of 1982, immediately

following Mexico's formal announcement that it was facing serious financial

difficulties,     the international financial community greatly reduced the

amount of funds intermediated to the developing world.         Even some countries,

such as Colombia, which in no way faced payments problems, had serious

macroeconomic     disequilibria,   or had accumulated debt at a very fast pace,

were affected by this reduction in foreign lending.          In fact, it is fair to

                                           was reduced in a brutal way.             For
say that the availability of foreign funds

the developingworld as a whole, external financing was reduced by almost 40

percent between 1981 and 1983.        Moreover,   the major debtors were forced to


fully close a current account deficit that in 1982 exceeded $50 billion in

less than 3 years.       By 1985 the aggregate current account had reached

virtual equilibrium ($-0.l billion).          In order to achieve this significant

adjustment these countries had to engineer a major turnaround in their trade

balance, which went from an aggregate deficit of almost $7 billion in 1981

to a surplus of more than $40 billion in 1984.

     During the initial stages of the adjustment process, most Latin

American nations resorted to an extraordinary increase in protectionism as

the most rapid and effective       (although not efficient) way of reducing
                                              5




imports.       In some countries the extent of trade restrictions has recently

been somewhat relaxed, while other have announced some easing up in the'near

future.     In Chile, for exsmple, tariffs were reduced to a 20% uniform level.

Mexico has taken some steps towards reducing the coverage of licenses, while

in Bolivia as part of the stabilization program aimed at stopping hyperin-

flation, quotas have been abolished and tariffs reduced.               In many countries

trade liberalization        packages are being discussed as a part of

conditionalityagreements with the multilateral institutions.                All in all,

however,       in mid-1988 the level of trade restrictions     remain very high in

most of the region.

11.2 Latin America's Historical Attempts at Rezional Trade Intezrptiort

     The first modern attempts at commercial           integration date back to the

late 1950s and early 1960s.           The rationale for these attempts, however,

cannot be found on the traditional           (static) trade-creation    effects predicted

by the customs unions theory.5           Instead, commercial integration in Latin

America was perceived and advocated as the only alternative to overcome the

problems related to the inadequate          scale of domestic markets.      Also,   it was

thought that regional integration would help overcome the existing diffi-

culties of substituting the importation of the full range of intermediate

and capital goods.

     In effect, it was basically as an attempt to extend the import

substitution strategy         --   and as a response to the urgings of ECIA    --   that
six South American countries and Mexico established the Latin American Free

Trade Area (LAFTA/AIALC) and four Central American nations created the

Central American Common Market (CACM) in 1960.            These attempts at commercial

integration were followed by the creation of two other subregional              common

markets    -   - the   Caribbean Free Trade Association   (CARIFTA) in 1965 and the
                                        6




Andean Group (AG) in 1969 - - and ended up with the replacement of LAFTA by

the Latin American Integration Association      (LAIA/ALADI) in 1980.

     In general, the differences among these institutions are not restricted

to the number and relative homogeneity of their members, but also lie on

their attempted goals and on the mechanisms designed to achieve them, as

well as on their accomplishments.     As a way to provide a basic framework for

the understanding of the current state and future prospects of this process,

this section provides a brief review of the most salient features of the

different attempts at commercial integration in Latin America in the last

three decades.

     11.2.1.     The Latin American Free Trade Area

     The Treaty of Montevideo, signed in 1960 and put into effect on June           1,

1961, created the Latin American Free Trade Area (LAFTA/ALALC) comprised of

Argentina,   Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay,     Peru and Uruguay (the two remain-

ing South American countries, Bolivia and Venezuela,      joined the association

only in 1966 and 1967, respectively).       The main objective   of LAFTA was the

gradual elimination of trade barriers and the progressive        reduction of

tariffs affecting intraregional    trade flows.    The goal of an almost

completely liberalized regional market was scheduled to be accomplished after

a 12-year transitionperiod of continuous multilateral                        The
                                                      negotiations.

countries agreed on following a product-by-product      negotiation strategy

regulated by GATT-type principles    of most favored nation and reciprocity.

The latter was designed to provide more favorable treatment to the least

developed countries of the region (Bolivia and Ecuador).

     In order to achieve its goal of a gradual liberalization of

intraregional    trade flows LAFTA established three mechanisms:     the "national

lists", the "common lists" and the agreements      for industrial
                                                7
complementation.       The items included in the "national lists" were those for

which each country agreed to reduce nominal tariffs by at least 8% per year.

The negotiations concerning          the products each country was to include in

these lists were scheduled to be conducted annually.               The "common lists", on

the other hand, included those producta in which               jj countries   agreed to

have fully liberalized        --   i.e.,   zero tariffs and no quantitative restric-

tions   -   - intraregional   trade by the end of the transition period.         The

Treaty established that negotiations regarding this list should be carried

out every 3 years and that the members should progressively              increase the

number of items included on it, in order to fulfill the objective of having

75% of the intraregional           trade subject to this treatment by 1972.       Finally,

the agreements for industrial           complementation   were supposed to constitute

the mechanisms for coordinating at a regional level the industrial policies

in those sectors in which the volume of intraregional trade was too low or

nonexistent.

        This attempt at commercial integration, however, faced serious

obstacles almost since its inception.              Pressures   for the extension of the

original 12-year transition period began to build up just after the first

round of negotiations.         After successive postponements and amendments of the

liberalizationschedule, this was finally extended until 1980.                  On the other

hand,    despite an auspicious        start, the number of items added each year to

the "national list" of the member countries experienced a rapid and abrupt

reduction.       As can be seen in Table        1, the total   number of tariff conces-

sions granted by LAflA members on their "national lists" more than doubled

between 1962 and 1968, but almost stagnated from then on.                By 1968 the

countries      had already granted 93% of the total concessions they had given by

the end of the LAflA agreement             in 1980.6
                                            8



      The other two mechanisms designed by LAflA performed even worse.          Only
one "common list" was negotiated and approved in 1964, but it never became

effective,    while the agreements for industrial complementationcovered very

few sectors, moat of which were dominated by multinational       corporations

located in the three larger countries (Argentina, Brazil and Mexico).

      The relative failure of the negotiation mechanisms      was also reflected in

the sluggish evolution of the volume of intraregional       trade.   Table 1 shows

that the percentage of LAFTA'a exports directed to the regional market only

increased from 7.6% to 11.4% between 1962-64 and 1971-72.        After a decrease      in

the period 1973-74 caused by the oil crisis, this ratio remained quite stable

at a level lower than 14% until the dissolution of LAflA in 1980.

      A key factor to understand the very limited success of LAflA in

promoting a vigorous increase in the level of intraregionsl trade can be

found in the type of products for which tariff concessions were granted.

Most of the items included in the "national lists" of the member countries

were either primary products (on which trade within the region had been

traditionally   based) or commodities that had never been produced in the

region.     In this sense, the slow acceleration in the volume of intraregional

exports seems to have been just a consequence of making the whole scheme

dependent    on the intensification   of the traditional patterns of trade within

the region.

      Among the different explanations that the literature on the subject has

provided for this modest overall result of the LAflA experience we have:7

(1)   the absence of a mechanism that would have prevented an uneven distri-

bution of the costs and benefits of the integration process among the

heterogeneous members of LAflA;       (2)   the favorable effect generated by the

abundance of capital inflows in the early 1970s on      LAFA   countries'   foreign
exchange constraints;      (3)   the nonexistence   of provisions for the

coordination of macroeconomic policies within the members;         (4)   the costly

bargaining process implicit in a product-by-product        negotiation technique;

and   (5)     the inherent conflict that exists between a domestic import sub-

stitution strategy and a commercial integration scheme.         Even though there

is no doubt that factors (1) through (4) played a role in the disappointing

outcome of the LAflA attempt, it can also be said that all of them were,           in

one way or another, a consequence of the conflict between the goals of

import substitution end those of a genuine integration process.

      In effect, the underlying rationale of all these explanations seems to

be the existence of a basic misperception of the significant costs involved

in the attempt to extend the import substitution strategy to a regional

level.      The fact that potential regional imports of manufacturing products

were even more competitive with domestic production than the permitted

imports from third sources made the highly protected        import competing sector

of each country to strongly oppose the scheduled liberalization.            The large

efficiency differentials among the industrial sectors of LAFTA members only

exacerbated this problem.        This also explains why the integration process

experienced a halt in the late l960s, precisely when its further progress

required granting tariff concessions on the highly protected durable and

nondurable consumer goods sector.

      The reaction of LAFTA members to this paralysis of the integration

process varied widely;     it went from the early creation of the Andean Group

by a subgroup of nations in 1969, to the final replacement of LAFTA by the

more modest, in terms of goals, Latin American IntegrationAssociation

(l.AIA/ALADI) in 1980.     By that time, however, the trade orientation strategy

of most countries of the region had already experienced a drastic change.

       11.2.2 Central American and Caribbean Exoeriences With Common Market
              Arrangements

i)   The Central American Common Market

       The first movements towards commercial integration in Central America

consisted of a series of bilateral trade agreements established among the

five countries   of the region in the 1950s.   The integration process was

accelerated at the end of that decade when, with the assistance of ECLA,

some of these countries attempted to extend their import substitution

strategy by implementing a regional industrialization scheme based on

"integration-industries"    previously allocated among the members.   However,

those countries with a more advanced industrial     sector (Guatemala and El

Salvador)   demonstrated   their strong opposition to this approach by signing,

together with Honduras, a free trade agreement ("Treaty of Economic Associa-

tion") in February of 1960.     This agreement was ratified by Nicaragua in

December of the same year with the signature of the "General Treaty of

Economic Integration", which created the Central American Common Marker

(CACM/MCCA).8    The terms of the treaty implied the immediate adoption of

free intraregional trade in most manufacturing     commodities and the

establishment of a five-year schedule for the elimination of tariffs on the

remaining items (mainly agricultural products) as well as for the

harmonization of a coinon external tariff structure.      The treaty also

considered the creation of a regional payments regime administered by a

Central American Clearing House, which was established in July 1961.

       There was remarkable progress during the first years of the treaty.       By

1966 more than 94% of the items of the CACM tariff classification (NAUCA)

were subject to free trade within the region and to a common external tar-

iff.    As a consequence, intraregional trade experienced a spectacular
                                          11



growth; Table 2 ahowa how the proportion of CACM's exporta traded in the

regional market increased from 7.8% to 24.2% between 1961 and 1968.

However,    this transition towards a fully liberalized regional trade waa

marked by the continuous complaints of the poorer membera of the agreement

(Honduras and Nicaragua) regarding      the asymmetry    in the distribution of the

benefits of the common market.       This discontent, reflected in these

countries' balance of payments deficits and coupled with adverse external

terms of trade in the late 1960s, led to the imposition of a 30% "temporary"

surcharge on the common external tariff in         1967, and prompted Nicaragua    to

implement discriminatorymeasures against the other CACM members in 1968.               A

related event was the July 1969 "Soccer War" between Honduras and El

Salvador that resulted in the withdrawal of Honduras from the CACM in

December of 1970.

     In spite of the disruptive effects of these circumstances, particularly

of Honduras' withdrawal,      an improving external environment allowed the

remaining    four countries   to continue with the intraregional      free trade

agreement during the l970s.       Moreover,    the continuous   attempts of Honduras

to re-enter the common market had the effect of not altering drastically           the

pattern of trade within the region.        In fact, Table 2 shows that by 1974

intraregional exports accounted for more than 25% of total exports of the

region.     The evolution   of this ratio not only contrasts with the poor

performsnce    of LAFTA in the same period, but is also higher than similar

indicators for all the other commercial integration groupings           among

developing countries.

     The most common explanation given to the good performance of this

integration attempt stresses the economic homogeneity of their members and

the lack of political       strength of their domestic import competing sectors.
                                          12




It is precisely because of these reasons that Cline (1983) sustains that the

liberalizationstrategy followed by CACM cannot be generalized to broader

commercial   integration schemes in Latin America.       Even if Cline's statement

is correct, and despite the negative effects that the severe internal prob-

lems and the adverse external shocks surrounding the debt crisis have had on

intraregional    trade flows, the CACM stands out as the most successful      of all

the attempts at liberalizing       intraregional trade that have been made in

Latin America.

ii)   The Caribbean Exoeriences with Common Markets:        CARIVA and   CARICOM

      The attempts at commercial integration among the very small and

extremely open Caribbean economies date back to the mid-l960s.         In 1965,

articles of a Caribbean Free Trade Association        (CARIFrA) were subscribed by

Antigua,    Barbados and Guyana.     This agreement was ratified three years later

(in May 1968), by eight other Caribbean countries         (Jamaica, Trinidad and

Tobago, Grenada,    Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Montserrat and St. Kitts-

Nevis-Anguilla);    the remaining Caribbean nation, Belize, only joined the
                       10
association in 1971.

      The CARIFTA agreement   immediately freed most of the trade among member

countries    from import and export dutiea and from nontariff barriers.       A five

year schedule for the elimination of intraregional         tariffs was designed for

the few import-aubstituting    products exempted from the regulation.       However,

the agreement did not consider any measure related to the impositionof a

common external tariff.     Intraregional      trade increased significantly after

the establishment    of CARIFTA; between 1967 and 1973 the share of intrareg-

ional trade rose from approximately       7.8 percent to 11 percent.

      The gains from this integration process, however, were strongly biased

in favor of the more developed countries of the agreement which accounted
                                           13




for more than 90 percent of intraregional trade.                        Given this asymmetry in

the distribution of benefits,     the less developed countries                    of CARIFTA

exerted pressure for a broadening of the scope of integration.                         In particu-

                                                                                  of mechanisms
lar, these countries were concerned with the establishment

that could imply a more favorable treatment for them within the agreement.

As a result of this situation the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) was

established in August of 1973.      Its objectives went further than commercial

               since they also involved the harmonization                      of monetary and
integration,

fiscal policies and the creation of planning agencies for agricultural and

industrtnl development.      Also, a common external tariff for imports from

nonmember countries was established.            Despite the almost immediate adoption

of the common external tariff, the adverse external terms of trade caused by

the oil shock prompted protectionist        responses
                                                                -   -   in   the form of restrictive


import licensing   -   - from Guyana and   Jamaica.            This action not only affected

negatively the level of intraregional trade
                                                       -   -   which         share in total trade


dropped to 8% in 1975 and 7% in 1976        --   but   also provoked antagonism and

retaliatory responses from the other members of CARICDM.11 Although some

conciliatory measures were subsequently attempted, the share of intrareg-

ional trade has remained in the neighborhood of 7% in the following years

and the trade flows have still been heavily concentrated among the four more

developed countries of the region.         These facts seem to indicate that the

wide differences in the economic size of the members, and the lack of

diversification    of their productive structures, constitute insurmountable

obstacles for a successful commercial integration within this region.

     11.2.3 The Andean Group

     As pointed out in Section 11.2.1, one of the consequences of the

inoperacy of LAFTA was the formation of the Andean Group (AG) by five of its
                                       14



middle-size members.     In 1969 Bolivia, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador and Peru

signed the Cartagena Agreement with the explicit goal of avoiding the incon-

sistencies    that determined the poor performance of   LAFI'A.12    These

optizuistic expectations were based on the relative economic homogeneity of

the AG members and on the by-then widely accepted conception that a compre-

hensive industrial planning strategy was the prerequisite of a successful

deepening    of the integration process.

      Within these expanded framework, the AG established as its objeccives:

(1)   a progressive liberalization of intraregional trade;          (2)     the gradual

achievement    of a common external tariff;    (3)   the emphasis on regional

investment programs designed to balance the costs and benefits of the inte-

gration process among the member countries, and        (4)   the establishment     of a

code for the common treatment of foreign direct investment.          The specific

mechanisms designed to achieve these objectives allowed for a special treat-

ment of the less developed countries of the region - -       Bolivia and     Ecuador.

      In this sense, with respect to the first two objectives, the AG

countries agreed that Colombia, Chile, Peru and Venezuela should carry out

an automatic yearly reduction of their average tariff level of the order of

7% of the initial tariff structure, in order to achieve a complete liberal-

ization of their trade flows by 1980.13       By that time the common external

tariff of the region was supposed to be already in practice.              In the cases

of Bolivia and Ecuador, however, this liberalizationwas expected to start

only in 1980, and to be completed by 1990.      Although the automaticity of

this liberalization schedule contrasts with the inefficient product-by-prod-

uct strategy adopted by LAflA, the AG scheme exempted several items from the

proposed tariff reduction.     It was argued that the allocation of industries

in those sectors should be a result of the regional investment program.
                                             15




     With respect to the last objective            -   - the   establishment   of common rules

governing foreign investment        --   the AG   contemplated two mechanisms that were

supposed to alter significantly the industrial configuration of the region:

the reallocation of some multisectoral            industries that already existed among

the member countries     -   - as a way to   distribute more equally the potential

benefits provided by the expanded market - - and the programming of new

investments    in eight "strategic" industrial sectorsJ4                Finally, the Andean

countries    agreed to maintain permanent negotiations on the issue of foreign

direct investment until a code for its common treatment could be unanimously

approved.

      Although the results obtained by the Andean Group are better than those
achieved by LAFTA, they are much less spectacular than what its members

originally expected.         The proportion of AG's exports traded in the regional

niarket   increased   from a low value of 1.7 percent in 1970 to 4.5 percent in

1979, and    since then has remained stable in the neighborhood of 4 percent.

The main factors determining this meager achievement seem to have been the

excessive number of exemptions granted on the tariff liberalization

schedule,    the serious difficulties        faced by the members in the design of the

common external tariff and the inconsistency between the regional industrial

planning strategy and the particular trade regime prevailing on each of the
member countries.

      The importance of the generalized granting of exemptions                  is reflected

by the fact that, as of 1980, more than 25 percent of the items included in

the NABANDINA tariff nomenclature had not been subject to the tariff

liberalizationprocess.          On the other hand, the differences in the level and

dispersion of the protective structure of the AG members generated divergent

positions    regarding   the appropriate timing, and the optimal level of the
                                         16




common external tariff.      The problem was exacerbated by the overvaluation     of

most of the members' real exchange rates and the existence of different

exchange rate practices within the region thet made it more difficult to

measure the effective rate of protection received by any activity in some

particular countryJ5       Overall, the fact that the members' positions in this

particular respect seemed irreconcilable, and thet the common external

tariff was never accomplished, influenced negatively the commercial

integration process within the Andean Group.

     The failure of the regional industrial planning strategy also

contributed to the slowdown of the integration process.        As of 1985 only

three of the eight investment programs in "strategic" sectors had been

approved (on the petrochemical,     metalmechanic   and automobile sectors) and

not a single regional reallocation of the previously established multisec-

toral industries     had been carried out.    This put in evidence, once again,

the incompatibility     of the national industrialization objectives with the

attempts to extend the import substitution strategy to a regional level; it

seems extremely     difficult for domestic producers   to internalize the

potential benefits stemming from a regional liberalization,       even if the

latter is carried out properly.

     Finally,     the attempt to coordinate   the region's position towards direct

foreign investment ended up constituting another disruptive factor.         The

approval of the Andean Code for Foreign Investment - -      better known as
Decision 24   -   - which severely limited the   share of foreign capital in

industries operating within the region, provoked the withdrawal of Chile

from the Andean Group in 1976 and caused a slight decrease in the inflow of

this type of private capital to the remaining members.
                                              17




    As a whole, then, the mechanisms designed by the AG for deepening the

integration process among its members           (the industrial programming   scheme and

the common external tariff), have not been successful.            However, there seems

to exist a consensus   in the sense that with a less interventionist            approach

and a more comprehensive   liberalization,         there are still significant gains

to be obtained from a commercial integration arrangement within this region.

     11.2.4 The Latin American Inteeration Association

    The recognition of the benefits of export promotion policies and the

adoption of a more outward oriented strategy by most Latin American count-

ries in the late 1970s, coupled with the poor performance           of the

comprehensive   integration processes attempted until then, determined the

replacement of LAFTA by the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA/

ALADI) in 1980.   This new arrangement substituted          the ambitious    goal of

establishing a free trade area within Latin America for the more pragmatic

objective   of facilitating the negotiation of bilateral commercial agreements

that might be later generalized to other countries of the region.

     In this sense, the basic mechanisms designed by LAIA are bilateral

tariff negotiations - -   that   should allow for the possibility of being later

on extended to other members      -   - and   the granting of regional tariff

preferences by each of the member countries.            These tariff preferences,

however, are not subject to any pre-determined           schedule and do not intend to

be a part of a common external tariff for the region.

     The increased efficiency of the negotiation strategy adopted by LAIA,

together with the realism of its objectives, reflect a clear change in the

expected role of commercial integration arrangements in Latin America.                 From

being conceived as the extension of domestic import substitution strategies

to a regional level, they are now perceived as a component           of an overall
                                           18




outward-orientedstrategy that can contribute to enhance export growth for

the region as a whole, without discriminating       excessively against other

trade partners.


III.   Latin America's International Trade:        Aggreaste Trends

       In this section we analyze the evolution of Latin America's direction

of foreign trade at an aggregate level.         Table 3 contains data on the dollar

value of imports and exports for fourteen Latin American countries for sel-

ected years between 1970 and 1985.        This table shows that for most countries

the (nominal) dollar value of imports peaked between 1980 and 1982, only to

experience    a dramatic fall in the years following the eruption of the debt

crisis.     Aa can be seen, in every single country the (nominal) dollar value

of imports in 1985 was well below its 1980 level.         For these 14 countries as

a whole the (nominal) dollar value of imports was, in 1985, 36 percent below

its 1980 value.      Moreover,   when expressed in real dollar terms, 1985 total

imports are 45 percent below their 1980         value6   Of course, this mainly

reflects the reduction in imports required by the adjustment programs imple-

mented by these countries after the 1982 debt crisis that was discussed in

Section 11.1.      The evolution of the value of exports in Table 3 also

reflects the effects of the adjustment programs.         In a number of these

countries    --
                  Argentina,   Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico --   the   value of exports

was in 1985 significantly above its 1980 value.          This was achieved in spite

of the fact that for most of the countries in the region the international

prices of their exports declined quite substantially during the period (see

Edwards l988a).

       Table 4 contains data on an indicator of these economies degree of

openness:     the ratio of total trade (imports           exports)    to GOP.   Although
                                             19




the index differs from country-to-country,          it is still possible to draw as a

general pattern of behavior that there was a fairly significant increase in

the degree of openness in the l970s.           This general move towards greater

openness is revealed both when 1975 is compared with 1970 as when 1980 is

compared with 1970.         Generally   speaking, the available    evidence strongly

indicates that the 1970s was a decade where most of the nations of Latin

America became more open to the rest of the world.           In fact, Edwards (1988d)

shows that this claim is supported by the evolution of the level of import

tariffs and other impediments to trade during this period.              Table 4 also

shows that during the first half of the 1980s the trend towards greater

openness was drastically reversed, with the openness          index exhibiting a

sharp drop for most countries.           This, of course, was partially the consequ-

ence of che debt crisis and of the significant cut in imports that the

adjustment policies required.           As can be seen in Table 4, in the case of the

tocal crade to GDP ratio, in 9 of the 14 countries there was a decline

between 1980 and 1985.17

111.1     The Origin of Aggregate Imnorts

        In this subsection we focus on the recent evolution of intraregional

trade by analyzing the behavior of different countries             shares of the value

of Latin America's        imports at an aggregate level.    In order co have a

general picture and a better understanding          of the way in which regional

trade has performed, we also look in some detail at the way other countries'

shares of regional imports have evolved.           In particular we inquire on how

the share of the OECD --        which   comprises the region's most important trade

partners    --   has   evolved through time.

        Tables 5 contains data on the percentage distribution of the value of

imports for 14 Latin American countries for 1977-86.              These data give us
                                                  20



information on what fraction of the U.S. dollar value of each of these

countries'    imports came from industrialized              countries, what share corres-

ponded to intraregional        trade     -   - imports from within Latin America and        the

Caribbean    -   - and what proportion         came from the rest of the world.

     Several facts arise from this table.                  First, notice that the

distribution of the origin of imports varies significantly across countries.

While in some of them the industrialized countries' share in total imports

is in the 70 to 80 percent range, in others it is approximately 50 to 60

percent, while still in others it is in the order of 30 percent (i.e.

Uruguay).        Another interesting fact, that due to the aggregation does not

emerge from the table, is that for the great majority of the Latin American

countries    there have been no perceptible changes in the proportion of

imports coming from the U.S.18                Third, in some of the large and medium size

countries    either in 1982 or 1983 there is a slight drop in the share of

imports coming from the industrialized                 countries   (Argentina, 1982; Brazil,

1982; Chile 1982 and 1983; Mexico, 1983).                  Finally,   in 8 of these countriea

there was a slight increase in the industrialized                  countries   market share in

1985 and 1986 (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay, Venezuela, Colombia,

Costa Rica and Ecuador).

     With respect to intraregional trade, it is interesting to note that in

the years corresponding to the debt crisis, and until 1983 or 1984, in al-

most every country there was a significant increase in the share of imports

coming from the region.         The reason for this has mainly to do with the way

in which the import compression that followed the crisis was distributed

across countries.        Most Latin American nations reduced imports from every

source; however,       during the initial years of the crisis the drop in total

imports greatly exceeded the decline in imports from the region.                     This
                                          21



increase in the share of intraregional         imports was reversed in most

countries   in the last few years.      This reflects, to a large extent, the

converse of the phenomenon of 1982-83.         As these nations have been able to

increase their total imports, these have mainly come from outside the

region.     Overall, Table S shows that the share of aggregate       imports coming

from the region stood in 1986 significantly above its level in the late

1970s in most of the middle-income       and low-income Latin American countries.

For the majority of upper-middle       income countries    of the region, however,

the share of intraregional    imports has remained rather stagnant, or has even

decreased -- as in Mexico    --   in   the last decade.


111.2     The Destination of Aazreaate     Exvorts

        Table 6 contains data on the regional destination of aggregate exports

for a group of 16 Latin American countries for 1970-83.            Given that this

table permits us to assess which markets sustained the aggregate expansion

of exports from the region in the adjustment period, an additional refine-

ment has been made by explicitly identifying the export shares of LAIA/

ALADI, the U.S. and Japan.

        A number of interesting facts are revealed by this table.         First, the

last two years show a reversal of the declining           trend that characterized   the

evolution of the share of exports going to the OECD.            Furthermore, regional

exports to the U.S. have increased        substantially after the debt crisis.

This fact seems to indicate that the U.S. market has absorbed most of the

regional attempt to close its current account gap.            Second, after reaching a

peak in 1980, intraregional exports have experienced a significant decline.

This implies that the regional market has not been able to couple with the

region's efforts to increase its foreign exchange earnings.            The latter

becomes evident if we note that in 1983 and 1984 the proportion of intra-
                                                22




Latin American exports reached their lowest value since 1970.                  Finally,

another important trend captured. in Table 6 is the steady increase in Latin

American exports going to the rest (i.e., non-Japan)               of Asia.    In general,

then, the aggregate          trends seem to indicate that the regional market posses-

ses a rather limited absorption capacity for new Latin American exports, at

least during periods in which the region as a whole is trying to solve acute

external disequilibria.


IV.   Latin American International Trade:                Disanreeated Data

      In the preceding section we investigated the evolution of Latin Amer-

ica's aggregate          imports and exports.    In this section we ask what is behind

these aggregate          data.   In particular we inquire on which specific products

does Latin America import from whom and exports to whom.                As in the previous
section our main interest is with the evolution of intraregional                  trade.

      The Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA/CEPAL)                 constructs

fairly detailed and very reliable data on the region's directions of trade.

Unfortunately in their effort to clean up the new data obtained from UNCTAD,

they take a long time checking and rechecking the figures.                  This means that

any atudy that wants to rely on these quality data has to use time series

that end some years back.            This paper is no exception;      the disaggregated

data discussed here only cover the period up to 1984.                At this point we can

only rely on some preliminary indicators             -   - including some   preliminary ECLA

figures   -   -   to   predict how these directions of trade have evolved in the last

3 years or so.

      ECLA collects disaggregated data at the one digit SITC level; thus in

the analysis that follows it will be possible to
                                                 distinguish between the

following goods' categories:
                                                 23



- Category       0:   Foodstuffs and Live Animals

-
     Category    1:   Beverages    and Tobacco

-
     Category    2:   Raw Non-Food Materials,         except Fuel

-
     Category    3:     Fuel and related products

-
     Category    4:     Oil, greases and waxes of vegetable and animal origins

-    Category    5:     Chemical products

-
     Category    6:     Manufactured products

-
     Category    7:     Machinery and transport equipment
-
     Category    8:     Other manufactured goods

-    Category    9:     Other commodities.

IV.l        Couroosition and Oriain of Latin American Imoorts:             Disasarezated Trends

        Table 7 shows the composition of imports in our 16 Latin American

countries       taken as a whole.       It reveals that the bulk of the region's

imports has always been concentrated on the manufacturing                    sector (categories

5, 6, 7 and 8), with capital goods (category 7) being the most important

    item.    However,    it also shows a clear decline in the import shares of

categories 6 and          7   that has been explained by a substantial increase in the

relative importance of fuel imports (category 3).

            In order to isolate the effects of the oil shocks, which affected

asymmetrically the countries of the region, Tables                  8   and 9 provide disaggre-

gated information on the distribution of different categories of non-fuel

    imports among the intraregional        market, the U.S. and Japan for 12 upper-

middle-income         and middle-income Latin American countries.             The


disaggregationused here distinguishes between primary and manufactured

products,       obtained in the following way:           (i)   Primary products:     Categories

0, 1, 2 and 4
              --          as   defined above,    (ii)    Manufactured products:      Categories

5, 6, 7 and 8.           The tables also include information on the dollar value of
                                                 24



imports of each category to get an idea of their relative magnitudes.

       From these tables it is possible to detect some common patterns across

countries.      First, with the exception of Uruguay and Paraguay,                    the U.S.

remains as the most important supplier of manufactured imports to the reg-

ion.     The range of the U.S. share of this type of imports in Latin America

goes from a low 17 percent       -   -   in   the case of Paraguay   -   -    to   as high as 67

percent --   in   the case of Mexico.          A second interesting pattern is related

to the increase in the share of intraregional imports.                       In moat Latin

American countries, Mexico being the major exception,                this increase in the

participation     of imports from within the region has constituted the

counterpart of the slight loss of competitiveness             experiencedby the U.S.
and some other OECD countries in the last decade.              As mentioned in the

previous section, this phenomenon was particularly clear in the asymmetric

compression of intraregional             imports during the enormous adjustment provoked

by the debt crisis.      However,        it is also clear form the table that, perhaps

with the exception of Argentina, the absolute magnitude of the share of

manufactured imports from within the region is relatively large only for the

smaller countries of Latin America.

       With respect to agricultural products, it is important to note the

increase in the share of imports coming from the U.S.                    Except for the cases

of Argentina,     Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay, the U.S. has displaced                    other

Latin American and Caribbean countries as the main provider of these type of

goods.    Moreover,   by 1984 some of these countries imported almost half of

their primary products from the U.S.

       A further disaggregationof these trends is provided in Tables 10 and

11.    They show how each of the two more important Latin American integration

schemes (LAflA --     which   later on became IAIA -- and the CACM) distribute
                                         25




their imports of the different     "categories" of goods añiong the different

suppliers.     Each cell in each of these tables indicate what proportion of

that particular category of good is imported by that integration scheme from

that specific supplier.     Also, the last column of these tables reflect the

distribution    of total imports from the region among the different suppliers.

     In this way, Table 10 shows that imports from the members of i.AFTA-LAIA

have been concentrated on categories 7 (machinery), 5 (chemicals), 3 (fuel)

2 (raw materials)    and 0 (foodstuffs).      With the exception of fuel, which is

mainly imported from OPEC countries, the OECD countries have been, by large

margin, the most important suppliers of these goods to the region.         The

table also reveals that the increase in the share of intraregional        imports

of manufactures (category 6) and chemicals (category 5) represent the major

achievement of this integration scheme in the recent years.        What is even

more important is that this increase in intraregional impdrts coincided with

the adoption of the more pragmatic     approach of the LAIA agreement     -   aa
                            --
opposed to that of LAFTA         and, more recently, with the drastic adjustment

prompted by the debt crisis.      Finally, this table also shows that the shares

of the other integration schemes (CACM and CARICOM) on the imports of LAIA

members have been almost insignificant,        although this fact maybe explained

by the enormous differences in the size of the countries involved in each

group.

     As shown by Table 11, the distributionof imports by origin in the

countries    of the CACM is somewhat different from that of the    L.AIA membera.


Although the OECD countries also constitute the major providers of all types
of goods, except fuel, to the CACM, the countries from within this region

have consistently remained as the second most important suppliers of

imports.     The significant difference in the magnitudes of the share of
                                         26




                 imports of the CACM and LAIA arrangements   is a reflection of
intraregional

the relative success of the integration process in Central America already

discussed in subsection 11.2.2.       The substantial decline in the CACM share

                                                                           be
of intraregional    imports in the recent years, on the other hand, has to

                                                               the political
interpreted with caution since it can be just a consequence of

turmoil that has characterized      the region since the late 1970s.


P7.2 Structure and Destination of Latin American Exports:
     Disasarezated Trends

       Given the major role that a significant increase in Latin American

                                        a long lasting solution to the
exports will play in the achievement of

region's pressing economic problems,       it is important to assess what and to

whom will Latin America export in the following years.       The analysis of the

aggregate    trends of regional exports made in subsection 111.2 have already

shown that the intraregional market embodied a somewhat limited capacity to

absorb the substantial increase in exportable output from the region in the

mid-1980s.      The disaggregated   data on the composition of regional exports

presented in this subsection will permit us to identify the type of exports

that determined this outcome.

       The data in Table 12 describe the evolution of the composition of totsl

and Non-Fuel exports of our sample of 16 Latin American countries.         Several

facts emerge from this table.        First, the share of exports of foodstuffs    and


agricultural products (category 0) has declined steadily throughout the per-

iod.    Second, exports of fuel have increased in importance both as a result

of the increases in the price of oil and of the larger gas and oil

production in the region.      Third, manufactured exports corresponding    to

categories    5 (chemicals) and 7 (machinery) have experienced an important

increase in recenc years.      This trend is more clearly captured in the second
                                        27




panel of the table that excludes fuel exports:     whereas in 1970 categories 5

and 7 represented no more than 6 percent of non-fuel exports,       in 1984 they

accounted   for 19.2 percent.   Finally, these data also show that exports of

manufactures    (category 6) have mostly maintained their relative importance

throughout the period, accounting for less than 20 percent of non-fuel

exports.

     In order to determine which trade partners have supported the export

expansion of Latin American countries, Tables 13 to 15 provide disaggregated
information on the destination of non-fuel exports for the Latin American

nations grouped according to their per capita income.19      These tables show

that those upper-middle income Latin American countries that achieved a

substantial    increase in manufactured exports in the last years    (Argentina,

Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and even Chile), have experienced a decline in the

proportion of their exports directed to the regional market.        In most cases

this lower share of intraregional exports has implied an increase in the

share of exports to the U.S., confirming the aggregate     trend captured by

Table 6.    The intraregional   share of manufactured exports in all the other

countries has not exhibited that much of a trend, having been this share

particularly large for the Central American countries,      With respect to

primary exports, these tables reflect that the U.S. constitutes the most

important market in the majority of cases.     Although the U.S. share has

declined in recent years, the shsre of incraregional exports of this type of

products,   which has rarely been larger than 20 percent, has not shown an

increasing trend.

     The more disaggregated data contained in Table 16 reveal even more

clearly how the substantial increase in manufactured exports of the LAIA

members has been mostly absorbed by OECD countries.      Between 1980 and 1984
                                         28




the regional exports of this type of goods increased by 37 percent (U.S.

$6.7 billion),   while the share of intraregional exports in all these

categories   declined drastically.    Actually,   the exports of these goods to

the region only increased by 0.4 billion during that period.

     On the other hand, the data in Table 17 shows that the large share of

intraregional    exports of manufactures in the CACM has not experienced a

significant reduction    in recent years.     However, this group of countries

have confronted shocks of a very different nature than the ones faced by

LAIA members, as indicated by the fact that the nominal value of these

countries'   exports has decreased since 1980.

      In general, then, the evidence presented in this subsection seems to

indicate that a sustained increase in Latin American exports        -   -   particularly
of non-traditional    products - in
                               -      the present circumstances    w4ll depend more

on these nations' ability to diversify their exportable output and to penet-

rate industrialized countries' markets than on the deepening of

intraregional    trade agreements.   However, the achievement of this goal will

require not only a more transparent trade regime in the Latin American

countries, but also a significant decline in the protectionist              sentiments

prevailing in the developed nations.        To both of these issues we turn in the

following section.


V.   protectionism and the Future     Evolution   of Latin Anerica's International


     As noted in Section II, after approximately three decades of inward

oriented policies, in the mid-l970s a number of Latin American countries

started to move towards more outward oriented trade regimes,        abandoning       the

idea of extending the import substitution process to a regional level.

Although this trend towards greater openness occurred at different speeds,
                                                 29




it involved a large number of countries.               Edwards (l988a), for example,

reports data on average tariffs that clearly show that several countries                  in

the region went through nontrivial              trade liberalizations   up to the early

1980s.    However,       the debt crisis and the need to reduce imports very fast

resulted in a dramatic reversal of that tendency.               As already mentioned in

the preceding sections,           in the mid-1980s in almost every country the degree

of protectionism exceeds that of the beginning of the decade.

     Although there is some debate on how desirable it is for the developing

nations to move towards                trade,    there is wide agreement that the Latin

American nations should implement more transparent and non-discriminatory

outward oriented regimes.           Only in this way will efficiency increase and the

volume of international           trade, and especially exports, will grow fast

enough.     In fact, Mexico is already energetically moving in that direction.

     Tariffs, of course, constitute only one form of protection, and

countries    in fact use a large number of other mechanisms, generally known as

nontariff barriers, to introduce de facto wedges between domestic and world

prices.     Nontariff barriers can take many different forms ranging from

prior-deposits to outright quotas.              The history of nontariff barriera in

Latin America is long and generalized.                Thus, in order for the region's

volume of trade      -   - both   intraregional and with the reat of the world      -   - to

experience a significant increase both tariffs and the wide variety of NTBs

should be drastically reduced.           Multiple exchange rates are another
mechanism used quite extensively by the Latin American nations to obstruct

trade flows.     Interestingly       enough, intraregional     trade agreements,   and even

the studies on NTB5, have not focused on this protective tool.                At this

point a number of countries in the region in fact do have multiple rates.
                                           30




       The lack of reliable data on NTBs        has   generally frustrated analysts

that have tried to assess with some degree of rigor the extent of protection

in the developingworld.       For this reason in a recent massive cross country

study undertakenat the World Bank, an effort to construct subjective "in-

dexes of liberalization"     was made.    These indexes are supposed to capture

the extent of trade impediments,        including tariffs and other NTBs.        They are

subjective,    in the sense that they don't combine actual objective measurea.

Although there are some shortcomings related to this subjectivity,               including

the nonverifiabilityand noncomparability              across countries, their construc-

tion has been extremely useful, helping understand the evolution of "true

protectionism" in some of these countries.              For the five Latin American

nations   included among the 18 countries covered by the study, the indexes

reflect both the protectionist history of these countries, as well as the

efforts toward non-discriminatoryliberalization implemented in the late

1970s and early 1980s (see Michaely, Papageorgiou and Choksi, 1986).

       Unfortunately   the data available on NTBs in the developing countries,

and in particular in Latin America, are exceedingly sketchy.                However,   a

recent study by ALADI (1984) provides some indication of the coverage of two

forms of NTBs:       outright prohibitions and prior import licenses.           Table 18

summarizes these data.      As can be seen from this table NTBs in Latin America

constitute a serious obstacle and are as prevalent, if not more, than in the

developed countries.

V.].   Macroeconomic   Disequilibrium    and Protectionist      Pressures

       An issue that has not been sufficiently emphasized, especially by the

supporters of an active integration process, is that Latin America's protec-

tionist history has been intimately related to the region's macroeconomic

instability.     A   common scenario observed again and again can be described as
                                              31



follows:     at some point in time the authorities of a-particular country

decide to pursue a fiscal policy that is inconsistent with the chosen nomi-

nal exchange rate regime       --   usually   a pegged rate.          Given the underdeveloped

nature of the domestic capital market, the fiscal expansion is basically

financed with domestic credit creation.                    As a result, there will be a loss

of international    reserves, domestic inflation will exceed world inflation,

and the real exchange rate will become increasingly overvalued.                     In an

effort to stop the drainage of reserves the authorities will usually respond

by imposing exchange controls and by increasing the degree of restrictive-

ness of the existing trade impediments             -   -   tariffs will be   hiked and QR5 will

be imposed.     Naturally, as long as the ultimate causes of the macroeconomic

disequilibrium --    that   is, the inconsistent credit and fiscal policies --

are   not tackled, all the authorities will gain by imposing new trade

restrictions is delay the need for corrective macroeconomic measures.                        The

real exchange rate will become more overvalued, international reserves will

continue to decline, and a black market for foreign exchange will emerge.

At some point this disequilibriumsituation will become unsustainable,                        and a

stabilization program --       usually   under the aegis of the IMF --           will   be

enacted.     This program will usually consist of a significant nominal

devaluation geared at correcting the over-valuation developed in the previous

period,    and of a contractionary macroeconomic policy.

      Table 19 contains data on the evolution of import tariffs, exchange

controls and capital controls in the period preceding                   17 balance of payments

crises in Latin America.       The table reveals that in the great majority of

the cases the crisis    -   - which   always took the form of a major devaluation               -   -
was preceded by an important piling up of exchange controls and restric-

tions.     In some episodes, such as Colombia in 1962 and 1967, Ecuador 1961,
                                               32



and Peru in 1975, the initial conditions (two years prior to the crisis)

were already extremely restrictive, and became even tighter as the erosion

of reserves became severe and/or real exchange rate appreciation became more

massive.        In other cases, however   --   Venezuela 1964 and Chile 1982, for

example    --    the period preceding the      devaluation was characterized    by a

fairly free environment, with little restrictions and no attempts by the

authorities       to impose any additional      controls.

      It is clear, then, that to the extent that the region does not

implement serious and far-reaching structural               reforms aimed at avoiding

macroeconomic       instability, we can expect the recurrence          of periodic balance

of payment crisis, with their concomitant negative effects on the trade

regime and on the volume of trade         -   - both   intraregional   and with the rest of

the world.


V.2   Protectionism      in the IndustrializedWorld

      As noted in subsection IV.2, the way in which Latin America's trade

performs will not depend exclusively on the region's protectionist policies.

Equally important, if not more, is what happena with trade impediments in
the industrial nations.

      While most Latin American nations have been going through almost heroic

efforts aimed at improving their external balance, the industrial countries

have been invaded with protectionist            sentiments.     In fact, in the past few

years the industrial countries have used a series of nontariff mechanisms                to


impede a freer flow of Latin American goods.                According to the CATT (1984),

industrial       countries currently use more than forty nontariff measures to

impede international flows of commodities.

      A few authors have dealt with the issue of nontariff barriers,

analyzing       the extent of these practices,         their coverage across countries and
                                        33



            and their evolution through time.    For example, in a comprehensive
products,

recent study Nogues et al. (1986b) analyzed the use of nontariff barriers in

16 industrializedcountries.       For the purpose of their analysis they defined

the following practicea     as nontariff barriers:   prohibitions,   quotas, dis-


cretionary import authorization,     conditional import authorizations,

"voluntary" export restraints, variable levies, minimum price systems,

"voluntary" price restraints, tariff-quotas,     seasonal tariffs, price and

volume investigations, and antidumping and countervailingduties.          Their

analysis suggests that the coverage of this type of impediments is quite

broad, affecting more than one-fourth     of all these countries     imports, with

textiles being the industry most severely affected.

     An important question is whether imports from all countries or regions

are affected in the same way by the NTBs.       Nogues et. al. found that this is

not the case; imports from the developing world are more severely affected

by this type of "semi-disguised" protectionism than those from the indust-

rialized world.    A   study by ECLA/CEPAL (1986e), confirmed this

discriminatorytrend.       It found that the NTB5 of industrializedcountries,

particularly those of the EEC, discriminate strongly against the exports

coming from Latin American LDCs.      Table 20 provides a summary of these

findings.     Once the effects of the NTBs are taken into account the degree of

protection the industrializedcountries grant to some product can be quite

remarkable.     Edwards   (l988a), for instance, provides estimates of the total

                                                     and Brazilian exports
average rate of protection to which some Argentinian

to the EEC, Japan and the U.S. were subject in 1980.       These figures are in

many ways staggering, indicating that in many cases the NTBs more than

double the tariff protection.
                                        34



      What is even more serious is that the existing evidence clearly

indicates    a slow but steady increase in the degree of coverage of the NIBs.

For example, Nogues et al. (1986a) found that the NTBs coverage for all

goods in the 16 industrial     countries increased by 1.5 percentage points

between 1981 and 1983.     To the extent that these NTRs increase, or even if

they are maintained at their current level, it will become very difficult if

not plainly impossible, for the Latin American countries to continue to

increase their exports at the rate required to solve the current debt

crisis.     While the main responsibility    for increasing exports rests with the

Latin American countries, their efforts, no matter how serious, can be

easily frustrated by the protectionist policies of the industrialized world.


VI.   The Prosnects for Intraregional Trade and the Debt Crisis

      Recently,   some authors have sustained that the adverse external

conditions    faced by Latin American countries in the aftermath of the debt

crisis are the appropriate ones for an intensification      of the integration

process in the region.     They argue that preferential reductions in tariffs

coupled with an effective "deadollarization" of intraregional payments - -

basically achieved through clearing house-type      arrangements - -   will   revital-

ize intraregional    flows of trade.   In fact, in a recent study that analyzed

the future prospects of the integration process in Latin America ECLA/CEPAL

(1986d) postulated that the adoption of these types of measures would be

translated in a sustained increase in the growth rate of intraregional           trade

flows.    Specifically,   the projections   that constituted the benchmark of that

study assumed that as a consequence of those measures the value of intra-

regional trade would grow at an annual rate of 16 percent in the following

years.    Table 21 reproduces these projections and shows how, under chose
                                         35




assumptions,   the share of intra-LAIA imports would increase from 15.9

percent in 1984 to 18.6% in 1990 and to 22.2% in 1994.

      The evidence presented in this paper indicates that both the

recommendations   and the projected scenario implied by such proposals are

fairly unrealistic.    Although there is agreement that the Latin American

countries   should implement significant reductions in their protective

structures and adopt more outward oriented policies, there      is no justifica-

tion for the presumption that the efficacy of these measures will be

enhanced by restricting them to the regional market.       Moreover,   the LAF1A

and   the Andean Group experiences have shown the significant costs involved

and the meager results achieved by regional liberalizations      arrangements

based on multilateral negotiations of the type that would be required, for

example,    to "de-dollarize" intraregional payments.   On the other hand, the

analysis in Sections III and IV have shown that the recent increase in Latin
American exports of manufactures have been absorbed mostly by OECD nations.

This in spite of the protectionist     trends of these countries.      Furthermore,

the increase experienced by the aggregate     share of intraregional     imports

during the same period was basically a consequence of the adjustment

process.    The adoption of a partial and discriminatory    liberalization    of

regional imports will surely not be translated in a significant increase in

that share in the current context.

       In this sense, then, there does not seem to exist any solid basis for

advocating the return to a more regulatory approach to commercial

integration in Latin America.      As noted before, the resumption of growth

within the region will mainly depend on the design of a satisfactory

solution to the debt problem, on the eradication of trade discriminatory

practices    in industrialized   nations and on the extent to which each Latin
                                         36




American country decides to implement profound structural reforms aimed at

avoiding macroeconomic      instability and at achieving a less unbiased and

intricate   trade regime.    Only if decisive steps in these directions sre

taken, the aggregate volume of imports and exports will grow, and it would

be reasonable to expect a significant and sustained increase in

intraregional    trade within the pragmatic   framework of the LAIA agreement.


VII. Concludine Remarks

     In this paper we have analyzed in detail the evolution of Latin

America's international trade patterns.       The results of the different

attempts to implement commercial integration arrangements among these count-

ries and the future prospects of intraregional trade have been discussed.

In particular, we have tried to assess the role of intraregional         trade in

the structural    adjustment process that the solution of the current crisis

requires from Latin American nations.

     In this sense, it was seen that most of the schemes designed to promote

commercial integration within the region were initially perceived and

advocated as an extension to the import substitution strategy adopted by

most Latin American countries in the l950s and l96Os.        However, we pointed

out that these arrangements overlooked the basic inconsistency         that exists

between the ambitious goal of establishing a common market of a regional

(LAFTA) or subregional      (Andean Group) dimension and the need of each govern-

ment to satisfy the demands of their highly protected and influential import

competing sectors.     It was as a consequence of this conflict that these

schemes turned out to be incapable of promoting a significant turnaround in

the volume and direction of intraregional      trade.   Moreover,   it was noted

that the relative success of the regional liberalization process carried out
                                                37




in the CACM was explained, precisely, by the initially weak position of

these nations' import competing sectors.

     It was also established that the dissatisfaction                  with the poor overall

performance        of these comprehensive      integration schemes, together with the

adoption of a more outward oriented strategy by most Latin American count-

ries in the late l970s, determined the replacement of LAFTA by the LAIA

Treaty and the practical abandonment of negotiations within the Andean

Group.    However, before the results of the more pragmatic                   approach of the

LAIA agreement        -   - mainly based on   bilateral       tariff negotiations -   - could be
reflected     in the data, the whole region was shocked by the abruptcurtail-

ment of foreign funds in 1982.              It was shown that the common denominators of

the region's adjustment process prompted by this drastic shock were an

abrupt contraction in the level of imports                -   - sometimes   resorting to

outright protectionist measures - and a desperate effort to increase exports
                               -



earnings -- which was achieved despite the low prices of these countries'

primary exports.
     The extensive analysis of aggregate and disaggregate data carried out

in this paper reflected both the meager results of the initial integration

attempts and the particular characteristics                   of the region's adjustment to

the debt crisis.            With respect to the first, it was not possible to detect
                                                    --
any significant change in the OECD countries' share                         especially   the U.S.

share    --   in   Latin American imports during the 1970s.             In particular, the
                                                                                         -   - mainly
region remained highly dependent on imports of manufactured goods

capital goods
              --           from   the industrialized   countries.      On the other hand, we

found that the major achievement of the integration arrangements in that

decade was limited to the increase in the intraregional trade share of some

manufactured products.              Nevertheless,    the overall increase in the volume of
                                        38




intraregional   trade flows was not found to be significant during that

period.

     In turn, the analysis of the more recent evolution of Latin America's

trade flows revealed some interesting patterns.        We could determine that the

increase in the share of intraregional imports in the years immediately

following the debt crisis was due to an asymmetric contraction in the demand

for imports originatedwithin the region.         The temporary nature of this

phenomenon was put in evidence by the increase in the proportion of imports

coming from industrialized   countries that accompanied the slight expansion

of the region's imports in 1985 and 1986.        Another interesting   finding was

the significant   increase in Latin America's     imports of primary products from

the OECD nations and particularly from the U.S.        Although this implied a

relative loss of competitiveness   in these countries' production of

manufactured goods in favor'of Latin America, the evidence showed that, for

the LAIA members,   the intraregional   share of manufactured imports is still

substantially   smaller than that of the industrialized nations.

     On the other hand, the data on exports revealed that the significant

expansion of Latin American exports after the debt crisis was propelled by a

large increase in the production of fuel and of exportable manufactures.

Moreover,   we could determine that the latter were basically absorbed by the

OECD markets, in particular by the U.S.        In fact, all those Latin American

countries   that achieved a substantial      increase in manufactured exports in

that period (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and Chile) experienced a

decline in the proportion of their exports directed to the regional market.

     Overall, this evidence seemed to indicate that the Latin American

markets possess a rather limited capacity to absorb a significant increase

in regional exports; at least in the current context of restrained imports
                                       39




and generalized external disequilibria.      It appears, then, that the success

of the required expansion in Latin American exports will depend more on

these countries' capacity to diversify their exportable output and to design

innovative mechanisms to penetrate the markets of industrialized             countries,

than on a renewal of efforts towards a substantial deepening of any regional

trade integration process.

     Even if the previous conclusion may seem uncontroversial          its

implementationis not free of serious obstacles.       As we have noted, the

current Latin American trade and exchange rate regimes are characterized             by

a high level of import restrictions    (tariffs, NTB's and multiple exchange

rates) and periodic balance of payments crises propelled by acute

macroeconomic disequilibria.     A sustained increase in Latin America's

exports will be highly unlikely without far-reaching         structural reforms

aimed at solving these problems.     Such an increase in the region's exports

would also be facilitated if a satisfactory solution to the debt problem is

finally reached and if a half is being put on the current protectionist

trend in industrializedcountries.

     If decisive actions in the above directions were taken, the existent

schemes for coordinating    intraregional   trade (LAIA, CACM and even the Andean

Group) would play a very useful, but only complementary, role.            In effect,

by improving the payments clearing mechanisms and granting bilateral

preferences to the poorer countries these arrangements may facilitate the

transition towards a more affluent and liberalized      --    in   a general sense --

regional   trade.   However, the temptation to overestimate        the potential

effects of these discriminatoryarrangements on the volume of intraregional
                                      40



trade must be resisted.    A global solution to the current crisis depends

crucially   on the region's ability to avoid previous mistakes.

     6These concessions were granted out of the NABALALC tariff nomenclature

which is based on the Brussels tariff nomenclature and contains approximate-

ly 9200 items.     The proportion of these tariff lines included in the

"national    list" of each country varied widely across LAFTA members.

     7See Wionczek (1978), dine (1983), Blejer (1984) and Fishlow (1984).

     8The fifth member of the      CACZ4, Costa Rica,   joined the Treaty only in

August of 1962.     A detailed analysis of the factors that prompted the

creation of CACM can be found in Delgado (1978).

     9According to the 1965 "San Jose Protocol", this action was supposed to

be taken only under extremely unfavorable external conditions for the whole

region.

     0Although all share the characteristics         of being primary producers

and extremely dependent on external markets, there are wide differences in

the economic size of these countries.          Two groups can be clearly distingu-

ished:     the relatively more developed countries      (Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica,
                                     42



Trinidad and Tobago) and the less developed ones (the seven Eastern

Caribbean islands and Belize).

     11These actions by Guyana and Jamaica were implicitly allowed by the

CARICOM Treaty, because it did not establish concrete requirements for the

elimination of domestic quantitative restrictions.   See Chernick (1978).

     12Venezuela joined the group in 1973, while Chile withdrew from it in

1976 for reasons that will be addressed below.

            deadline was later postponed to 1983.

     L4See JUNAC (1982) for a detailed analysis of each of these programs.

     15The need to develop an indicator of the "dual tariff-exchange    rate"

protection had its origins in this difficulty (see Morales 1983).

     16An important issue refers to which external price index should be

used to compute the evolution of the real value of imports and exports.         The


figure quoted above was calculatedusing the U.S. CPI.    If instead the

wholesale price index for the industrialized countries is a whole, as

computed by the IMF, is used, Latin American imports declined by 49% on real

terms between 1980 and 1985.

     17The decline of the trade ratio, however,   is less marked than that of

the imports ratio.   The reason for this is that as a result of the adjust-

ment program exports in most of these countries increased during the

period.

     181n Argentina, Chile, Venezuela, Peru, and El Salvador the U.S. share

exhibited a slight increase between 1977 and 1982; in Brazil, Paraguay and

Nicaragua there was somewhat of a decline during the same period.      In the

other countries   the U.S. share fluctuatedaround a fairly stable value

during 1977-81.

these tables follows a classificationcriterion similar to that of Tables S

and 9.
