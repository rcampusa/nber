Shrinking the Tax Gap: Approaches and Revenue Potential

                                           ABSTRACT

Between 2020 and 2029, the IRS will fail to collect nearly $7.5 trillion of taxes it is due. It is not
possible to calculate with precision how much of this "tax gap" could be collected. This paper
offers a naïve approach. The analysis suggests that with feasible changes in policy, the IRS could
aspire to shrink the tax gap by around 15 percent in the next decade--generating over $1 trillion
in additional revenue by performing more audits (especially of high-income earners), increasing
information reporting requirements, and investing in information technology. These investments
will increase efficiency and are likely to be very progressive.

                    Shrinking the Tax Gap: Approaches and Revenue Potential

                               Natasha Sarin and Lawrence H. Summers

        The IRS recently released its most recent estimates on the tax gap--the difference between
what was due to the IRS and what it collected. 1 Between 2011 and 2013, the IRS estimates that it
failed to collect over $380 billion in taxes per year, across all tax categories.

        Extrapolating this estimate to present to allow for inflation and income growth, in 2020
the IRS will fail to collect over $630 billion, or nearly 15 percent of total tax liabilities and that
the tax gap will total $7.5 trillion over the 2020 to 2029 period. 2,3 The sheer magnitude of the tax
gap suggests that there is substantial revenue-raising potential from shrinking it through well-
targeted enforcement measures.

        It is not possible to calculate with precision how much of this missing $7.5 trillion could
be collected. Our estimates suggest that it is reasonable to anticipate that with feasible changes in
policy, the IRS could aspire to shrink the tax gap by around 15 percent. 4 This would require
increased investment in compliance efforts, in the range of previous IRS budget outlays. On the
assumption of immediate implementation, our estimates suggest it would be possible to generate
around $1.1 trillion in additional revenue in a decade. 5

        This short article represents an attempt to quantify the benefits of substantial investment
in tax compliance. We proceed in three parts. We first provide background on the tax gap, noting
that the benefits of noncompliance accrue most to high-income earners; and that the resources

2019).
2
  To get this number, we first estimate the 2018 tax gap, assuming the net compliance rate of 85.8 percent from the
most recent IRS projections as follows: Taxes Owed = Gross Collections/Net Compliance Rate; and Tax Gap =
Taxes Owed ­ Gross Collections. We then age this total to 2020 using the CBO's projected nominal growth rates for
2018 (5.4 percent) and 2019 (4.3 percent). Our sources are CBO, "The Budget and Economic Outlook, 2019-2029"
(Jan. 2019); SOI Tax Stats: Gross Collections by Type of Tax: IRS Data Book Table 6; and IRS Publication 1415,
supra note 1.

  To extrapolate our estimates, we rely on the most recent CBO budget projections, which report that average
nominal GDP growth will be around 3.85 percent annually between 2020 and 2029. CBO, supra note 2, at Table
2.3, "CBO's Economic Projections for Calendar Years 2019-2029." We use this approach for all extrapolations to
the decade 2020-2029.

  Since we prepared this paper, Senator Warren released her Medicare for All proposal, which includes $2.3 trillion
in additional federal revenue from tax compliance efforts. We note that if we have made errors in the estimation
offered, we believe they are more likely to be on the side of optimism than pessimism.
the IRS has at its disposal to tackle noncompliance are at historic lows. This suggests that there is
substantial low-hanging fruit to be gathered from adequate investment in the IRS, and that
investments in reducing noncompliance are likely to be progressive. We then argue that more
resources for examinations (particularly of high-income earners); an increase in cross-party
reporting requirements; and an overhaul of outdated IRS technology will enable the IRS to
shrink the tax gap by around 15 percent in the next decade. These estimates seem substantially
optimistic relative to what the CBO estimates an increase in IRS appropriations would raise;
however, we show the two can be reconciled. Further, we point out that agency scorekeeping
guidelines disincentivize compliance investment by limiting the extent to which the gains from
additional tax collections can be included in official scores of enforcement initiatives. We
conclude by noting that our estimation is naïve and that more formal revenue estimates are
desirable. However, we find it probably that scorekeepers will come to the same basic
conclusion: restoring the IRS' budget to previous levels is likely to pay for itself many times
over.

    I.       Background on the tax gap
    a. Tax gap benefits primarily high-income earners

         In each filing category--for individual income, corporate income, employment, 6 and
estate tax filers, the majority of the benefits of noncompliance accrue to high-income earners.
Individual tax returns make up the largest share of the tax gap (over 70 percent) and have the
highest rate of noncompliance (nearly 20 percent). 7 The sources of the individual income tax gap
are primarily high-income individuals because more of their income accrues in opaque
categories, like dividend income, capital gains, and proprietorship income. In some of these
categories, taxes are only paid on 55 percent of income earned.

  Employment taxes include withheld Social Security and Medicare taxes, federal unemployment taxes, and self-
employment taxes (Social Security and Medicare taxes owed by individuals who work for themselves). See IRS
Publication 1415, supra note 1, at section 4.2.3, "Employment Tax Underreporting Tax Gap."
7
  Between 2011 and 2013, the net tax gap for individual income taxes averaged $271 billion. Total true tax liability
averaged $1,398 billion. So there was a 19.4 percent net non-compliance rate. Id.

2019). The employment tax gap includes both underpaid employment and self-employment taxes. To compute the
tax gap for 2020-2029, we first take the share of the gross tax gap for which the IRS reports each filing category was
responsible between 2011 and 2013. We apply these shares to our estimate of the overall net tax gap for 2020-2029.

         We illustrate this point below using data on individual income filers' underreporting
rates, which are available by category of income. Underreporting accounts for around 80 percent
of the total tax gap (the remaining 20 percent comes from non-filing or under-payment of taxes
due). 10 In Table 1, we attempt a rough estimation of misreporting rates by income level. We
compute average underreporting rates for individual filers based on the share of their income that
accrues to them in each of the available individual income categories. Underreporting is more
than five times as high for individuals who earn $10 million or more annual than it is for those
who make under $200,000 a year.

     Table 1: Average Net Misreporting for Individual Income Tax Filers by Income Level 11,12




10
   Unfortunately, data on noncompliance by income category is only reported for the "underreporting" tax gap, not
for non-filing or under-payment. As such, the information in Tables 1 and 2, infra, relies on data on the
underreporting tax gap. For ease of discussion, we assume that noncompliance rates overall across income
categories are comparable to misreporting rates for underreported income.
11
   To arrive at this average, we multiply the share of income that accrues in each income category from Table 1 by
the net misreporting percentage for income in that category reported by the IRS. For example, individuals who make
$10 million+  17% income from salary and wages x 1% misreporting + 13% dividends x 5% misreporting + 18%
partnership x 11% misreporting + 47% capital gains x 23% misreporting.
12
   At first glance it may appear surprising that the average underreporting percentages broken down by income
category are each less than the headline 18% underreporting across individual filers. This is in fact expected and
reflects the difficulty in such a calculation. The approach to calculating these percentages normalizes by a mass
greater than 100 percent of taxable filer income; in the case of offsets and losses, the subcategories are calculated as
underreported amount divided by the absolute value of quantities that should have been reported. We also lack
information on underreporting for every individual income category, so necessarily omit some individual income.
Our weights are also constructed from reported income. Ideally, we would do this exercise with true income, as this
approach underweights categories with the highest underreporting percentages.
         Statistics on reporting rates for other filing categories--like corporate taxes, employment
taxes (e.g., social security and Medicare taxes, for employers and those self-employed), and
estate taxes--are not available by income level. However, it seems likely that the beneficiaries of
tax evasion for other types of tax filers are also disproportionately the wealthy. 13 In the case of
corporate taxes, Treasury and JCT estimate that at least 75 percent of the burden of the corporate
tax falls on corporate shareholders or owners of capital (Cronin et al. 2012, JCT 2013). And only
estates of the wealthiest 0.1 percent are even eligible for estate taxation, meaning they are the
sole beneficiaries of the $1.5 billion in estimated annual estate tax avoidance. 14



     b. IRS resources to tackle noncompliance declining over time

         While it is true that outright elimination of any tax gap is impossible, the magnitude of
the gap between what is due and what the IRS collects is a function of the resources at its
disposal to detect and punish individuals, firms, estates, and tax avoiders across other filing
categories. These resources have decreased over time: The IRS budget has decreased (in real
terms) by nearly 15 percent since 2011. Its enforcement budget has dropped by 25 percent during
this period. Another way to appreciate the extent to which the IRS today is handicapped relative
to longer-term historical norms comes from examining its budget as a share of gross collections.
The share of tax revenue that is reinvested in the IRS has decreased steadily over the last twenty-
five years, from its peak of 0.6 percent in 1993 to its trough of 0.34 percent today. 16 Since 2011,
the ratio of its budget to collection activity fell by 34 percent. 18 This results in sizeable direct

13
   We are unaware of estimates of the incidence of employment tax noncompliance. High-income earners avoid
employment taxes by setting up passthrough businesses, and estimates suggest that over 10 percent of gig economy
workers simply do not report their income for tax purposes.
14
   In 2018, the number of estates eligible for estate taxation fell to less than 2,000 (from around 5,000 previously).
See Howard Gleckman, "Only 1,700 Estates Would Owe Estate Tax in 2018 Under the TCJA," Urban-Brookings
Tax Policy Center (Dec. 6, 2017); and Heather Long, "3,200 Wealthy Individuals Wouldn't Pay Estate Tax Next
Year Under GOP Plan," The Washington Post, Nov. 11, 2017.
16
   Considering the IRS budget as a share of gross collections is potentially problematic because changes in the tax
code will impact collections, and so the decrease we observe could hypothetically be related to an increase in owed
tax liabilities. To alleviate this concern, we also look at the IRS budget as a share of cumulative adjusted gross
income for all individual filers. This too reflects a similar trend, decreasing from a peak of 0.16 percent in 1996 to
0.11 percent in 2016 (the last year for which this data is available).
18
   The earliest year these data are available in the IRS Data Book Index of Tables. For some series, historical data
exist in the SOI Tax Stats Archive. Unless we refer to it explicitly, our focus is on data that is available in the IRS
Data Book Index of Tables, not the historical archives. The budget data come from IRS Data Book Table 28: "Costs
Incurred by Budget Activity." In real terms, the IRS budget has been above the FY 2018 level every year since
2001. Unless noted otherwise, dollar estimates are presented in 2018 dollars. Data on real GDP comes from FRED.
losses to the IRS. But such a lax enforcement regime also has sizable indirect effects, as
previously law-abiding filers realize that there are substantial gains--and little cost--to
noncompliance.

change in this ratio relative to 1993 is reported.
Because of this decrease in enforcement resources, today, the IRS has fewer auditors than it had
at any point since World War II. Last year the IRS' criminal division brought fewer than 800
cases in which tax fraud was the primary crime, a decline of almost 25 percent over this
decade. 22 Its workforce declined by essentially this proportion over this same period.

        Consequently, the share of returns that are examined declined by around 45 percent since
2011. There has been a steep decline across filing categories: the share of individual returns,
corporate returns, employment returns, and estate returns examined decreased by between 37
percent and 46 percent during this period.

        One might argue that a reduction in enforcement resources is benign for multiple reasons.
First, it is plausible that as technological developments have made the IRS more efficient, such
that it no longer needs large outlays to police tax evasion. Second, if the IRS successfully targets
resources toward examining the most egregious evaders' returns, then a steep decline in the share
of audits performed will have a much lesser impact on audit revenue.

After Examination.
         The fact that we observe an essentially 1:1 relationship between the resources that the
IRS has at its disposal and the revenue generated from examinations casts doubts on these
theories. As Figure 6 illustrates, since 2011, the share of returns audited (across all filing
categories) fell by 45 percent, and the additional taxes collected from audits fell by nearly 50
percent. The same is true for audits of high-income individual returns, which generate substantial
revenue for the IRS: audit rates for individuals making $1 million or more annually peaked in
2011 at 12.5 percent. Since then, they have fallen: Last year, only 3.2 percent of returns of these
high-income individuals were audited. Consequently, the additional revenue generated from
examination of millionaires' individual income tax filings declined by a similar amount (70
percent) over this period. These patterns suggest that it is unlikely that there would be

     I.       Potential reforms

          Below, we estimate the revenue-raising potential of specific reforms to shrink the tax gap
by (1) increasing enforcement resources and targeting high-income individuals for audit scrutiny;
(2) improving information reporting; and (3) greater IT investments. It seems likely that these
changes could raise over $1 trillion in the coming decade, shrinking the tax gap by around 15
percent.

     a. Increasing examination rates
              i. Increasing examination rates for individual income tax filers

          The likelihood that an individual return will be audited has been falling since 2011, when
it peaked at 1.1 percent. Last year, only 0.5 percent of individual returns were audited.

          Had audits last year been performed at 2011 rates, the IRS would have audited 775,000
more individual returns. This would have generated nearly $14 billion in additional revenue in
2018, and around $180 billion in additional revenue if audit rates were at this level for the
coming decade (2020 to 2029). 25




25
  To get this estimate, we take 2011 average revenue per audit (additional tax liability + civil penalties, net of
abatements) x 775,000 additional individual audits. This gives us an estimate of how much additional revenue would
have been collected in 2018 if audit rates were at the 2011 peak. We then extrapolate for years 2020 to 2029 to
adjust for growth and inflation as described in note 2, supra.

             Table 3: Revenue raised from returning to historical individual audit levels

        This understates the revenue-raising potential of adequate and appropriately targeted
enforcement resources because it does not account for the efficiency gains from tilting individual
audits toward high-income earners, where returns on investment are highest, as described above.
Had the IRS audited individuals in 2018 at 2011 rates, nearly 95 percent of this increase in
individual examinations would have been audits of those making $200,000 or less a year, who
are primarily ordinary wage earners with near-perfect compliance. Audit rates for
multimillionaires would remain at low levels: around 8 percent for the 30,000 individuals
making $5 million to $10 million; and 12.5 percent for the 15,000 individuals making $10
million or more. 26

        Increasing the IRS's enforcement resources would substantially increase tax collections.
But reconsideration of how the recourses at its disposal are allocated would also be
consequential. In 2013, the IRS estimated that an extra hour spent auditing someone who earns
$200,000 annually generated only $650. An extra hour spent auditing someone who makes $5
million or more a year generated around $4,900. 27 It is thus hard to explain from an efficiency

distribute it throughout the income distribution based on 2018 examination shares.

       Figure 7: Audit rates for those earning over $500,000 annually vs. EITC recipients 30

         To understand the revenue-raising potential of focusing examination resources on high-
income earners, consider the following: The IRS spent over $8 billion last year on its 75,000-
person workforce. 31 Assuming a forty-hour workweek, the average IRS employee makes around
$55 per hour. Even if overhead costs relating to audits of individuals who make $1 million or
more annually are five times this size, an extra hour spent auditing a high-income individual
amounts to a 1,800 percent return on investment.


28
    The IRS recently reported to Congress that high numbers of EITC audits are in fact the most efficient use of the
current resources at the agency's disposal because EITC audits are conducted mostly via mail and performed by
less-skilled auditors. Audits of the wealthy require senior specialists that the IRS has had trouble retaining. Thus,
before more high-income audits can be performed, "Congress must fund and the IRS must hire and train appropriate
numbers" of skilled, senior auditors capable of examining complex returns. Letter from IRS Commissioner Charles
P. Rettig to Sen. Ron Wyden, D-ORE, ranking Finance Committee member (Sept. 6, 2019). Committee on Finance.

Status, Budget Activity, and Selected Type of Personnel.
         This large payoff to high-income audits has several components: (1) first, mechanically,
those who are wealthier have larger tax liabilities and so discrepancies between what is owed and
what is paid tend to be larger in magnitude; (2) second, high net-worth individuals have more
complex returns, and their income tends to accrue in opaque categories where information
reporting, and thus compliance, is lowest; and (3) high income individuals have the most
motivation and resources to invest in lowering tax liability.

         Given the significant returns from audits of high-income individuals, imagine that the
IRS directs new examination resources to focus on these returns: auditing 50 percent of
individuals who make $10 million or more; 33 percent of those who make between $5 million
and $10 million; and 20 percent of those who make $1 million or more. In 2018, this would have
corresponded to roughly 70,000 additional audits of those earning $1 million or more annually.

         Because the returns of the high-income are most complex, these examinations are most
costly and most time-consuming. 32 We thus assume that it takes ten times as long to audit
someone above the millionaire threshold as someone below. Thus, instead of restoring audit rates
for those earning $200,000 or less annually to 2011 levels; consider a scenario where the IRS
instead increases audit rates for those earning $1 million or more annually. This would have
generated nearly $41.5 billion in additional revenue in 2018. If these additional examinations are
performed between 2020 and 2029, the additional tax revenue collected from this approach
would be nearly $535 billion.




32
  They can also only effectively be performed by the skilled senior auditors, "revenue agents" who are the IRS'
"most highly trained and experienced employees with substantial accounting skills." The average time to complete
an audit of an individual making $10 million or more annually is in the range of 50 to 250 hours. Rettig letter, supra

             Had the IRS examined returns at 2011 levels last year, it would have also audited around
   11,500 more corporations. Though less than 2 percent of the increase in individual audits (by
   number), these audits would have generated substantial revenue for the IRS, since in 2011, each
   corporate audit averaged around $1 million in additional tax liability and civil penalties imposed.




   33
     IRS SOI Tax Stats. Table 9a: Examination Coverage: Recommended and Average Recommended Additional Tax
   After Examination, by Type of Return; Table 9b: Individual Income Tax Returns Examined; Table 17: Civil
   Penalties Assessed and Abated, by Type of Tax and Type of Penalty. To arrive at these estimates in Column (1),
   from a return to audit rates at 2011 levels, we take the total across individual income categories estimated from
   returning to 2011 individual audit rates (around $14 billion) and distribute it among income categories based on the
   share of additional tax liability each income group was responsible for in 2011. We divide this total by the number
   of additional audits that would be performed if the IRS returned to 2011 levels to arrive at an estimate for the
   average additional tax collection (inclusive of civil penalties) for each additional audit performed, by income level.
   Note that the distribution of additional tax liability is only available in broad income groups (under $200,000,
   $200,000 to $1 million, over $1 million). We thus are forced to assume that all audits of those earning over $1
   million generate equivalent average additional revenue. In Column (2), we use the average additional revenue per
   audit computed to evaluate the consequence of a shift toward higher-income auditing. Practically, because we
   assume an extra high-income audit will take 10 times as long as that of an individual earning $200,000 or less
   annually, this means that rather than performing about 730,000 additional audits of low-income earners (as would be
   required to return to 2011 levels), the IRS instead performs only 3,600 additional low-income audits, shifting the
   vast majority of resources toward those earning over $1 million.
             The audit rates for other filing categories, like estate and employment returns, have
    decreased substantially as well. Since 2011, the share of returns audited across all filing
    categories has fallen from 0.9% to 0.5%. Increasing examination rates to 2011 levels for estate,
    employment, and corporate returns; as well as an increase in audits of individual tax filers,
    focused particularly on the high-income--could generate over $700 billion in additional tax
    revenue between 2020 and 2029.

          b. Improved information reporting to shrink underreporting tax gap

             Around 80 percent of the tax gap accrues from underreporting of tax liabilities on filed
    returns. Underreporting is most common in categories of income that are less visible to the
    IRS--like sole proprietorship income, partnership income, and self-employment returns--as
    these are subject to relatively little information reporting and not automatically withheld.
    Substantial revenue could be raised from an increase in information reporting requirements that
    decreases the ability of tax filers to misreport their income.




    34
      Note that for all filing categories except individual income tax filers, extra investment would return to 2011 audit
    rates. For individual filers, extra resources would be tilted toward the wealthy, with the overall audit rate increasing
    to only 0.7 percent, but the audit rate for those making between $1 million and $5 million to 20 percent; $5 million-
    and $10 million to 33 percent; over $10 million, to 50 percent.

        We first consider the revenue potential of efforts to shrink the individual income tax gap
through increased information reporting. When a salaried employee files her taxes, income is
correctly reported and taxes appropriately paid approximately 99 percent of the time. This is
because her tax payments are in a sense automated by withholding requirements and easily
verified by the simultaneous reporting of her employer. Misreporting remains low (5 percent) for
income not automatically withheld but still subject to robust cross-party reporting, like pension
income. It jumps to 17 percent for income subject to only light reporting requirements, like
partnership income. And it is reaches 55 percent for income subject to essentially no cross-party
reporting requirements, like sole proprietor income or rental and royalty income. 36

        Increasing information reporting is regarded as a highly effective way to increase tax
compliance. The GAO and IRS suggest that reporting requirements are one of the "few means of
sizably increasing the compliance rate." 37 And JCT has highlighted the success of increases in

reporting requirements resulted in substantially more accurate reporting of business receipts. 38

        Despite consensus on the desirability of increasing reporting requirements for less
transparent income sources, there are relatively few estimates of the potential revenue that could
be raised by such reforms. We offer a naïve approach: based on the 2019 tax gap statistics,
increasing reporting requirements for individual income categories subject to some information
reporting (like partnership/S corporation income) to the "substantial" level of pensions and
annuities would generate nearly $40 billion in additional tax revenue in 2020. Increasing
requirements for income subject to little or no information reporting (like nonfarm proprietor
income, rents, and royalties) to the "some information reporting" level would generate an
additional $115 billion in 2020. Between 2020 and 2029, an increase in reporting requirements
for the two most opaque income categories would generate nearly $2 trillion in tax revenue. 39

   IRS Publication 1415, supra note 1. To get estimates for years 2020-2029, we first calculate 2018 tax gap
numbers by category based on the share of the 2012 individual net tax gap that income that accrues in each of these
categories represents. We then age this estimate per the discussion in note 2, supra.
        This is an optimistic sum, and it is difficult to be confident about how effective
information reporting requirements will be across varied and complex income sources.
Additionally, investments made to increase reporting will not reap their full benefits for years, as
it will take time to develop and implement changes. But even if in the coming decade an increase
in information reporting allows us to capture only 15 percent of the $2 trillion estimated, this
would mean gains of $300 billion in the next decade from individual income tax filers alone.

        It is also likely that an increase in information reporting can help address the large and
growing self-employment tax gap. 41 Today, misreported self-employment taxes represent around
10 percent of the tax gap, and non-filed self-employment taxes represent an additional 1 percent.
This is at least in part attributable to the growth in self-employment filers in the gig economy. In
many cases, platforms do not file information reports unless workers earn at least $20,000
annually. Estimates suggest this means that for more than 50 percent of income (by dollars) and
95 percent of returns (by number) the IRS is not provided information by employers about the
income earned by workers who file self-employment returns. 42 Mandating information reporting
for all independent contractors would increase compliance. While it is hard to predict the precise
magnitude, our reasoning is as follows: self-employment tax misreporting contributes around 11
percent to the net tax gap, relative to around 70 percent for individual filers. We predict an
increase in information reporting can shrink the individual tax gap by around 5 percent. A
comparable decrease in the self-employment tax gap would mean nearly $50 billion in additional
revenue in a decade.

payroll taxes that are automatically withheld from employees.

       c. Technological advancement
                  i.       IRS relies on antiquated technology

          Although the potential usefulness of technology in helping to identify tax evaders
increased dramatically in the last two decades, the IRS has decreased, rather than increased, its
IT outlays. Indeed last year, the IRS spent only $2.5 billion on IT investments. As a point of
comparison, Bank of America spent around $16 billion, but serves only a quarter of Americans. 44

          The IRS's low budget is not the natural byproduct of modernization decreasing IT costs.
Rather, the IRS underinvests in technology, and the effects are evident: by the end of 2017,
nearly 60 percent of IRS hardware was past its useable life, and 26 percent of software was two
or more releases behind the most up-to-date version. According to the GAO , the IRS Individual
Master File and Business Master File systems date back to 1960 and are the two oldest IT
systems in the federal government. 45 Treasury officials warn that outdated technology is a threat
to the stability of the tax system: "by analogy, the IRS has erected a 50-story office building on


43
   Note that for all filing categories except individual income tax filers, extra investment would return to 2011 audit
rates. For individual filers, extra resources would be tilted toward the wealthy, with overall audit rate increasing to
only 0.7 percent, but audit rate for those making between $1 million and $5 million to 20 percent; $5 million and
$10 million to 33 percent; and over $10 million to 50 percent.
44
   Between 2010 and 2018, Bank of America spent $25 billion, or $3.1 billion per year, on new technology
initiatives, which surpasses IRS's technology outlays and "include[s] reworking effectively all of our major systems
and adding innovative capabilities, while also building an internal cloud and software architecture for maximum
efficiency and speed to market." Bank of America Annual Report 2018. We are grateful to Charles Rossotti for

top of a creaky, 60-year foundation, and it is adding a few more floors each year. There are
inherent limitations on the functionality of a 60-year-old infrastructure, and at some point, the
entire edifice is likely to collapse." 46

        Outdated technology creates delays for taxpayers: in 2017, the IRS had to extend the
filing deadline after a server crash. Additionally, the IRS fails to match in a timely manner many
taxpayer filings with information returns filed by third parties which can verify the accuracy of
reports.

                 ii.     Greater investment in analytics can increase efficiency and raise
                         revenue

        The IRS piloted the use of data analysis for the identification of suspicious tax returns in
1962. The audit-selection process today remains fairly similar to that first implemented forty
years ago--each return is given a score based on the probability of noncompliance, and IRS
personnel then manually screen returns to ensure that audit selection is appropriate. 47

        In recent years, the IRS has developed on this front, with early-stage analysis aimed at
identifying and quickly resolving deficiencies, before resources are expended on full
examinations. These advances have been made possible by the dramatic increase in electronic
filings (by 2016, almost 90 percent of returns were filed electronically--a decade earlier, this
share was only 54 percent); as well as the greater availability of data, for example from credit
card companies and third-party processors on payments routed through their networks. 48

        A recent success is the IRS' return review program (RRP) that automatically identifies
discrepancies with information returns to prevent the issuance of invalid refunds. In 2017, RRP
saved the IRS $4.4 billion 49 and cost only $90 billion. 50 That is around a 50:1 return.

           Significant untapped potential remains. The ability to match taxpayer filings with third-
party information returns increases tax collection: in 2018, the IRS closed 3 million cases in
which it identified a discrepancy between the taxpayer's return and third-party information,
which resulted in an additional $5.3 billion in tax revenue. 51

           However, the actual volume of mismatches is likely significantly larger than the 3 million
cases that were closed. This is both because the IRS is currently unable to identify all
mismatches; and because it lacks the capacity to collect additional tax revenue even from the
discrepancies it identifies. In 2010 when this data was last made available, the IRS identified
almost 24 million mismatches on returns, but worked only about 5.3 million (22 percent) of these
cases. 52

           The IRS hopes to expand RRP to detect fraud in other filing categories, for example
business income and partnership returns, where noncompliance is rising. Beyond refunds, it
could also be leveraged to help select the most suspicious returns for examination by improving
the match between information reports and taxpayer returns. If the IRS expands information
reporting, better matching will have even greater revenue potential.

           It is difficult to speculate about potential gains. Assume that marginal investments in
information technology, including the expansion of RRP, have much lower returns--perhaps
10:1. This suggests that spending $10 billion on investment in a decade would generate $100
billion in additional tax revenue.



     II.      Benchmarking our estimate with scorekeeper estimates

           There are reasons to believe that the estimates we offer above are too optimistic. We do
not take account of the behavioral effects of our proposals: the fact that as enforcement efforts
rise, tax evaders will become more sophisticated about sheltering revenue. Additionally, we do
not consider the relationship between the different components of our compliance program: For
example, greater information reporting will increase voluntary tax compliance, and thus reduce


51
   IRS SOI Tax Stats. Table 14, "Information Reporting Program."
52
   National Taxpayer Advocate 2013 Annual Report to Congress (Dec. 31, 2013) ("Fundamental changes to return
filing and processing will assist taxpayers in return preparation and decrease improper payments.")
the returns to additional examinations. And there are potentially diminishing returns to
compliance investment.

        But there are also reasons to believe our estimates are overly conservative. As one
example, we do not consider the revenue that can be generated by a substantial increase in
penalties for tax evaders, which would both increase revenue directly and deter illegal avoidance
schemes. Additionally, if, as we suspect, the IRS is not currently well-equipped to identify the
most suspicious returns for audit attention, then concerns about diminishing marginal returns to
extra compliance efforts are less pronounced. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that audit
rates and tax collection from examinations decreased 1:1 in recent years.

        As a check on our estimation and the feasibility of the substantial investments in
compliance we recommend, we compare our estimate of substantial investment in tax
compliance to the CBO/JCT's estimate of a much smaller increase in audits and collection
efforts. CBO recently estimated that a $20 billion investment in 2019 would generate $55 billion
in additional tax collections between 2019 and 2028. 53 At first glance, our estimates appear
substantially more optimistic than this.

        This is largely because the CBO approach is based on a program that is far more modest
in scale and scope. Returning the IRS to historical budget levels (as a share of total collections)
would involve an expansion of over four times that which the CBO proposes. Additionally, the
CBO primarily focuses on returns to more aggressive auditing overall. The approaches we
consider are better targeted: we consider an expansion of IRS high-income audits where returns
are highest. They are also broader: we also consider an increase in IT investment and information
reporting that the CBO does not, although it acknowledges this is likely to be an efficient way to
raise additional tax revenue.

        Still, the CBO estimate provides a useful baseline for extrapolation. If the IRS budget
increased to the 2010 share of gross collections, this would mean nearly $100 billion in greater
IRS expenditure between 2020 to 2029. The Treasury reports that indirect effects of compliance-

Service's Enforcement Initiatives," (Dec. 13, 2018).
oriented investment are likely to be more than three times as large. 54 Augmenting the CBO
estimate to incorporate deterrence effects results suggests that restoring IRS budget outlays to
historical levels would generate around $1.1 trillion. This is quite close to our estimate ($1.15
trillion) of the total revenue-raising potential of our compliance proposals.

         This comparison is in some sense spurious because our approach above does not consider
indirect deterrence effects, but this omission may well be counteracted by overly optimistic
estimation. On balance, the CBO estimate does not lead us to doubt that a substantial investment
in the IRS has the potential to shrink the tax gap by at least $1 trillion in the coming decade.

             a. Issues with budget scorekeeping of compliance initiatives

     As the above illustrates, we offer only rough back-of-the-envelope revenue approximations.
Before policy is pursued in this vein, it will be important to have professional scorekeepers like
those at the CBO, JCT, and other major agencies weigh in on the likely returns to investment in
the tax compliance proposals we outline.

     It is important to highlight that these agencies' scorekeeping guidelines limit their ability to
account for revenue gains from compliance efforts when they provide official scores of proposals
to increase the IRS' budget. These guidelines were put into place in response to legitimate
criticisms of congressional leaders' reliance on "tax compliance initiatives" to stopgap last hour
budget gaps. This practice became discredited, and the revenue from increased enforcement
efforts came to be excluded from official scorekeeping. To the extent possible, professional

54
   The IRS reports in its 2019 budget request that the returns on enforcement are "likely understated, since the ROI
estimate does not include the revenue effect of the indirect deterrence value of IRS enforcement programs, which is
conservatively estimated to be at least three times the direct revenue effect."
55
   See note 53, supra. Direct effects estimated based on CBO revenue option.
scorekeepers still provide Congress with information on potential revenue effects 56--for example
by estimating "nonscorable" gains from greater enforcement efforts. But what is counted, counts.
When credit is not given for revenue that will be collected from increased spending on
compliance efforts, it is unsurprising that such spending is neglected. The constraints imposed by
the budget scorekeeping guidelines in this context relate to a broader debate about what kind of
feedback effects should be considered in revenue estimates for changes to federal budget policy,
long an area of controversy. This paper suggests that the revenue gains from investments in tax
compliance are likely to be substantial--and thus the consequences of the scoring guidelines
significant, with stakes in the same range as those at play in the debate on dynamic scoring.

     III.   Conclusion

     Our hope is for this short paper to highlight that decisions about the scale of the IRS are
comparable revenue significance to much debate about changes in tax provisions. Further,
improvements in revenue collection from better tax enforcement have the potential to produce
efficiency gains, by reducing the diversion of resources into areas where avoidance is easy.
Compliance efforts will also increase the progressivity of the tax system, because non-
compliance is greatest among high-income taxpayers.
