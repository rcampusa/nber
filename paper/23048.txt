Open Borders in the European Union and Beyond: Migration Flows and Labor Market Implications
John Kennan
NBER Working Paper No. 23048
January 2017
JEL No. E25,F22,J61

                                         ABSTRACT

In 2004, the European Union admitted 10 new countries, and wages in these countries were
generally well below the levels in the existing member countries. Citizens of these newly-
admitted countries were subsequently free to take jobs anywhere in the EU, and many did so. In
2015, a large number of refugees from Syria and other broken countries sought to migrate to EU
countries (along very dangerous routes), and these refugees were met with fierce resistance, at
least in some places. This paper seeks to understand the labor market implications of allowing
free migration across borders, with particular reference to the EU. The aim is to quantify the
migration flows associated with EU enlargement, and to analyze the extent to which these flows
affected equilibrium wages. The main conclusion is that the real wage effects are small, and the
gains from open borders are large.

1        Introduction
In 2004, the European Union admitted 10 new countries, and the wage levels in most of these
countries were far below the levels in most of the existing member countries. Citizens of these
newly-admitted countries were subsequently free to take jobs anywhere in the EU, and many did
so. This paper seeks to understand the labor market implications of allowing free migration across
borders, with particular reference to the EU. The aim is to quantify the migration flows associated
with EU enlargement, and to analyze the extent to which these flows affected equilibrium wages.
        This paper is about long-run effects of open borders, with very limited discussion of dynamics.
Obviously, short-run effects are also important. But it can reasonably be argued that short-run
effects tend to get too much attention in policy discussions. Given the difficulty of actually changing
economic policies in practice, there is a lot to be said for making recommendations based on long-
run considerations, with the idea that if the recommended policy is actually implemented, it will
have lasting effects.

                                    Figure 1: Labor Allocation Effects




2        Literature
Hamilton and Whalley (1984) initiated the quantitative analysis of the costs of immigration re-
strictions. Their analysis (and subsequent work by Moses and Letnes (2004) and Iregui (2005),
for example) was based on a multi-country version of the model illustrated in Figure 1.1 This is
a standard textbook model of a segmented labor market (used for example to show the relative
wage effects associated with unions). If two labor markets (say Mexico and the U.S.) have different
downward-sloping curves showing the marginal product of labor as a function of the number of
workers employed (here the number of workers in Mexico is measured from left to right, and the
number in the U.S. is measured from right to left), then migration from Mexico to the U.S. reduces
the wage in the U.S. and increases the wage in Mexico (the initial position being indicated by
the solid lines, and the final position by the dashed lines). Since total output in each country is
the area under the marginal product curve, migration raises total output. In the Hamilton and
Whalley (1984) analysis, the result when immigration restrictions are removed is at the point where
marginal products are equal, and total output is maximal.2
        Hamilton and Whalley (1984) divide the world economy into 7 regions (EEC, U.S., Japan, other
developed countries, OPEC, LDCs and Newly Industrialized Countries). Each region has its own
CES technology, with different TFP levels, and different elasticities of substitution between capital
and labor. The elasticities are set at “extraneous” values (meaning that calculations are made for
a range of possible values), and the TFP levels are inferred from the data (World Bank data on
GNP and population, and factor shares data from U.N sources). The results indicate that there
are massive costs due to labor misallocation: total world output could be roughly doubled if all
immigration restrictions were removed.

     In exactly the same way, union relative wage effects are understood as the result of limiting the number of
workers in one sector, which drives up the marginal product, while pushing more workers into the nonunion sector,
which drives down the marginal product there.




                                                       2
       There are two major limitations of this segmented labor market model, in the present context.
One is that the people in the model are not attached to any particular place, whereas there is a
great deal of evidence indicating that, other things equal, most people would rather live their lives
in the place where they grew up. Thus in the absence of immigration restrictions, one would not
expect that wages would be equalized across countries, but rather that in the new equilibrium, every
potential migrant would view the wage gain from moving to a high-wage country as insufficient
to offset the cost of living away from home. The implied increase in output would then be less
than the maximal amount (i.e. the amount calculated by Hamilton and Whalley (1984)), and even
this increase overstates the gains from relaxing immigration restrictions, because it neglects the
migration cost.3
       The second limitation is that there is no consideration of the extent to which wage differences
are arbitraged through product markets. Hamilton and Whalley (1984) acknowledged this, with
the comment that “most trade economists appear to regard factor price equalization as a theoretical
possibility rather than an empirical proposition”, and proceeded to use a model in which only a
single composite consumption good is produced, so that the factor price equalization theorem is
moot. But of course the same comment applies to the idea that there is only one consumption good.
The factor price equalization theorem does not apply directly in models which assume that every
firm produces a distinct good, as in Dixit and Stiglitz (1977) and Krugman (1980), but product
market arbitrage also implies strong restrictions on cross-country wage differences in such models.4
       The Klein and Ventura (2009) analysis differs from Hamilton and Whalley (1984) in that the
gains from migration are attributed to differences in TFP (as opposed to differences in the numbers
of workers allocated to each country). The model used in Kennan (2013) attributes wage differences
to differences in labor productivity; in this model the factor price equalization theorem holds when
labor is measured in efficiency units, as in Trefler (1993). In contrast to the Klein-Ventura model,
the gains have nothing to do with reallocating capital across countries, because it is assumed, in
line with the evidence presented by Caselli and Feyrer (2007), that there are no differences in the
productivity of capital, and factor price equalization implies that the return to capital is the same
in all countries.5
   3
      For example, the marginal migrant is more productive after migrating, but has a net gain of zero.
   4
      For example, in the basic model in Krugman (1980), and also in the Melitz (2003) model, wages are equal across
countries, because everything is symmetric. When transport costs are introduced, wages are higher in larger countries.
Each good is consumed in all countries, and if production is moved to a larger country, the cost of delivering the
good to consumers is reduced (because the consumers are closer). This pushes down the wage in smaller countries,
to the point where the lower wage just offsets the higher transport cost. But transport costs are hardly a plausible
explanation for the huge cross-country wage differences seen in the data.
    5
      Even this modified version of the factor price equalization theorem is viewed skeptically as an empirical proposition
by trade economists – see Davis and Weinstein (2004), for example. One reason for this skepticism, as explained
by Goldberg and Pavcnik (2007), is that there is no evidence that the increased exposure of developing countries
to international trade seen in recent years has led to a reduction in the skill premium. But of course no amount of
evidence can repeal a theorem, and there seems to be no fully satisfactory model that accounts for large cross-country
differences in wages paid to workers whose output is sold in competitive international markets. At this point the
efficiency units version of factor price equalization seems to be the best model available.

3.1       Some Descriptive Statistics

Since it was founded in 1958, the number of member countries in the European Union gradually
increased from 6 to 28, as shown in Table 1.6 Citizens of newly-admitted countries were free to
move and work anywhere within the borders of the EU (although in some countries restrictions
remained in place for a few years).

        Differences in real GDP per worker together with population numbers are shown in Figure 2.7
        The EU expansion demonstrates that open borders do not imply massive population movements,
even when there are large wage disparities across countries. People do move, in substantial numbers,
but the vast majority of people choose to stay in their home country. This is illustrated in Figure 3,
which shows the number of Polish-born people living in Poland in 2002 and 2009, and the number
of Polish-born people living in the UK and in Sweden, from 1998 to 2014, as a percentage of the
population of Poland in 2002. Although there was a large increase in the number of Polish people
in the UK after Poland joined the EU (and a similar increase in Sweden, on a smaller scale), the
number of Polish people living in Poland nevertheless increased by 1.3% between 2002 and 2009
(from 36, 871, 281 to 37, 337, 408).8 Figure 3 shows similar results for Hungary; in this case the
data for the UK are missing, but the same pattern is seen using data for Holland. It is clear
from these plots that when Poland and Hungary joined the EU, many people from these countries
decided to move to more attractive locations. But the net migration flows are small in relation to
the populations of the sending countries: even in the case of Poland and the UK, the proportion
of Polish people in the UK 10 years after Poland joined the EU was less than one quarter of one

                        Another notable feature of these data is that the population movements are slow. Before Poland
joined the EU, there were less than 100, 000 Polish people in the UK. Five years later, that number
had risen to about half a million. But after 10 years, the number was about three-quarters of
a million, and apparently still rising. This is the pattern predicted by the simulation results in
Kennan and Walker (2011). Migration decisions are affected by many things other than income
differences. Even when income differences are large, the number of people close to the migration

    Some restrictions on migration from Bulgaria and Romania remained in place until January 1, 2014, notably in
the UK

finding is that these costs are relatively small.10 The approach here is less chauvinistic, following
Klein and Ventura (2007), Klein and Ventura (2009), Clemens (2011) and Kennan (2013): the
emphasis is on the benefits associated with immigration, as perceived by the immigrants. As in
Kennan (2013), the model assumes free trade in product markets, implying factor price equalization.
The large observed differences in wages across countries are interpreted as the result of differences
in the productivity of labor, implying large migration incentives even though wages are equalized
in terms of efficiency units of labor. The model goes beyond Kennan (2013) by treated skilled
and unskilled labor as imperfect substitutes, thus introducing the possibility that large flows of
unskilled migrants can affect the skill premium. The main objective is to quantify the gains arising
from expansion of the EU to include 13 new countries after 2004. In addition, the model is used
to estimate the effects of this expansion on real wages in the EU countries.
                         The model has many produced goods, and it is assumed that the production technologies
are similar, but not identical. Factor prices are equalized, but elasticities of substitution are not
constant at the market level, even though the technology for each product is a (nested) CES.

4.1                             Factor Price Equalization with Labor-Augmenting Technology Differences

Suppose there are J countries, with common technologies, but different productivity levels. If
the productivity differences are labor-augmenting (i.e. Harrod-neutral), then the technology for
product s in country j can be specified as

                                                                                                       Qjs = Fs (K, aj S, bj U )

view, see Borjas (2003).

where K is capital, and (aj , bj ) represent the efficiency units of skilled (S) and unskilled (U ) labor
per worker in country j.
   Let c0s be the unit cost function for product s when the labor inputs are measured in efficiency
units, so that the production function is Qs = Fs (K, S, U ). Then the cost function for product s
in country j is

where w is the wage per efficiency unit of (skilled and unskilled) labor, and v is the price of capital.

4.1.1   Factor Price Equalization

If there is free trade in the product markets, with no transportation costs, then the zero-profit
condition implies

                                                                         !

                                                                 aj bj

If three products {s1 , s2 , s3 } are produced in country j, then

                                                !
                                        wS wU
                               c0s   v,   ,                = ps , s ∈ {s1 , s2 , s3 }
                                        aj bj

   These equations determine the factor prices in country j. If the marginal rates of technical
substitution satisfy a single-crossing condition, the factor prices are uniquely determined. Then if
country ` also produces these same products, the same equations determine factor prices in country
`, with a` in place of aj . This implies vj = v` , and

                                                    wj   w`
                                                       =
                                                    aj   a`
   Thus

                                               wjS = aj w0S
                                               wjU         = bj w0U

where w0S and w0U are reference wage levels. In other words, wages are equal across countries
when measured in efficiency units. This is true regardless of whether workers are allowed to move
between countries (and it remains true if capital cannot move either). The point is that arbitrage
in product markets implies (indirect) arbitrage in factor markets as well. In the standard Hecksher-
Ohlin model, factor price equalization implies that restrictions on international labor mobility are

                                                              8
irrelevant, in the sense that there is no pecuniary incentive for workers to migrate. Here, in contrast,
a worker who moves from a low-productivity country to a high-productivity country acquires more
efficiency units of labor, and thus earnings rise even though the underlying price of labor is the
same everywhere.

4.2      General Equilibrium

Given the factor prices, the prices of consumer goods are determined by the cost functions. The
quantities consumed are determined by these goods prices, and by preferences and total income
(where income depends on factor prices). Given the quantities to be produced, and the factor
prices, producers determine the profit-maximizing factor quantities. This gives demand curves for
the factors, and factor prices are determined so as to clear the factor markets.
      For simplicity, it is assumed that: (1) preferences are identical in all countries, and are described
by a loglinear utility function with expenditure share parameters θs ; and (2) the production function
for each good is a nested CES, and is the same in all countries, with substitution elasticities that are
the same for all goods (and with the understanding that the labor input is measured in efficiency
units). The consumption goods are produced using capital and labor, where labor is a composite
of skilled and unskilled labor, and where the skill mix is allowed to differ across products.
      It is also assumed that each worker supplies one time-unit of labor (inelastically). This time-unit
implies different amounts of effective labor in different countries, for two reasons: human capital
endowments hj may differ across countries, and each unit of human capital in country j means aSj
efficiency units of skilled labor, or aU
                                       j efficiency units of unskilled labor.
      The nested CES treats labor as a composite of two components, skilled and unskilled. The
composite is a power-linear function of skilled and unskilled labor11 :

                                                 Lκ = γS κ + (1 − γ) U κ

with κ < 1, where γ ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter reflecting the relative importance of skilled and unskilled
                                                                                                       1
labor in the composite. The elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled labor is ζ =     1−κ .
It is assumed that this elasticity of substitution is the same for all products, but γ may differ across
products, with some products being more skill-intensive than others.
      Output is a power-linear function of capital and (composite) labor. Write this as

                                                 Y ρ = αK ρ + (1 − α) Lρ

with ρ < 1, where α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter reflecting the relative importance of capital and labor.
                                                                                  1
The elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled labor is σ =        1−ρ .   It is assumed that
this elasticity of substitution is the same for all products, but α may differ across products, with

      The function is linear if κ = 1, and it is log-linear if κ = 0.

each good has constant returns.

4.3   Equilibrium Characterization

The equilibrium conditions can be described as follows. First the labor share in each industry (λr )
is given by
                                                              σ         σ−1
                                  1 − λr            αr               Wr
                                              
                                         =
                                    λr            1 − αr             v
and the share of skilled labor in total labor income in each industry (ηr ) is given by

                                                              ζ          !ζ−1
                                   1 − ηr         1 − γr            wS
                                              
                                          =
                                     ηr             γr              wU

Skilled labor earnings in industry r can be written as

                                           wS Sr = ηr Wr Lr

Similarly, labor cost in industry r can be written as

                                           Wr Lr = λr pr Qr

The quantities to be produced are determined by the expenditure shares θr applied to total income
                                                                                
                                 pr Qr = θr vK0 + wS S0 + wU U0

where S0 and U0 are the aggregate amounts of skilled and unskilled labor in the world (in efficiency
units), and K0 is the aggregate amount of capital.

                                                     11
   Putting these pieces together gives skilled labor earnings in industry r as
                                                                                                       
                                  wS Sr = ηr λr θr vK0 + wS S0 + wU U0

and adding over industries gives the market-clearing condition for skilled labor
                                             X                                                             
                                 wS S̄ =           ηr λr θr vK0 + wS S0 + wU U0
                                              r

with a similar equation for unskilled labor. Thus the market-clearing equations can be written as



                                             AS (x) (1 + x1 + x2 ) = x1
                                         AU (x) (1 + x1 + x2 ) = x2

where

                                        x = (x1 , x2 ) =                     ,                                                (1)
                                                                        vK0 vK0
and


                                                              X
                                      AS (x) =                      θr λr (x) ηr (x)
                                                               r
                                                              X
                                      AU (x) =                      θr λr (x) (1 − ηr (x))
                                                               r

To complete this characterization of the equilibrium conditions, it must be shown that the shares
can be expressed in terms of x. The skilled labor share can immediately be written as

                                                                             1
                                        ηr (x) =                           ζ            ζ−1                               (2)
                                                                    1−γr           x1 U0

To write the share of the labor composite as a function of x first note that the factor price ratio in
industry r satisfies

   Adding the two market-clearing equations gives


                                                                       12

so

and
                                    X                                             1
                                               θr (1 − λr (x)) =                                        (3)
                                       r                                     1 + x1 + x2

Substituting this in the market-clearing equations gives
                               X                                              X
                                           θr λr (x) ηr (x) = x1                   θr (1 − λr (x))
                                   r                                           r
                        X                                                     X
                             θr λr (x) (1 − ηr (x)) = x2                           θr (1 − λr (x))
                         r                                                     r

and these equations can be rearranged as
                                       X
                                                θr λr (x) (ηr (x) + x1 ) − x1 = 0                       (4)
                                           r
                              X
                                       θr λr (x) (1 − ηr (x) + x2 ) − x2 = 0
                               r

Thus an equilibrium is a point x = (x1 , x2 ) that solves these two (nonlinear) equations. It is
straightforward to show that a solution exists. But showing uniqueness by direct analysis of these
equations is surprisingly difficult. And showing uniqueness indirectly using the economic structure
that generates the equations is surprisingly easy, as is shown in the Appendix.

4.4   Goods Prices

                                   s                                 αsσ       v
                                                                               Ws          + (1 − αs )σ

     Thus an increase in the price of capital relative to labor implies an increase in the relative price
of capital-intensive goods.

4.5     Immigration and Wages

The effective total supply of labor aggregated over countries is

efficient, the effective supply of labor increases, and if the capital stock is taken as fixed, this reduces

4.6     Real Wages

When immigration restrictions are relaxed, the capital-labor ratios and factor-price ratios change,
and this leads to changes in real wages. These changes affect all countries in exactly the same
way (regardless of whether they are sending or receiving countries). Factor price equalization holds
both before and after the migration of labor, but migration reduces the wage per efficiency unit of
labor (and therefore also reduces the wages of all workers who do not migrate).
   The indirect utility function is the log of the real wage

(where an additional constant term involving log              αi       is ignored).
   This gives an aggregation result: if there was a single product, the real wage would be computed
in the same way. In other words, yk∗ is just the marginal product of labor, because aggregate output
is given by

Here the wage is proportional to the average product of labor, in the aggregate.

4.7     Real Wage Effects in the Short Run and in the Long Run

Migration increases the return on capital, since the effective capital-labor ratio decreases. In steady
state equilibrium with a constant returns technology

                                             f 0 (k ∗ ) = ρ + δ


                                                      17
where f 0 is the marginal product of capital, ρ is the rate of time preference, δ is the depreciation
rate and k ∗ is the effective capital-labor ratio. In the short run, migration increases the effective
labor supply, so the capital-labor ratio falls below k ∗ , and the marginal product of capital rises
above ρ + δ. The investment rate therefore increases, and this continues until the effective capital-
labor ratio returns to k ∗ , and the real wage returns to its original level. Thus migration does not
reduce wages in the long run. One conclusion from the analysis in Kennan (2013) is that the effect
of open borders on real wage rates is small (even in the short run, with capital held fixed). In a
dynamic model, the effect on real wages would be very much attenuated, even in the short run. For
example, in the Kennan and Walker (2011) model of internal migration within the U.S., it takes
about 10 years before the response to a simulated (permanent) increase in the real wage in one
location is more or less complete. Thus if immigration restrictions are removed gradually, in such
a way that the effective labor supply grows at the same rate as the capital stock, then wages do
not fall even in the short run.

4.8     Migration Decisions

One might initially expect that in a world with open borders, everyone would move to the most
productive location. But this ignores the strong attachment to home locations that is evident in
the data.12
                                                   yjs
     For a worker at skill level s, let ajs =      y0s   ≤ 1 be the level of income in the home location
(yjs ), relative to the highest income available elsewhere (y0s ), and assume that migration involves
a utility cost δ, which is drawn from a distribution Fs . Since the utility function is loglinear, the
indirect utility function can be expressed as log (y). Then it is optimal to stay in the home location
if
                                          log (y0s ) − δ ≤ log (yjs )

     If the distribution of δ is exponential, Fs (t) = 1 − e−ωs t , then the probability of staying is


                                                   !!                           
                                                                            y0
                                              y0              −ωs log
                           Prob δ ≥ log                  = e                yj
                                                                                     = (aj )ωs
                                              yj

     So if the proportion who stay is Sjs then

                                          log (Sjs ) = ωs log (ajs )
 12
    For example, Kennan and Walker (2011) show that attachment to home is an important determinant of internal
migration decisions in the U.S.

5         Quantitative Results
The model can be used to quantify the effects of restrictions on international migration. The main
focus is on the net gains from migration (or the costs of immigration restrictions). The model also
determines the number of migrants, and the real wage effects, for skilled and unskilled labor.
         These quantitative implications depend on parameter values that cannot easily be inferred
from the available data, although the data do provide some guidance. First, the main force driving
migration is the efficiency gain when moving from one country to another. The procedure used to
estimate these gains is described in Section 5.1. Next, given the gross return to migration due to
the efficiency gains, the proportion of people who would actually choose to move depends on the
distribution of migration costs. One way to measure this distribution is described in Section 5.2.
Finally, the supply of potential migrants is estimated using labor force data from standard sources.

5.1        Efficiency Ratios

The efficiency ratio at skill level s in country j is given by

                                                              wsj
                                                     ajs =
                                                              ws0

where wsj is the wage as skill level s in country j and ws0 is the corresponding wage in countries at
the productivity frontier; here this is measured as the wage in Germany. These ratios are estimated
using data from several sources. Data on average wages are available for OECD countries.13 Six of
the new EU countries are not OECD members (Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Lithuania, Malta and
Romania); for these countries, average wages are estimated as income per worker from the Penn
World Table (version 8.1).14 For the case of two skill levels, average wages in country j can be
written as
                                           w̄j = (1 − χj ) w1j + χj w2j

where χj is the proportion of skilled workers; here this is measured as the proportion with post-
                                     w2j
secondary education. Let ξj =        w1j    be the relative wage of skilled workers in country j. Given
estimates of relative wages (which are obtained from de Hoyos et al. (2016)), the efficiency ratios
can be computed as follows. The average wage can be written as

                                       w̄j = (1 − χj ) w1j + χj ξj w1j

Thus
                                      w̄j          (1 − χj ) + χj ξj       w1j

5.2         Migration Costs

Given the efficiency ratios, the simple migration model described in Section 4.8 above can be used
to predict (long-run) migration flows. But in order to do this, it is necessary to specify values for
the home attachment parameters (ωs ) for each type of worker. One way to proceed is to infer these
parameters from data on the proportion of Puerto Ricans who choose to stay in Puerto Rico, even
though the U.S. border is open (to Puerto Ricans), and wages in the U.S. are considerably higher.
The relevant data from the 2000 Census are as follows.


                               Table 2: Wage Ratios and Migration Rates
                                  Migration from Puerto Rico to U.S.
                                 Schooling    Secondary Post-Secondary
                                Wage Ratio       0.52          0.64
                               Migration Rate    0.40          0.30
                                     ω           0.79          0.82
                                     N          718,559      445,435


         The average moving cost is the reciprocal of ω. It is well known from the empirical literature
that migration rates are higher for people with more education,15 but at least in the case of Puerto
Rico, it is also true that the incentive to migrate is higher at higher education levels. The Puerto
Rican data indicate that, as a first approximation, it is reasonable to assume that the distribution
of migration costs does not differ across education levels, and the baseline estimates below assume
that ωs = .8 for both skilled and unskilled workers. Of course, the cost of migrating from Poland
to Germany may be quite different from the cost of migrating from Puerto Rico to the U.S., but it
would be very difficult to measure this directly. On the other hand Kennan (2015) presents some
evidence indicating that the costs of internal migration are lower for more skilled workers in the
U.S. Thus it is useful to consider the implications of alternative values for the ωs parameters.

5.3         The Effective Supply of Labor

Given that the proportion of stayers is aω , the average supply of effective labor after migration
(to the most productive location, where the efficiency level is normalized to 1) is aωj × aj y0s +
                                                                              
                                                                                           yjs
    1 − aωj × y0s . Thus the increase in effective labor per person is 1 − aωj (1 − aj )   aj ,   and the

         For example, see Wozniak (2010) and Kennan (2015).

where Njs is the supply of labor at skill level s in country j.

5.4     Net Gains from Migration

Given factor price equalization, average income per worker in country j is yj = aj hj w, where hj is
the human capital of the average worker. Both h and a are measured in efficiency units of labor;
the difference between them is that h is embodied in the worker, while a is embodied in the country.
When a worker of type s moves from j to a frontier country (where a = 1), the (gross) income gain
is

                                           ∆y = (1 − ajs ) y0s
                                                1 − ajs
                                              =         yjs
                                                  ajs

For the average migrant, the net gain is roughly the average of this and zero, if the lowest migration
cost is zero. The proportion of people who do not migrate is aωjss (according to the simple model of
migration decisions described in Section 4.8), so the income gain for the average person (including
nonmigrants) is

                                             2        ajs
     The net gains for each of the 13 countries joining the EU beginning in 2004 are shown in
Figure 7. The net gains from universally open borders estimated in Kennan (2013) were roughly
equivalent to doubling the income of an average worker in the average less developed country. The
magnitudes of the gains from EU expansion shown in Figure 7 are somewhat less impressive, but
they are still very large. For unskilled workers in the poorest countries (Romania and Bulgaria),
the gains are in fact roughly equivalent to doubling average income (meaning that there is a large
and permanent jump in the level of income). At the other extreme, for skilled workers in the more
developed countries, the gains are small. Taking Poland as a fairly representative example, the
gain is roughly 30% of income for unskilled workers, and less than 10% for skilled workers.


5.4.1    Gains from further EU Expansion

It is also of interest to consider the gains associated with possible further expansion of the EU, given
that several additional countries are active candidates for membership. The simplest calculation
assumes that skilled and unskilled workers are perfect substitutes, and infers the efficiency ratio aj

from data on GDP per worker. Illustrative results for the candidate countries using this method are
shown in Figure 8 (with gains for the 13 recent member countries estimated in this way shown for
comparison). The result for Serbia is much like the result for Bulgaria, and the numbers of workers
are also comparable. The estimated gain per worker is relatively small for Turkey (although the
magnitude is still large), but since Turkey has a large population, the total gains would be enormous.
                    Figure 9 shows estimates for other nearby countries, including Syria, meaning pre-war Syria.
In the context of the recent refugee crisis, the results for Syria are rather striking. Even if the
productivity of labor in Syria can be restored to the pre-war level, the gains from admitting Syria
to the EU are estimated at about $10,000 per annum, for the average Syrian worker (where again the
average is taken over all workers, not just those who would migrate). Given the recent devastation
in Syria, this is surely a conservative lower bound for the gains that would result from a policy of
freely admitting Syrian migrants to the EU.

5.5    Real Wage Changes

When labor is treated as a homogeneous factor, the massive increase in the effective supply of labor
on the world market if all borders are open implies a surprisingly small effect on real wages; this
was shown in Kennan (2013). But when skilled and unskilled workers are imperfect substitutes,
the real wage effects may be considerably larger for unskilled workers. Moreover, the aim here is to
consider these effects in the EU context. The factor price equalization theorem assumes free trade,
and this assumption is much more realistic for the EU than for the world economy as a whole. It
is surely not realistic to treat the EU as a small open economy that takes product prices on the
world market as given. At the other extreme, it is also unrealistic to assume that the EU is a closed
economy that does not trade with the rest of the world, but this assumption will nevertheless be
maintained here, on the grounds that it yields a relatively clean “worst case” analysis of real wage
effects.
    In order to apply these results, it is necessary to have estimates of the coefficients αi . Under the
assumption that the production technology is Cobb-Douglas, and that it is the same across coun-
tries, these coefficients are equal to the factor shares (which should be the same for all countries).
The estimates shown in Table 3 were obtained using data for Germany for the year 2005.

    The results for real wage changes due to migration are shown in Table 4. In the homogeneous
labor case, doubling the labor endowment had a relatively small effect on the real wage. But the

unskilled labor share is small, and this means that almost all of the change in the unskilled labor
endowment passes through to the real wage. The estimated change in the endowment is that it
increases by about 15%, and the real wage then falls by about 6%. On the other hand, there is very
little change in the real wage of skilled labor. The ratio of skilled labor to capital falls substantially,
but this is largely offset by the increase in the ratio of unskilled to skilled labor16

5.5.1       Sensitivity of Real Wage Changes to Elasticities of Substitution

The above calculations are based on unit elasticities of substitution. The standard view is that the
elasticity of substitution across skill groups is a good deal higher than unity (see Katz and Murphy
(1992), Ottaviano and Peri (2012), Card (2012), and di Giovanni et al. (2014)). Computing the
effects for the CES case requires more work – it is necessary to solve the equilibrium equations
numerically. The point is that a higher elasticity means that unskilled workers would gain less from
an increase in the skilled labor endowment.
       If preferences are symmetric over goods, the unskilled real wage is given by

   The real wage effects are not very sensitive to deviations from the benchmark Cobb-Douglas
technology. As the elasticity of substitution between capital and the labor composite (σ) increases,
the real wages effects are diminished for both skill levels. As the elasticity of substitution between
skilled and unskilled labor (ζ) increases, the real wages effects are more favorable for unskilled
workers, at the expense of skilled workers.



                                                                25
6         Conclusion
In Kennan (2013) it was shown that the potential gains from open borders are very large: if all of
the developed countries dropped all legal restrictions on immigration, the gains would be roughly
comparable to a doubling of the income of the average person in a less developed country. The
European Union has actually implemented an open borders regime, and the expansion of the EU
to include many large countries with relatively low wages provides some evidence on the extent to
which these gains are actually realized. Here the potential gains are quantified country by country,
for the countries which actually joined the EU since 2004, and also for countries that are candidates
for membership, as well as other countries in the neighborhood. The estimated gains are shown in
Figures 8 and 9. In the case of unskilled workers in Poland, for example, the estimated average gain
is about 30% of income, or about $7, 000 per worker per year; this is net of migration costs, and
the average is taken over all Polish workers (the average gain for the people who actually migrate
is much higher). Although these gains are certainly substantial, they are not as large as the gains
reported in Kennan (2013), simply because the measured labor productivity differences are not on
the same scale as the difference between productivity levels in countries like India, compared with
countries like the U.S.
         These estimates are based on a model in which free trade in product markets implies factor
price equalization, with the important qualification that although real wages are equalized across
countries even when labor is immobile, this applies to wages measured in efficiency units; actual
wage measures reflect cross-country differences in the productivity of labor. Removing restrictions
on labor mobility affects equilibrium real wages to the extent that workers move to countries where
they are more productive, thereby reducing capital-labor ratios. The model is used to quantify the
real wage effects associated with increased labor mobility due to expansion of the European Union.
Even though the predicted migration flows are large in relation to the number of workers in the
sending countries, the estimated real wage effects are surprisingly small, even under the assumption
that capital is held constant. More generally, a reduction in the capital-labor ratio that causes a
fall in the real wage, also causes an increase in the return to investment in capital; these are in fact
two sides of the same coin.17 Thus in the long run (assuming a constant returns technology) even
large migration flows do not depress real wages. Political opposition to free migration of labor is
based to some extent on the prediction that immigration depresses real wages in the host country.
The analysis in this paper is based on a model that determines real wages in general equilibrium (as
opposed to a model in which changes in the quantity of labor supplied merely generate movements
along a marginal product curve for a single good). Any credible prediction regarding the long-run
effects of immigration on real wages requires a fully specified theory of how wages are determined
in general equilibrium. The theory in this paper, when used to quantify the long-run real wage
    17
    It is also important to recognize that removing restrictions on international labor mobility is likely to increase
the return to investment in human capital, implying that the long-run gains are likely to be considerably higher than
the gains estimated in this paper, which takes the distribution of skills as given.

effects of immigration, provides no support for the idea that immigration depresses real wages.


Appendix: Uniqueness
The proof of uniqueness involves the following steps, each of which is quite straightforward.
  1. Every solution of the market-clearing equations is associated with a competitive equilibrium.

  2. Every competitive equilibrium is Pareto optimal.

  3. Every Pareto optimal allocation maximizes the utility of a consumer who owns everything.

  4. If two allocations are Pareto optimal, they must have the same total output vector, because
     preferences are strictly convex.

  5. The production function for each good is strictly quasiconcave.

  6. If two Pareto optimal production plans yield the same output, they must use the same input
     vectors.
These steps are discussed in turn.
  1. Suppose that x solves the market-clearing equations (4). Normalize the price of capital so
     that v = 1, and set wages as

   2. This step is just the first welfare theorem.18

   3. Given that preferences are homothetic, and identical for all agents, the competitive equilib-
       rium must maximize the utility of a consumer who has these preferences and owns everything.
       In any competitive equilibrium, by homotheticity, there is a number β i for each consumer i
       such that the individual consumption plans are given by

                                                           qi = β iQ

       where Q is the equilibrium aggregate output vector. The utility function representing a
       homothetic preference ordering can be chosen so that it is linear homogeneous, implying that
                                                       
                                                    u q i = β i u (Q)
                    
       Then if u Q̂ > u (Q) for some feasible aggregate output vector Q̂, and if this output is
       divided over consumers so that q̂ i = β i Q̂, then
                                                                      
                                                  u q̂ i     = β i u Q̂
                                                                     
                                                             > u qi

       which gives a contradiction. Therefore if Q is the aggregate output vector in a competitive
       equilibrium, then u (Q) is maximal over the set of feasible output vectors.

   4. From step 3, any Pareto optimal allocation maximizes the utility function over the set of
       feasible aggregate consumption plans, and since the feasible set is convex and the utility
       function is strictly quasiconcave, there is a unique utility-maximizing consumption vector.

   5. Any constant-returns CES production function with a nonnegative and finite elasticity of
       substitution is concave and strictly quasiconcave. Suppose f : Rn → Rk and g : Rm → R`
       are strictly quasiconcave functions, and suppose h : Rk+` → R is a strictly increasing and
       strictly quasiconcave function, and let H (x, y) = h (f (x) , g (y)) for x ∈ Rn and y ∈ Rm . The
                                                                                                                   
       question is whether H is strictly quasiconcave. Take two distinct points (xa , y a ) and xb , y b
                                                                                                   
       in Rn × Rm , with X a = f (xa ) and X b = f xb , and Y a = g (y a ) and Y b = g y b . Let x̄ =
       δxa + (1 − δ) xb and ȳ = δy a + (1 − δ) y b and X̄ = δX a + (1 − δ) X b and Ȳ = δY a + (1 − δ) Y b ,
                                                                      
       with δ ∈ (0, 1). First suppose (X a , Y a ) 6= X b , Y b . Then since h is strictly quasiconcave,
  18
     The proof can be recited so as to emphasize that this step is elementary. If there is an alternative allocation
that is a Pareto improvement, the value of aggregate consumption at the equilibrium prices is strictly larger in this
alternative allocation (someone is doing strictly better, so the value of this person’s consumption bundle must be
strictly greater, or it would have been chosen before; and no one is doing worse, and if they could have achieved this
by spending less money, then local nonsatiation implies that they could have done better). The value of consumption
is the value of net production plus the value of the endowment. But the value of net production can’t be higher in the
alternative plan, because if it were, some producer was not maximizing profit. And since the value of the endowment
is unchanged, this gives a contradiction.

  6. If two Pareto optimal production plans yield the same output vector, then any convex combi-
     nation of these plans is also feasible, and yields at least as much output of each good; and if
     the two plans involve distinct input vectors for some product, the convex combination yields
     a strictly greater quantity of this product, since the production function for each good is
     strictly quasiconcave (by step 4).
