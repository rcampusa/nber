Even though some countries track students into differing-ability schools by age 10, others keep their

entire secondary-school system comprehensive. To estimate the effects of such institutional

differences in the face of country heterogeneity, we employ an international differences-in-

differences approach. We identify tracking effects by comparing differences in outcome between

primary and secondary school across tracked and non-tracked systems. Six international student

assessments provide eight pairs of achievement contrasts for between 18 and 26 cross-country

comparisons. The results suggest that early tracking increases educational inequality. While less

clear, there is also a tendency for early tracking to reduce mean performance. Therefore, there does

not appear to be any equity-efficiency trade-off.

1. Introduction

        Many countries worry about the relative merits of a selective versus comprehensive

school system, and the resulting system choices are surprisingly different. Some countries

track students into differing-ability schools as early as at age 10 (e.g., Austria, Germany,

Hungary, and the Slovak Republic). By contrast, others including Canada, Japan, Norway,

Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States essentially keep their entire lower

secondary school system comprehensive. Parents and politicians alike would like to know

whether it has consequences for the equity and efficiency of educational outcomes if a

country tracks its students into different school types, hierarchically structured by

performance. Such macro issues of institutional structure are extraordinarily difficult to

evaluate within individual countries, largely because the variations in structure that exist there

are almost certainly related to the characteristics of the families and schools choosing to

follow an anomalous pattern. To deal with these analytical complexities, we provide evidence

from international experiences across countries.

        The arguments about school placement policies – variously called tracking, streaming,

or ability grouping – often rest on a perceived trade-off between equity and efficiency.1 Some

discussions of tracking are mainly concerned with placements between different types of

schools and others with placements into different tracks within schools, but the arguments for

and against tracking are basically the same.2 The central argument behind tracking is that

homogeneous classrooms permit a focused curriculum and appropriately paced instruction

that leads to the maximum learning by all students. In such a situation, the teacher does not



1   It appears that the costs of tracked and untracked systems are roughly comparable. Therefore, although we
do not perform any direct efficiency calculations, we often refer to variations in outcomes in the loose manner of
efficiency differences.
2   See the papers on “comprehensive and selective schooling” collected in Heath (1984) for examples of the
UK-based discussion of streaming between schools and Slavin (1990) for an example of the US-based
discussion of ability grouping within schools.


                                                        1
have to worry about boring the fastest learners or losing the slowest learners. The arguments

for ungrouped classrooms largely revolve around concerns that the lower groups will be

systematically disadvantaged by slower learning environments that leave them far behind the

skills of those in the upper groups. The argument frequently goes further to relate preparation

on entry into school to socio-economic background of the students, implying that grouping

will also lead to continuing bias against more disadvantaged students.

        The argument in favor of or against tracking gets even more complicated once

possible peer effects are taken into account, because the precise nature of any interactions

then becomes a key element in considering tracking. Proponents of ungrouped classrooms

often suggest that heterogeneous classrooms might give rise to efficiency gains through

nonlinear peer effects: the higher ability students lose nothing, but the lower ability students

gain through the interaction (from motivation, better classroom discussion, and the like). By

contrast, if the impact of peer achievement is linear, tracking would tend to increase the

variance in outcomes without having any clear impact on the level of achievement (e.g.,

Argys et al. 1996). And if individuals are better off with peers of their own ability level,

tracking could even improve the level of performance while possibly also reducing inequality

(e.g., Dobbelsteen et al. 2002).3 Thus, theory suggests considerable uncertainty about the

impact of tracking on both the level and distribution of schooling outcomes.4

        So far, the empirical literature attempting to sort out the effects of tracking on both the

level and distribution of outcomes has followed two general strategies. The difficulty for any

empirical research is that the major elements of the institutional structure of schools are

choices whose impact is difficult to separate from other influences on achievement. When


3 Lazear (2001) provides an alternative model of possible externalities within classrooms that lead to nonlinear
effects of peer composition on student outcomes, which also generally implies efficiency improvements through
grouping.
4  For recent advanced theoretical treatments of the effects of tracking, see Brunello and Giannini (2004);
Epple et al. (2002); and Meier (2004).


                                                       2
some schools or local education authorities introduce alternative structures, these choices are

likely to be linked to other features of the students and schools if for no other reason than

parental choices of residence and schools. Thus, the first empirical approach, which focuses

on tracking within schools, attempts to standardize for heterogeneity across institutional

structures through statistical analyses of measured factors (see Argys et al. 1996; Betts and

Skolnick 2000; Betts et al. 2003; Figlio and Page 2002).5

        Alternatively, if operating at the level of nations or states, the lack of within-state

variation eliminates any control group unless there is variation over time. Thus, the second

empirical approach, which focuses on tracking between different types of schools, looks

within countries for situations where the institutional structure is altered and with some

embellishments compares outcomes before and after.6 The results of the different empirical

analyses, while far from uniform, tend to suggest that tracking leads to more inequality in

outcomes, particularly from the perspective of family backgrounds (but see Figlio and Page

2002 for an opposite finding).

        The concern with both empirical approaches is that other unmeasured factors bias the

estimated impacts of tracking. For example, with the trend analyses, the change in tracking

structure is frequently just one of a series of changes to the schools. While these studies also

include a variety of controls for other observable factors, it is hard to assess whether they

sufficiently capture the concomitant factors that might affect student outcomes over time. The

statistical analyses of tracking that employ both national and local samples for U.S. schools

face complications of family residential choice plus generally sparse controls for family,



5   The direct analyses of tracking are also supplemented by investigations of peer achievement effects. Early
peer investigations were not very concerned about problems of omitted variables and simultaneity (i.e., the
“reflection problem”). More recent peer studies have concentrated on those issues (Hanushek et al. 2003; Hoxby
2000). Nonetheless, the importance of peer ability remains disputed.

Rueda and Vignoles (2004); Harmon and Walker (2000); and Meghir and Palme (2004).

teacher, and school differences – elements that are likely both to affect achievement and to be

related to the institutional structure of classrooms.

       To address these empirical problems, we use the macro variation in both the

institutional structure of between-school tracking and student performance that exists across

countries to sort out the impacts of tracking. Of course many other things also differ by

country, leading us to adopt a differences-in-differences strategy to parse the effects of

tracking. In this, we compare the level and distribution of performance of younger students

(before tracking is introduced in any country) with those of older students (after some

countries have started tracking) across countries with and without tracking, effectively using

early outcomes in each country as the control. The existence of several large international

assessment programs permits a consistent evaluation of student performance across a wide

range of countries.

       Our analysis provides reasonably strong support for the disequalizing effects of early

tracking. Variation in performance, measured in a variety of ways, tends to increase across

levels of schooling when a country employs early tracking. On the other hand, the evidence

about possible efficiency gains from tracking is more mixed.

       The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the empirical

identification strategy in detail. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 presents the results on

the impact of tracking on educational inequality, mean performance, and gainers and losers in

the performance distribution. Section 5 concludes.



2. Cross-Country Identification

       Understanding the impacts of macro institutional factors requires observing instances

both of use of the structure and nonuse. In the case of between-school tracking, with the rare

exception of when a country changes policies, the institution is common to all of the schools,


                                                 4
implying that variation within countries is not useful.7 At the same time, international

comparisons face monumental problems because of the heterogeneity of nations. Quite

obviously, finance and operations of school systems as well as social structure, family

backgrounds, and a host of other, often unobserved factors besides tracking affect the

observed outcomes.

        Consider a simple model:

        (1)                              Aigc = α c + γTigc + X igc β + ε igc

where individual achievement of student i in grade g and country c ( Aigc ) is determined by a

country specific intercept (α), varying attributes of families and schools (X), the existence of

tracking (T), and an error (ε). In principle, if we could measure the various inputs to

achievement, we could directly estimate equation (1). Two problems exist, however. First, we

do not have sufficient knowledge or data to be confident of any estimates of the β (see

Hanushek 2003). Second, with respect to the influences of tracking, if every student in the

country is subject to tracking, T will be a constant, and we cannot estimate its influence on

achievement.

        In reality, no country tracks students between differing-ability schools in the early

primary grades. Thus, we can consider looking at the changes that occur between primary

school (grade g) and later schooling (grade g*). A simple estimate of the impact of tracking

could be found by looking at the average difference in achievement between g and g* for a

country that introduced tracking during that period:

        (2)
                                              c
                                                        (
                                          ∆A = γ + ∆X β + ∆ε
                                                                c        c
                                                                             )

7   In the US, the use of magnet schools with specialized curriculum does vary across cities. These programs
have not been evaluated very thoroughly, and both their existence and the selection rules for students is often
closely related to their use as a device for the racial desegregation of schools.


                                                            5
In principle, if none of the X’s changed much and if the change in average errors had an

expected value of zero, we could estimate the impact of tracking (γ) simply by observing the

growth in achievement over time for a single country.

       It is nonetheless implausible to believe that all systematic influences across grades and

across different tests are irrelevant to achievement. Specifically, the normal pattern of

achievement gains between g and g* would be intertwined with the impact of tracking. To

deal with this, we can compare the growth in achievement across tracked countries and

untracked countries, where the countries without tracking indicate the expected achievement

gain in the absence of tracking:

       (3)                                                 (
                          γ = ∆A tracked − ∆A untracked + ν tracked − ν untracked   )
The impact of tracking can then be estimated by comparing the average achievement gain in

tracked countries to that in untracked countries (where the double bar indicates averages

across the groups of countries).

       The estimation still depends upon the expected composite errors (ν) being

uncorrelated with the existence of tracking. This would be violated if, for example, the

observed tests came from widely different cohorts of students such that the X’s were to

change (and to be correlated across countries with the existence of tracking), or if tracked

nations tended to introduce more changes in their schools between the testing of students in

different grades. We return to this below.

       In reality, we estimate equation (3) in a regression framework where mean

performance in grade g* is regressed on mean performance in grade g along with an indicator

for the existence of tracking. Thus, our approach applies a differences-in-differences

methodology to the cross-country comparisons, combining tests in primary school with tests

in secondary school. The effect of tracking is identified by comparing performance

differences between primary and secondary school across tracked and non-tracked systems,


                                                     6
where each country’s own primary-school outcome is used as a control for its secondary-

school outcome.

        We also estimate a similar equation for inequality in performance. The simplest model

is one where the variation in outcomes within countries are magnified (or shrunk) by the use

of tracking. Again, the most basic model is a regression of late variance on early variance plus

an indicator for tracking.



3. School Performance Data

        International testing of students began in the early 1960s when the International

Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) developed a mathematics

test that could be used to compare student performance across countries. Although the earliest

testing was plagued by uncertainties about the within-country sampling, the selectivity of

students who were not in school, and a variety of other factors, more recent testing has

followed strict protocols with elaborate efforts to ensure both high quality test designs and

representative sampling of students.

        To implement the differences-in-differences estimation, we concentrate on the series

of international assessments conducted since 1995. We match international student

achievement tests in secondary school with tests late in primary school. Because the

methodology requires a stable educational system, we concentrate on roughly

contemporaneous measures of performance at the two different grade levels.8 We supplement

the six different test observations that meet this requirement, however, by following the 1995

cohort of 4th grade students that subsequently was assessed in the 8th grade in 1999 (on the



8 Comparing different cohorts at one point in time minimizes any contamination of variations in other school
policies, but it does so at the cost of any inherent variation in family background and peers that exists across
different cohorts. Although we also follow a single cohort (see below), we emphasize comparisons at a given
time because we believe that school policies tend to be more volatile than family backgrounds of cohorts.


                                                        7
TIMSS math and science tests). Table 1 summarizes the comparisons that are used, and the

data and sources are described in detail in the Appendix.

       Tests are found in reading, mathematics, and science. Each assessment produces 18 to

26 country level observations. For analytical purposes, the differences in the tests and

subjects lead us to treat each of the eight assessment pairs as a separate test of the impacts of

early tracking, although the common grouping of countries implies that these are not truly

independent tests.

       In our analyses, we use the data on age of first tracking as a dummy representing

whether an education systems tracks its students before the age at which the specific

secondary-school test is performed or not. For the PISA secondary-school tests, we consider

tracking by age 15 (the average student age on the two PISA tests is 15 years and 9 months);

for the TIMSS secondary-school tests, we consider tracking by age 14 at the latest

(corresponding to an average testing age of 14 years and 5 months). Half the countries in our

samples based on the PISA tests had a tracked system by the age of 15. The share of countries

that tracked by the age of 14 in the TIMSS tests is roughly one third (see Appendix Table

A2), reflecting both the earlier testing age and the different country compositions of the

samples.



4. Impacts of Early Tracking

       Because of the importance attached to inequality in the existing literature, we begin

with an analysis of distributional aspects of tracking. This is followed by implications for

mean performance.

4.1 Tracking and Inequality

       The nature of the international comparisons and the relationship with tracking is

easiest to see in the data on inequality for the most recent comparison: reading performance

on the 2003 administration of the PISA test for 15 year olds compared to the 2001

administration of the PIRLS test for 4th graders. Figure 1 plots the relative standard deviation

of scores for countries with early tracking (solid lines) versus countries without early tracking

(dashed lines).9

       Relative inequality increases in every country with tracking except the Slovak

Republic, while relative inequality decreases in every country without tracking except for

Sweden and Latvia. Out of the 18 countries, the top four countries in terms of the increase in

inequality between primary and secondary school are all early trackers (Germany with an

increase of 0.71, Greece 0.30, Czech Republic 0.25, and Italy 0.22). The bottom six countries

with the largest decrease in inequality are all late trackers that do not track before the age of

PISA testing (Turkey -0.63, New Zealand -0.50, Canada -0.32, United States -0.27, Norway -

0.14, and Hong Kong -0.13).

       The regression analysis expands this to consider different measures of inequality: the

standard deviation of test scores within each country; the test-score difference between the

student performing at the 75th percentile and the student performing at the 25th percentile in

each country; and the performance difference between the 95th and the 5th percentile. We also

provide a comparison with estimation of a simple model of average achievement that, along

the lines of equation (1), compares mean performance of the 15 year olds just to tracking.

       As the results reported in columns (1), (3), and (5) of Table 2 show, none of the three

inequality measures is statistically significantly related to tracking in a simple bivariate

analysis. However, as argued in Section 2, these bivariate estimates may be biased by general

heterogeneity in inequality of the participating countries. Thus, columns (2), (4), and (6)

report differences-in-differences estimates of the effect of early tracking on the three

inequality measures which condition on the extent of educational inequality already present in

late primary school, before tracking in any country. With all three measures of inequality, it is

obvious that countries that exert high inequality already in primary school also tend to have

high inequality in secondary school. The point estimates of roughly 0.6 indicate that schools

everywhere tend to reduce the inequality which was present in primary grades – and which

presumably represents the proportionately greater influence of families.

         More importantly, on all three measures of inequality, countries that track their

students before age 15 show a statistically significantly larger inequality on the PISA 2003

secondary-school test, once the difference in inequality that existed already in primary school

is accounted for. Specifically, early trackers show a national standard deviation of test scores

in secondary school that is one quarter of a cross-country standard deviation larger than non-

trackers. Consider for example the observed country differences in outcome variation. The

minimum national standard deviation of 3.5 (Hong Kong and the Netherlands) is noticeably

different from the maximum national standard deviation of 4.5 (Germany) on the PISA 2003

test. The results suggest that the effect of early tracking can account for one quarter of the

difference in inequality between the most inequitable and the most equitable country.

         Figure 1 makes apparent why simple bivariate estimates do not reveal this pattern:

None of the five countries with the largest inequality in primary school (New Zealand,

Turkey, United States, Norway, and Iceland) have early tracking of students. Across the

countries, the correlation between the national standard deviation in primary school and the

early-tracking dummy is -0.472 (statistically significant at the 5 percent level).




9   Standard deviations are expressed relative to the average national standard deviation on each test.


                                                        10
        The estimates across the other seven pairs of international achievement tests are

generally consistent with the results in Table 2 but are not as strong or statistically significant.

Table 3 reports the differences-in-differences results using the standard deviation as the

inequality measure.10 With the exception of the PISA 2000/02-PIRLS pair, all estimates of the

coefficient on early tracking are positive, and four are statistically significant at the 10 percent

level or better. For the insignificant results of columns (11)-(13), inequality in secondary

school is not even statistically significantly related to inequality in primary school, raising

some concerns about the specific tests.

        The limited samples of countries preclude very elaborate specification checks, but

some extensions are interesting. First, rather than entering the tracking variable as a dummy,

we can also enter tracking as a linear variable depicting the age at which a country first tracks

its students. Unfortunately, the continuous variation in when the tracking occurs is limited,

with no country starting to track at the age of 13, for example. Results using the linear

tracking variable (available from the authors) are broadly consistent with results using the

simple existence of tracking, and the main impact comes from the mere existence of early

tracking with no consistent linear pattern detectable for the age at which tracking occurred.

        Additionally, experimentation with adding further control variables to the estimation

did not change the basic results. In terms of the estimates of Table 2, adding GDP per capita

and/or a country’s cumulative educational expenditure per student by age 15 left the impact of

tracking largely unchanged.11




10  Given the consistency across measures of inequality, we report only the results for standard deviations. The
results for the other two measures were qualitatively very similar.
11  OECD (2004) reports GDP per capita (in purchasing power parities) for 15 of the 18 countries. When
included, it enters statistically significantly positive, while the tracking dummy also remains statistically
significantly positive. The expenditure measure (again in purchasing power parities) is available for 13 countries
but does not enter significantly, although the significance level of the tracking dummy falls to 15 percent.

4.2 Tracking and Mean Performance


          Given that comprehensive schooling systems seem to reduce inequality, the question

arises whether this effect is achieved by improving the lowest performers or by holding back

the best performers. That is, does performance converge at a lower or higher level? We first

estimate the effect of tracking on a country’s mean performance level using the same

differences-in-differences identification strategy as before; following that, we estimate the

effects at different percentiles of student performance in the next section.

          Table 4 reports the results on the effect of early tracking on mean performance for all

8 pairs of international student achievement tests. In all pairs, we see a clear tendency for

countries which performed better on average in primary school to also perform better in

secondary school.

          The impact of early tracking is, however, inconsistent across subjects and tests. The

two reading comparisons indicate a statistically significant lower achievement associated with

early tracking. Similarly, the mathematics results are always lower with early tracking,

although the result is statistically significant at the 10 percent level or better in only one of the

three comparisons. For science, however, two of the three estimates indicate positive

achievement effects from early tracking (and one is statistically significant at the 5 percent

level).

          As an alternative approach, we allow for the possible correlation of the residuals of the

inequality and the mean-performance equations. In order to improve the estimation efficiency,

we estimate the two equations by seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR). The results in

Appendix Table A3 reveal no change in any of the substantive previous results, only lifting

the significance level of the effect of early tracking on inequality in the TIMSS 2003 science

test.

4.3 Who Gains, Who Loses?


       One final issue is where any losses (or gains) from early tracking are found in the

distribution. To address this, we estimate the effect of early tracking on the performance of

students at different percentiles of the performance distribution, again in differences-in-

differences models. Specifically, we estimate whether a student at the 5th percentile (or 25th,

75th, and 95th percentiles) of the national distribution is affected by tracking. Although effects

cannot be statistically significantly estimated in most pairs of international achievement tests,

where they can, they reinforce the results in Tables 2-4.

       For example, the increased inequality and decreased mean performance in tracked

systems detected in the PISA 2003-PIRLS pair come from the lower percentiles losing more

than the upper ones, even though each of the four percentiles loses a statistically significant

amount. The coefficient estimates on the early-tracking dummy for the different achievement

levels are depicted in Figure 2, which shows that lower performers suffer more from early

tracking than higher ones.

       Across the estimates from the remaining samples (available from the authors), the

most striking finding is that in no case do some students gain at the expense of others; both

high and low achievers lose (or, in the one case of a positive effect on mean performance,

gain) from tracking. The net impact comes from the differential impacts on different parts of

the distribution.



5. Conclusion

       This analysis provides preliminary results about the impact of early tracking on the

level and distribution student performance. The results consistently indicate that early

tracking increases inequality in achievement. Although the evidence on the level of

performance is less certain, there is very little evidence that there are efficiency gains

associated with this increased inequality.

       On the research side, these preliminary results also suggest the value of further study

of tracking. Some of the literature has suggested that one channel for increasing inequality is

reinforcing the effects of family background. Specifically, if much of the early inequality in

achievement is associated with differences in family background, many of the track

placements will be associated directly with family background. Indeed, some have suggested

that family background is a driving force in setting track placements even beyond its impact

on early achievement levels (e.g., Schnepf 2003). The implications for family background

inequality can potentially be investigated through use of the micro data generated by the

international assessments. Beyond that, with the micro data it would be possible to consider

more fully the underlying structural model of achievement that would generate these patterns

of aggregate outcomes. Also, extending the dichotomous analysis between tracked and non-

tracked systems pursued in this paper, there may be heterogeneity in the rigidity of tracked

systems. Future research may explore the extent to which allowing mobility across tracks

might reduce the negative effects of tracking.

       From a policy perspective, it seems incumbent on those advocating early tracking in

schools to identify the potential gains from this. These preliminary results suggest that

countries lose in terms of the distribution of outcomes, and possibly also in levels of

outcomes, by pursuing such policies.




                                                 14
Appendix: Data Sources and Description
       The most recent international test employed is the 2003 edition (data release: December 2004)
of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), conducted by the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).12 PISA tested representative samples of 15-year-
old students in reading, math, and science, with a focus of test items on real-life applications. A recent
primary-school test to which the PISA test can be matched is the Progress in International Reading
Literacy Study (PIRLS). In 2001, the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational
Achievement (IEA) conducted the PIRLS reading test to 4th-grade students,13 which is the grade just
before the first countries start tracking their schools. There are 18 countries that participated both in
PISA 2003 and in PIRLS. Appendix Table A1 provides a list of countries participating in each pair of
tests.

       Since the mid-1990s, there are seven further international student achievement tests at the end of
lower secondary education to which we can match specific primary-school tests, all of which tested
representative samples of students in each participating countries (see Table 1). The first PISA study,
also testing 15-year-olds in reading, math, and science, was conducted in 2000 for most participating
countries and in 2002 for several additional countries. We match the PISA 2000/02 test again with the
2001 PIRLS primary-school test, which gives a sample of 20 countries participating in both tests.
Next, the IEA performed the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS, later re-
named to Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) in 1995, which tested both 4th-grade
and 8th-grade students in math and science.14 Matching the TIMSS 1995 tests in primary and
secondary school, there are 26 countries participating both in the two math tests and in the two science
tests. The next primary-school TIMSS tests were conducted in 2003, which we can match to the
TIMSS 2003 secondary-school tests, yielding a sample of 25 countries participating in primary and
secondary school both in math and in science.

       All these matches test primary- and secondary-school students at exactly or roughly the same
point in time. We can also follow specific cohorts of students over time. This is possible by relating the
8th-grade performance on the TIMSS tests in 1999 to the 4th-grade performance on the TIMSS tests in
1995. That is, the very same cohort which was tested in math and science in 4th grade in 1995 was
again tested in 8th grade in 1999. 18 countries participated both in the 1995 4th-grade and in the 1999
8th-grade math and science tests, allowing for matching of representative samples from the same cohort
followed over time.

       We take the data on means, standard deviations, and percentiles of the test-score performance on
the different international tests from the following sources: OECD (2003; 2004) for reading
performance in PISA 2000/2002 and PISA 2003; Mullis et al. (2003) for reading performance in
PIRLS; Beaton et al. (1996a; 1996b) for secondary-school math and science performance in TIMSS
1995; Mullis et al. (1997; 2000; 2004) for math performance in TIMSS 1995 primary school, TIMSS
1999 and TIMSS 2003; and Martin et al. (1997; 2000; 2004) for science performance in TIMSS 1995
primary school, TIMSS 1999 and TIMSS 2003.


12  TIMSS assessments for 2003 were also released in December 2004, but we start with the PISA 2003 test
because it tests students who are older and thus longer exposed to tracking than the students tested in the TIMSS
tests and because it has a broader coverage of developed countries.
13 Specifically, PIRLS tested the upper of the two adjacent grades with the largest share of nine-year-olds in
each country, which is usually fourth grade.
14 Specifically, the different TIMSS tests tested the upper of the two adjacent grades with the largest share of 9-
year-olds (4th grade) and 13-year-olds (8th grade), respectively, in each country. The first TIMSS test also tested
the lower of each of these grades (3rd and 7th grade), but we stick with 4th and 8th grade because 4th grade is just
before the first countries start tracking their schools and 8th grade allows more time for tracking to exert its
effects.

       For the purposes of this paper, we re-scale the test scores of each primary-secondary pair of tests
so that they are normalized to have a mean of zero and a cross-country standard deviation of one
between the countries jointly participating at both test levels. Note that this normalization refers to the
cross-country variation of test scores among the sample of participating countries only, without
considering possible differences in the within-country variation of test scores between the primary- and
secondary-school tests. Thus, for example, the mean of the standard deviation of test scores within
each country is considerably larger in the PISA 2003 test than in the PIRLS test, at 4.0 versus 2.9
cross-country standard variations on each of the tests, respectively. That is, in PISA 2003, the standard
deviation of test scores within a country was, on average, four times as large as the standard deviation
of test scores across the 18 countries.

        We collected data on the age at which students are tracked into different schools for the first
time in each country from different sources, including the data collections of the European
Commission (2000; 2002), the Encyclopedia of national education systems of Postlethwaite (1996), a
table in OECD (2003), and detailed country-specific inquiries. The mean age of students at the time of
first tracking across the 45 countries considered in this paper is 15.2, ranging from a minimum of 10 to
a maximum of 18.

      Descriptive statistics for the eight pairs of international tests are presented in Appendix Table
A2.
