                                          ABSTRACT

We develop a heterogeneous-agents network-based model to analyze alternative policies during a
pandemic outbreak, accounting for health and economic trade-offs within the same empirical
framework. We leverage a variety of data sources, including data on individuals' mobility and
encounters across metropolitan areas, health records, and measures of the possibility to be
productively working from home. This combination of data sources allows us to build a
framework in which the severity of a disease outbreak varies across locations and industries, and
across individuals who differ by age, occupation, and preexisting health conditions.

We use this framework to analyze the impact of different social distancing policies in the context
of the COVID-19 outbreaks across US metropolitan areas. Our results highlight how outcomes
vary across areas in relation to the underlying heterogeneity in population density, social network
structures, population health, and employment characteristics. We find that policies by which
individuals who can work from home continue to do so, or in which schools and firms alternate
schedules across different groups of students and employees, can be effective in limiting the
health and healthcare costs of the pandemic outbreak while also reducing employment losses.

      1     Introduction
      1.1     Overview
      Our goal is to compare the effects of different policies during the COVID-19 pandemic ac-
      counting for public health and economic trade-offs within the same empirical framework. The
      multi-dimensional consequences of different policies depend critically on both the mobility
      patterns and the socioeconomic and health structures of a given geographic area. To take this
      into account, we develop a model in which interactions between individuals are governed by
      a contact network, and individuals belong to heterogeneous groups based on location, age,
      industry, and health status.
          Using data on individual mobility based on cell-phones location data, complemented with
      data from the Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamics (FRED) (Grefenstette
      et al., 2013), we capture patterns of movement between different groups. Frequency of close
      encounters and the demographics of these encounters constitute a key mechanism that underlies
      the spread of an infectious disease, as well as its health and healthcare consequences (death,
      hospitalizations, costs). Furthermore, distinct types of economic activity contribute differently
      to the distribution of encounters, and may be more or less replaceable with “work from home”.
          The model links explicitly alternative policies to their impact on the distribution of en-
      counters across different types, as well as on the economic activities in which encounters are
      made. As such, it allows us to measure the health, healthcare, and economic impact of alter-
      native policies accounting for heterogeneity across individuals in behavior, ability to fight the
      infection, and ability to work from home.
          We focus on comparing policies that alter mobility and encounters, such as shelter-in-place
      orders, school closures, industry closures, rotation of workdays or work hours, and isolation
      of frail, high-risk individuals. Our model can also be used to study the importance of policies
      and behavioral changes (e.g., wearing masks) that can lower exposure and infection without
      reducing encounters. In terms of outcomes, for each sequence of policies, and across different
      locations, we measure death, hospitalizations, ICU access, and number of workers who are not
      productive because either sick, quarantined, and/or unable to work from home when requested
      to shelter-in-place.


      1.2     Data
      We combine the following primary sources, which we introduce in details in Section 3: (i) syn-
      thetic populations at the MSA level from Replica and FRED;1 (ii) electronic medical records
      from the COVID-19 Research Database;2 (iii) occupation-level data from the Occupation In-
      formation Network (O∗ NET), combined with the Occupation Employment Statistics (OES)

      and the American Community Survey (ACS); (iv) comorbidity and demographic information
      from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).


      1.3     Results
      Our current findings3 highlight differences between policies across MSAs, as driven by the
      composition of the local population, mobility and encounter patterns, and initial infections
      in the early months of 2020. A cautious reopening of all activities will lead in higher cases,
      with areas where the pandemic outbreak was less severe in early 2020 expected to experience
      a faster growth in infections, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths.
          Policies that lower contact between individuals while trying to limit employment losses can
      be very effective. When focusing on asking individuals who are able to work from home to do
      so, or when alternating school and work schedules to lower density of encounters, we predict
      a significant reduction in cases (up to 40% fewer deaths in Chicago, and 17% fewer deaths in
      New York), while employment losses are contained relative to a regime in which only essential
      activities are open.


      1.4     Related Literature
      Our work is related to an already expansive economics literature analyzing the COVID-19
      pandemic (e.g., Budish, 2020; Baker et al., 2020; Bartik et al., 2020; Mongey et al., 2020;
      Dingel and Neiman, 2020; Fernández-Villaverde and Jones, 2020)). In particular, we add to
      the burgeoning set of papers that look at the effectiveness of different policies to open the
      economy while the crisis is still ongoing (Acemoglu et al., 2020; Baqaee and Farhi, 2019;
      Benzell et al., 2020; Farboodi et al., 2020; Glover et al., 2020; Birge et al., 2020; Loertscher
      and Muir, 2020; Azzimonti et al., 2020). Stock (2020) provides an overview of this literature.
          Much more broadly, our work adds to the vast—and daily growing—interdisciplinary re-
      search on the containment measures for the COVID-19 pandemic, building on multi-agent
      model-based epidemiological work leveraging data on social contacts (Eubank et al., 2004;
      Grefenstette et al., 2013). Related studies in this literature include Eubank et al. (2020);
      McCombs and Kadelka (2020); Prem et al. (2020); Moran et al. (2020); Gatto et al. (2020);
      Soriano-Paños et al. (2020); Will et al. (2020). New articles appear every day. We contribute
      to this work by adding an explicit consideration of the employment effect of different policies,
      also accounting for the extent to which individuals are able to work from home.
          Further, our model considers explicitly the interlinked relationship between (labor) produc-
      tion, health, and healthcare. This follows a classical framework in health economics built upon
      Grossman (1972), and more recently adopted in Aizawa and Fang (2020). In modelling how
      unhealthy individuals need healthcare, and are not productive, we leverage a novel data source

ings from early studies analyzing the properties of Sars-CoV-2, including Novel et al. (2020);
Mizumoto et al. (2020); Verity et al. (2020); Ruan (2020). New papers become available every
day.


2     Model
2.1     Contact Network
We are interested in the diffusion of an infectious disease in a contact network of individuals.
A contact network is a simple graph, consisting of a set of individuals and set of pairs of
individuals who are connected. Only connected nodes can infect each other. An individual is
characterized not only by her network position, but also her age, industry, and health status.
    A social planner can restrict interactions between people and thus impose a different struc-
ture on the contact network. For instance, by closing down schools, a social planner can ensure
that there will be little or no connections left between students. Thus, any policy is effectively
choosing a subset of connections and removing them from the possible networks. The following
stylized example referring to Figure 1 clarifies our approach.

Example 1 Consider the simple stylized network of individuals as shown in Figure 1. Dif-
ferent colors and shapes indicate different types of agents. The green squares are children,
grouped in two schools and the red circles are adults who work in a manufacturing firm. The
three black triangles are adults who work in a tech firm, and the blue diamonds do not work
and are only in contact with their family members.
    Figure 1a is the network in normal (non-pandemic) times. In Figure 1b, both schools
and the firm employing red-circle individuals are closed. The network has now two separate
components, with one household being completely isolated in the top-left corner. Figure 1c is
the network structure when the firm employing black-triangle individuals is also closed. The
network is now divided into four small, isolated components.
    Our framework allows us to consider policies such as “Individuals should work from home
if possible, and schools are closed.” Figure 1d shows the network structure in this situation.
All individuals in the tech firm (black) can work from home. One of the workers in the manu-
facturing firm (red) can also work from home. The network now has more connections than a
total shut down, so there is more expected infection or death. At the same time, however, our
model will predict a much lower drop in productive employment.

   Outcomes generated by a given policy depend crucially on the underlying network structure
and the types of individuals within it. Individuals in our framework are heterogeneous in a
variety of aspects; for instance, their probabilities of symptomatic infection given exposure,
their probabilities of needing ICU treatment, and their probabilities of being able to work

Note: The figure displays a stylized example of a network of heterogeneous individuals grouped in households, schools,
and firms, under different policies, where 1a is the configuration during normal times. Green squares nodes correspond
to children, red circles correspond to workers of a manufacturing firm, black triangles to workers of a tech firm, and
blue diamonds indicate individuals who are not working. In panel 1b red firm and schools are closed, in panel 1c all
firms and schools are closed, and in panel 1d schools are closed and those who can work from home, while others are
allowed to go to work.


       productively from home, and so on. Our framework allows us to study how differences in the
       network structure induced by different policies (such as those in the example above) lead to
       differences in the rate of infection, the death toll, unemployment, and healthcare spending.


       2.2      Empirical Framework
       2.2.1     From Contact Network to Type-based Contact Matrices
       At the scale of a MSA with millions of people, it is often computationally intractable to
       work with the complete contact network when modeling diffusion. As such, we reduce the
       dimensionality of our contact networks by constructing contact matrices and estimate their
       parameters from the observations of individual-level contacts in the full network.4
   4
    The idea of constructing random networks based on contact matrices is based on the inhomogeneous random
graph model studied in Bollobás et al. (2007).


                                                          4
           For a given MSA m, an individual is described by a type θ ∈ Θ. A type describes demo-
       graphic characteristics (e.g., age group), employment characteristics (e.g., industry and ability
       to work from home), and health characteristics (e.g., obesity or diabetes). In our analysis, we
       include approximately |Θ| = 250 distinct types in each MSA.
           Agents of different types and in different locations have different patterns of mobility and
       encounters, leading to a different number of contacts in a given period t, measured in days.
       The diffusion of a virus is then moderated by the empirical contact matrix Cmt . This is a
       square matrix with dimension |Θ|, such that each entry Cmt [θ, θ0 ] is given by the expected
       number of encounters that an agent of type θ has with agents of type θ0 :

                                   Cmt [θ, θ0 ] ≡ E # encounters with type θ0 θ
                                                                               
                                                                                                              (1)

           In principle, an encounter is defined as any interaction in which a contagious person may
       infect a susceptible person. For instance, behaviors cautioned against by public health officials
       during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as sitting within close proximity (e.g. less than 6 feet
       apart), or sharing a confined indoor space, constitute encounters.5

       2.2.2    The Θ-SEIIIRRD Model
       During the epidemic outbreak, an agent of any type can be in one of eight different states,
       each denoted by s ∈ S, E, I A , I N S , I HC , RQ , RN Q , D .6 The different states correspond to
                           

       the following:
         S: susceptible individuals, who can contract the virus if exposed;
        E: exposed individuals, not infectious;
        I A : recently infected and infectious individuals;
      I N S : infectious individuals who will not show symptoms, and will go undetected;7
      I HC : detected and/or symptomatic infectious individuals;
       RQ : recovered and quarantined individuals;
     RN Q : recovered and not quarantined individuals;
        D: deceased individuals.
   5
     A detailed description of how encounters are defined in our model is provided in Section 3. The parameter
regulating disease transmission within our model is calibrated with respect to this. A broader definition—which
yields a higher expected number of interactions in which contagion may occur—corresponds to a lower probability
of contagion upon contact.

     See also http://covid-measures.stanford.edu/ for a similar model developed by Erin Mordecai and coauthors
at Stanford University; our model is more general than the one used in Acemoglu et al. (2020), or similar recent and
forthcoming research.

     See Berger et al. (2020) for a discussion on the modelling choices to capture both probabilistic transitions between
infectious and symptomatic, and the duration within each compartment of the epidemic model.

In a given period, each individual is characterized by a type-state pair (θ, s). We use the
notation Sθmt to indicate the share of individuals of type θ in the susceptible state S in MSA
m in day t, Eθmt to indicate exposed individuals of type θ in MSA m in day t, and similarly
for any other state.
    For any type θ, except for types corresponding to active healthcare workers, given the
contact matrix Cmt , the law-of-motion governing the transitions across the SEIIIRRD states
is the following:

The parameters governing these transitions between states are the following:
βmt : probability of contagion given contact between an infectious individual and a susceptible
      individual in MSA m and day t;
  θ : transition probability (inverse duration) from exposure to infection for type θ individuals;
  τθ : transition probability (inverse duration) from infection to either symptomatic (or de-
       tected) state or never-symptomatic and undetected state;
  ψ: probability that an individual is symptomatic or detected after infection;
γθHC : inverse duration of the infection for individuals who recover from healthcare;
γ N S : inverse duration of the infection for asymptomatic, undetected individuals;
  δθ : probability of death after healthcare for infected, symptomatic type θ individuals;
   η: inverse duration of quarantine period.


                                                      6
Important Note on Parameters:                   The parameters of our model capture a spurious
combination of virological properties, behavioral factors, and modelling choices. We highlight
this explicitly by letting the probability of contagion given contact vary by MSA and day. This
parameter depends on a multitude of factors, which include our exact definition of contact (see
discussion in Section 3), the extent to which individuals adopt protective measures (e.g., use
of masks, gloves, and hand sanitizer or 6 feet distancing), local factors such as weather or
genetic properties of the population. It is essential for the reader to keep this in mind when
interpreting our results: policies, behavior, as well as changes in weather, can alter βmt , thus
affecting the evolution of the infectious disease outbreak. We aim to avoid any confusion when
discussing our findings in Section 4.
    Another important parameter that can be affected by policy or behavior is ψ, which regulates
the probability that an individual is symptomatic or detected after infection. The insurgence of
symptoms can be reduced by behavioral factors such as healthy choices that boost the immune
system (e.g., diet, exercise, no smoking nor alcohol). Perhaps more importantly, detection
can increase following widespread testing and contact-tracing policies. Extended access to tests
increases ψ, while also changing the selection of individuals into I N S and I HC . This ultimately
affects the evolution of the infectious disease and its consequences.

2.2.3    Accounting for Healthcare: The Θ-SEIIIRRDhc Model
We make two modifications to the model to account for healthcare. First, as we will specify
in Section 3 below, we do not only consider death as a relevant epidemic outcome. We also
keep track of hospitalizations, and ICU usage. Different types will have different propensity of
using healthcare services when infected.
    Second, we note that healthcare workers are special types, since they are exposed to ill,
infectious individuals. In many countries, much of the diffusion of Sars-CoV-2 took place in
healthcare facilities. We therefore let HC ⊂ Θ denote healthcare workers; equations (2) and
(3) are replaced by the following:

                                  X                     (IθA0 mt + IθN0 mt
                                                                        S )                      HC
                                                                                           Sθmt Imt
             Ṡθmt = −βSθmt              Cmt [θ, θ0 ]                       − 1{θ∈HC} β HC              (2.hc)

                                                                                              mt
                                                                              |         {z          }
                                                                              exposure in healthcare



                      X                     (IθA0 mt + IθN0 mt
                                                            S )                                HC
                                                                                         Sθmt Imt
    Ėθmt = +βSθmt           Cmt [θ, θ0 ]                       − θ Eθmt + 1{θ∈HC} β HC           .    (3.hc)
                     θ0 ∈Θ
                                                   Nθ0 mt                                HC Active
                                                                                            mt


 These modified equations capture contagion between infectious individuals and healthcare
workers, where HC Active
                  mt     denotes the number of active (non-infectious, alive, healthy) among
HC in m in day t. The probability of contagion is regulated by the parameter β HC <<< βmt ,
a natural assumption since healthcare workers wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

       2.3     Social Distance Policies and Outcomes
       We map a social distancing (and/or closure) policy to a sub-graph of the network of contacts
       between individuals, and to the corresponding modification of the contract matrix. In other
                                                                      φ
       words, if φ is a policy (e.g., schools are closed), we define Cmt to be the modified contact matrix
       under the set of restrictions implied by this policy (e.g., we exclude all contacts that occur at
       schools).8
           The set of possible social distancing policies that may have an impact on the economy
       and on public health can be quite large. For the sake of exposition, we focus our analysis on
       policies that limit the number of contacts between most types of people. Our main analysis
       considers policies that have been frequently proposed or carried out in US states and OECD
       countries during COVID-19. We will assume that specific policies regarding work and school-
       related closures, accompanied by decreases in neighborhood interactions as well. This captures
       both voluntary limitations to social interactions, and policies such as park closures and limited
       capacity at grocery stores. (See Section 3.4 for a detailed description of the policies that we
       consider.)
           We do not require policies to be static over the course of a disease outbreak. Rather,
       we consider a sequence of daily policies φ = (φ1 , φ2 , ..., φT ), where φ1 is the policy in day
       t = 1, followed by φ2 in day t = 2, and so on and so forth until t = T , the last day of
       our analysis. For example, φ could indicate T1 days without any restrictions, followed by T2
       days of shelter-in-place with only essential industries and remote work allowed, followed by
       a sequence of re-opening authorizations. This has been the modal policy sequence in many
       countries affected by the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak.
           Figure 2 summarizes our empirical approach and provides an overview of how we combine
       data from different sources to analyze and compare the downstream effects of various social
       distancing policies. The motivating idea of this approach is that policies that reduce the
       number of contacts between individuals may be effective in mitigating the diffusion of an
       infectious disease. However, the degree to which a given policy is effective depends on the
       particular changes that it induces on the graph of contacts, as well as the parameters that
       govern the transmissibility of the disease, the probability of death upon infection, etc.
           Our approach captures a number of key outcomes that characterize the effectiveness of
       a policy. Under each policy, our Θ-SEIIIRRDhc model allows us to calculate key health
       outcomes—such as the number of infections and deaths—as well as healthcare outcomes—
       such as hospitalizations, healthcare spending etc. In addition, our model allows us to calculate
       key economic outcomes such as the number of individuals who are unable to work (either due
       to regulation or due to illness). Implications for downstream variables such as productivity,
       financial and firm outcomes etc. could also be assessed by future work.
   8
     One limitation of this approach is that we do not capture re-configurations of activities in response to policies in
                                                                                                     φ
this definition, although, in principle, such behavioral responses could be explicitly included in Cmt . For example, if
all schools are closed but playgrounds are not, we could increase the number of contacts in playgrounds in a principled
fashion.

Note: This figure represents an overview of our empirical framework and how it is used to compare alternative policies
along different outcomes. Note that while this figure illustrates how any given policy at a point in time t (e.g., closing
schools on a given day) can be studied in our model, in practice we study the aggregated effects of sequences of different
policies over time (e.g., essential businesses only for 45 days followed by opening of schools). See Section 3.4 for
formal details on the policy sequences we consider.

       3       Data and Estimation
       Our empirical framework is informed by four main blocks of data: (i) data on individual
       characteristics and physical interactions between them to construct a contact network and
       contact matrices, (ii) data on health and healthcare outcomes such as diagnoses, procedures,
       hospitalizations, and comorbidity, (iii) data on the ability of individuals to be productive while
       working from home.


       3.1     Measuring Physical Contacts
       3.1.1    Contact Network and Mobility Data
       Our primary input to construct the contact matrices that represent physical interactions be-
       tween individuals of different types is synthetic population data. A synthetic population is a
       1:1 scale representation of the individuals living in a given MSA, where individuals are assigned
       covariates in a realistic way in order to match census statistics. Importantly, the synthetic
       population captures information on the number of physical interactions between individuals.
           Our baseline analysis for Chicago and Sacramento relies on synthetic populations and
       physical contacts created by processing cellphone location information from our data partner
       Replica,9 a startup spun-out of Alphabet Inc. Given limited coverage for the remaining MSAs,
       we supplement this information with data from the publicly-available FRED (Framework for
       Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamics) database.10 This allows us to extend our analysis
       to other MSAs, as we showcase in detail for New York City, one of the epicenters of the 2020
       pandemic in the US.

       Replica Data: Replica, has access to multiple sources of cellphone GPS data sourced
       from mobile applications11 as well as data on cell-tower specific locations from a major US
       telecom service provider. Using these inputs as well as demographic information from the
       Census, Replica has built a proprietary algorithm to create a synthetic population consisting
       of individuals who perform activities in the real world. The algorithm preserves privacy (no
       synthetic individual exactly matches an individual in the real world), but also produces a
       population that closely approximates both age and industry distributions from the Census
       ACS, as well as granular ground-truth data on mobility patterns from a variety of different
       sources (e.g., State DoT traffic counts).
           For every synthetic individual, we observe a home location (and therefore the other individ-
       uals they live with). Grade school and college students are assigned a school location based on
       their age, home location, and the local schools. Employed residents are assigned a workplace

     Unlike the more aggregate form of similar data used in the literature (e.g., Allcott et al., 2020b), these data rely
on more disaggregated device-level information from multiple different sources.

based on their industry of employment. Each synthetic resident is then assigned to a specific
set of activities for a typical day, as predicted by the cellphone activity patterns. For each ac-
tivity, we observe the time it began, the time it ended, the specific location or point-of-interest
it took place at (e.g., workplace, school, parks, and grocery stores), and the mode of transport
to the next activity (e.g., car, subway, and bus). Our main dataset is constructed from the
first quarter (Jan-Mar) of 2019 in order to represent the full function of the economy absent
lockdown measures. A detailed description of these data and the methodology for generating
a synthetic city is provided in Appendix A.1.

FRED Data: Since Replica data has limited coverage at this time, we use it for our base-
line analysis in Chicago and Sacramento. For the remaining MSAs for which this information
is not (yet) available, we use the FRED synthetic population data provided by the Pub-
lic Health Dynamics Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh (Grefenstette et al., 2013).
These populations are the key input to a widely-used open-source agent-based modeling system
developed to simulate infectious disease epidemics in the epidemiological literature. Similar to
Replica, FRED’s synthetic population provides assignments to homes, work/school locations
and neighborhoods along with demographic information such as age. However, a key differ-
ence with Replica is that FRED does not use cellphone location data to create its synthetic
populations and does not provide information on mobility in the real world. See Appendix
A.2 for more information.

3.1.2    Contacts and Contact Matrices
In defining contacts, which in our framework correspond to instances where contagion is pos-
sible, we employ the following criteria. (We take a conservatively broad stance, since our data
does not allow for granularity at the level of where each person sits, and the public health
community has not produced a comprehensive list of activities in which transmission may
occur.)
    First, an individual is connected to all others in the same household. Second, they are also
connected to peers at their work and school locations. Since work and school locations can be
quite large and we only want to capture direct contacts (e.g., between classmates, but not the
whole school), we adjust the number of school and work contacts downward using available
information on average school/work sizes and timing of contacts; details in Appendix A.1
and Appendix A.2. Finally, we also want to capture contacts between individuals that occur
outside of the work, school, or home context, such as when they are performing activities like
buying groceries or visiting a park.

                               (a) Chicago: Age                                                         (b) Sacramento: Age

Note: This figure documents the expected number of contacts (degree) for an individual in Chicago and Sacramento as observed in the Replica synthetic
populations. Contacts are split by age and industry of the focal person. The dashed vertical lines represent the average expected degree for a person of
the given type. For example, the purple vertical line in panel (a) is the average degree for people 75+ years old in Chicago. Degree distributions have a
long right tail, especially for workers; we cap at 500 for illustrative purposes, but the average degree is calculated on full distribution. The distribution
for those under 18 is in part driven by our assumptions on class size for students; see Appendix A.1 for more details.
    While the home and school/work criteria to define a contact can be applied equally to both
our data sources, the Replica data is more powerful in defining these “activity” contacts since
we directly observe an individual’s activities as trained on cellphone location data. In regions
where Replica data is available, two (synthetic) individuals are connected when they both visit
the same location and overlap in terms of the time of their visit (e.g., being inside a grocery
store; at present, we count even one minute overlaps in visit time as sufficient to establish a
contact). When relying on FRED data, we assume individuals are probabilistically connected
to a subset of other individuals in the same neighborhood, where we define neighborhood as
the same longitude and latitude rounded to the second decimal points (a squared block of
slightly more than 1km2 ).
    To provide a first look of heterogeneity in individual-level contacts across MSAs, in Figure 3
we plot the frequency of expected degrees (i.e. the number of daily contacts) across individuals
in a given MSA. We present these distributions for Sacramento and Chicago separated by the
age and industry of a given individual, along with a vertical dotted line for the average degree
for that group. The differences across age and industry, as well as across MSAs, are worth
noting. In Chicago, for example, an average individual aged 25-49 encounters more than twice
as many people as an individual who is 75 or older. This difference is much less pronounced in
Sacramento. Across industries, healthcare has a very large number of daily encounters—more
than twice as those in manufacturing.
    As illustrated in Section 2, our empirical model aggregates individual contacts to a type-
by-type contact matrix Cmt defined in Equation (1). To define types, we start by assigning
individuals to six age bins (0-17, 18-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80+) and 2-digit NAICS industry
bins. Next we add two more dimensions of heterogeneity to the type space: comorbidities and
the ability to work-from-home. However, while outcomes vary along these additional dimen-
sions, contacts only depend on age and industry, and are otherwise (random and) statistically
independent as long as individuals are not ill, or under social distancing policies. As more
data become available, this assumption could be relaxed.
    Once individuals are assigned their types, our baseline contact matrix Cm0 (i.e. absent any
policy) is derived by aggregating contacts over each type-to-type combination across different
activities. Formally, we let A be the set of possible activities, or types of contacts: work,
school, household, and neighborhood. For each type, ξθm (a) denotes the probability that
type-θ individuals engage in activity a during the day, as observed in the synthetic population
of MSA m. The data also provides us with estimates of

                   ν(θ, a, θ0 ) ≡ E # encounters with type θ0 θ, activity a ,
                                                                          

Note: Each figure represents a contact matrix for the Chicago (panel A) and Sacramento (panel B) as constructed
from the Replica synthetic population. Each cell is the expected number of contacts for an individual in the row age
group with individuals in the column the age group. Focal individuals must live within the specified county, but they
can have contacts with those in surrounding counties. The histogram along the bottom is the population distribution
across age bins. This histogram along the right is the sum of all contacts in that row.


          Figure 4 provides an illustration of the resulting contact matrices across age types for
      Chicago (Panel A) and Sacramento (Panel B). As already highlighted in Figure 3 the Chicago
      MSA displays more daily encounters, particularly for the relatively young population. Never-
      theless, Sacramento features more contacts between over 70 (high risk) and under 50 (lower
      risk) individuals. Although this figure plots the contact matrix across one dimension only (age),
      our model employs a multi-dimensional approach. For example, rather that simply recording
      contacts between 50-59 year olds and 18-49 year olds, our contact matrix records how many
      50-49 year olds, who work in Manufacturing (NAICS:31-33), cannot work from home and are
      either obese or diabetic meet 18-49 year olds, who work in Finance and Insurance (NAICS:52),
      can work from home and are not obese or diabetic.

       nary and subject to updates; data in the C19RD are updated weekly. Crucially, our use of the
       C19RD is meant to complement the daily growing literature studying the effect of Sars-CoV-2
       infection and COVID-19 disease on the health and healthcare needs of different individuals.
       (The MIDAS network13 is an excellent source for a comprehensive overview of this literature.)
           The C19RD contains regularly updated electronic medical records (EMR), and claims, for
       a large portion of the US population. In our current analysis, we focus on easily identifiable,
       diagnosed COVID-19 cases. More precisely, we apply a stringent guideline-based definition to
       identify a healthcare encounter related to the disease, as detailed in Appendix A.3. This leads
       us to a sample of 3,454 individuals living in the US with confirmed diagnoses since the onset
       of the epidemic disease, up to May 1st, 2020.
           For each individual, we keep track of all medical procedures executed for the event of care,
       including indicators for hospitalization and ICU care. In terms of observables, in this timely,
       yet preliminary use of the data we keep track of age, diabetes, and obesity. For each case, we
       observe total procedure charges. This number is preliminary, since charges in EMR do not
       necessarily correspond to charges in the submitted claim. While reported in our summary, we
       currently do not use this variable in our analysis, leaving this to later updates.
           The C19RD sample is summarized in Table 1. In alignment with mounting evidence from
       other sources (see Section 1.4), 5.6% of cases in our sample requires hospitalization, while the
       ICU admission rate is 1.7%. Comorbidities—currently we keep track of diabetes and obesity—
       are observed in 43.7% of the individuals in the sample. Preliminary measures of charges are,
       on average, equal to $562 per-case, but they are five times as large for hospitalized patients,
       and ten times as large, on average, for patients requiring ICU admission.
           In Figure 5 we plot hospitalizations and ICU admission rates across age types, distinguish-

 The figure shows the average hospitalization rates (left panel) and ICU admission rates (right panel) as observed in
the COVID-19 Research Database sample. Each line distinguishes between individuals with and without comorbidity,
while the horizontal axis distinguishes between age groups that are one dimension of a type in our empirical model.
These incidences of hospitalization and ICU admissions are used to calculate hospital days and ICU days given the
size of the symptomatic population (I HC ) in our results in Section 4.


         ing between cases with and without pre-exsiting comorbidities (diabetes or obesity). As known,
         severity increases sharply with age, showing a critical inflection point after 60. After the age
         of 70, patients with comorbidities are both less likely to be hospitalized and less likely to be
         admitted to the ICU. This is consistent with the severity of COVID-19 being very high for
         these groups, implying both a higher case-fatality rate, and the difficult but rational decision
         of hospital staff to focus resources on patients with higher probability of survival.

         3.2.2     Comorbidity in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
         We enrich our definition of a type allowing each age-industry type observed in the contact
         matrix within a given MSA to be split in two subgroups (or sub-types): one with comorbidities,
         and one without comorbidities.
            At the moment, we define an individual as having comorbidities if they are either diabetic
         or obese. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), contains information on these
         variables, as well as individual’s age, industry, and a geographic region that is a larger area
         covering a set of MSAs.
            For any age-industry in MSA m, we assign a fraction κm (age,industry) of individuals to
         the age-industry-MSA type with comorbidities, where

            κm (age,industry) ≡ Pr [diabetic or obese|age, industry, MEPS region containing m]                   (16)

 The table lists the parameters of the Θ-SEIIIRRDhc model that we use for our simulations. These parameters are
based on existing literature (c.f. Section 1.4), and are subject to change. The last column on the right indicates the
case-fatality-ratio for each group that is implied by our model parameters. This reflects closely results in Fletcher
et al. (2020) and Ruan (2020).


      is computed directly from the MEPS. The remaining fraction of individuals (with weight
      1−κm (age,industry)) is assigned to the type with the same age-industry, but no comorbidities.
          Importantly, contacts and comorbidities are independent, conditional on age-industry-
      MSA; our data contains no information on differential mobility and encounters by comorbidity
      status. Richer data would be needed to relax this assumption.

      3.2.3     Healthcare Transitions and Model Parameters
      We use our estimates from the C19RD to study the healthcare outcomes of COVID-19 infection
      beside mortality. As a key ingredient for our simulations, however, the model presented in
      Section 2.2.2 requires us to specify a set of parameters determining the transition across the
      health states of the population during the epidemic. We let some of these parameters vary by
      age and comorbidity.
          We currently select parameters from the literature; the reader can refer to the articles cited
      in Section 1.4 and to the daily updates to the meta-analysis in the MIDAS network. We are
      extremely grateful to Mark Cullen at the Center for Population Health Sciences at Stanford
      University for the ongoing cooperation in tracking “sensible” parameters from the literature
      to use as inputs in our simulations.
          The parameters we use in our Θ-SEIIIRRhc model are listed in Table 2. The only ex-
      ception is βmt , which we estimate by indirect inference minimizing the discrepancy between

our predicted deaths and observed mortality series. The details on this procedure and some
comments on model fit are reported in Appendix B.


3.3     Measures of Work-from-Home and Employment
After defining types by age, industry, and comorbidity, we add a last dimension of heterogeneity
by accounting for the ability of individuals to work from home. As with comorbidity, the
work-from-home dimension of a type is probabilistic: we split each age-industry-comorbidity
type into two, corresponding to those able or unable to work from home, respectively. The
fraction of individuals who can work from home given age and industry is ω(age, industry).
Comorbidities and ability to work from home are statistically independent, an assumption
which could be relaxed with richer data.
    Our estimates of ω(age, industry) are derived following closely the approached introduced
in Dingel and Neiman (2020) and Mongey et al. (2020). This approach combines data on
activities and employment by occupation (from Occupation Information Network, O∗ NET,
and the Occupation Employment Statistics, OES), with the composition of occupations by
industry and age from the American Community Survey (ACS).
    First, we use O∗ NET to construct a measure of the likelihood that a given 2-digit occupation
o may be conducted from home. For this, the O∗ NET contains average responses to survey
questions regarding more than 250 job attributes, and is at the 6-digit occupation level. For
example for the attribute, “Wear protective or safety equipment” we observe the average of
worker responses that themselves range from 1 (never), to 5 (every day). We focus on 17 job
attributes that reflect a job that would be difficult to reallocate to home. (See Mongey et al.,
2020, for more details.)
    We then use the distribution of employment within 2-digit occupations, across 6-digit
occupations from the OES to aggregate each of these scores to the 2-digit occupation level.
We then assign a 2-digit occupation o a work-from-home status of 1 if any of 17 job attributes
have an average score of more than 3.5, indicating an average response of, for example, wearing
protective equipment regularly. At the two digit occupation level this gives an indicator
wo ∈ {0, 1}.
    Lastly, we use national ACS data to construct the distribution of 2-digit occupations o
conditional on age and 2-digit NAICS: Pr(o|age, industry) ∈ [0, 1]. The use of national data is
motivated by the fact that MSA-level data including occupation-industry-age is not sufficiently
fine for this exercise. With these we derive our desired fraction of individuals within a age-
industry who can work from home:
                                            X
                       ω(age, industry) =       wo × Pr(o|age, industry).                   (17)
                                            o

This will affect both, our employment outcomes (even when the workplace is closed, the
individual can work) and our policies, insofar firms and local governments can ask individuals


                                                18
       to work from home if possible.


       3.4     Policies and Counterfactuals
       3.4.1    Policy Sequences
       We use the model to collect series of health, economic, and healthcare outcomes along different
       sequences of policies φ. We distinguish between three phases, with t = 0, ..., T1 indicating phase
       1, t = T1 , ..., T2 for phase 2, and t = T2 , ..., T for phase 3. These are tailored to the COVID-19
       pandemic policy response across the vast majority of the United States.
           We set t = 0 corresponding to March 5th, 2020. In Phase 1, we impose no policy between
       March 5th and t = T1 = 15, where T1 = 15 corresponds to March 20th:
       NP - No Policy: In the no policy regime, for t = 0, 1, ..., T1 , φt = φNP , and the contagion
            patterns are determined by the contact matrix Cm0 as defined in Equation (15) above.
            Precisely:

                          φNP
                         Cmt [θ, θ0 ] = Cm0 [θ, θ0 ] = ξθm (household)ν(θ, household, θ0 )
                                                  + ξθm (neighborhood)ν(θ, neighborhood, θ0 )           (18)
                                                                             0
                                                  + ξθm (work)ν(θ, work, θ )
                                                  + ξθm (school)ν(θ, school, θ0 ).


       In our baseline Phase 2, i.e. between t = T1 and t = T2 = 75, corresponding to May 19th,
       each MSA sets φt = φEO , indicating a regime in which only essential activities are allowed.
       Precisely,
       EO - Essential Only: Essential workplaces such as hospitals, groceries, and transportation
            are open;14 all other workplaces and locations are closed. No contacts outside these
            locations are kept aside for all household interaction and 10% of neighborhood interaction.
            Formally, φEO imposes

                         φEO
                        Cmt [θ, θ0 ] = ξθm (household)ν(θ, household, θ0 )
                                   + 0.1ξθm (neighborhood)ν(θ, neighborhood, θ0 )                       (19)
                                   + 1 θ, θ0 are essential workers ξθm (work)ν(θ, work, θ0 ).
                                       



       In Phase 3, i.e. after May 19th we consider alternative policies between t = T2 and t = T = 150,
       corresponding to August 2nd, the last day in our analysis at the moment. During this period,
       φt can be one of the following:
  14
   Essential industries corresponds to agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, mining, utilities, manufacturing,
wholesale trade, transportation and warehousing, health care and social assistance, public administration.

       CR - Cautious Reopening: With φt = φCR indicating that there is no regulatory restriction
            on mobility or encounters; schools and workplaces are open. However, neighborhood
            interactions are still reduced to 10% of the normal, pre-pandemic level. This captures
            recommendations to use caution, limited capacity of grocery stores, and additional social
            distance measure enacted voluntarily. Formally, φCR is such that

       60+ - Isolate 60+: With φt = φ60+ indicating that there is no regulatory restriction for
             anyone, but individuals who are 60 or older must limit their contacts to household and
             neighbor (local stores). Neighborhood interactions are still reduced to 10% of the normal,
             pre-pandemic level. Formally, φ60+ is such that

   WFH - Work-from-Home if Possible: Individuals who are able to work from home produc-
         tively do so, and do not form contacts at their workplace. All other employed, healthy
         individuals access their workplace and form contacts accordingly. Schools are open,
         household contacts are as usual, and neighborhood interactions limited to 10% of pre-
         pandemic levels. Formally, φWFH is such that

                 φWFH
                Cmt     [θ, θ0 ] = ξθm (household)ν(θ, household, θ0 )                                  (22)

        AS - Alternating Schedules: Students and workers in all schools and workplaces are split
             into two groups that do not intersect. The thought experiment corresponds to alternating
             schedules (morning and afternoon), or alternating days (MWF and TThS); alternative
             versions could consider alternate weeks, implying different disease dynamics.15 Neigh-
             borhood interactions are again reduced to 10% of pre-pandemic levels. Formally, for each

    Delays in the manifestation of symptoms and test results are key drivers of these differences. Exploring optimal
alternation could be an interesting direction for future work.

Note: The figure displays the sequence of contact matrices to study the policy sequence no policy (NP) in Phase
1, essential only (EO) in Phase 2, and work from home (WFH) if possible in Phase 3. Our simulation procedures

            type we consider a 50-50 split from θ to θ[1] and θ[2] ; each corresponds to one subgroup,

           Although we limit our attentions to sequences of NP, EO, CR, 60+, WFH, and AS, our
       model is suited to analyze a very large class of policies. Importantly, the richer the data on
       activities, mobility, and encounters, the larger the set of policies one could consider.

       3.4.2      Simulations and Outcomes
       We simulate outcomes given parameters for Phase 1, and then consider combinations of EO,
       CR, 60+, WFH, and AS for Phase 2 and Phase 3. When discussing our results in Section 4
       we will focus on sequences imposing EO in Phase 2, the modal path of most MSA in the US.
  16
   Technically, our contact matrix now has higher dimensionality, as for each type corresponding to a nonessential
worker we have two sub-types.


                                                               21
       The changes to policy in Phase 2 are retrospective, and have therefore more limited normative
       implications. In our current analysis we do not consider changes to Phase 1 policies, although
       such an analysis is feasible in our framework.
           For every MSA, we start by constructing the contact matrices corresponding to the desired
                                                                 φNP    φEO    φCR
       policy sequence φ. Figure 6 shows the three matrices Cm       , Cm   , Cm   for the Chicago MSA.
       This is the input to analyze the sequence NP in Phase 1, EO in Phase 2, and CR in Phase 3.
           Armed with the contact matrices, we run our Θ-SEIIIRRDhc model. We keep track of the
       number of individuals in each state (i.e. susceptible, infected etc) which allows us to calculate
       the total number of deaths at the end of Phase 3, a key outcome in our analysis. Beyond
       this outcome, we compute the number hours, individuals are unable to work under a policy
       sequence. This depends on the policy φ, and on the epidemic outcomes, since individuals
       who are symptomatic do not work, and the same applies to quarantined individuals who
       cannot work from home. Lastly, we use our estimates of the rates of hospitalizations and ICU
       utilization by type, to compute the healthcare outcomes beyond death of a given trajectory of
       the epidemic.


       4     Results
       4.1     Baseline Model Prediction
       We start by examining the evolution of outcomes in one MSA under the scenario in which it
       adopts the Cautious Reopening (CR) policy in Phase 3, following no policy (NP) in Phase
       1 and essential only (EO) in Phase 2. We consider this our baseline policy sequence for two
       reasons. First, the sequence of NP and EO is representative of the policies that were adopted
       in most localities during Phases 1 and 2. Second, CR represents a policy where no direct
       restrictions are imposed, but which still captures a reduction of contacts in an individual’s
       neighborhood due to social restrictions and social distancing measures.17
           Figure 7 plots predicted outcomes for Chicago in Phases 1, 2 and 3. In terms of epidemic
       outcomes, depicted in Figure 7a, the Chicago MSA experiences a growth of cases during Phase
       2—despite the EO policy—with a “peak of the curve” at t = 50 when approximately 2.5% of
       the population is infected and symptomatic.
           When the MSA moves from EO to CR, our model predicts that within ten days, infection
       rates will increase again. The new peak, at t = 115, corresponds to almost 4% of the pop-
       ulation being infected and symptomatic (or detected). This is reflected in a higher growth
       rate of cumulative deaths, and a larger number of individuals who, on a given day, need to be
       hospitalized or admitted to the ICU (Figure 7c). Importantly, this version of our model does
  17
    As Allcott et al. (2020a) describe, voluntary social distancing has been broadly adopted in areas without enforce-
able lock-downs across the United States, and so this is likely the most representative description of how removing
strong social distancing policies would manifest. (See also Brzezinski et al. (2020); Chetty et al. (2020); Gupta et al.
(2020); Villas-Boas et al. (2020).)

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Essential Only in Phase 2 and
Cautious Reopening in Phase 3 for the Chicago MSA, with contact matrices based on Replica data. The top left
panel displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected,
and the number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots
the share of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and
unable to work from home), sick, or deceased.


      not account for hospital capacity and ICU capacity. This is an important venue for future
      work, since if our predicted hospitalization and ICU admissions exceed capacity, we expect
      death rates among symptomatic individuals to increase.
          As shown in Figure 7b, when EO is imposed, only slightly more than 60% of individuals
      in Chicago are actively employed—either as workers in essential industries or by being able
      to work from home. This number decreases to 55% as individuals contract the disease, and
      either get sick, die, or become quarantined and unable to work from home. The CR policy—

Note: The figure shows outcomes series with No Policy in Phase 1, Essential Only in Phase 2, and Cautious Reopening
in Phase 3. The left column shows results for the Sacramento MSA, based on Replica data; the right column shows
results for the New York MSA, based on FRED data. For further details refer to note to Figure 7.




                                                                                                                                                                 24
       under which the population returns to work—dramatically reduces the number of inactive
       individuals. However, even under CR, we see a new drop in employment 15 days into this
       phase, due to the rising number of sick, deceased, and quarantined individuals.
           In Figure 8 we show the same outcome series for the Sacramento (Replica-based, like
       Chicago) and the New York (FRED-based) MSAs. These figures hint at considerable hetero-
       geneity across the different regions. For example, in New York, the infection rate is relatively
       high under EO in Phase 2, but decreases steadily in Phase 3, even with the less stringent CR
       policy. Unlike Chicago, New York experiences a second peak of infection in Phase 3 that is
       30% lower than the level of Phase 2.
           As we showed in Section 3, Sacramento is less densely populated than Chicago and New
       York and features fewer individual contacts. As such, it does not exhibit a peak of infections
       in Phase 2, but infections, deaths, hospitalization, ICU admissions and the number of inactive
       individuals (due to illness, death, or quarantine) increase in Phase 3, with a peak at t = 110.
       However, it is important to notice how for this area, our model predicts an overall limited
       magnitude of the COVID-19 outbreak.


       4.2     Outcomes across Counterfactual Policy Sequences
       We can compute the time series introduced above for any policy sequence, as well as cumulative
       counts for each of our key outcomes. We now turn to comparing our baseline NP-EO-CR policy
       sequence with key alternatives. Our emphasis will be on sequences along which local authorities
       still impose NP in Phase 1, and EO in Phase 2. However, for Phase 3 we will consider not only
       CR, but also the 60+, WFH, and AS policies as alternatives. For the sake of completeness, we
       also allow for counterfactual policies in Phase 2. However, as these refer to a counterfactual
       past, we consider them less relevant and do not emphasize their results.
            For each alternative policy sequence, we compute cumulative outcome measures (total
       deaths, and total days of employment lost, etc.) at the level of each MSA. In Figure 9 we plot
       the cumulative number of deaths against days of employment lost, both in absolute magnitudes
       and relative to NP-EO-CR. The lower-left-most boundary of each graph may be read as a
       “death-to-employment frontier”.18 Triangular markers indicate cumulative outcomes for the
       sequences NP-EO-CR (baseline), NP-EO-60+, NP-EO-WFH, and NP-EO-AS in each MSA.
       Each marker is labeled with reference to the corresponding Phase 3 policy. Other (dotted)
       markers refer to changes in policy in Phase 2, so that NP-60+-CR, NP-AS-CR, NP-AS-WFH,
       etc. are also evaluated, for a total of 25 possible combinations across Phase 2 and Phase 3.
            Figure 9 shows how our empirical framework delivers several insights, both within MSA
       and across MSAs. First, there is substantial heterogeneity in relative differences across policies
       in Sacramento as compared to Chicago and New York. In Sacramento, there is little difference
       across all of the policies for the total number of deaths due to COVID-19, both in relative and
  18
     As noted in Acemoglu et al. (2020), this frontier may be useful in demonstrating the trade-offs between economic
losses and public health losses from each policy.

absolute terms. This is a direct consequence of the smaller number of contacts. At the same
time, as one would expect, the imposition of EO or AS in Phase 3 would be relatively more
costly in terms of inducing employment losses compared to CR, WFH or 60+.
    By contrast, for Chicago and New York, there seems to be substantial heterogeneity across
policies in terms of outcomes along both mortality and employment. For example, in Chicago,
any of the alternate policies that we consider would make a large difference in reducing deaths
with respect to a cautious reopening. In fact, we predict that WFH in Phase 3 reduces the total
number of deceased individuals (up to August 2nd, 2020) by almost 40%, while maintaining a
very similar level of employment losses.
    Furthermore, for both Chicago and New York, isolating 60+ in Phase 3 appears to be
Pareto-dominated by imposing a work-from-home regime for the occupations that can be
executed remotely (WFH). This suggests that simply isolating 60+ year olds—who are at
higher risk for severe cases of COVID-19—is not as effective in reducing deaths as WFH even
at a comparable level of unemployment.
    We also find that, at the cost of slightly higher employment losses, alternating schedules
(AS) is very effective in limiting deaths in both cities. If avoiding loss of lives was the only
objective, AS would always rank second for Phase 3, topped only by prolonging the regime
of EO into the summer. Note that here we are considering the “pure” AS policy, where all
individuals work on alternate days. A hybrid solution where those who can work from home,
do, and those who cannot, work on alternate days might potentially do even better than these
two policies individually. Clearly, a deeper knowledge of the local economy, and the productive
and organizational structure of local firms and establishments would be essential for a practical
implementation of AS.
    Although Chicago and New York are both large metropolitan areas, we observe notable
differences in comparing their responses to different social distancing policies. As noted above,
the two cities exhibit different disease dynamics: Chicago experiences a less-severe outbreak
in Phase 1 and Phase 2, but remains more exposed to a severe outbreak in Phase 3. As a
consequence, the model suggest that EO in New York was, in a sense, necessary. No alternative
to EO in Phase 2 is Pareto-dominated by the baseline sequence NP-EO-CR. This is not the
case in Chicago, where a slower epidemic outbreak in Phase 1 would have allowed imposing
milder restrictions in Phase 2, but where the differences in outcomes across Phase 3 policies
are now larger. Intuitively, the early path of the outbreak in Chicago left a larger number of
susceptible individuals in Phase 3, making social distancing policies more salient. As such,
while WFH reduces deaths by 40% in Chicago as compared to the baseline policy, in New York
this number is about 20%.
    The heterogeneity of policy outcomes across areas is not only a function of differences in
early disease dynamics and contact density across MSAs, but also of their different distributions
of age-industry-occupation-comorbidity types, and cross-types encounters. As such, our model
would be expected to produce different results for other cities, depending on their properties
along these different dimensions. Finally, it is important to note that our New York results

          As a last note, it is important to reiterate that all of the results in this section (including
      CR) are assuming reduced neighborhood contact. We do not consider a full “back to normal,”
      or formally NP in Phase 3. In Table 3, we summarize selected policy comparisons for Chicago,
      including our baseline policy sequence, amended to have NP in Phase 3. As demonstrated in
      the table, reopening fully without any restrictions to mobility and encounters of any sort would
      lead a much higher number of deaths, hospitalizations and ICU admissions. In Appendix C
      we report tabular and graphical output across a large number of policy combinations for each
      MSA.19

      Mandatory policy intervention becomes less necessary if individuals respond more to the spread
      of disease by voluntarily taking preventive measures such as wearing masks and keeping 6 ft
      apart. Such measures reduce the spread of respiratory droplets, and subsequently decrease the
      disease transmission rate (Prather et al., 2020).
          In our model, the take-up of preventative measures in individual behavior corresponds to
      lowering the transmission probability upon contact, βmt . For our main results, we employ
      two sets of calibrated βmt parameters for each MSA: an initial βm 1 that governs transmission

      during Phase 1, and a reduced βm  2 that governs transmission during Phase 2 and Phase 3.

Note: The table shows how the simulated results change with transmission parameter βmt . “Baseline” shows our
main results using the calibrated parameters for Phase 1 and Phase 2. We then consider setting βmt to the calibrated
                    1                                                                  2
value from Phase βm    (for all periods), and to the calibrated value from Phase 2 βm    . To demonstrate sensitivity to
these values, we scale the baseline βmt values by a constant factor of 0.9, 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25. Each row shows deaths
or employment loss in million-days for Sacramento, Chicago, and New York under two different reopening policies
after May: Cautious Reopening (CR) and Work-From-Home if Possible (WFH).


         Both of these parameters are calibrated with respect to observed death rates at the onset of
         the disease outbreak.20 We allow βmt to vary between phases during calibration to account
         for the possibility that behavioral responses became more rampant as lock-down policies pro-
         liferated. Although we do not impose any further restrictions on βm    1 and β 2 , we find that β 2
                                                                                        m                 m
         is substantially lower than βm 1 , suggesting that behavioral responses were indeed being taken

         up during Phase 2.
             We test the sensitivity of our results to βmt in Table 4. Focusing on the comparison between
         the CR and WFH policies, we compute deaths and employment loss under several alternative
         values of βmt in each city. Under the “Baseline” column, we report the death and employment
         loss numbers under our main setting with the different, calibrated βm      1 and β 2 values. We
                                                                                             m
                           1                                      2
         then fix βmt = βm and (in the next column) βmt = βm for all periods t. Finally, we scale the
         baseline βmt with a constant factor of 0.9, 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25 in each period.
             As Table 4 shows, the relative performance of CR to WFH is largely preserved, even at a
         substantially reduced βmt . However, the extent to which behavioral responses can substitute
         for policy restrictions also varies across regions. For instance, reducing the baseline βmt by
         10% under CR leads to fewer deaths and less employment loss in Sacramento than switching to

       WFH under the baseline βmt . By contrast, in order to achieve a similar Pareto improvement
       in Chicago or New York, βmt would need to be reduced by over 25%.


       5      Conclusions
       We develop an empirical model to study policy responses during a pandemic outbreak, with
       an immediate application to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our model is explicit about geographic
       and age-industry-comorbidity heterogeneity across individuals in their mobility and encounters
       patterns, their health risk specific to the disease, and their ability to work from home. This
       framework allows us to capture how different areas can expect different outcomes along alter-
       native policy sequences. We inform our model with data on mobility, healthcare outcomes,
       and death series. This empirical framework is flexible in ingesting new, or different data, and
       it can be expanded to consider a richer set of policy alternatives.
           Our results highlight the difference in trade-offs that different areas face when deciding
       how and when to re-open their local economies and relax social distancing measures. Areas
       that are hit early and have highly connected populations might expect a lower growth of the
       number of cases when relaxing social distance measures, while areas that had limited severity
       in the pandemic outbreak in early 2020 might expect cases to grow faster when these measures
       are relaxed and individual contacts grow, fueling contagion.
           Policies by which individuals who can work from home do so, or policies by which school and
       work schedules are alternated (splitting classes and employees in groups) appear very promis-
       ing for limiting contagion, while also containing employment losses. Behavioral responses in
       limiting contacts, and precautions such as wearing masks, can play a significant role in limiting
       the severity of the disease outbreaks.
           Our current results are preliminary, and do not tackle directly a variety of important
       considerations. As mentioned above, we abstract away from hospital and ICU capacity in
       a given geographic area, and we do not yet observe healthcare outcomes broken down by
       geography. More data are available every week, and we are working to expand our analysis
       to encompass more of these details. The model is flexible, and designed to include these.
       Importantly, moreover, by looking at aggregate outcomes, we do not explore the heterogeneous
       and possibly distributional effects of policies across different types. The choice of policy affects
       who gets infected and which jobs are lost.21 As such, our ongoing agenda is to include a
       richer description of socioeconomic status in the definition of a type, and investigate how our
       policies influence individuals in different income groups, races, and age groups. In terms of
       counterfactuals, our current results analyze one policy at a time. A natural next step is to
       combine policies (e.g., work-from-home if possible and isolate 60+) to locate their outcomes
       on the frontier. Finally, we have not directly looked into the effects of different policies on
       the broader production supply-chain network of the economy. Since shutting down a specific

order concern and we hope that mobility data can be used to investigate this angle as well.

       A       Details on Data Sources
       A.1      Replica Data
       A.1.1     Building a Synthetic City
       Replica is a transportation planning company spun out of Alphabet in 2019.22 For each
       city, Replica generates a synthetic representation of the activities and movement of residents,
       visitors, and commercial vehicle fleets for a representative week during a quarter. Replica
       ingests data from four primary sources in order to create these synthetic cities: 1) public
       use census data; 2) granular location data for a sample of devices, from both GPS pings and
       triangulation between cellular towers; 3) proprietary data describing features of various points
       of interest (POIs), such as their exact location, brand, and industry; and 4) data from public
       agencies on traffic and transit usage (‘ground truth’), often sourced from sensors placed on
       roads and public transit turnstiles.
           There are four major steps to constructing a Replica city.
         1. Build a synthetic population with people and households that with demographics that
            mirror the joint-distributions of the real population’s demographics and household struc-
            ture.
         2. Assign each person a home and, where applicable, a work or school location.
         3. Generate a ‘typical day’ of mobility for each person, consisting of an activity sequence
            (e.g., [home, work, eat, work, shop, home]), a location for each activity, and travel modes
            between activities. Figure Figure A.1 provides an illustrative example of an activity
            sequence for a single individual.
               • Activities are produced using generative models trained on GPS and telco devices.
                 Location data from GPS traces are very spatially accurate, but cover only a small
                 sample of devices, whereas location data from telco devices are less spatially accurate
                 (as they depend on triangulation between cellular towers), but cover upwards of 20%
                 of the population.
               • There are three generative models: the first determines the activity sequence for the
                 day, the second determines exact locations of the non-home/work activities, and the
                 final assigns travel modes between each activity based on the origin/destination and
                 available travel modes.
               • Mobility ‘personas’ comprising of the above generative models are matched to the
                 synthetic population based primarily on their home, work, and school locations, plus

          some model that infers their age, employment status, vehicle ownership, and other
          demographics.
        • Residents under 5 are not modeled. Residents under 16 are not in the labor force
          and only go to school and their home. College students may go to school in addition
          to work, shop, and other standard activities.
  4. Calibrate using various ‘ground truth’ data sources provided by each city, including
     transit usage, cars on highways (from sensors), and others.
   The process accomplishes two primary goals: 1) accurately capture the true movement of
individuals in a city and 2) protect the privacy of those in the underlying location data. No
individual in the synthetic population can me matched to an exact device.
   Each Replica city is built separately, using all available data for a given quarter. Generating
a new Replica city requires significant data gathering efforts and computational time. As such,
coverage is currently limited to a handful of US cities.

                      Figure A.1: Illustration of an activity sequence




A.1.2    Defining a Graph of Interactions
We construct the graph of social interactions in a city using the locations and times of activities
for each person. In this graph, people are nodes and edges are formed between people whenever
they are at the same location at the same time. Locations are varied in sizes. Edges can be
formed between people doing two different activities, e.g., between a customer shopping and
an employee working at the same store.

‘Core’ and ‘Donut’ Geographies: The graph is built for the full Replica city, which
includes outer areas. However, degree distributions for people who live on the geographic
boundary of the Replica city would be inaccurate; interactions with those who live on the
other side would not be observed. To help account for this, our results use as focal individuals
only those living in the ‘core’ counties of these areas (Cook County and Sacramento County).
Edges formed with those outside the core (people in the ‘donut’ region) still count towards,
for example, a core person’s degree distribution and contacts.

       Workplaces: Employed residents are assigned industries and accompanying workplaces.
       For customer-facing industries, we assign workers to workplaces corresponding to points of
       interest (POIs) of the corresponding industry (e.g., a ‘Retail Trade’ worker may be assigned
       to work at a Walmart). POIs are not available for all workplaces; while a Walmart or dentist’s
       office would appear in our POIs data, a hedge fund’s office would not. For industries that
       encompass firms that are either infrequently visited by customers or absent from our data on
       POIs—for example, construction and manufacturing—we divide workers into workplaces by
       sampling from a distribution of workplaces sizes.
           The full procedure for assigning a given employed resident a specific workplaces is as follows:

         1. Take all employed workers in a Census Block Group (CBG), industry (NAICS 2-digit)
            pair.
         2. For those are in industries that are customer-facing and have data on POIs,23 randomly
            assign POIs of the same industry as the worker as workplaces, weighting by the number
            of visits to that POI relative to other POIs in that CBG-NAICs. So a Walmart that
            receives 50% of all retail traffic in a given CBG will have 50% of the retail workers in
            that CBG assigned to it as ‘employees’
         3. For workers in other industries,24 we divide up large groups of workers in a CBG-NAICS
            into smaller workplaces. For CBG-NAICS that have >150 employees, we break them
            into groups where a worker’s group number is sampled from a Poisson distribution. The
            rate parameter is chosen so that the average group size is 75 employees.25
         4. For POIs with a large number of employees assigned via the above method, we break
            into working divisions using the same parameters.
         5. For workers, edges are formed between coworkers at work simultaneously and—when the
            workplace has a POI—between workers and customers who arrive while the worker is
            present. Worker-to-worker links for large workplaces must be within the same ‘group,’
            but worker-to-customer do not.

       Schools: Students are assigned schools by Replica; however, many schools are unrealistically
       large (e.g., a college campus would be considered a single school). To help address this issue,
       we break up schools into classes in a similar manner to how we divide up large workplaces,
       but with different parameters. In schools with over 100 students, each student is assigned a
       class where class number is sampled from a Poisson distribution where the rate parameter is
       calibrated to produces average class sizes of 50 students. All students within the same
  23
     The following industries are matched to POIs: ‘Wholesale Trade’, ‘Retail Trade’, ‘Information’, ‘Finance and
Insurance’, ‘Real Estate and Rental and Leasing’, ‘Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services’, ‘Health Care and
Social Assistance’, ‘Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation’, ‘Accommodation and Food Services’
  24
     These include: ‘Construction’, ‘Manufacturing’, ‘Transportation and Warehousing’, ‘Administrative and Sup-
port’, ‘Educational Services’, ‘Other’, ‘Public Administration’.
  25
     In future versions, these parameters will be calibrated to match the true distribution of firm sizes in a given
industry-location.

                                                         37
    We are currently investigating data on both firm size (by industry) and average class size
for schools within a given Census Tract. With this data, we can calibrate the distribution of
workplaces groups and school classes to better match the true distribution.

Households: Members of the same household are all connected, with a single contact of
activity type ‘home.’

A.1.3    Comparing Replica and ACS Populations
We compare Replica’s synthetic population to the 2018 5-year ACS. Figures Figure A.2a and
Figure A.2b plot the distributions of ages in each population for Chicago (Cook County) and
Sacramento (Sacramento County). Figures Figure A.2c and Figure A.2d plot the distributions
of industries for workers. Figures Figure A.2e and Figure A.2f plot the distribution of age-
industry types. The age distributions are nearly identical, but Replica consistently under-
matches the number of people in a given industry by a small margin.


A.2     FRED Data
A.2.1    Synthetic Population in FRED
FRED (a Framework for Reconstructing Epidemic Dynamics) is a freely available open-source
agent-based modeling system for studying pandemic influenza. FRED uses open-access census-
based synthetic populations developed by RTI International, which capture the demographic
and geographic heterogeneities, including realistic household, school, and workplace social
networks.
    We use the 2010 version of synthetic population accessed from FRED website (https://
fred.publichealth.pitt.edu/syn_pops). The following steps summarize the construction
of the synthetic population at a high level. Please refer to Cajka et al. (2010) for more detailed
descriptions.
  1. The synthetic population uses an iterative fitting method to generate a population from
     US Census Bureau’ s Public Use Microdata files (PUMS) and aggregates data from the
     2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year sample.
  2. Determines the number of household in each census block group based on Summary
     File 3 (SF3) Data from Census, and randomly generates a GIS point location for each
     household within each census block.
  3. Assigns school-age individuals to schools, using National Center for Education Statistics
     (NCES) Public School Data for 2005–2006, US Census Bureau 2000 TIGER road network
     data, and private school information from Schoolinformation.com. The allocation to
     public school is based on a minimum path algorithm that assigns a student to the closest
     school that has capacity for his/her grade level. The remaining school-age individuals
     are assigned to private schools or home school.

         4. Assigns non-school-age population to workplaces, using US Census Bureau Special Tab-
            ulation Product 64 (STP64) and 2006 InfoUSA Business Counts, following a two-stage
            method. The first stage assigns workers to a Census tract for work. The second stage
            creates individual workplace locations within each Census tract and assigns workers to
            specific workplaces.

       A.2.2     Defining a Graph of Interactions
       Using the synthetic populations within each MSA, we construct the graph of social interactions
       using locations and assignments of households, schools, and workplaces.

       Workplaces: Individuals contact colleagues in the same assigned synthetic workplace. In
       the synthetic population, the size of workplaces can be large. So we break workplaces into
       subgroups, using a similar procedure as described in Appendix A.1. The size of subgroups is
       sampled from a Poission distribution and the rate parameter is an exponential transformation
       of the size of synthetic workplace relative to the average size in each MSA.26
           Since industry is a key source of heterogeneity we consider, we assign a 2 digit NAICS
       code to each synthetic workplace. We take the 2007 County Business Pattern, which includes
       the number of establishments in each county × NAICS-2 × size cohort27 . Using the synthetic
       workplaces and assigned workers, we group workplaces in each county into the same size
       cohorts. Then, we randomly assign each workplace an NAIC 2 code assuming a multinomial
       distribution.

       Schools: Students interact with other students assigned to the same synthetic school. We
       divide up schools similar to the procedure for workplaces.

       Neighborhoods: We assume individuals form contacts with others living in the same
       neighborhood. A neighborhood covers the same longitude and latitude rounded to the second
       decimal points, which is a squared block of slightly more than 1km2 . According to this defini-
       tion, a neighborhood block can include many people in metropolitan areas, and we divide up
       neighborhood blocks similar to the procedure for workplaces and schools.

       Households: We assume individuals contact all other members in the same household.


       A.3      Healthcare Data
       The sample of confirmed 3454 confirmed cases from the COVID-19 Research Database is
       constructed as follows. First, we consider all individuals for which we observe electronic medical
  26
      The rate parameter is equal to 4 + (100 − 4) × (1 − exp(−α × workplace size/avg neighborhood size)) where α
is a parameter we calibrate.
   27
      Size is in terms of number of employees, with the following cohorts ¡5, 5-9, 10-19 20-49, 50-99, 100-249, 250-499,
500-999, 1000-1499, 1500-2499, 2500-4999, 5000+

records. We identify our sample considering the official guidelines for ICD10 coding, and in
particular we include all individuals for which we observe one of the following ICD10 diagnostic
codes between Jan-1-2020 and May-1-2020: U04.9, B34.2, U07.1, U07.2.
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines before April 2020, the official
codes for COVID-19 were
   • U04.9 Severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], unspecified;
   • B34.2 Coronavirus infection, unspecified site.
After April 2020 the CDC guidelines included new WHO recommendations to exclude COVID
diagnoses from using the above codes, and instead adopt:
   • U07.1 COVID 19, virus identified Description: ”Use this code when COVID-19 has been
     confirmed by laboratory testing irrespective of severity of clinical signs or symptoms. Use
     additional code, if desired, to identify pneumonia or other manifestations”;
   • U07.2: COVID 19, virus not identified. Description: ”Use this code when COVID-19
     is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not
     available.Use additional code, if desired, to identify pneumonia or other manifestations”.
   For these individuals, we consider all procedures observed between 25 days prior and 20
days after the diagnosis. We then identify hospitalizations using CPT codes 99221-99239, and
ICU admissions using CPT codes 99291 and 99292.
   To identify diabetes, we use ICD10 E11, ICD9 250, and SNOMED 7321109. To identify
obesity, we use ICD10 E66, ICD9 278, and SNOMED 162864005.

used by the 2018 ACS. We index 2-digit OCC occupations j ∈ {1, . . . , J}. We index O∗ NET
occupation characteristics k = 1, . . . , K. We index 2-digit NAICS codes i ∈ {1, . . . , I}

A.4.2   Ability to WFH by Industry and Age
We want to know, conditional on age a and industry i, the share of workers who can work-
from-home P (W F H|i, a). Our age bins of interest are [5, 17], [18, 49], [50, 64], 65+.
   From the 2018 ACS 5-year, we compute employment in each occupation conditional on
industry and age P (j|i, a). From O*NET we know P (teleworkable|j), the likelihood that

      an individual in occupation j can work-from-home. With an independence assumption, this
      allows us to compute the probability a worker can work-from-home conditional on age and
      industry.

                                                      X
                            P (teleworkable|i, a) =         P (teleworkable|j) × P (j|i, a)
                                                      j∈J

         For example, notice that among workers in industry 11, Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and
      Farming, younger workers are less likely to be employed in a teleworkable occupation than
      older workers.

           Figure A.3: Share of age x industry bins employed in teleworkable occupations




 Note: This figure compares groups of 2 digit NAICS industries and age groups by employment in teleworkable
occupations. To construct this figure, we follow Dingel and Neiman (2020) and Mongey et. al. (2020) by labeling
occupations as non-teleworkable if they are sufficiently intensive in O∗ NET activities that prevent the occupation from
being performed remotely. Occupations are teleworkable otherwise. We compute the probability P         of being employed
in a teleworkable occupation conditional on industry and age as P (teleworkable|i, a) = j∈J P (teleworkable|j) ×
P (j|i, a). We use data from the 2018 ACS 5-year and O∗NET.




      B       Calibration of Contagion Probability, Model Fit
      The chosen definition of a contact, and the specific nature of the available synthetic population,
      affect the magnitude and interpretation of the parameter governing contagion given contact.
      In other words, our parameter βmt for the “probability of infection upon a Replica contact in
      MSA m in day t” is to be interpreted as the “probability of infection upon face-to-face contact
      in MSA m in day t” multiplied by the “probability of a face-to-face contact in MSA m in day
      t upon a Replica contact in the same location-day”.
          To account for this, we estimate the probability of contagion given contact via indirect
      inference matching the model-predicted death series (using the parameters in Table 2) to
      the cumulative deaths at daily frequency from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems


                                                            44
         Science and Engineering.28 This is similar to Fernández-Villaverde and Jones (2020).
             Currently, for each MSA m we estimate three parameters: the transmission rate βm     1 apply-

         ing to Phase 1 from t = 0 to t = 15, the transmission rate βm    2 applying to Phases 2 and 3 for

         t > 15, and the initial condition I0 , corresponding to the number of people that are recently
         infected and infectious (I A ) in each type θ at t = 0.
             We allow for the change in βmt from βm      1 to β 2 to capture how a combination of endoge-
                                                                m
         nous behavioral changes and regulatory guidelines reduce contagion given contact during a
         pandemic. Typical examples include the use of masks, hand sanitizer, six feet distancing, etc.
             We run a grid search for βm  1 , β 2 , and I , which minimizes the sum of squared error of log
                                               m         0
         death per 100 thousands people in the first 60 days of data. Then, we use t ∈ (61, 90) to test
         out-of-sample fit. We drop a few days after the first death or the start of the sample to avoid
         noise in reported deaths in the early period. Because the period in Phase 1 with reported death
         is short, in this calibration exercise, we consider βmt = βm   1 for t ≤ 25 for NYC and Chicago,

         and βmt = βm  2 for t ≤ 23 for Sacramento. The exact timing for this change in transmission

         rate βmt is selected out of a range from 20 to 30 that generates reasonable out-of-sample fit
         and sensible parameter values. The disease spread earlier in Sacramento, so an earlier change
         of behavior is more reasonable. In addition, the death rate in Sacramento is low and noisy, so
         we fix I0 = 1 and only search for βm    1 and β 2 .

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Essential Only in Phase 2 and
Cautious Reopening in Phase 3 for the Chicago MSA, with contact matrices based on Replica data. The top left
panel displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected,
and the number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots
the share of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and
unable to work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Essential Only in Phase 2 and
Essential Only in Phase 3 for the Chicago MSA, with contact matrices based on Replica data. The top left panel
displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected, and the
number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots the share
of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and unable to
work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Essential Only in Phase 2 and
Isolate 60+ in Phase 3 for the Chicago MSA, with contact matrices based on Replica data. The top left panel displays
the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected, and the number
of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots the share of
workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and unable to work
from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Essential Only in Phase 2 and
Work-from-Home if Possible in Phase 3 for the Chicago MSA, with contact matrices based on Replica data. The top
left panel displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected,
and the number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots
the share of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and
unable to work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Essential Only in Phase 2 and
Alternating Schedules in Phase 3 for the Chicago MSA, with contact matrices based on Replica data. The top left
panel displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected,
and the number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots
the share of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and
unable to work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Cautious Reopening in Phase 2
and Cautious Reopening in Phase 3 for the Chicago MSA, with contact matrices based on Replica data. The top left
panel displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected,
and the number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots
the share of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and
unable to work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Isolate 60+ in Phase 2 and
Isolate 60+ in Phase 3 for the Chicago MSA, with contact matrices based on Replica data. The top left panel displays
the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected, and the number
of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots the share of
workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and unable to work
from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Work-from-Home if Possible in
Phase 2 and Work-from-Home if Possible in Phase 3 for the Chicago MSA, with contact matrices based on Replica
data. The top left panel displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic
and/or detected, and the number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel
corresponds plots the share of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the
workplace and unable to work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Alternating Schedules in Phase
2 and Alternating Schedules in Phase 3 for the Chicago MSA, with contact matrices based on Replica data. The top
left panel displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected,
and the number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots
the share of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and
unable to work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Essential Only in Phase 2 and
Cautious Reopening in Phase 3 for the Sacramento MSA, with contact matrices based on Replica data. The top left
panel displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected,
and the number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots
the share of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and
unable to work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Essential Only in Phase 2 and
Essential Only in Phase 3 for the Sacramento MSA, with contact matrices based on Replica data. The top left panel
displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected, and the
number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots the share
of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and unable to
work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Essential Only in Phase 2 and
Isolate 60+ in Phase 3 for the Sacramento MSA, with contact matrices based on Replica data. The top left panel
displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected, and the
number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots the share
of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and unable to
work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Essential Only in Phase
2 and Work-from-Home if Possible in Phase 3 for the Sacramento MSA, with contact matrices based on Replica
data. The top left panel displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic
and/or detected, and the number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel
corresponds plots the share of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the
workplace and unable to work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Essential Only in Phase 2 and
Alternating Schedules in Phase 3 for the Sacramento MSA, with contact matrices based on Replica data. The top left
panel displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected,
and the number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots
the share of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and
unable to work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Isolate 60+ in Phase 2 and
Isolate 60+ in Phase 3 for the Sacramento MSA, with contact matrices based on Replica data. The top left panel
displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected, and the
number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots the share
of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and unable to
work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Work-from-Home if Possible
in Phase 2 and Work-from-Home if Possible in Phase 3 for the Sacramento MSA, with contact matrices based on
Replica data. The top left panel displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and
symptomatic and/or detected, and the number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top
right panel corresponds plots the share of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed
to access the workplace and unable to work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline
case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Alternating Schedules in Phase 2
and Alternating Schedules in Phase 3 for the Sacramento MSA, with contact matrices based on Replica data. The top
left panel displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected,
and the number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots
the share of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and
unable to work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Essential Only in Phase 2 and
Cautious Reopening in Phase 3 for the New York MSA, with contact matrices based on FRED data. The top left
panel displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected,
and the number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots
the share of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and
unable to work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Essential Only in Phase 2 and
Essential Only in Phase 3 for the New York MSA, with contact matrices based on FRED data. The top left panel
displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected, and the
number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots the share
of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and unable to
work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Essential Only in Phase 2
and Isolate 60+ in Phase 3 for the New York MSA, with contact matrices based on FRED data. The top left panel
displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected, and the
number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots the share
of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and unable to
work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Essential Only in Phase 2 and
Work-from-Home if Possible in Phase 3 for the New York MSA, with contact matrices based on FRED data. The top
left panel displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected,
and the number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots
the share of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and
unable to work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Essential Only in Phase 2 and
Alternating Schedules in Phase 3 for the New York MSA, with contact matrices based on FRED data. The top left
panel displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected,
and the number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots
the share of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and
unable to work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Cautious Reopening in Phase 2
and Cautious Reopening in Phase 3 for the New York MSA, with contact matrices based on FRED data. The top left
panel displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected,
and the number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Isolate 60+ in Phase 2 and
Isolate 60+ in Phase 3 for the New York MSA, with contact matrices based on FRED data. The top left panel
displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic and/or detected, and the
number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel corresponds plots the share
of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the workplace and unable to
work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.

Note: The figure shows health and employment outcomes with No Policy in Phase 1, Work-from-Home if Possible in
Phase 2 and Work-from-Home if Possible in Phase 3 for the New York MSA, with contact matrices based on FRED
data. The top left panel displays the percent of individuals of the local population that are infected and symptomatic
and/or detected, and the number of deaths per 100,000s of population on the right vertical axis. The top right panel
corresponds plots the share of workforce that is either active, inactive (due to quarantine, or not allowed to access the
workplace and unable to work from home), sick, or deceased. Dashed lines correspond to the baseline case NP-EO-CR.
