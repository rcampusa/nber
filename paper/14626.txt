This paper presents and tests a new model of multinational firms to explain a rich array of multinational
behavior. In contrast to most approaches, here the multinational faces costs to transferring its know-how
that are increasing in technological complexity. Costly technology transfer gives rise to increasing
marginal costs of serving foreign markets, which explains why multinational firms are often much
more successful in their home market compared to foreign markets. The model has several key predictions.
First, as transport costs between multinational parent and affiliate increase, firms with complex production
technologies find it relatively difficult to substitute local production for imports from the parent, because
complex technologies are relatively costly to transfer. Second, the activity of affiliates with complex
technologies declines relatively strongly as transport costs from the home market increase, both at
the intensive and the extensive margin. We also show that as transport costs from the home market
increase, affiliates concentrate their imports from the parent on intermediates that are technologically
more complex. We test these hypotheses by employing information on the activities of individual multinational
firms, on the nature of intra-firm trade at the product level, and on the skills required for occupations
with different complexity. The empirical analysis finds strong evidence in support of the model by
confirming all four hypotheses. The analysis shows that accounting for costly technology transfer
within multinational firms is important for explaining the structure of trade and multinational production.

1         Introduction

Multinational …rms are often seen as the quintessential global player. At the same time, they

tend to be much more successful in their home market compared to foreign markets. The

combined market share of the car makers General Motors and Ford in the United States,

for example, is close to 40%, compared to only about 20% in Western Europe. National

consumer preferences could play a role, but they can hardly explain why two German car

makers, BMW and Volkswagen, have a market share in all countries of Western Europe that

is more than six times their market share in the United States.1 In this paper, we propose

a di¤erent explanation.

        We start from the premise that multinationals sell less abroad than at home because

there are costs of transferring technology that lowers their productivity abroad. Consistent

with this, the business press often reports that multinational a¢ liates operate with lower

e¢ ciency than their multinational parent plants. Even though multinational …rms play an

ever-larger role in the world economy— about half of foreign trade and 80% of manufacturing

R&D in the US are conducted by US multinational …rms–, this research is one of the few

attempts to uncover the underlying factors.

        In most analyses of the multinational …rm, whether the motive for foreign production is

mainly to save on factor costs or primarily to gain easy market access, multinational par-

ents always fully transfer the …rm-speci…c and non-rival intangible that de…nes the …rm’s

technology to their a¢ liates (Helpman 1984, Markusen 1984).2 Thus, …rms make no inde-

   2
     Some recent work focuses on rival …rm know-how as it resides within managers while retaining the perfect

                                                     1
pendent choice on technology transfer.3 In contrast, here the degree of technology transfer

is endogenously determined by both the desire to save on factor and trade costs and by

the di¢ culty of transferring technology within the multinational …rm.4 We propose that

technology transfer costs are high in part because some technologies are relatively complex,

and complex technologies require extensive problem-solving communication between parent

and a¢ liate. Technology transfer costs to relatively poor countries are also higher than to

richer countries because the former have a lower ability to adopt technological information

than the latter.

    Firms sell di¤erentiated …nal goods produced with intermediate inputs that can be

sourced from di¤erent countries. In our model, there are two Northern and one South-

ern country. The advantage of importing intermediate inputs from the South is low factor

costs, while importing intermediates from the North is preferred relative to local production

if the technology transfer required to produce is relatively costly. We show that optimal …rm

strategies often involve production sharing, where some intermediates are imported while

others are locally produced. The least technologically complex intermediates are sourced

from the South, while the most technologically complex intermediates are produced in the

multinational parent. If a …rm originating in a Northern country (East) opens a multina-

tional a¢ liate in the other (West), the a¢ liate will import a greater range of intermediates

transferability assumption (Burstein and Monge-Naranjo 2008).
   3
     In these models, there is international transfer of technology, but it is only at the extensive margin: if
an a¢ liate is established, there is full transfer, and if not, there is zero transfer.
   4
     Along the lines of Dunning’s (1977) O(wnership)L(ocation)I(nternalization) paradigm, our paper treats
the O and L aspects simultaneously; in future work, we plan to extent the framework to address the in-
ternalization question as well. We expect that studying the technology transfer of multinational …rms will
also improve our understanding of when local …rms bene…t from FDI spillovers, which have recently been
quanti…ed in Keller and Yeaple (2008).


                                                      2
from the South than the multinational parent, because the a¢ liate receives the parent’s

technology only at a cost, and thus purchasing a greater range of inputs from the South

becomes optimal.

   As trade and transfer costs are changing, this framework yields major predictions for the

level and the composition of international economic activity, both at the intensive and the

extensive margin. Speci…cally, as trade costs from the South decline, sales of multinational

a¢ liates will expand by more than sales of the parent (since a¢ liates rely more strongly

on imports from the South). A¢ liate sales in technologically complex industries are more

a¤ected by increasing trade costs than a¢ liate sales in less complex industries, because

in the latter it is easier to substitute local production for intermediate imports from the

parent. We also show that lower trade costs between East and West leads to the entry

of new multinational a¢ liates at the same time that exit increases the productivity of the

average multinational parent …rm.

   These results are obtained by combining our analysis of trade and transfer costs with a

heterogeneous …rm model in the spirit of Melitz (2003) and Helpman, Melitz, and Yeaple

(2004). We then use information for individual U.S. multinational …rms from the U.S. Bureau

of Economic Analysis on the level of a¢ liate sales, a¢ liate imports from their parents, and the

R&D of the parents as a measure of technological complexity to test our theory’s predictions.

Consistent with our model, there is strong evidence that a¢ liate sales decline in trade costs

to the parent, and this e¤ect is stronger for relatively complex technologies. At the same

time, as trade costs increase, the share of intra-…rm imports in a¢ liate sales falls less rapidly

for complex technologies than for less complex technologies. This result also supports our


                                                3
model, since for a given increase in trade costs, a¢ liates …nd it more di¢ cult to substitute

local production for imports from the multinational parent when technologies are complex.

We also …nd evidence that not only the value of trade, but also the range of intermediate

inputs that US parents are providing to their a¢ liates is declining in trade costs by using

highly disaggregated data on U.S. exports. This provides direct evidence in favor of our

prediction that as trade costs increase, more and more intermediates are produced locally

by the a¢ liate as opposed to imported from the parent.

   Our paper is not alone in highlighting the importance of intermediate inputs in interna-

tional trade ‡ows (Feenstra 1998, Hummels, Ishii, Yi 2001, Yi 2003). Particularly relevant

for us is the work by Hanson, Mataloni, and Slaughter (2005) who show using data on U.S.

multinational …rms that vertical production sharing, where parents and a¢ liates each per-

form di¤erent tasks but are linked by trade in intermediate inputs, is an important feature

of the data. In Hanson, Mataloni, Slaughter’s (2005) framework, such production sharing

is facilitated by both low intermediate trade costs and factor cost savings when activities

di¤er in their factor intensity. We extend this analysis, …rst, by showing that the technolog-

ical complexity of tasks is another important factor that shapes multinational production

networks, both in relatively poor and in richer countries. Second, our analysis determines

also the level of multinational activity in di¤erent countries, both at the intensive and the

extensive margin, in addition to the composition of production inside the a¢ liates on which

Hanson, Mataloni, and Slaughter (2005) focus.

   An in‡uential set of papers has recently examined o¤shoring, de…ned as the performance

of tasks (or, intermediate goods) in a country di¤erent from where a …rm’s headquarters are


                                              4
located (Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg 2006, 2008). Di¤erent factors have been emphasized

in what makes certain tasks easy to o¤shore. Our analysis shares a resemblance with Levy

and Murnane (2004) and Leamer and Storper (2001); the former argue that routine tasks

are easier to o¤shore because information can be exchanged with fewer misunderstandings,

while the latter stress that tasks requiring only non-tacit information exchange are relatively

easy to o¤shore.5 Our contribution in this respect is to provide explicit microfoundations,

based on Arrow (1969), which are highly consistent with the arguments made by Levy and

Murnane (2004) and Leamer and Storper (2001). Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg’s (2008)

paper di¤ers in that heterogeneous o¤shoring costs are taken as given in a North-North

framework while at the same time they interact with external economies of scale not present

in our work. Moreover, while in our paper factor price di¤erences a¤ect o¤shoring decisions,

as in Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2006), our model has nothing to say on the factor

price e¤ects of changes in o¤shoring costs, the main focus of Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg

(2006). At the same time, by including both costs of o¤shoring tasks— here, the costs of

transferring technology within the multinational— as well as the usual iceberg-type trade

costs on intermediate and …nal goods, our framework allows for a richer set of predictions as

these costs change relative to each other.

       The theory of multinational …rms tends to view multinationals either as the result of

horizontal expansion (in which the a¢ liate replicates the production activities at home but

saves on the trade costs of exporting) or vertical expansion (in which parent and a¢ liate

   5
    In Head and Ries’(2008) study of merger & acquisitions FDI, the authors propose the costs of corporate
control vary with distance and cultural similarity; at the same time, such costs might also vary across
intermediate stages of production.



                                                    5
specialize in di¤erent parts of production so as to take advantage of factor cost savings).

Correspondingly, the focus of recent empirical work is often on one of these motives. For

example, Brainard (1997) and Irarrazabal, Moxnes, and Opromolla (2008) examine horizon-

tal, whereas Hanson, Mataloni, and Slaughter (2001), Burstein and Monge-Naranjo (2008),

and Garetto (2008) study vertical foreign direct investment (FDI).6 Our theory of multina-

tional …rms combines horizontal and vertical motives. All FDI is vertical in the sense that

multinational parents and a¢ liates specialize in di¤erent tasks.7 At the same time, since

our analysis incorporates both trade costs and factor cost di¤erentials, it includes motives

for horizontal and vertical expansion. Moreover, our empirical analysis con…rms that both

motives are explaining important parts of the overall pattern of multinational production.

       Another set of papers has started to address the important question of how large the gains

from openness are based multi-country general equilibrium models (Eaton and Kortum 2002,

Ramondo and Rodriguez-Clare 2008, Burstein and Monge-Naranjo 2008, Garetto 2008, and

Irarrazabal, Moxnes, and Opromolla 2008); all authors except the in‡uential work by Eaton

and Kortum (2002) consider, as does this paper, both international trade and FDI. One

contribution of this paper is that the optimal decision on intermediate input purchases,

which determines the level of trade and FDI in this framework, is a smooth function of

costs, whereas in existing work certain margins of choice exist, or do not, in a discrete way.8

Finally, it is important to note that our analysis tests, and con…rms, key elements of the

   6
     Some empirical studies address both horizontal and vertical FDI, including Carr, Markusen, and Maskus
(2001), Blonigen et al. (2003), and Hanson, Mataloni, and Slaughter (2005).
   7
     At a relatively …ne level of disaggregation, it becomes apparent that multinational parents and a¢ liates
specialize to a signi…cant degree in di¤erent tasks (Alfaro and Charlton 2007).
   8
     In Garetto (2008), for example, the costs for …nal goods producers to purchase the ‘adaptable’technology
used by potential input suppliers is in…nity.

model by employing information on individual multinational enterprises. This includes data

on the multinational …rms’ technology investments and their intra-…rm trade, as well as

information on multinational a¢ liate activity both at the extensive margin (entry) and the

intensive margin (sales). This enables us to assess the performance of individual elements of

our model relatively accurately. We believe that this is very useful in order to make progress

on these important questions.

    The remainder of the paper is as follows. The following section 2 describes the model,

characterizes its equilibrium and derives the key empirical predictions of the model. Section 3

derives four central hypotheses that will be tested, describes the data that we have assembled

to do so, and presents the empirical results. We conclude with section 4.




2     Theory

2.1    A Model of Costly Technology Transfer with Multinationals

Consider a world with three countries, E, W , and S that are each endowed with L units of

labor. Countries E and W are identical Northern countries and S is the South. Preferences

in the Northern countries are given by


                                         Z                                         !
                         X
                         I                                               X
                                i
                    U=              ln            xi (!) d! +        1         i       ln Y;                    (1)

                          i                                                i



where Y is a homogenous, freely-traded good,              i   is the expenditure share of the di¤erentiated

                                                                                         i
…nal good i, xi (!) is the volume of variety ! of good i consumed, and                       is the set of available


                                                      7
varieties of good i. The parameter          =1          1= , where             > 1, is the elasticity of substitution

across varieties. For simplicity, we assume that the South consumes only good Y .

   All goods are produced using exclusively labor. Good Y is produced in every country

by perfectly competitive …rms. Cross-country variation in the e¢ ciency of Y production

induces di¤erences in wages across countries. The wage in the North wN exceeds the wage

in the South wS . In each Northern country, there is a continuum of potential entrants. Each

potential entrant is endowed with the property rights over a unique variety associated with

a particular good i.

   Any variety of the di¤erentiated good X is costlessly assembled in the country in which it

is consumed from a continuum of variety-speci…c intermediates, which are indexed by their

technical complexity, z. Industries di¤er in the mixture of intermediates that are used in

their production. Speci…cally, in the industry producing good i the production function is

Cobb-Douglas:
                                                    Z       1

                                                                                         R1
where xi (!) is the volume of output of variety !,                         i   = exp         0   i (z) ln   i (z)dz   is an

industry-speci…c constant, m(!; z) is the volume of intermediate input z that is speci…c to

variety !, and   i (z)   is the cost share schedule for intermediate z in industry i. We assume

that the cost share function in industry i is given by



                                            i (z)   =       i   exp(      i z).                                         (3)



According to the formulation in (3), the average technical complexity for industry i is equal

                                                                8
to 1= i : industries with lower values of       i   are more technologically complex.

       Firms di¤er in their technological capability (or productivity), '. In order to produce

its variety, a Northern …rm must …rst incur an industry-speci…c …xed cost                 i.   Upon entry,

a …rm draws its type ' from a known distribution G. The country in which the …rm enters

will henceforth be called the …rm’s home country, any productive facility in that country

will be called the parent, and any other productive facility owned by that …rm in another

country will be called an a¢ liate.

       A …rm’s productivity in producing intermediate inputs depends on its productivity and

on the country in which the intermediate is being produced. If a …rm produces a given

intermediate z in its home country, then its labor productivity is given by its type ': one

unit of labor can produce ' units of any intermediate. If the …rm produces an intermediate

input z in any country other than its home country then its productivity at that location

is reduced because of the existence of costs to international technology transfer. The size

of this labor productivity loss depends on the technological complexity of the intermediate

input z and on country characteristics. Such technology transfer costs due on international

communication problems are stressed by Arrow (1969), who argued that there can be large

e¢ ciency losses when communication between teachers (here the multinationals’ parents)

and students (here the multinationals’a¢ liates) fails.9

       To produce one unit of an intermediate input, suppose that a number of tasks, given by

z, must be successfully completed. In the application of each task, problems arise that will,

   9
    Technological information is di¢ cult to communicate because it is often not fully codi…ed; Feldman and
Lichtenberg (1998) demonstrate empirically that codi…ability is associated with better transfer of informa-
tion, and Teece (1977) shows that transfer costs account for a substantial portion of all costs of shifting
production from multinational parent to a¢ liate.

                                                      9
if unsolved, result in the destruction of that unit. A plant’s management must communicate

the problem to the …rm’s headquarters which must in turn communicate to the plant the

solution to the problem. If communication is successful for each task, then one unit of

the input is produced. If the solution to any problem fails to be communicated, then the

input that is produced is useless. When the plant and the headquarters are in the same

country, we assume that there is no di¢ culty in communication, but when headquarters and

the plant are in di¤erent countries, the probability of successful communication is e 2 (0; 1).

Assuming that the success rate of communication is independent across tasks, the probability

of successful communication is (e)z . If a units of labor were committed to the production

of one unit of an intermediate input, then a(e)z is the “e¤ective”labor input. A decrease in

the communicability of technology thus results in a decrease in productivity for intermediate

z equal to the inverse of (e)z :



                                   1=(e)z = exp( z ln e)

                                            = exp( z);                                         (4)



where the parameter           ln e > 0 is inversely related to communicability and so measures

the ine¢ ciency costs of international technology transfer. Hence, higher z are associated

with higher technology transfer costs. We assume that labor in the North is better trained

than Southern labor, and so the magnitude of technology transfer costs to the South are

higher in the South than to the North:     S   >    N.   Hence, the e¤ective productivity of a …rm

                                                           e j ('; z) in a foreign country
with home productivity level ' producing intermediate z is '


                                                   10
j 2 fN; Sg is

                                        e j ('; z) = ' exp(
                                        '                     j z):                          (5)


   A …rm that has learned its type must then decide in which countries to sell its variety.

To sell its variety in a given country, the …rm must incur …xed labor cost f to market and

distribute its variety. There are no other …xed costs.

   Final goods are assembled in the country in which they will be sold, but the source of

any given intermediate input is chosen by the …rm. Any given intermediate input could

be produced in either of the Northern countries, or in the South, or in all three locations.

This choice will depend on relative labor costs wN =wS , on the size of technology transfer

costs   S   and   N,   and on transport costs. Any intermediate input or di¤erentiated …nal good

shipped between Northern countries incurs an iceberg-type transport cost          N   > 1. Any

intermediate input or di¤erentiated …nal good shipped from the South to the North incurs

iceberg transport cost       S   > 1.

   The timing of the model is as follows. First, …rms incur entry costs. Second, …rms choose

which Northern market to set up an assembly plant and distribution networks to sell their

products. Third, …rms choose where to produce their intermediates. Finally, …rms assemble

their …nal product and sell output on the monopolistically competitive product market.



2.2     Equilbrium and Empirical Implications of the Model

We now develop the main empirical implications of our theory in a series of propositions.

The equilibrium is described by, …rst, solving for the optimal intermediate input sourcing

decisions of …rms conditional on their decision to sell their product in the home and foreign

markets. Second, we examine how transport costs and technology transfer costs a¤ect the

international structure of multinationals’ operations. It is shown that as transport costs

between multinational parent and a¢ liate increase, the latter concentrate on intermediate

imports from the parent that are technologically relatively complex. Moreover, this techno-

logical complexity also plays a key role in determining a¢ liate activity at both the extensive

and intensive margins, as well as for the trade-o¤ between imports from the parent versus

local a¢ liate production. These central implications of our theory are examined empirically

in section 4. The description of the model’s equilibrium is completed in the appendix, which

also derives additional predictions on the relative importance of North-North compared to

North-South FDI as transport costs change.


Transport Costs and the Structure of Intra-Firm Trade We begin by deriving the

optimal intermediate sourcing decisions of a …rm of type ' whose parent is in one Northern

country (e.g. E) and that owns an assembly a¢ liate in the other Northern country (e.g. W ).

First, consider the decision for the parent …rm. Let the minimum cost of a parent …rm of type

' of procuring intermediate z be cP ('; z). For each intermediate input, the parent can either

produce the intermediate itself or procure it from an a¢ liate in the South.10 If the parent

…rm produces the intermediate z locally, it pays the northern wage wN and its productivity

is ', so cP ('; z) = wN ='. If the intermediate is procured from an a¢ liate in the South, it

pays the Southern wage wS , incurs transport cost          S,   and incurs technology costs transfer

  10
    This parent …rm will never procure an intermediate from an a¢ liate in the other Northern country
because doing so incurs transport and technology-transfer costs that it can avoid by producing locally.


                                                  12
costs that reduce its productivity to ' exp(          S z).   In this case, cP ('; z) = wS        S   exp(    S z)='.


The minimum cost of procuring intermediate z for assembly at the parent …rm is thus


                                            1
                              cP ('; z) =     min fwN ; wS      S   exp(   S z)g :                               (6)
                                            '


Assuming that wS      S   < wN , and noting that technology transfer costs are increasing in z, it

follows that the least technologically complex intermediates are produced in the South while

the most complex intermediates are produced by the parent. In particular, there exists a

cuto¤ intermediate input



                                                1          wN
                                       zbSP =        ln              :                                           (7)
                                                 S        wS S

such that all intermediates z < zbSP are sourced from a Southern a¢ liate and all the remaining

intermediates are produced in the home country by the parent.

   Now consider the sourcing decision of the multinational’s a¢ liate in the other Northern

country. Let cA ('; z) be the minimum cost to the a¢ liate of a …rm of type ' to procure

intermediate z. The …rm has three options for procuring this intermediate. First, it can

obtain the intermediate from its parent in which case the wage paid is wN , the transport

cost is   N,   and the productivity is ', so cA ('; z) = wN              N ='.   Second, the …rm can obtain

the intermediate from a Southern a¢ liate in which case the marginal cost of the Northern

a¢ liate is the same as it would be for the parent: cA ('; z) = wS                   S   exp(   S z)='.      Finally,

the a¢ liate can produce the intermediate input itself in which case it pays a wage of wN ,

pays no transport costs, and produces with e¢ ciency level ' exp(                         N z),   so cA ('; z) =

                                                     13
wN exp(    N z)='.   The minimum cost of procuring intermediate z for assembly at a Northern

a¢ liate is thus


                                    1
                     cA ('; z) =      min fwN        N ; wS S     exp(     S z); wN   exp(   N z)g :              (8)
                                    '


Given our assumption that foreign productivity is decreasing in z, it follows that the most

technologically complex intermediates must be sourced from the parent. Our assumption

that wS   S   < wN implies that the least technologically complex intermediates will be sourced

from a Southern a¢ liate. If        S   is su¢ ciently large relative to              N,   the intermediate inputs of

a moderate technological complexity will be most cheaply produced locally. Assuming this

is the case, intermediates z < zbSA will be sourced from a Southern a¢ liate, where


                                                     1               wN
                                        zbSA =               ln                :                                  (9)
                                                 S       N          wS S

are imported by the a¢ liate from its parent …rm, and intermediates z 2 [b       A
                                                                                   ] are produced

locally by the a¢ liate. We can now summarize two key results in the following propositions.

First, comparing equations (7) and (9) establishes the …rst proposition.


Proposition 1 A¢ liates source a wider range of intermediate inputs from the South than

their parents, i.e. zbSP < zbSA .


    This result on parent versus a¢ liate’s import range from the South is the consequence

                                                         14
of costly technology transfer within the multinational enterprise. That increases the cost of

producing each intermediate in a Northern a¢ liate relative to the cost of producing at the

parent so that for the threshold intermediate zbSP , the cost of production in the parent …rm is

the same as in the Southern a¢ liate but strictly higher for the a¢ liate in the other Northern

country. Hence, the a¢ liate will strictly prefer to import that intermediate from a Southern

a¢ liate rather than produce the intermediate itself.

   Di¤erentiating equation (10) establishes the second proposition.

                                                                             A
Proposition 2 An increase in the size of transport cost      N   increases zbN and so (i) reduces

the range of intermediates imported from the parent and (ii) increases the average technical

complexity of the intermediates it imports from the parent.


   According to this result, the commodity composition of a¢ liates’imports from their par-

ent …rms should become more concentrated in fewer categories that are more technologically

complex as transport costs between a¢ liate and parent …rm rise. The increase in transport

costs from the parent means that the intermediate good with threshold technological com-

          A
plexity zbN is now strictly cheaper obtained locally. As a consequence, the a¢ liate’s imports

                                                                                         A
from the parent will concentrate on intermediates that are more complex than the level zbN .

In the limit as transport costs increase, parents export only the most technologically complex

intermediate as headquarter service–all other inputs are locally produced by the a¢ liate.


The Structure of International Production In this section, we show how technolog-

ical complexity a¤ects the trade-o¤ between imports from the parent versus local a¢ liate

production. Also, technology transfer costs that are increasing in complexity are shown to

                                              15
yield predictions for both the extensive and intensive margins of a¢ liate activity. We …rst

calculate the cost share of intermediate inputs that foreign a¢ liates in Northern countries

procure from their parent …rms as a function of transport costs, and we show how this re-

lationship can be used to infer cross-country and cross-industry variation in the marginal

cost facing multinationals in serving foreign markets. We then derive the implications of

this variation in marginal costs for a¢ liates’sales and the likelihood that a …rm will open a

foreign a¢ liate.

   Let    i   be the optimal share of imported intermediates in the total costs of a foreign

a¢ liate of a …rm in industry i. The Cobb-Douglas production technology combined with

                                                                                      A
the observation that all intermediates with a technological complexity greater than zbN are

imported from the parent …rm imply that this cost share is given by


                                                   Z    1
                                           i   =              i (z)dz;                                           (11)

                                                                                                                     A
where    i (z)   is given by equation (3). Substituting out                 i (z),   integrating, substituting for zbN

using (10), and then taking logarithms of the resulting expression yields the following simple

formula for this share of intermediates imported from the parent …rm in total a¢ liate costs:


                                                              i
                                         ln    i   =              ln   N:                                        (12)
                                                              N




From this expression, the following important proposition is immediate:


Proposition 3 The share of intermediates imported from the parent …rm in total costs,


                                                         16
 i,   is strictly decreasing in transport costs between a¢ liate and parent, and the rate of this

decline is slower in technologically complex industries (low                    i ).



      For a given increase in transport costs, the cost share of intermediates imported from

the parent …rm in total a¢ liate cost is decreasing more slowly in technologically complex

industries because these industries are intensive in intermediates whose production is hard

to move o¤shore. In contrast, for non-complex intermediates it is easy to substitute local

a¢ liate production for imports from the parent. This has important implications for the

structure of marginal costs of a¢ liates across countries and across industries because indus-

tries featuring complex technologies will be more exposed to transport cost changes than

less technologically complex industries.

      To see this, we now calculate the marginal cost of an a¢ liate as a function of transport

costs. Cost-minimization implies that the marginal cost of assembling the variety of a …rm

of type ' in industry i at the a¢ liate or parent (indicated by k 2 fA; P g) is

           To calculate the marginal cost facing the Northern a¢ liate of a …rm of type ' in

industry i, substitute for cA ('; z) using (8) and the cuto¤s (9) and (10), and then integrate

by parts using (3). The resulting equation can be written

Here, g A (:) summarizes the e¤ect of costly technology transfer, transport costs, and the

factor cost di¤erences on the marginal cost of serving the foreign market.

   Now consider the e¤ect on the marginal cost of the a¢ liate in industry i of an increase in

 N,   the size of transport costs between the parent and the a¢ liate. Di¤erentiating equation

(14) with respect to        N    and rearranging, we obtain

                                                    CiA   @ N


The following lemma can be obtained by di¤erentiating this equation.

                                                                                                                     A
Lemma 1 The elasticity of the marginal cost of the a¢ liate with respect to                                N   ("CN ;i ) is

higher in technologically relatively complex (low ) industries.


   It is useful to compare equation (16) which relates technology transfer costs                                N,   tech-

nological complexity         i,   and transport costs           N,   to the elasticity of marginal cost of the

the parent, given by equation (12). We observe that ln("CN ;i ) = ln i , so the logarithm of

the cost share of imported intermediates is a su¢ cient statistic for the elasticity of marginal

costs with respect to the size of transport costs between a¢ liate and parent. By estimating

the relationship between technological complexity, transport costs, and ln i , we can infer

                                                           18
the e¤ect of these variables on a¢ liates’marginal costs.

   We now derive the implications of Lemma 1 for other key variables: the structure of a

…rm’s a¢ liate’s sales conditional on opening a foreign a¢ liate in a given country and the

likelihood that a given …rm will open an a¢ liate in the …rst place. We begin our analysis

of the structure of …rms’ international operations by deriving the optimal level of sales

generated in each market conditional on entry.

   The preferences given by (1) imply that the demand for the variety of a type ' …rm in

country k 2 fE; W g is

where pik (') is the price charged by the …rm in industry i of type ' in country k, and P i is

the price index for good i in each of the Northern countries.

   It is well known that a …rm facing the iso-elastic demand curve (17) optimally charges a

constant proportional mark-up over marginal costs (1= > 1). Substituting for the parent’s

marginal cost using (14), we …nd that the optimal revenue of generated by an a¢ liate of

parent …rm of type ' in industry i in a foreign market is



                                      RiA (') = Ai CiA (')1        ;                     (18)

is the endogenous, mark-up adjusted demand level in a Northern country in industry i, and

CiA (') is given by equation (14). Totally di¤erentiating (18) and holding …xed Ai , we …nd

that the elasticity of a¢ liate sales can be written


                                  A           N@RiA (')                                  A
                              "RN ;i                    =                  (        1)"CN ;i
                                        RiA (') @ N


This equation combined with Lemma 1 has the following implication.


Proposition 4 Holding …xed the mark-up adjusted demand level, Ai , the value of a¢ liate

revenues RiA (') is decreasing in the transport costs                  N,   and the rate of this decrease is highest

in technologically relatively complex (low ) industries.


   This second observation follows from the fact that in technologically complex industries

more of the global value added is in intermediates that are costly to o¤shore, and so marginal

costs rise faster in transport costs.

   Similarly, a …rm will open an assembly a¢ liate in the other Northern country if gross

level that a …rm must have before it is pro…table to serve the foreign market:

Di¤erentiating equation (20) with respect to           N   and using Lemma 1, we can establish the

following important result.


Proposition 5 Holding …xed a foreign country’s mark-up adjusted demand level Ai , the

probability that any given …rm invests in that country is decreasing in transport costs be-

tween parent and a¢ liate (     N ).   Everything else equal, this rate of decrease is higher in

technologically relatively complex (low ) industries.


    This result is closely linked to our earlier results. An a¢ liate’s marginal cost is higher

when the transport cost between parent and a¢ liate is greater, and the rate at which mar-

ginal cost increases is faster in more complex industries (see Proposition 3). Therefore,

                                                        bA
holding all other country variables …xed, the threshold ' i rises faster in technologically


complex industries and the likelihood that any given …rms productivity exceeds this thresh-

old is decreasing.

    We now turn to testing these predictions.




3     Empirical Analysis

The model o¤ers a rich set of predictions over the structure of intra-…rm trade and the

location and volume of multinational activity that will be examined in this section. We begin

by summarizing the predictions for the case where transport costs between multinational

parent and a¢ liate (   N)   increase, relative to transport costs to the South and the costs

of technology transfer. An increase in        N   reduces the share of imports in total a¢ liate

costs relatively less in technologically complex industries (Hypothesis 1). An increase in

                                                  21
Northern transport costs lowers a¢ liate sales particularly strongly in technologically complex

industries (Hypothesis 2). And an increase in           N   reduces the probability that a …rm invests

particularly strongly in technologically complex industries (Hypothesis 3). We will refer to

these as, respectively, the hypotheses on the mix of imports versus local production, on the

intensive margin, and on the extensive margin of multinational activity.11

      Note that if intermediates are technologically complex, this moderates the substitution

from imports to local production while at the same time it exacerbates the response of

a¢ liate activity to an increase in transport costs both at the intensive and the extensive

margin. The data most suitable to testing this powerful distinction is the con…dential …rm-

level information from the BEA on the structure of U.S. multinationals’global operations.

This is because one can directly observe the total cost share of intermediates imported by the

a¢ liates from their parent …rms and the location and host country sales of these a¢ liates.

Below we derive the corresponding estimation equations, provide additional information on

the BEA dataset, and conduct this empirical analysis.

      Another prediction of our theory to be tested is that as             N   increases, multinational

a¢ liates concentrate on intermediate imports from their parents that are technologically

more complex (Hypothesis 4).12 The changing nature of U.S. intra-…rm trade is captured

best by U.S. Census information on related-party trade which varies by country and six-

digit industry classi…cation.13 Below we show how the related-party trade data can be used

together with information on the importance of complex problem solving skills from the U.S.

 11
    These three hypotheses are based on Proposition 3, Proposition 4, and Proposition 5, respectively.

    See Proposition 2 above.

    There is no …rm-level data on the technological complexity of intra-…rm trade that we are aware of.

vary across destination countries in their technological complexity.

   The following two sections describe how Hypothesis 1 to 4 are tested with these data.


The Structure of U.S. Multinationals’Global Operations The BEA data allows us

to observe many features of the international operations of U.S. multinational …rms. Chief

among these features are the cost share of intermediate inputs obtained by the a¢ liates

of U.S. multinationals, the sales of these a¢ liates in their host countries, and the location

decisions of these a¢ liates. Consider …rst the share of intermediate inputs imported by an

a¢ liate from its parent …rm j in an a¢ liate’s total cost. In the model, this variable is the

…rm-level analog to equation (12), or



                                          A               i
                                   ln i (b
                                         zN )=                 ln   N:
                                                          N




Hypothesis 1 says that while generally the import cost share is declining in               N,   this is less so

the case when intermediates are technologically complex (low                i ).   In terms of observables,

let Mjk be the value of goods imported by an a¢ liate of …rm j located in country k from its

parent …rm, and let T Cjk be the total costs of that same a¢ liate. Further, let F Ck be the

size of transport costs between the parent …rm (in our data located in the United States)

                                                      A
and the a¢ liate in country k. The analog to      i (b
                                                     zN )       in the data is then


                                       Mjk            j
                                  ln         =                ln F Ck :
                                       T Cjk          N




                                                 23
The transfer cost (    N)   and technological complexity ( j ) parameters are not observed. We

address this by, …rst, assuming that technology transfer costs are the same across countries

in which …rms sell their good to …nal customers. Second, we parametrize the technological

complexity of …rm j by the parent’s R&D intensity (R&D expenditures over sales). To

the extent that technology transfer costs are problem solving communication costs, as in

equation (4), it is reasonable to assume that they are higher, the higher is the …rm’s R&D

intensity. Thus we assume that the technological complexity of …rm j is



                                              j   =   0   +       1 RDj ;




where RDj is the R&D intensity of …rm j in industry i, and                              0   and   1   are parameters.

Now, allowing for (unmodelled) observed country characteristics that in‡uence the ability

of a country to absorb technology Xk , …rm …xed e¤ects                          j,   and idiosyncratic unobserved

…rm-country characteristics "jk , we obtain the following estimating equation:



                       Mjk                                    0        1
                  ln         =    j   + ln Xk +                   +         RDj ln F Ck + "jk                    (21)
                       T Cjk                               N           N


where    is a vector of unknown coe¢ cients. We assume that "jk is well-behaved in the

sense that it is uncorrelated with observed country characteristics so that we may estimate

equation (21) via ordinary least squares. Hypothesis 1 is that the coe¢ cient                             0
                                                                                                          N
                                                                                                              < 0 and

that the coe¢ cient estimate          1
                                      N
                                          > 0. As transport costs increase, …rms substitute local

production for imports of intermediates from the parent, but this substitution is more costly

in technologically relatively complex industries with hard to transfer technologies.

                                                          24
   Now consider the intensive margin of a¢ liate activity. The relationship between the

revenue generated by an a¢ liate from sales in its host country and the magnitude of transport

costs between the parent and the a¢ liate is given by equation (18). Taking the logarithm of

equation (18), we have



               ln RA (') = ln Ai + (       1) ln(')    (   1)g A (   S;   N;    S;     N;   i );



where g A (:) is given by equation (15). Holding …xed the mark-up adjusted demand level

Ai , the size of an a¢ liate’s revenue should be increasing in the …rm’s productivity ' and

decreasing in the size of transport costs between the a¢ liate and its parent …rm. As shown

above, the size of the e¤ect of transport costs should be larger (decreasing faster) in tech-

nologically relatively complex industries because technology is more di¢ cult to transfer in

those industries. We consider the following linearized version of this equation that relates

the sales revenue of the a¢ liate of …rm j in country k, Rjk , to transport costs F Ck and other

country characteristics:



                      ln Rjk =   j   + ln Xk + (& 0 + & 1 RDj ) ln F Ck +       jk ;                  (22)


where   j   is a …rm-…xed e¤ect that absorbs …rm j’s productivity, Xk is the same vector of

controls as in equation (21) and      is the corresponding coe¢ cient,         jk   is a well-behaved error

term. Our Hypothesis 2 is that & 0 < 0 and & 1 < 0: a¢ liate sales in technologically relatively

complex sectors (high RDj ) are more sensitive to variation in transport costs F Ck . The

di¤erence in the predicted sign on the interaction between RDj and F Ck in equations (21)


                                                  25
and (22) has strong empirical bite.

      Finally, on the extensive margin of a¢ liate activity, Hypothesis 3 states that the proba-

bility of individual …rms to enter individual foreign markets should be decreasing in the size

of transport costs between the parent …rm and the prospective host country and that the size

of this decrease should be more pronounced in technologically relatively complex industries.

This relationship is driven by the foreign entry condition that a …rm should enter if


                                         RA (')
                                                    wN f    0:



Letting Yjk equal one if …rm j owns an a¢ liate in country k and zero otherwise, we assume

that a …rm will invest if the latent variable Yjk > 0, with



                                         Yjk = ln Rjk +    jk ;                                  (23)



where      jk   is a random error term associated with the …xed cost of investment facing …rm

j when investing in country k (if …xed costs are the same across countries than they will

be absorbed into the …xed e¤ects). Because the same country characteristics that make

the optimal volume of sales larger in a given country also increase the probability to enter

the market in the …rst place, everything else equal, the independent variables for the entry

estimation equation (23) are the same as in the revenue equation (22).

      The data for testing Hypotheses 1, 2, and 3 come from the BEA which collects con…dential

enterprise-level data on U.S. foreign direct investment.14 Our data is extracted from the

      The BEA conducts annual surveys of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad where U.S. direct investment is

manufacturing parent …rms. We calculate the technical complexity of each …rm j; RDj ; as

the ratio of the parent …rm’s R&D spending to the parent …rm’s total sales. Each a¢ liate

in each country k is linked to a unique parent …rm, allowing us to construct the variable

EN T RYjk , which is equal to one if parent …rm j owns an a¢ liate in country k and is zero

otherwise; this is the dependent variable for estimation equation (23). The local sales variable

Rjk in estimation equation (22) is constructed by aggregating the sales to local customers

of all the a¢ liates in country k owned by …rm j. The cost share of intermediate inputs

imported from the parent of …rm j by its a¢ liates in country k, Mjk =T Cjk (see equation

21), is constructed by dividing total imports of all a¢ liates from their parent by the total

cost of goods sold.15


The Scope and Technological Complexity of Exports by U.S. Parents to their Af-

…liates Hypothesis 4 posits that a¢ liates’imports from their parent …rms should become

more concentrated in technologically complex intermediates as trade cost increase. This

de…ned as the direct or indirect ownership or control by a single U.S. legal entity of at least 10 percent of the
voting securities of an incorporated foreign business enterprise or an equivalent interest in an unicorporated
business enterprise. A U.S. multinational entity (MNE) is the combination of a single U.S. legal entity that
has made the direct investment, called the U.S. parent, and at least one foreign business enterprise, called
the foreign a¢ liate. The International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act requires that …rms …le
detailed …nancial and operating items for the parent …rm and each a¢ liate.
  15
     For robustness, we also constructed several alternative measures using di¤erent measures of intermediate
imports. One concern is that FDI is sometimes associated with wholesale distribution activities, as opposed
to production and assembly. To ensure that imports are actually intermediates, we used a variable de…ned
as intended “for further manufacture.”Results obtained using this narrower measure are very similar to our
primary measure and are reported in Table A1 of the Appendix.

diate (b
       zN ) and the size of shipping costs (   N ).   An increase in zbN implies that the set of

intermediate inputs that are imported decreases and that the average technical complexity

of the intermediate inputs in that set increases. Note that this hypothesis does not involve

any cross-industry or cross-…rm variation, only variation across countries.

   To test Hypothesis 4, we de…ne two country-level variables: SCOP Ek , which is the

number of products exported from U.S. parents to their foreign a¢ liates in country k, and

T CP Xk , which is the average technical complexity of exports from U.S. parents to their for-

eign a¢ liates in country k. We then regress each of these variables on the size of transport

costs to country k, F Ck . According to Hypothesis 4, the coe¢ cient on F Ck should be nega-

tive when SCOP Ek is the dependent variable and positive when T CP Xk is the dependent

variable. To control for countries’ability to absorb technology, we include the set of country

countrols Xk in each of these regressions.

   Our measures of the scope and technological complexity of U.S. intra-…rm exports are

constructed from data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Labor.16

the countries in our BEA dataset. There are 500 NAICS six-digit manufacturing industries.

While some of these exports are from U.S. a¢ liates of foreign parents to their foreign parents,

the BEA data reveal that, in the aggregate at least, most of these exports are from U.S.

parents to their foreign a¢ liates.17 Our data are for the year 2002.

       Let Exik be the value of related party exports in commodity i from the U.S. to country

k. We measure the scope of U.S. related party trade across country as follows

where f1jExik > 0g is an indicator function equal to one if exports of commodity i to country

country k as follows

where T CPi is the complexity of the technology for commodity i. For robustness, we consider

two alternative measures of T CPi . The …rst is based on the average complexity of occupations

used in the manufacture of these commodities. The second is the skill intensity of each

commodity.

       The occupations data is less familiar, so we provide more details on it (our construction

  17
    The BEA data report that in 1997, the aggregate shipments of U.S. parents to their foreign majority
owned a¢ liates was $193 billion while the aggregate shipments of U.S. a¢ liates to their foreign parents was
only $28 billion.

broadly follows Costinot et al. 2008). From the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational

Information Network (O*NET ) we obtained an index of the importance of complex problem

solving skills for each of 809 occupations as de…ned in the Standard Occupational Classi…-

cation (SOC) system. Importance is measured on a scale of 0 to 100, and “complex problem

solving skills”is described as the need to “identify complex problems and reviewing related

information to develop and evaluate options and implement solutions.”To faciliate matching

these occupational measures to industrial data, we …rst aggregated occupational complexity

data to 22 two-digit occupations, using the share of each 6-digit occupation category and na-

tionwide employment weights. The resulting measures of occupational complexity were then

merged with data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’Occupational Employment Statistics

for 2006, which provides employment information on each occupation by 4-digit NAICS in-

dustry categories. Using occupational employment shares by industry, we calculated T CPi

in each of 86 4-digit NAICs manufacturing industries.18 For the skill-intensity based measure

of T CPi ; we compute each commodity’s skill intensity as the ratio of non-production workers

to production workers in each 6-digit NAICS industry from employment data reported in

the 2002 Census of Manufacturing.19

       Finally, for each country we obtain measures of the size of transport costs F Ck between

the U.S. and country k and a set of country variables Xk to control for unobserved variation

in factor costs, market size, and other factors. We follow Brainard (1997) in constructing

  18
     Our concordance is not perfect because technical complexity is measured at the four digit level while
the trade data is at the 6-digit data. To avoid losing important variation in the extensive margin of trade,
we apply each measure of commodity technical complexity to several 6-digit commodities.
  19
     We also experimented with trade share based weights rather than simple averages. While the coe¢ cients
on some of the controls were di¤erent, the coe¢ cient on F Ck was very similar.

is the ad-valorem measure of c.i.f imports divided by f.o.b. imports into the United States

demeaned the data by industry and kept only country-speci…c averages obtained from this

demeaned data.20

       To control for variation across countries in the mark-up adjusted demand level and for a

country’s ability to absorb foreign technology, we include in many speci…cations the logarithm

of a country’s GDP per capita, GDP P C, and the logarithm of its population, P OP . Both

measures are for the year 1994 and were taken from the Penn World Tables. Because intra-

…rm trade can be used to shift pro…ts in response to variation in country taxes rates, we

also include the logarithm of each country’s maximum corporate tax rate, T AX, which was

taken from the University of Michigan database. The means and standard deviations of

each dependent and independent variable for each dataset are shown in the Table 1. The

descriptive statistics for the …rm-level multinational dataset is reported in the upper portion

of Table 1. It contains information on the activities of over 5,400 a¢ liates of 1,055 parent

    Anderson and Van Wincoop (2004) discuss the measurement of trade costs in great detail. They suggest
a number of imperfect measures of trade costs and the issues associated with aggregation. In future work,
we plan to explore the importance of additional measures of trade costs, including measures that incorporate
trade policy related barriers such as tari¤s and non-tari¤ barriers.

Empirical Results We …rst examine the trade-o¤ between imports and local production

as transport costs change (Hypothesis 1). The results for estimating equation (21) using the

…rm-level BEA data are reported in columns (1) and (2) of Table 2. In column (1) coe¢ cient

estimates are reported which correspond to the speci…cation that excludes country controls,

while they are included in column (2). All regressions include …rm-level …xed e¤ects, and

the standard errors, reported in parentheses, are robust to heteroskedasticity. We see that

as predicted by the model, the coe¢ cients on transport cost, F C, in both columns (1)

and (2) are negative and statistically signi…cant, while the coe¢ cients on the interaction

between R&D intensity and transport cost, RD          F C, in both columns are positive and

statistically signi…cant. The cost share of intermediates imported from the parent …rm is

declining in the size of transport costs, but the rate of this decline is slower for …rms that

trade in technologically relatively complex intermediates. The coe¢ cients on the control

variables in column (2) indicate that other country characteristics in‡uence the cost share

of intermediates imported from their parent …rm. The negative coe¢ cient on GDP P C

indicates that a¢ liates in less developed countries rely more on imported inputs than a¢ liates

in developed countries. This result suggests that a¢ liates in developing countries face more

serious technology transfer costs than in developed countries.

   These results are robust to a number of speci…cation changes. First, instead of exploiting

only variation within a given multinational …rm, implied by the inclusion of …rm …xed e¤ects,

we have repeated the analysis by exploiting within-industry variation. Table A1 in the

appendix shows that this leads to similar results (columns (1) and (2)). Second, we employ

a narrower de…nition of a¢ liates’ imported intermediates, imports of goods intended for


                                              32
further manufacture. This will exclude wholesale distributors from our sample, for which

our model arguably applies to a lesser extent. Using this imports measure generates almost

identical results (see columns (3) and (4) of Table A1). In addition, we have experimented

with using data on a¢ liate imports from the multinational parent and all other U.S. entities

to see whether outsourcing of intermediate production is a serious concern for our inferences.

However, the results using this import data were virtually identical to those obtained using

our preferred measure. To sum up, we …nd strong evidence for Hypothesis 1: technological

complexity a¤ects the trade-o¤ between a¢ liate imports and local a¢ liate production in the

way the model predicts.

   Next we provide evidence on the in‡uence of costly technology transfer on the intensive

margin of a¢ liate operations (Hypothesis 2). Results for the estimating equation (22) are

shown in columns (3) and (4) of Table 2. In both columns, the coe¢ cients on F C are

negative and statistically signi…cant, and the coe¢ cients on RD F C are also negative and

statistically signi…cant. This con…rms our Hypothesis 2: we …nd that, holding …xed the

…rm, a¢ liates in countries where transport costs are high are smaller and hence they sell

less, and this e¤ect is more pronounced for …rms with relatively complex technologies. These

e¤ects are robust to controlling GDP per capita and country size as shown in column (4).

The results suggest that after controlling for a country’s level of development and size, the

marginal cost of production is rising in transport costs, and that holds particularly for …rms’

that sell technologically relatively complex products. Moreover, these results are con…rmed

in speci…cations employing industry- instead of …rm …xed e¤ects (see columns (5) and (6) in

Table A1).


                                             33
   The analysis so far con…rms two central implications of our model of costly technology

transfer. On the one hand, because costly transfer raises a¢ liates’ marginal costs, they

reduce sales particularly strongly when they have most bite–which is for technologically

complex products. On the other hand, the impact of an increase in transport costs between

parent and a¢ liate is not as large for technologically complex products as it is for less complex

products. This is because for an a¢ liate to reduce its reliance on imported intermediates

from its parent, it would have to be able to produce them locally, and that is relatively

costly when products are technologically complex. Our results provide strong evidence on

both channels through which costly technology transfer within the multinational …rm a¤ects

its operations.

   We now turn to Hypothesis 3, which concerns the extensive margin of a¢ liate activity:

high transport costs and complex technology reduce, everything else equal, the probability

that a …rm will establish a multinational a¢ liate in a foreign country (see equation 23). The

…fth and sixth columns of Table 2 report the coe¢ cient estimates for a linear probability

model of multinational a¢ liate entry. The coe¢ cients on F C are negative and statistically

signi…cant, and the coe¢ cients on RD       F C are also negative and statistically signi…cant.

These results con…rm Hypothesis 3 and support the idea that while a¢ liates’marginal costs

generally are increasing in transport cost, this rate of increase is particularly fast for …rms

with complex technologies.

   These results indicate that multinationals’marginal costs are rising in the transport cost

to their host country and that the rate of increase is fastest for …rms using complex tech-

nologies. There is also evidence that the technological complexity of some products explains

                                               34
why some …rms can substitute local production for intermediates imported from their parent

better than other …rms. We can bring to bear additional evidence on this by analyzing direct

measures of the scope and the technological complexity of U.S. multinational parent exports

to their a¢ liates. According to Hypothesis 4, the scope of multinational a¢ liate imports

from their parents falls as the transport costs between parent and a¢ liate rise, because

it becomes optimal to locally produce a larger set of intermediates. In addition, this also

raises the average technological complexity of a¢ liate imports, because the newly locally

produced intermediates are less technologically complex compared to those that continue to

be imported from the parent.

   In Table 3, we present results from employing our SCOP E and technological complexity

(T CP ) variables that support this hypothesis. Columns (1) and (2) of Table 3 report the

scope regression results. Columns (3) and (4) report the coe¢ cient estimates for the tech-

nological complexity of export regressions where technological complexity is measured from

occupational data. Columns (5) and (6) report the coe¢ cient estimates for the technical

complexity of export regressions where technical complexity is measured using skill intensity.

Standard errors robust for heteroskedasticity are reported in parentheses. For each set of

results, we report regressions with and without country controls.

   The statistically signi…cant coe¢ cients on F C in columns (1) and (2) indicate that af-

…liates in countries with high transport costs import a narrower range of intermediates

from their parents. The coe¢ cient estimate is not sensitive to controlling for a country’s

GDP per capita, the size of its population, or the corporate tax rate. We next turn our

attention to how the technological complexity of U.S. related party trade varies with the


                                             35
size of transport costs. Consider columns (3) and (4), which correspond to speci…cations

in which complexity is measured using the occupational composition of commodities. In

both columns, the coe¢ cient on F C is positive and statistically signi…cant indicating that

as the range of commodities imported by a¢ liates becomes narrower, the composition of

this trade is systematically shifting toward more technologically complex commodities. This

conclusion is reinforced by the results reported in columns (5) and (6), where complexity

is measured using the ratio of non-production to production workers. As transport costs

increase, the average skill intensity of U.S. related party trade is increasing. These results

strikingly support the mechanism present in our model: because technology transfer costs

make technologically complex intermediates hard to o¤shore, intra-…rm trade in these inter-

mediates is less sensitive to increases in transport costs than intra-…rm trade in less complex

intermediates.21

       Overall, the empirical analysis provides strong evidence in favor of the model. When an-

alyzing central hypotheses of our theory of costly technology transfer within multinationals,

we obtain precisely estimated parameter estimates in line with the model using data both

on individual multinational …rms as well as disaggregated information on the trade between

multinational parents and their a¢ liates.

       We conclude with the following section.

  21
    Additional results corresponding to speci…cations in which the dependent variable is in logarithms are
reported in the appendix, Table A2; they con…rm the results of Table 3.

4     Conclusions

Economists increasingly recognize that multinational …rms are the cornerstone of interna-

tional trade and technology di¤usion. These …rms intermediate much of trade ‡ows between

developed countries and are widely believed to be important conduits for knowledge ‡ows be-

tween nations. It should be of great concern to economists, therefore, that the geographical

reach of most multinationals is actually quite modest, particularly given that the traditional

treatment of the multinational …rm is built on the premise that …rms can perfectly repli-

cate their technologies abroad and so geography should play little role in the structure of

multinational activities.

    In this paper, we introduce a model of multinationals that demonstrates that explains

a rich array of multinational behavior by the interaction between physical transport costs

and technology transfer costs. As in much of the recent international literature, our model

considers physical transport costs and the ability of …rms to fragment their production tech-

nology into tradeable components. One key assumption is added: there also exist technology

transfer costs that are increasing in the complexity of components in the production process.

We show that the role of technology transfer costs manifests itself in the interaction be-

tween transport costs across countries and the technological complexity of …rms’production

technologies: as transport costs increase, …rms have an incentive to replicate increasingly

complex (and therefore hard to transfer) activities abroad. This gives rise to increasing

marginal costs of serving foreign markets as the size of transport costs increase. This is

our explanation of why multinational …rms tend to be much more successful in their home



                                             37
market compared to foreign markets.

   This simple mechanism gives rise to a set of important hypotheses that we can test. First,

the cost of intermediates imported from the parent in total a¢ liate costs should be decreas-

ing in transport costs between multinational parent and a¢ liate, and the rate of decrease

should be slower for …rms with relatively complex production technologies. Importantly, we

show that variation in this ratio is a su¢ cient statistic for variation in the marginal cost of

production facing foreign a¢ liates abroad. Second, because the rate of increase in marginal

costs is increasing in the complexity of a …rm’s production technology, the size of a¢ liate

sales such be decreasing in the size of transport costs but at a faster rate for …rms using rel-

atively complex production technologies. Third, the probability that a given multinational

opens an a¢ liate in a given foreign location should be decreasing in transport costs and the

rate of decrease should be faster for …rms using technically complex production technologies.

The fourth hypothesis is over the commodity composition of a¢ liate exports: as transport

costs increase, a¢ liates should concentrate their purchases of intermediates from their parent

in intermediates that are technologically more complex.

   To evaluate these hypotheses empirically, we show that the model’s central predictions

can be tested using rather simple estimating equations. Moreover, we employ information

on the activity of individual U.S. multinational …rms from the BEA, highly disaggregated

Census data on U.S. intra-…rm trade, as well as Department of Labor data on the problem

solving skills required for di¤erent occupations, among other data, to give the theory a

certain empirical content. The resulting data base is richer than what is typically employed

in empirical analyses of the structure of trade and multinational production, and arguably


                                              38
it is the best data that exists to address questions in this area.

   The empirical analysis provides strong evidence in favor of the model. For all four

hypotheses we obtain precisely estimated parameter estimates that con…rm the predictions

of the model. We …nd that when technologies are relatively complex, a¢ liates have less

opportunity to substitute for imports from their parent with local production. Moreover,

both the extensive and intensive margins of a¢ liate activity contract as transport costs rise,

and this is most strongly the case for …rms with relatively complex production technologies.

The range of imported inputs of a¢ liates also becomes more concentrated in technologically

complex intermediates as transport costs increase.

   There are a number of directions that we intend to work on in the future. First, the

empirical analysis in this paper has been based primarily on outward FDI, here the activity

of U.S.-owned a¢ liates in foreign countries. At the same time, the interplay of transport

costs, technology transfer costs, and factor price di¤erences can lead to important di¤erences

in the activities of multinational parents compared to a¢ liates, as we show with Proposition

1 above. These e¤ects can be investigated by comparing the activities of U.S. multinational

parents and foreign-owned a¢ liates that are located in the United States. Second, we will

study the economic importance of technology transfer costs in an aggregative model that

builds on the framework developed here.

All variables in all specifications are demeaned by firm. The variables FC, GDP, POP, and TAX are in
logarithms and RD is in levels. Robust standard errors are in parentheses below the corresponding
coefficient estimates. In columns (1) and (2), the dependent variable is the logarithm of the ratio of the
value of affiliate imports from their parent firms to cost of goods sold. In columns (3) and (4), the
dependent variable is the logarithm of total affiliate sales to local customers. In columns (5) and (6), the
dependent variable that is equal to one if the firm owns an affiliate and equal to zero otherwise.

 Appendix: Additional Equilibrium Conditions and
Results
   Here we provide additional results concerning parent …rms, close the model, and provide

a fundamental comparative static result. We begin by deriving the marginal cost of the

parent …rm, the sales revenue and pro…t directly generated by the parent …rm.

   Consider …rst the marginal cost of the parent. Substituting for cP ('; z) using (6), the

cuto¤ (7), and integrating by parts using (3), the parent’s marginal cost can be written

summarizes the e¤ects of technology transfer costs and physical shipping costs on parent

marginal cost. Because the parent …rm does not directly face technology transfer costs or

shipping costs it follows that CiA (') > CiP ('). Di¤erentiating equations (26) and (14), we

obtain the elasticities of the marginal costs of the parent …rm and its foreign a¢ liate in

industry i with respect to shipping costs between the north and the south:

                                                                                             i

An increase in   S   is associated with an increase in the marginal cost of both parent and
                                                                                           A   P
a¢ liate. There are two additional implication of (28). First, we have "CS ;i > "CS ;i because

a¢ liates rely more heavily on imported intermediates than their parents. Second, the elas-

ticity of marginal cost with respect to        S   is higher in relatively low-tech industries (high )

because lower-tech industries rely more heavily on intermediates imported from the South.

We summarize this result in the following lemma:

      Lemma 2: The elasticity of marginal cost of the parent …rm with respect to                   S   given
       P
by "CS is strictly less than the elasticity of the marginal cost of north a¢ liate with respect to
                 A
 S,   given by "CS .

      Following the arguments in the text, it is straightforward to show that the revenue

generated by the parent …rm of type ' in industry i is given by



                                       RiP (') = Ai CiP (')1             :



Because the parent …rm’s marginal cost is less than that of its a¢ liate, the parent …rm

should have larger sales than the a¢ liate and the pro…ts associated with these sales, which

are given by

                                   P         Ai CiP (')1
                                   i (')                            wN f          0;                    (29)


should be greater. Substituting (26) into this expression and rearranging yields the cuto¤

productivity level that a …rm must have before it is pro…table to serve its home market:

                                                    1
                                           wN f         1

                                           Ai
It should be clear from the fact that the marginal cost of the parent is less than the marginal

cost of the a¢ liate that '      bAi , which is a feature of most heterogeneous …rm models.

generate the following result concerning the e¤ect on changes in international shipping costs:

   Because the proposition does not consider variation across industries, we suppress the

industry subscript. First, consider the e¤ect of a reduction in the size of               S,   the cost of

This expression shows that the change in the mark-up adjusted demand level is proportional

to a weighted average of the elasticities of marginal costs with respect to the southern

transport costs for the parents and the a¢ liates and so dA=d                             S   > 0. Substituting this
