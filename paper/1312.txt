                                      ABSTRACT




        This paper studies the economic role of financial institutions in

economies where agents' incomes are subject to privately observable,

idiosyncratic random events. The information strLlcture precludes conventional

insurance arrangements. However, a financial institution——perhaps best viewed

as a savings bank——can provide partial insurance by generating a time pattern of

deposit returns that redistributes wealth from agents with high incomes to those

with low incomes, resulting in a level of expected utility higher than that

achievable    in simple security markets. Insurance is incomplete because the bank
faces a tradeoff between provision of insurance and maintenance of private
incentives.

I.    Introduction

     Economic     analysis   of   institutions,   including      that   of   financial

institutions such as banks,          is entering an important third stage of

development. Theoretical models of institutional organization are currently

being developed on a wide variety of fronts1 with a common emphasis on the

importance of private information, incentives and contract enforcement. This

third stage of economic analysis holds out the promise of providing

theoretical explanations of the patterns of institutional structure and

behavior catalogued in the initial stage, the detailed classificatory studies

initiated early in the present century.             Further, current theoretical

explanations promise to be more intellectually satisfying and empirically

relevant than earlier second-stage explanations that stressed amorphous

transactions costs.


      This paper investigates the nature of financial arrangements in an

environment where individual agents' incomes are subject to idiosyncratic

random shocks.        Risk averse individuals desire insurance against such

disturbances, but conventional insurance arrangements are not feasible because

these income fluctuations          are not publicly observed.            A financial

institution- -perhaps best visualized as a savings bank- -can provide partial

insurance by generating a time pattern of deposit returns that redistributes

income from agents with high incomes to those with low incomes, resulting in a

level of expected utility for depositors that exceeds other market

alternatives. Our development of this banking theory builds on the earlier

analysis of Diamond and Dybvig [1983] and stresses the similarity of expected

utility maximizing banking arrangements to optimal taxation of saving,

1
     See,   for example, Radner [1981] and Fama-Jensen [1982].
                                                                             2

analogous   to   discusioxis of income taxation by Mirrlees [1971]. As in the

public finance literature, the bank faces a tradeoff between provision of

insurance and maintenance of private incentives. Consequently, insurance is

typically incomplete.


   The organization of the remainder of the paper is as follows. In section

II, we specify the economic environment and individuals' preferences.       In

section III, we compare three market institutions: full insurance, autarky and

an ex post security market.         The former is not feasible given the

informational requirements of such a system, but serves as a useful "ideal."

An ex post security market dominates autarky, but neither provides insurance

against individual income shocks. In section IV, we discuss the nature of

banking and its provision of partial insurance in our economy, with an

explicit derivation and analysis of the nature of the optimal bank in a

limited (linear) class of candidate institutions.    In section V, we analyze

two topics concerning the relationship between deposit banking and ex

security markets: (I) an equivalence between deposit banking and an ex post

market in derivative claims and (ii) potential arbitrage opportunities

occasioned by simultaneous operation of deposit banking and markets in

underlying securities,     In section VI, we further consider the insurance

aspects of deposit banking in our model and the types of alterations that

would yield more conventional insurance companies. We also provide a summary

of our work and discussion of related ongoing research in section VII.


II. The Model Economy


   The hypothetical economy that we study has three periods: a planning

period (t0) and two periods with production and consumption (tl,2), as in

Diamond and Dybvig (1983).
                                                                                 3


Preferences


      There are an infinite number of agents, all of whom have the following

identical valuation of consumption goods in t       1,2.



(1)           U = G(u)

                               1-1 Ic c-l and G(u) = 1 u .
                         1-1/0 +                                 l-      These
where u(c1,c2)   [c1         c2      ]

preferences depend on three parameters: the discount factor 0 <            < 1; the

intertemporal      elasticity of substitution in consumption, 0 > 0; and   relative
risk       aversion toward random variations in lifetime wealth at known prices,

      0.


Endowments


      Each individual has an endowment of the single good in each period.        At

periods 0 and 2, all agents have identical endowments       and y2. At period 1,

each agent receives a privately observable income level y1(8)         y1 + 0, where

y1 is the level of per capita income at date 1. The idiosyncratic component

 of income, 0, has expected value of zero and is continuously distributed on

 (0,9) with strictly positive density function f(0).         As our model has a

 continuum of traders, who may be indexed at date 1 by the realized value of 0,

 each value of the distribution is realized. That is, there are no 'aggregate

 shocks' in our model because per capita income is simply y1.


 Production Opportunities


       In addition to these endowments, agents have intertemporal production

 opportunities--storage technologies--of two types.          The first type (A)

 transforms a unit       of goods stored at t   into a unit of goods at t+1.     The
                                                                                                 4

period    t+2. The B storage technology is illiquid in that no output can be

retrieved from a period t investment at period t+l. Table 1 indicates the

time structure of production in our economy.

                                                                                                 1

    Throughout our discussion, we denote the fraction of initial wealth ()

invested   in the process A as k.


Consumption Demand and Lifetime jit


    In the bulk of our discussion below, we will view our individual agent as

facing sequential market opportunities with (1) the rate of return r0 earned

between t=0 and t1; and (ii) the rate of return r1 earned between t1 and

t=2. Thus, upon realization of 6 at t1, our agent maximizes (1) subject to

the constraint


             + c2/r1        r0 +           +
                                   y1(O)        y2/r1       a(r0,r1,6).


Preferences represented by (1) imply that the consumption demands are
proportional to wealth
                                                                                5

(3)        c = h(r1)   a(r01r1,0)

           c2   r1(l-h(r1)) a(r0,r118).


where h(r1) =
                 [l+r1     1.] is the first-period propensity to consume out of

wealth.


       In these settings, because our agents face uncertainty about "lifetime

wealth," we can separate the effects of attitudes toward risk aversion from

those concerning the time pattern of consumption. That is, once individuals

enter period 1, they face neither uncertain income nor risky assets. Lifetime

utility, but not the consumption strategy, depends on the risk aversion

parameter .       To   see this, recall that lifetime utility has the form
G(u) =    u1/(l-fl,    where u(c1,c2) is the CES function specified above. The

maximized value of u, which we denote v, is linear in wealth


(4)
           v u(c,c) (r1)a(r0,r1,0)

where a(r1) =                  is the marginal effect of a change in wealth.
                 h(r1)1'U0)
Thus, lifetime realized utility--conditional on a value of 0--is


(5)        G(v) ---    [a(r1)][a(r0,r1,0)],
where (as discussed above)          controls the individuals' aversion to bets on

lifetime wealth. For 3 > 0, individuals are risk averse.


III.    Markets, Insurance and Liquidity

       A useful starting point for our analysis is consideration of three

alternative 'trading arrangements' that might arise in our economy.
                                                                                       6

C9je
    The case of complete insurance is a useful benchmark case.                 In this

benchmarking discussion, we assume that individual incomes/outputs are

publicly observable at zero cost, although this strictly violates the

character of our economic environment as detailed above. Since enforceable

contracts must be contingent on observable variables, public knowledge of

endowments allows standard insurance policies.


    As idiosyncratic income (8) has zero mean, each individual should be able

to fully and costlessly insure against 8 at date t0. This insurance is

desirable so long as individuals are risk averse.


    With full insurance arranged at date t0, individuals need not engage in

any other market transactions. That is,, they may directly invest in process A

and process B to the points that are efficient given the returns implied by

this technology (r01 and r1R). These investments will yield the consumption

levels shown in Figure 1, where c1 =   h(R)a(l,R,O)   and c2 =       R[l-h(R)ja(l,R,O),
where the post-insurance value of wealth is just      +        +          a(i,R,O).2

Aut arky



    The polar extreme to the regime of perfect insurance is autarky, in which

an individual agent cannot make any trades.3 In autarky, our model implies

that agents face two types of uncertainty as a result of 8, which are

illustrated in Figure 2a.   For a given value of k, the fraction of wealth

2 In our analysis, here and below, we assume that  is sufficiently large
  relative to y1 and y2 so that market equilibrium takes place "off the
  corner" at the aggregate level as shown in Figure 1. That is, individuals
  will want to save some portion of .

  This might be viewed as the outcome of an explicit restriction on trade or
  on information that rules out exchange of investments, securities, etc.

 uncertain liquidity.        The first of these involves parallel shifts in the

budget line (M] A2) induced by variations in 8. The second of these involves

variation in the position of the vertical segment (LL').


    With a historically determined value of k, our individual may find that a

particular realization of 0 has confronted him with one of two possible

situations, as illustrated in Figures 2b,c.               In Figure 2b, the agent has a
high draw of 0 and 'regrets' that more was not invested in process B, as he

faces a return of 1 <        R    in his current use of process A. In Figure 2c, the

agent has a low draw of 8 and 'regrets' that so much was invested in process

B, as he would like to 'borrow' at the return of 1 reflected by the short-term

process.     Efficient selection of k involves trading off these costs and

benefits, which we discuss in detail in Appendix A.                   We demonstrate two

appealing results, First, in autarky, agents hold more of the liquid asset
than under full information.              Second, agents will always hold some of the
illiquid asset (k <    1),       trading off the consequent possibility of illiquidity

for higher returns (R >          1),   if initial wealth is sufficiently large.


Ex Post Security Market


   In autarky, at date 1, there are some individuals who would like to sell

part of their investments in technology B (those that have low values of 0

and, hence, are liquidity constrained) and some who would like to buy Units of

B since these offer a superior return to the alternative of reinvesting in A

(i.e., R >   1).    We now introduce an ex p security market on which such
trades can take place.

      On   this   market, c1aiis on type B storage may be bought and sold, so that

the strategy of storing at date 0 and selling off at date 1 generates another

'liquid asset' for the agents in this economy. As a convention, let one share

be a claim to a physical unit stored at date 0 and let P denote its price at

date 1.


      At date t1, agents have the following budget constraint,


(6)
             c1+Pqk+P(l-k)+y1+8
in which k is the predetermined fraction invested in the short term asset and

in which q is holdings of the long term asset chosen at t1. Thus,
consumption at t=2 is given by c2 =
                                           y2 + Rq. Equivalently, the two period
consumption opportunities are given by

                                             Py2
(7)
            c1+c2=k+P(l-k)+y1++8.
Solving for a rational expectations equilibrium involves four stages:          Ci)

finding an agent's optimal consumption profile, subject to the date 1 budget

constraint, at given P; (ii) finding the P that clears the asset market, given

the supply of long term assets, (l-k); (iii) finding an optimal date 0 choice

of k given that agents know the value of P that will prevail; and (iv)

requiring that date 0 market equilibrium occur. A modest amount of intuition,

however, suggests that our economy will have the following solution: P1 and

        where k1 is full information portfolio share discussed above.' That is,

with our CES preference specification, the individual income distribution is

unimportant for the determination of date 1 prices and date U investments.

'
    Notice that in equilibrium, individual portfolio choice is indeterminate,
    because the strategy of buying a long-term asset at 0 and selling it at
    date 1 has the same return as the short term technology. However, market
    equilibrium requires that a 'representative agent' hold k1.
                                                                                          11


The ex post securities market banishes liquidity risk, as individuals can

trade claims to B storage at P1, as illustrated in Figure 3. However, since

agents are subject to income risk, expected utility E{G[a(R)a(l,R,6)J) is

lower than under the full insurance scheme.


IV. Alternative      Banking Structures

      In   this section, we explore some alternative banking structures that could

arise in the economic environment outlined in section 1 above. One important

object is to develop the welfare implications of alternative arrangements, as

our presumption is that competition produces banks that maximize the expected

utility of the representative consumer.


      Throughout our discussion, we imagine banks operating in the following

way. Individuals 'deposit' the initial endowment                     at date 0 with the bank,

which will pay an interest rate r0 from period 0 to 1 and r1 from period 1 to

2 on deposits held during these periods.


      Conditional on realization of 8, the individual decides on an amount of

funds to be withdrawn from the bank. From our discussion in section II above,

we know that we can write the optimal withdrawal pattern as


                                            -
(8)          w'(r0,r1,O) =   c(r0,r1,8)         y1(O)
                         =              +           +            -
                             h(r1)[r0       y1(O)       y2/r1)       y1(O).

where the second equality follows from (3) above.


      For the bank, assets must be structured so as to meet the deterministic

pattern of withdrawals, i.e., investment in the short-term technology so as to

meet period one withdrawals

That is, the bank creates a demand deposit that may be fully withdrawn at date

structures assets so as to satisfy the demands that will actually materialize

Clearly, (9a,b) restrict the range of feasible deposit returns (r0,r1).


Banking Without Income Insurance


       It is possible to interpret the ax post securities market as a deposit

banking institution, which provides a convenient starting point for our

discussion.     That is, selecting the deposit rates r0           1 and r1 = R,   it

follows that agents simply accomplish their consumption patterns just as

above, withdrawing more or less depending on 0.          These individual withdrawal

fluctuations were represented as security trades in the ax post market.


      Thus, this basic banking arrangement has some features that are typically

employed in analysis of banking markets: (i) interest rates on deposits are

equal to the returns on underlying securities over the relevant horizon

(r0 = 1 and r1 = R) and (ii) individual circumstances cause changes in deposit

balances that are stochastic, but cancel out across depositors.              In the

current setup, however, these individual "riskst' involve imply a lower level

of expected utility at date 0 than that obtained in the full insurance case,

so long as individuals are risk averse (G" <             0).   Thus, other banking

arrangements can potentially dominate this basic structure.
                                                                                                             14
       In   order for any banking                         structure to improve welfare        In tha

environment,          it   must redistribute wealth from the lucky (J >                     0)   to the unlucky

(6 <    0).       The limiting case of such redistribution is, of course, the full

information            redistribution scheme outlined above.                               A market banking

institution, however, must accomplish such a redistribution subject to

informational constraints, i.e., the private character of idiosyncratic

income, 6.             Consequently,                a tension arises between redistribution and

individual incentives that is analagous to the tradeoffs in the analysis of

principal-agent problems (e.g., Ross [1973]) and optimal income taxation (as

initially investigated by iirrlees [1971] and with a good overview provided by

Atkinson and Stiglitz [1980, sections 13-3,4]).


Deposit Rates and Income Insurance


   By raising the interest rate r0 and lowering r1, the bank can induce a

redistribution from agents with higher incomes to those with lower incomes.

We begin by considering a small increase in r0 and a small decrease in r1.

The bank, of course, must respect its budget constraint, which is obtained
from                                       =
             (9a,b)          as
                                             E[w(r0,r1,8)] + {r1(r0_E[w*(r0,r1,8)])}/R or,

equivalently, as             =
                                  r0       +
                                                (r
                                                -         -
                                                  R1)[y2 Ec(8,r0,r1)]. This constraint
requires that


(10)          0=              -       —1    -       —1

                  -               -             +         -l     -   R
                                                                         -1.._ 3c    2

When         we        evaluate             at
                                                           r1        R,      feasibility   simply      requires
       =               -

in r0 requires a decrease in
                                                 r1.
                                                                                           15

       The effects on expected utility can similarly be calculated by
differentiation.                             -




(11)       dU =                    +
                    E{G'-!-_)dr0        E{G'!_)dr1
                =                        -                      -
                                                                    *                 2
                    E{G'a(r1))dr0                E(G'a(r1)(y2       c2(0,r0,r1))}dr1/r1.

The form of this expression reflects that increases in r0 have an identical

wealth effect on all consumers, where a is the marginal benefit (in u units)

of a unit of period 1 wealth. As discussed above, a is invariant to 0 in our

CES example. By contrast, the wealth effect of an increase in r1 is largest

for individuals who are the greatest lenders in period 1, i.e., for those whom

   <<
        c(0).       Imposing the condition that dr0 and dr1 be feasible and

rearranging the resulting expression, we get

                              *                        2
(12)       dU =                    -
                    a(R)E{G'(c2         Ec2))dr1/r1.

With risk aversion, G" <           0,   the covariance term is unambiguosly negative, so

that a small decline in r1 raises welfare. Intuitively, by- raising r0 and

lowering r1, the bank has shifted wealth from those with high 0's to the

average individual.         In effect, at date 0, the bank offers an individual

security that has a certain date 1 expected return (dr0) and pays off

negatively when high 0's occur, so reducing individual risks.


Valuing Fractional Insurance


   The extent of the demand for insurance in our economy is best measured by

the price that individuals would pay for artificial assets with individual-

specific returns. That is, for any individual at date 0. wealth is a random

variable a(r0,r1,0) because of the idiosyncratic component of individual
  :;o, Extd u               liy        E{&[( )ri,G)j                   (r    was defined
 above.



        Now, iiine constructing the artificial asset that has date 1
                                                                     "returi

                                                         Our individual would have
 expected utility unchanged if an infinitesimal amount of this claim was traded

 for       units of output in period 1 if


 (13)       E(G'}p - E{G'x(O)) = 0.


 Equivalently, the price must be less than unity if the covariance of x(8) with

 marginal (lifetime) utility of wealth is negative.

                       E{G'J

That is, our agent would 'price' such an asset
                                               by principles that accord with
the theory of finance (Fama and                                   in
                                         Miller, [1972]) and,          particular, with
recent theories that stress covariance with
                                                     marginal utility of lifetime
wealth, (Breeden [1979] and Grossman-Shjl].er          [1982]).        In our context,
however, the private character of information and absence of aggreate shocks

implies that (1) risk arises from the
                                            idiosyncratic disturbance, 8, and     (ii)
that no securities with these direct
                                              characteristics could be traded on
markets.


The   2pmal Linear Bank

      The tradeoff between insurance and incentives emerges when one considers
changes in r0 and r1 that are not small.             But the principal economic
institution behind the previous local results       extends to the optimal linear
                                                                                           17

banking structure, which we derive in Appendix B.                  In particular, the optimal

level of r1 satisfies


(15)           r1 R[2 +    62a       ]/[c2 +            + R62]

                 =
                     RZ(t2, 2T

The determinants of this optimal level of r1 are as follows. First, there is

a measure of intertemporal substitution, specifically £2 is the compensated

semi-elasticity of second period consumption demand with respect to its price,
                                                                    3c*
p2      hr .     That is, £     =-             >   0.    Second,          is the effect
           1                2
                                      c2 p2u
of a wealth increment on second period consumption. Third, 62 is the extent

of the 'risk premium' imposed by a representative private agent on a bet of

the form c(O)/Ec(8), which has expected return of one but covaries

negatively               with              lifetime                marginal          utility,

        -{cov(G',c(O))/EG'Ec(O)} > 0.


       Initially, note that r1 < R so long as agents are risk averse (62 >                 0),
which preserves the flavor of the local results above. Further, the higher

the risk premium ó2 the lower the level of r1, i.e., az/a62 < 0.                          This

accords with the idea, developed above, that                          it is a demand for
insurance--reflected in              -that motivates decreases in r1 and consequent

increases in r0. Two further elements enter the formula that were not present

above: higher values of second consumption response to the interest rate or to

wealth raise the efficient value of r1, i.e, z/32 > 0 and z/(}E_) > 0.

These additional effects can readily be explained by returning to the bank's

feasibility condition and exploring the effects of changes in r0 and r1 laid

out in (15) above. The bank receives a return R on funds held over from t1
 t t2, but must pay out only r1, yielding a 'surplus' that can be distributd

 as initial returns            The extent of this surplus can be illustrated by
                        r0.

writing   the budget constraint as

                       R-r
           (r0-l) =                  -
                      (-TJ)[rO
where the right-hand side is the surplus.               Now,- as there is a higher
substitution response (E2)      in   second period consumption, changes in r1 erode
the deposit 'base' [r0 -
                               Ew"(r0,r1,O)} more rapidly. Thus, the bank picks a
higher value of r1. Furthermore, wealthinduced changes in consumption enter

via r0 because an increase in r0 raises wealth and, hence, second period

                                ac
consumption by the amount -i-----
                                         3c

                                 0
spend most of the wealth increase in period 2, initially saving it. Because

the bank receives R on these deposits, the "surplus" has                       increased.

Conversely,, a low            implies consumers withdraw much of the wealth,

leaving the bank with a small deposit base and little surplus, able to pay

only a low r1.


   In fact, this idea of deposit base erosion brings us naturally to

discussion of a constraint not explicitly imposed in derivation of formula

(15) above. That is, in order for the income redistribution to work, it is

necessary that r1     1, so that depositors do not have an incentive to withdraw

at date tl so as to invest in technology A from period t1 to t2.


   Figure 4 illustrates the effects of banking on the welfare and
                                                                             consumption
levels of an 'average' agent, i.e., one with 0              0. The budget constraint
facing this agent reflects the fact that r1 <           R   under deposit banking and
induces a substitution from consumption in period 2 to period 1. The 'tax on
                                                                           19


saving' that the banking system• imposes lowers the welfare of this average

agent, since his consumption must fundamentally be constrained by the (per

capita) nature of social opportunities. Although the welfare of the 'average'

agent depicted in Figure 4 declines, the expected utility of agents (prior to

the realization of 0) is increased by deposit banking, because of a reduction

in the range of variability of individual circumstances.


Nonlinear Schedules and Ex Post Arbitrage


     A priori, nothing restricts the bank to a linear pay-off schedule.

Indeed, throughout our discussion, we have employed the analogy between

deposit banking and distributive taxation: Mirrlees [1971] and others have

explored non-linear tax structures in some detail.


     Although we have so far not made it explicit in our discussion and in

particular have not formally incorporated this constraint into Appendix B, we

assume that ex post arbitrage by groups of depositors would rule out any bank

contracts that made the interest rates r0 and r1 functions of withdrawal

amounts.    That is, even if depositors were limited to one withdrawal per

period, then nonlinearities in the bank schedules would make coalition

formation feasible and desirable.


V.   Deposit Banking and Ex Post Security Markets

1arkets in Derivative Claims


      The deposit banking institution discussed above utilized no resources but

was a pure intermediary, purchasing one set of claims and issuing another.

This observation suggests that similar insurance could be delivered by a

particular type of financial instrument without the demand deposit

characteristic.


      That is, suppose that at date 0 individuals can only purchase shares on a

"fund" that combines kB units of the short-term asset and (i_kB) units of the

long-term asset, where kB is the amounted invested by the optimal linear bank

discussed in the preceeding section. To make this conform as closely to our

previous discussion, let the "fund" announce that its policy will be to pay

share-holders interest equal to                per share at date 1 and use the

remainder of its income to repurchase its shares at the going market price

Let the amount of this repurchase in shares be        so that (r0-i)i +
                                                                              k.
Further, let the fund announce that it will pay shareholders r1 (principal

plus interest) at date 2 with its available funds r1(-ii) (KB)L Now,

suppose that the market price           is one and that   =
                                                              [Ew(r0,r1,6)-(r0-i))
is the announced repurchase amount. Then, it is direct that the levels of

bank rates r0,r1 are feasible from the perspective of the "fund". Further,

     =   1   is a rational expectations equilibrium price in the market for "fund"

shares since supply and demand for "fund" shares will be equated at that

price.


      Notice    that the "fund" does not have a policy of "pegging" the price of
its   shares at one, which is one interpretation of the bank's policy in section

IV    above.      Similarly, it is commonly observed that banks have date 1
                                                                                   22

 liabilities [(1+r0)} that exceed their date 1 cash flows [kB], which is

 sometimes asserted to lead to banking instability. The "fund" described above

 should not have such a problem.


    The fact that a market in this type of derivative security can replicate

 the allocations of the optimal linear bank has
                                                   important consequences for the
 analysis of Diamond and Dybvig (1983). These authors suggest that the demand

characteristic is a necessary outcome of environments where individuals

circumstances are subject to privately observable random shocks.5 They go on

to argue that banking runs--viewed as self-fulfilling expectations that all

agents will demand funds in period 1--are a consequent potential outcome of

this sort of environment.       The ex p market in the derivative security
outlined above would not be susceptible to runs and thus would dominate the

sort of bank deposit scheme considered by Diamond and Dybvig (1983).


Derivative Claims and Ex Ante Incentives


   Throughout the preceeding discussion, we confronted individual agents with

extreme choices of date 0: remain in autarky or purchase claims at date 0 from

the bank (by depositing one's funds) or from the "fund"            Now, we want to
imagine a single agent pursuing the following strategy: (i) at date 0, invest

a unit (part of fl   in   the long-term asset and (ii) at date 1, sell this to a

depositor from the bank at a price that the depositor will find yields a

higher return than the bank deposit, i.e., p      R/r1 -   , for   some c >   0.




  Diamond and Dybvig (1983) consider a two state model with preference shocks
  and a slightly different technology (see fn 6 below) but these differences
  are inessential for the present discussion.
                                                                                                 23

         Is this strategy profitable from the stand-point of our agent? The answer

turns on whether the rate of return from 0 to 1 exceeds the bank deposit rate

r0. That is, we want to know whether p >                    r    for some     >   0.     To discuss

this, we need to return to the bank's budget constraint in present value form,

as          that            links       feasible                and                    which     is
                                                     r0                 r1,

     =                      +                             This may be rewritten as
         Ew(r0,r1,8)            r1[r0-Ew(r0,r1,8)]/R.

              R/r1 -            =
                           r0

where       the right-hand term is positive for our bank as                             r0 > 1   and

Ew*(r0,r1,O) <         •.       Thus, it is possible to construct a price p that satisfies


                   <   p    <
                                R/r1

for any 0 <        t < (r0-l)/(-Ew),         with the choice of       reflecting the division

of the gains from trade between the two agents.


         Thus, there are incentives for individual agents to Ci)              not      join the bank

if others do and to (ii) induce bank members to withdraw balances to finance

asset accumulation rather than consumption. Basically, this result ref lects

the fact that the bank is engaged in insurance (redistribution) so that its

returns do not correspond to those given by the technology (in particular, the

return                      Similar ex ante arbitrage opportunities (i.e., based on

decisions at date 0) would also occur in the "fund" case discussed above. The

incentives for individuals to avoid joining the bank in period 0 mean that

without binding contracts, the bank would not arise. This points out the

importance of refining the equilibrium concept employed in our analysis, a

subject which is on our agenda for further research.

 V. Comparisons of Alternative Structures

     In    autarky, each individual agent is subject to two types of private risks

 stemming from individual income fluctuations
                                                     (0): (1)   pure income risk and
 (ii) illiquidity risk, which arise from the interaction of the information

 technology (the private character of 0) and the
                                                      production technology (process
 B is irreversible).


    Ex          security markets remove the illiquidity risk from
                                                                         fluctuating
individual circumstances (9) by enabling agents to sell claims against the

returns from long term investment projects.
                                                    Consequently, in our setup, ex
p security markets dominate autarky, according to the expected utility
(pareto) criterion at date 0.6      Equivalently,    a simple banking arrangement,
could provide the necessary tpooling' of liquidity risks, as it replicates the

ex p security market. Such possibilities for pooling of liquidity risks

induce agents to invest more in long-term projects than they would under

autarky.


   The optimal linear banking structure provides agents with a higher level

of expected utility than such a. simple banking structure or an ex

security market, however, as it partially insures agents against income risks

as well as fully against liquidity risks.           The provision of insurance is
typically incomplete because the bank faces a tradeoff between insurance and
6 This result
               contrasts to Diamond-Dybvig [1983], who show an equivalence
  between autarky and ex p security markets, in a model where agents are
  subject to individual (privately observable)
                                                  preference shocks.  If our
  technology B is modified to be partly reversible, with
                                                         payoffs (1-b) at t1
  and R at t=2, then ex post security markets
                                               will dominate autarky so long
  as b > 0, i.e., there is a positive
                                         opportunity cost to investing in B
  rather than A. If b=0, the only
                                    technology B will be employed and agents
  will face no ttiliiquidity risks" in autarky.
                                                     Thus, there will be an
  equivalence of autarky and ex p security markets as only pure income
 risks will be relevant in each case.      Further, no trade will occur on these
 ex post markets.
                                                                             25

incentives for saving. Relative to ex post security markets, banks offer

higher short term yields (r0>l) and lower long term yields (r1<R). The

banking-insurance mechanism induces substitutions that imply that more

investment will take place in projects of shorter duration. Without income

uncertainty (if 620), an optimal bank would set r0 =      1   and r1 = R,   thus

serving no economic purpose.


   In viewing an economic role of banking as providing insurance against

unobservable private risks, it is useful to consider two related insurance

concepts. First, in environments where there are substantial idiosyncratic

private risks, borrowing and lending can serve as 'buffer' that permits long-

lived individuals to smooth consumption and, hence, reduce the risks of

individual shocks. However, this insurance role of saving is bounded as long

as agents have finite lives or are sufficiently impatient.7 Thus, we expect

that our results would be robust to extensions to more time periods. Second,

it is natural to ask why one sees both cooperative institutions such as

savings banks and companies providing traditional insurance. We believe that

traditional insurance typically arises when individual circumstances can be

verified but not costlessly.   (Townsend, [1979].) Consequently, equilibrium

insurance contracts involve 'deductability,' i.e., the decision by the insured

agent that particular events are not sufficiently costly to warrant payment of

verification costs. By contrast, the insurance provided by our 'savings bank'

scheme does not require state verification. Thus, these institutions coexist

because there are many types of idiosyncratic risks, with varying costs of

state verification.



  Grossman and Weiss [1982] suggest that the bond market can provide perfect
  insurance, but a careful reading of their discussion makes clear that
  incomes must be observable to obtain such a result.
                                                                                   26

    VI.     Summary and Conclusions

          In   this paper, we have discussed how a private financial institution--such

    as a savings bank--can provide partial insurance against fluctuations in

    individual incomes that are private information. In our model, fluctuations

    in individual incomes cause income and illiquidity risks in autarky. Lx

security markets or simple banking structures that are pure intermediaries can

remove illiquidity risks, but insurance against income fluctuations requires

that bank deposit returns differ from those on individual securities.

Insurance is partial because the cooperative banking institution faces a

tradeoff between insurance and (intertemporal) allocative efficiency.


          As macroeconomists, our principal interest in this framework is to have a

secure foundation for aggregate analysis and, consequently, several comments

are in order.           First, our formal model is the standard sort that most

macroeconomists have in mind when concerned with tmicro structure?: all agents

have identical preferences that can be aggregated, but individual agents

differ due to fluctuations in individual conditions that average out across

individuals (see, for example, Friedman [l969]), Yet, risk aversion and the

private character of individual income fluctuations, however, imply that

banking institutions of the sort discussed in section IV dominate conventional

market structures. Second, one might conjecture that responses to aggregate

disturbances--such as shifts in per capita incomes (y1,y2) or rates of return

(R) in our framework- -would be unaffected by the institutional structure,

since no risk pooling can occur against these shocks. But, in extensions to

our analysis, such an invariance to micro structure requires that aggregate

disturbances not be associated with changes in the dispersion of individual
8
     The trivial aggregation makes it easy for us to analyze ex p!t
     markets, etc.
                                                                            security
                                                                          27

income fluctuations. In fact, Haubrich [1983] demonstrates that the existence

of banks alters the temporal structure of equilibrium interest rates and

consumption-investment quantities    if there are effects of aggregate
disturbances on the income distribution.     Consequently, taking these two

observations together, explicit analysis of factors that lead to development

of specific institutional structures--such as private information--may also

alter our conclusions about aggregate responses.

                        Portfolio   Composition and Consumption in Autarky


   We discuss optimal decisions of the autarkic individual using the typical

dynamic programming method of recursive optimization..


Decisions at Date.1


   At date 1, our individual's portfolio composition (k) is predetermined.

The agent maximizes utility G(u) subject to the following two constraints:


(Al)       c1       y1 + 6   +k L(8,k)

(A2)       c1 + c2 y2 +             (l-k)R   +
                                                 (k+y1+6)
                                                             E   A(6,k).

The former of these constraints is the liquidity constraint. It does not bind

an agent if c1              h(l)A(O,k)       L(O,k).        With the liquidity constraint not

binding,        an        agent      has         indirect        utility   vNB(O,k) =   a(l)A(6,k).
Correspondingly, with the liquidity constrint binding, an agent has indirect

utility vB(O,k) [Ll +                   (A_L)l']0.                  In Figure A-i, we graph the

indirect utility function against 0. Notice that v is not linear in current

                                                                                             -
income, 6, when the constraint is binding, i.e., when 6 <                      U   c - y1
and that agents have a higher marginal utility of 6 over this range.


Decisions at Date 0


   At date 0, the autarchic individual selects k so as to maximize expected

utility, which is (A3) in autarky, where 6 is the value of k at which the

constraint just binds.


                I G(vB
                    0
(A3)   EU =          (0,,k))f(6)dO + I             G(v.NB (0,k))f(e)dO
                e
                                                                                                     30

The marginal expected utility of investment in the liquid asset is (A4). For

an interior optimum (0 <          k   <   1),   this must be set to zero.


             =
(A4)             G(vB(8,k))f(O)+ i—G((Ok))f(8)dO
             -                                                                   = 0.
                 G(vNB(O,k))f(8            +IG(vNB(8,k))f(G)d0



From Figure A-i, we know that vB(O) =                                       so that the first and third
                                                            vNB(O),
terms just cancel.


Efficient Investment in the Liquid Asset


   First, we demonstrate that an individual will subject himself to some

illiquidity risk in autarky, providing--as assumed in the main text--that

wealth is sufficiently large. Specifically, we require that if income is at

its lowest level1 y1 +         6, that

(A5)         +
                 y1
                      + 0 >
                              c       h(1)[(Ø +
                                                       y1
                                                            +   U   +
                                                                         y2].


   Now, consider evaluating EU/k at k                               1.     By Virtue of assumption (AS)

above, O(k = 1) < 8.          Consequently,


                  =
(A6)   3EU             f(vNE(e))lklf(e)de
                  = -(R-i)E{a(l)G'}              < 0



since R > 1.      This is a variant of Arrow's famous proposition [1964] that a

risk averse agent will always accept a small amount of a bet with positive

expected return.
                                                                                   31

        Second, we want to demonstrate that an individual will hold more of the

 liquid asset in autarky than with an ex post security market. Consider the

value kE that is efficient in an ex p security market. This satisfies


 (A7)
             IG(vNB(O,K))Jf(e)de = 0.

Now, consider the crossover value
                                          0E implied by kE. Above 0E agents are
equally well off in autarky and in an ex post security market. Evaluate
                                                                                 CM)
at kE. Then, it follows that


(A8)              =                -
                                       G(vNB(8,k))] IkEf(O)dO
The utility derived from a marginal increment of investment in the liquid

asset is always higher with the constraint binding for two reasons: Ci) as may

be seen from Figure A-i, the level of unconstrained "u unit" Utility (vB) lies

above the constrained level (vNB) and the strict concavity of G insures that

G' is diminishing in v; and (ii) the marginal "U      unit"   utility obtained from a

                                             Appendix B

   In this appendix, we present a detailed treatment of an optimal linear

banking structure or, equivalently, an optimal linear tax on saving.


   An individual private agent, with given value of period 1 income, chooses

an optimal consumption plan so as to maximize utility.

                          —1
where p2 =                      and T = r0. The outcome of this maximization is an
                 (r1)
indirect     utility function,             v(6,p2,T),
                                                            and a set of optimal decisions

                                          These are not the same functions as those
c(8,p2,T) and 4(6,p2,T).
discussed in the text, but it is easy to move from one to the other.


   In the CES case, u(c1,c2) =
                                             [cl/       +                  and the relevant

where h(p ) = [1 + a-(a-l)_l and a(p ) = h(p21 )l /l- is
independent of 8.               Further, we record for future use that the compensated

semi-elasticity

is independent of the scale of wealth, i.e., [y1(O) + T + p2 y2].


   The implied withdrawal behavior of an individual is w(8) =
                                                                                                              34

                                                                               h(p21)(p2 y2 + T)
c(8) - y1(8).        Thus, it follows that w*(U,p2,T) =

-
    (l-h(p2   ))y1(O).


     Prior to the realization of U, in period 0, an expected utility maximizing

bank or government will maximize


(B4)      E{G(v(O,p2,T))}


with respect to p2 =
                               r11 and T =              r0    subject to (1) a resource constraint

and (ii) the depositor's decision rules, c(8), c(8), and w(8). The basic

resource constraints for a bank are


(B5a) k = Ew*(O,p2,T)

(B5b)     R(l-k)         E[r1(r0 Ew(U,p2,T))]

For current purposes, it is convenient to combine and rewrite these as


(B6)      p2[ - Ew(O,p2,T)]                    -
                                                   R1[T   -
                                                              Ew*(8,p2,T)]             O



Using the fact that w"(8,p2,T) = T ÷ p2(y2 -                                                       the resource
                                                                               4(O,p2,T)),
constraint is


(B7)          [(-T)] -             -                -                       = 0.
                         (p2               R1)(y2       Ec(U,p2,T))

Forming the 'Lagrangian' for this problem,


          H      E{G(v(O,p2,T))} + X[-T -                             -            -
(B8)
                                                              (p2         R')(y2           Ec(8,p2,T))]

and differentiating with respect to T and p2. we get the following necessary

conditions for anoptimal linear bank.

                                                               9 c'

                                                                                    aEc*
  (B9b) -           =                       - A(y       -
                                                            Ec*) + "p -       R)          2   =
              p2                  p2                                                   p2
 The first of these conditions may be reorganized as


  (BlO)      .E{b(8)} =       1


                                                              ac*
 where b(O)         {G'a(6)/X + (p2 -                   R1) a1• Analagously,              using av/ap2

              -
                   *         -l ,T))        and the Slutzky decomposition
 a(p2              c2(6,p2
             3c= ac
                        — 2 c) + ac    -



 it follows that the second condition may be written as

                                               *                       -l )E{1—I}
                                                                            3c
                                               c2)} ÷
 (Bil)        EC(b(8)-l)(y2 -                                  -   R                = 0

 These conditions correspond to those                               of Atkinson and Stiglitz [1980,              pp.
 407-8] in the optimal linear income tax case, who provide the relevant

 interpretations in that setting.


  Solving the second necessary condition, and simplifying slightly, we find
                            *
            —1   cov(b(8),c2(O))
(Bl2) p,-R =
                                           *
                                   3c
                                                )
                                       p2 U

In   our framework, some further reorganization of this condition is useful. As

a, a4/aT and £2 are independent of 0, we may write this as
                                                    *

(B13)       p2 -   R

                             EG'Ec
                         =    eEC'

                                                                                                  a c*
                                   which has a unit mean, and £2 =                                       which
                                                                                         36

to its price p2 =          .   Further   simplification may be obtained by noting
                                                              8

we may write

(B14)    p2 -   R' =   2'2     +


The formula discussed in the text is a straightforward transformation of this

expression.
