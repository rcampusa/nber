                                             ABSTRACT

        Several recent proposals have advocated using the income tax system to collect user fees to
help fund the health care system. While there is a considerable amount of research investigating both
how individuals respond to tax incentives for employer provided health insurance and on the effects
of user fees payable at the point of service on the use of health care services, there is limited
evidence on how individuals respond to tax incentives when these are not realized until taxes are
paid.

        This paper uses existing exemptions in the Canadian tax code that allow individuals to

deduct the cost of health care or health insurance from their taxable income in order to identify the

tax price elasticity of demand for health care when price changes are realized at the end of the tax

year. Our results suggest that despite not realizing the tax benefit at the time of purchase, individuals

are quite responsive to changes in the tax price of health care. Our elasticity estimates for a wide

range of health care products are well within the range of traditional price elasticity estimates,

including in particular our estimates for prescription drugs. We also find some evidence that

suggests individuals trade off risk sharing through traditional insurance companies with risk sharing

through the tax code. That is, as the tax price of health care decreases, individuals spend more on

health care, but spend less on health insurance.

1. Introduction



      The tax system is one of the primary tools by which governments

provide assistance to people with high health expenditures. In the United

States, Canada, and elsewhere, governments exempt employer-provided

health care benefits from taxable income, thereby subsidizing the purchase of

health insurance through the workplace. The U.S. government has developed

other mechanisms by which individuals can shelter the cost of medical

expenses from taxes including Section 125 plans and Archer MSA accounts.

Recently, debate surrounding the growing number of uninsured in the U.S.

has focused on refundable tax credits as a mechanism for extending

insurance coverage to the uninsured (Goodman, 1999).

      In Canada several proposals have recently emerged which would use

the tax system as a mechanism for collecting benefit taxes for the use of

health care services. Such proposals either suggest the inclusion of health

care services as taxable income (Kent, 2000), the use of the tax system to

collect fees on a percentage of health care spending scaled by taxable income

(Aba, Goodman, and Mintz, 2002) or a tax credit against which health care

expenses would be deducted (Reuber and Poschmann, 2002). Proponents of

these plans argue that the existing tax structure would facilitate the

administration of benefit taxes for health care, and would also allow the

government to easily identify and exempt those populations that are likely to



                                       1
be unable to pay the benefit taxes. In every case, the response to such plans,

whether they be to insure the uninsured, or to collect benefit taxes, hinges on

how responsive individuals are to tax incentives.

      A considerable volume of previous research has investigated how

individuals respond to tax incentives for health insurance purchased through

an employer (see Gruber, 2001 for a review of the literature). There is also a

growing consensus among economists about how user fees payable at the

point of service affect the use of health care services (Glied and Remler,

2002). However, there is far less evidence on how individuals respond to tax

incentives when these benefits are not realized until taxes are paid. Despite

the fact that many countries allow individuals to deduct some portion of their

direct medical expenses from taxable income, the elasticity of demand for

medical care and medical insurance in such contexts remains at best poorly

understood.

      This paper uses the existing tax treatment of medical expenditures in

Canada in order to identify the tax price elasticity of demand for health care

when price changes are realized at the end of the tax year. We exploit

variation in the tax price of health care both within Canadian provinces over

time and across individuals within provinces to identify how individuals

respond to tax incentives reducing the price of both health care and health

insurance.




                                       2
      Our results suggest that individuals are quite responsive to changes in

the tax price of health care, even though the tax benefits are not realized at

the time of purchase. Our elasticity estimates for a wide range of health care

products are well within the range of traditional price elasticity estimates, as

are our elasticity estimates for spending specifically on prescription drugs.

      One notable feature of the Canadian system is that the tax credit

applies equally to taxpayers’ out-of-pocket medical expenses and to premiums

for private health insurance plans. As such, the system leaves the relative

price of market insurance and self-insurance unchanged, and individuals’

demand for insurance could either rise or fall, depending on second-order risk

tolerance considerations. Consistent with this view, we find some evidence of

a negative effect of the tax subsidy on private insurance premiums. That is,

as the tax price of health care decreases, individuals spend more on health

care, but spend less on health insurance.

      The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the

previous literature on tax subsidies and cost sharing in health insurance.

Section 3 explains the workings of the medical expense tax credit in Canada.

Section 4 describes the data used in the analyses. Section 5 outlines our

empirical strategy. Section 6 presents our results and section 7 offers some

conclusions.



2. Previous Literature




                                       3
        Through extensive empirical research, economists have developed a

good understanding of how cost sharing affects health care utilization. Most

of the literature focuses on two areas. The first estimates the price elasticity

of demand for health care. The most comprehensive study estimating the

price elasticity of demand for health care remains the RAND health

insurance experiment (Newhouse, 1993) which finds significant differences in

the use of health care services depending on the out-of -pocket price at the

time of use. Elasticity estimates in the RAND experiment are on the order of

–0.2. A second branch of the literature has examined the price elasticity of

demand for health insurance. Here, most researchers examine the demand

for employer-provided health insurance using variation in the tax-price of

insurance to identify the demand for insurance. For example, Gruber and

Poterba (1996) use variation created by the 1986 US Tax Reforms to examine

changes in the demand for insurance among the self-employed. Stabile (2001)

and Finkelstein (2001) use variation across and within provinces in Canada

to identify the price elasticity of demand for supplemental employer-provided

health insurance. In all cases, estimates of the price elasticties are generally

significant, but inelastic, ranging from –0.2 to –0.7.1



1
         Previous work has also examined the effects of deductibles on the demand for medical care
services (Keeler et al., 1977, Newhouse et al., 1980). The theoretical work shows that consumers who
expect to exceed the deductible in a given payment year will behave as though they do not face a
deductible, whereas those who do not expect to exceed the deductible will behave similarly to a an
uninsured individual. (Keeler et al., 1977).




                                                  4
      These estimates have, directly or indirectly, informed a more recent

policy literature examining the potential role for Medical Savings Accounts in

the health care system. Such accounts would involve employers or

governments providing a fixed amount of money to individuals each year for

health care services. Individuals would then be free to allocate these funds as

they see fit. Once the account maximum is reached, individuals are either

covered by catastrophic health insurance or face some “spending corridor” for

which all costs are paid out of pocket before catastrophic insurance kicks in.

In the event that the full account balance is not used in a given year it can

either be rolled over for future use or used for other purposes depending on

the specifics of the proposal. Variations on these proposals suggest using the

income tax system to administer tax credits to apply towards health care

(Reuber and Poschmann, 2002) or health insurance spending (Goodman,

1999). While there have been attempts to simulate the effects of this type of

cost sharing (Keeler et al, 1996; Eicher, McClellan, and Wise, 1996) these

studies generally rely on demand elasticities from the RAND experiment or

other sources in the literature and do not directly estimate whether

individual behaviour under MSA plans is similar to individual behaviour

under traditional cost-sharing arrangements.

      A number of policy analysts have advocated using credits or fees

administered through the income tax system to help manage health care

utilization (see Stabile, 2003 for a general review of such proposals).




                                       5
However, we are unaware of any previous literature that directly examines

the effects of cost sharing for health care services when the costs are not

borne at the time of use, but rather at the end of the fiscal year. Evidence

from other markets suggests that people may indeed respond differently

when they do not faces out-of-pocket costs at the time of use, but instead pay

later. For example, Gross and Souleles (2002) find that individuals change

their spending behaviour and the debt that they carry on their credit cards

with changes in their spending limits. It is therefore quite feasible that

estimates of the price elasticity of demand for both health care and health

insurance may be quite different depending on when out-of-pocket costs must

be paid for. There is also a related literature investigating the effects of

tuition credits for post secondary education in the United States. Long (2003)

investigates the effects of the Hope and Lifetime Learning Tax Credits which

provides aid for college expenses. Like the tax credits investigated here, there

is a significant delay between college enrollment and when the tax credit is

received. Two results from this literature may be useful for better

understanding the behaviour investigated here: first, despite the fact that the

tax credit is at the end of year, people still appear to adjust their behaviour

regarding educational choices. Long finds that students were more likely to

attend more expensive colleges as a result of the tax credit. Second, the take-

up of this credit is much lower that might be expected—only one third of




                                        6
individuals who are eligible for the school credit actually take it up. Both of

these findings will be consistent with the analysis we present here.




3. The Canadian Medical Expense Credit



       The current system of tax relief for medical expenditures in Canada is

based on a non-refundable federal income tax credit for qualifying medical

expenditures. Qualifying medical expenditures can be paid by or on behalf of

the taxpayer, his or her spouse, and dependant family members, and a claim

must be accompanied by receipts. A broad list of expenditures is prescribed

in the legislation, including:



  i.   payments to hospitals, doctors, dentists, and other health professionals

       for medical services;

 ii.   expenditures on a variety of medical devices, such as wheelchairs,

       prosthetic limbs, iron lungs, and so on, as well as hearing aids,

       dentures, and prescription eyeglasses;

iii.   the costs of full-time care in a nursing home or in the patient’s own

       home, including the costs of home renovations for disabled patients;

iv.    expenditures on prescription drugs; and

 v.    premiums paid for private health insurance plans.




                                        7
As this list suggests, the credit was conceived of by federal authorities as tax

relief for taxpayers facing catastrophic health costs and disabilities, but the

credit is far more broadly available. In Canada, most health care costs

incurred in a hospital or a doctor’s office are covered by publicly-funded

health insurance. Coverage for these services is first dollar and universal.

Despite this coverage, more than 30 percent of health care spending in

Canada is privately financed (OECD, 2001). Any portion of these privately

financed services not reimbursed by an insurance company is eligible for the

tax credit. No services reimbursed by a health insurance plan are eligible. A

significant fraction of taxpayers claims the credit each year (just over 10

percent of tax filers in 2000), and tax advisers and health-care providers

frequently advise clients on how to take advantage of it.2

         For the 2000 tax year, the system worked as follows: an individual

could claim a credit for 17 per cent for medical expenses in excess of either

$1,637 or three per cent of the individual’s net income, whichever is less;

however, the credit cannot reduce the tax liability below zero. (Since the 17

per cent rate was then the federal tax rate in the lowest income bracket, the

non-refundable credit therefore operated exactly like a deduction from

taxable income for expenditures over the threshold amount, except that the

treatment is more favourable for taxpayers in low brackets than high

2
  For example, an advertisement for one cosmetic surgery practice explains the intricacies of the credit to
prospective patients through an example and concludes, “your facelift would qualify for a 22 per cent
rebate”.


                                                      8
brackets.) Since the 1997 tax year, some claimants have also been eligible for

a supplementary credit, equal to 25 per cent of the basic credit amount, up to

a maximum (in 2000) of $507. Unlike the basic credit, the supplementary

credit is refundable for taxpayers without taxable income, and the

supplement is reduced by five cents for each dollar by which the claimant’s

adjusted net income exceeds $17,664.

      The effect of both the basic and supplementary credits is to reduce the

after-tax price of health care expenditures, but the precise magnitude of the

marginal subsidy is complicated. Figure 1 depicts the notional budget

constraints under the various regimes facing a household which chooses a

bundle consisting of health care services H and a composite, taxable

consumption good C. The dotted line, closest to the origin, represents the

budget constraint that would apply if health care expenditures were fully

taxable, and the household’s taxable income were Y. The budget constraint

for the basic credit regime, which applied prior to 1997, is represented by the

line BEY: health expenditures in excess of the threshold H0 (which depends

on income) are eligible for the federal credit rate. The budget constraint for

the supplementary credit regime introduced in 1997 is represented by the

line ADEY: expenditures between H0 and H1 are eligible for both credit and

supplement, while higher amounts are eligible for the credit alone.

      Thus the “tax price” of health care expenditures facing each taxpayer

depends on the level of expenditures chosen. Importantly for our work,




                                       9
however, the tax price varies for reasons unconnected with the household’s

choices. As noted previously, the first threshold level is the lesser of 3 per

cent of net income and a dollar amount that has varied annually. The second

threshold level is in turn a decreasing function of income, with the maximum

supplement fully taxed back for taxpayers with net income over $27,804.

        As well, the tax price in both ranges differs among households. In all

provinces but Quebec, provincial income tax liabilities have been calculated

as a surtax on basic federal tax minus federal non-refundable credits

(including the medical expense credit). Consequently, the effective credit rate

in these provinces was increased from 17 per cent to 17(1+ tp) per cent, where

tp is the provincial surtax rate, which ranged between 0.44 and 0.62 in 2000,

and which have varied in each province over time. In Quebec, provincial tax

liabilities are calculated as a function of income rather than federal tax, so

that the federal credit does not have a cascading effect on provincial

liabilities. However, Quebec operates its own credit and refundable

supplement for medical expenditures which has roughly paralleled the

federal system, but which is somewhat more valuable than the implicit

credits offered by the other provinces.3 Furthermore, prior to 1987, tax relief

for medical expenses was implemented as a deduction rather than a credit.

Consequently, for 1986 (the first year in our sample), the effective subsidy

3
  The basic credit in Quebec applies to expenditures in excess of 3 per cent of net income, with no
maximum amount for the threshold, unlike the federal credit. The refundable supplement is available only
to taxpayers with employment income, and is taxed back in roughly the same way as the federal
supplement. Of course, Quebec taxpayers are eligible for the federal credit and supplement on their federal
tax liabilities, in addition to the provincial tax relief.


                                                    10
rate was equal to the taxpayer’s actual marginal tax rate on income, rather

than the low bracket rate that applies under the credit regime.



4. Data



      We use data from the Family Expenditure Survey (FAMEX) and its

successor, the Survey of Household Spending (SHS), from 1986 through 2000.

The FAMEX is a cross sectional Canadian data collected approximately every

other year. Respondents are asked detailed questions on family income and

expenditure, including a module on health care spending. The income and

expenditure data are collected for the entire preceding year (so, for example,

the 2000 survey is conducted in 2001). Income and demographic data for both

the reference person and the spouse of the reference person includes income

before taxes, earned income, self-employment income, transfer income,

investment income, sex, age, marital status, and number of children.

(Questions on educational attainment of respondents were discontinued in

1997.) Health care expenditures include direct health care expenditures for

the household (such as medical and dental services, prescription and over the

counter drugs), spending on health insurance premiums not reimbursed by

government or employer-provided health plans, and so on. All expenditure

amounts are collected for the family as a whole, which is also the unit for




                                      11
which expenditures are eligible for credit under the Medical Expense Tax

Credit.

      We calculate detailed tax information for all the observations in our

sample. Tax information is based on the income and demographic

information available in the FAMEX and SHS surveys and is calculated

using a Canadian tax rate calculator developed by Kevin Milligan at the

University of British Columbia. Tax information includes the individual’s

marginal tax rate, average tax rate, and total tax burden. In addition to this

information we construct a module to provide us with the marginal tax price

of health care under the medical expense tax credit (which is different from

the individual’s marginal tax rate on earned income), the dollar thresholds at

which each household begins and ceases receiving the credit and supplement,

and the tax price of the first dollar of creditable expenditure.

      We report means and standard deviations for the main variables in the

sample (calculated for all survey years) in Table 1. Mean health care

expenditure is $1025 in 1991 Canadian dollars. The mean expenditure on

health insurance premiums is $322. Total expenditures for the entire family

averaged $43,149. Average individual income is $26,959, and the average tax

price in the sample, including all individuals who do not qualify for the credit

and hence have a tax price of 1, is 0.907. The average tax price for the sub-

sample of individuals who qualify for the credit is 0.714. Forty percent of

families in our data have sufficient health care spending to qualify for at




                                       12
least $1 of credit, however it is very unlikely that anyone who only qualified

for a $1 credit would go through the effort of claiming the medical expense

tax credit on his or her return. Imposing a cutoff of, say, $50 in tax reduction

as a requirement for applying for the credit, and restricting the sample to

those who actually owe taxes, 16 percent of families in our data would receive

the credit. This number is almost identical to the numbers given in the

government’s aggregate taxation statistics, which report that approximately

15 percent of filers with taxable incomes apply for the credit (Canada

Customs and Revenue Agency, 2002).

      Who takes up the medical expense credit? The Canadian Customs and

Revenue Agency provides information on take-up of the credit by individual

income group for the 2000 tax year. We report these rates as a fraction of

either total returns or taxable returns in the first two columns of table 2.

Unfortunately we have no way of knowing what percent of individuals

actually take-up the credit as a fraction of those eligible for the credit. Take-

up rates decline with income, primarily due to the income scaled threshold.

The threshold reaches its maximum at approximately $53,000 in taxable

income and, as shown in Table 2, the take-up rate also appears to level off at

about 5 percent at and above $60,000.

      We report take-up in the FAMEX in two ways: first we include all

families whose health care spending exceeds the minimum threshold for a

credit, and second we impose a minimum claim of $50 (and hence a tax price




                                        13
less than 1) in order to be counted as taking-up the credit. This second

method is comparable to the second column of Table 2, but will

underestimate take-up for low-income families in our sample. Take-up rates

also decline in the FAMEX data, although the declines are less pronounced.

While it is difficult to fully understand who takes up the credit and why, the

most likely causes of the discrepancy between suggested take-up in the

FAMEX and the actual take up rates are that individuals are either not

aware that the credit exists, or do not take the steps required to file for the

credit. Both of these causes would bias against us finding a significant tax-

price elasticity of demand for medical care.

      Finally, as noted above, any individual within the family can claim

health care expenditures for the entire family. In order to maximize the

benefit, the lowest income individual for whom the whole credit can apply

should claim the credit. In our analysis, however, we assume that the

primary survey respondent is the individual who claims the credit. This

assumption would again bias against us finding a significant tax-price

elasticity of demand for medical care.



5. Empirical Strategy



      Our analysis exploits variation in the individual tax price generated in

four ways, as outlined above. First, there are changes within provinces over




                                         14
time generated by changes in provincial income tax rates. Second, there is a

large change in 1987 from tax deductions to tax credits, which significantly

increased the tax price of medical care by different amounts depending on the

individual’s federal tax bracket. Third, Quebec’s separate tax collection

program offers provincial credits for medical credits which are higher than

those in other provinces and which also changed over time. Fourth,

supplemental tax credits for medical care expenses were added to the tax

code in 1997, the amount of which differs by income, province, and year.

While we exploit all these sources of variation, we have also re-estimated our

models excluding each source of variation separately to ensure that our

analysis is not being driven by one source of variation in particular.

      We pool the eight years of data and estimate models of the form:



            log( H ) = α + β (tax price) it + δX it + γ Pr ovi + πYeart + ε it (1)
                  it




where the dependent variable, the log of health spending, takes on four

values: total health care spending, direct health costs to households (all

spending minus spending on health insurance premiums), spending on health

insurance premiums, and spending on prescription drugs in particular. We

use log spending to help normalize the distribution of health care spending,

but our results are not sensitive to using levels instead of logs. Since almost

no households have zero spending in any of the four categories (the exception



                                             15
being health insurance premiums) we lose very few observations from moving

from levels to logs. While all four of these spending categories are broadly

eligible for tax credits, and hence should respond to changes in the tax price,4

we are particularly interested in the last two—health insurance premiums

and prescription drug spending—since these are more directly comparable to

estimates from previous studies. Tax price is our calculated tax price of

medical spending. X includes a quartic polynomial in income and a quadratic

in age, as well as sex, marital status, number of children, and total

expenditure by the household. Prov are province fixed effects and Year are

year fixed effects which are included in all specifications.

        The tax price calculated for each household is a function Pit(Hit) that is

endogenous to the health care spending decision Hit. A household spending

more than the eligibility threshold faces a lower tax price than an otherwise

identical household spending less than the threshold; similarly, a household

with spending in excess of the amount eligible for the supplement faces a

lower tax price than one in the supplement range. We use two strategies for

dealing with the endogeneity of the tax price. First, primarily for comparative

purposes, we examine only those households whose spending exceeds the

household’s threshold level to qualify for the medical tax credit. Examining

this selective sample provides some information as to the source of variation

in spending behaviour. Specifically, it allows us to check whether we are

4
  There are some minor expenses reported in Famex/SHS that are not eligible for the tax credit (Hawley,
2001). The health insurance premiums and prescription drug categories, however, do not include any such
expenses.


                                                  16
identifying our estimates purely based on the difference between individuals

who do and do not receive a tax credit, or whether there is further

identification to be gained by those individuals who exceed the credit

threshold.

      Our second method for dealing with endogeneity is to construct two

instruments for the tax price of medical care. The first is the change in the

tax price from the previous year, Pit(Hit) – Pit-1(Hit). This amounts to holding

constant all the individual characteristics, including medical spending, and

taking the difference in the tax price generated only through changes in the

tax laws between years t-1 and t. Of course, this remains a function of

observed health spending Hit, but it is apt to be uncorrelated with spending

in the absence of a behavioural response, because of the extreme non-

linearity of the tax price function and the tendency for tax reforms over our

sample period to affect tax prices at different parts of the health spending

distribution. What is particularly attractive about this instrument is that it

not only picks up the variation within province over time, it also varies across

households within a province based on a fixed set of individual

characteristics.

      The second instrument is the household’s first dollar tax price of

medical care, calculated as the tax price of medical care an individual would

receive for the first dollar of spending above his or her individual threshold.

In this case, the instrument is completely independent of the household’s




                                       17
actual health care spending behaviour, but varies within provinces over time.

It also varies with family income within a province for the 1986 year, since

the measure was then a tax deduction rather than a credit, and from 1997

onwards when some low-income families were eligible for a supplemental

credit. However, for the majority of our sample, this instrument is

independent of both health care spending and income, and fixed within a

province/year cell. We present estimates using each of these instruments

separately, and then using them together. Overidentification tests suggest

that the inclusion of the additional instrument is valid. First stage results for

the instruments are reported in notes to the tables. Given that the

instruments are constructed to be highly correlated with the actual tax

prices, they perform extremely well in the first stages.



6. Results



      We begin by presenting results from estimates of equation (1) by OLS.

These estimates use the full sample. The coefficients on tax price suffer from

endogeneity bias, but are a useful starting point for comparative purposes.

The first column of Table 3 reports the results using all health care spending

as the dependent variable. Our results suggest a large and significant

negative relationship between the tax price of medical care and health care

spending. The quartic in income does a reasonable job of fitting the




                                       18
relationship between income and health spending, with higher income

households spending more on health care. Married couples and families with

more children have higher health care expenditures.5 The estimate on the tax

price of medical care, which translates into an elasticity of approximately –

2.9 is clearly too large to be plausible, primarily because these estimates

reflect the fact that individuals with higher health spending will also have a

lower tax price of medical care.

         Columns two through five of Table 3 report similar results for direct

health care expenditures, health insurance expenditures, and prescription

drug expenditures. Income remains positively correlated with health

spending for both direct health care costs and health insurance spending.

However, there is a negative correlation between income and prescription

drug spending. This result may reflect the fact that income is strongly

correlated with having supplemental drug insurance in Canada. If high

income individuals are more likely to have their prescriptions paid for by an

insurance company, then lower income individuals will appear to spend more

out of pocket on prescription drugs. The tax-price coefficients on health

insurance premiums and prescription drug expenditures are considerably

smaller, as would be expected given that they are a subset of total health care

costs. However, the elasticity estimates, -1.4 for health insurance spending

and -1.26 for prescription drug expenditure, are still larger than most


5
  We re-run all specifications while excluding families with children. Our results in that case are very
similar to those reported here.


                                                     19
estimates in the literature. This is surely due to the endogeneity of the tax

price. To account for this we turn now to estimates which either restrict the

sample to those who have spending above the individual threshold for the

medical expense tax credit, or which instrument for the tax price.

      As noted above, once spending on health care exceeds the credit

eligibility threshold determined by income, and year, the tax price of medical

care is only weakly and positively related to health care spending. (Once the

maximum threshold for the supplement has been exceeded, the tax price is

independent of spending.) Therefore, it is possible to examine whether

individuals who are already heavy health care spenders respond to changes

in the tax price of medical care. The results are presented in Table 4.

Estimates for all four measures of health spending remain negative and

highly significant. Of particular interest are the estimates of the effects of tax

price on health insurance spending and on prescription drug spending,

presented in columns 3 and 4. Here the coefficient estimates are considerably

smaller than those obtained using the full sample. Using the mean tax price

for the conditional sample (0.71), the estimated elasticity for health insurance

spending is -0.25 and for prescription drug spending the elasticity estimate is

–0.24. These results are much more in keeping with estimates of the price

elasticity of medical care when the price is paid at the point of service (see

Newhouse, 1993, Gruber and Poterba, 1994, Stabile, 2001). While we are

ultimately interested in elasticities for the entire sample and not just the




                                       20
sub-sample of high health care spenders, these results do suggest that part of

our identification is coming from spenders above the threshold levels.

      We next turn to presenting estimates using the two instruments for

the tax price of medical care: the difference in tax prices between t-1 and t,

and the first dollar marginal tax rate. The first instrument relies on changes

in the tax price over time, holding health care spending and income constant.

The second instrument is independent of health care spending and, for most

households in the sample, independent of income as well. Table 5 presents IV

results using the difference in tax price as an instrument. Controlling for the

endogeneity of the tax price produces estimates of the elasticity of demand for

medical care at tax time that are in keeping with point of service estimates in

the literature. The elasticity of demand for prescription drug spending is –

0.46, similar to the range of estimates for prescription drug spending in both

Canada and the US (Zweifel and Manning, 2000). Using the first dollar

marginal tax price (Table 6) yields a slightly smaller, but still significant

elasticity estimate of –0.27, and using both instruments to over-identify the

coefficients yields a similar estimate of –0.29. As noted above we can not

reject the over-identification test of the additional instruments. Other

coefficients are similar in magnitude to their OLS counterparts.




                                        21
         That these estimates are so similar to the previous literature is

somewhat surprising.6 There are a number of reasons to believe that

individuals would be more sensitive to changes in the price of health

spending when they pay for those services at the time of use, rather than

some months later, at tax time. Our estimates strongly reject this, however,

with consistent evidence of a negative and significant price elasticity in the

range of -.027 to -0.46 under our instrumental variables specifications.

         The estimates for private health insurance premiums are particularly

striking. Using the change in tax price between t and t-1 as an instrument

produces a positive and significant elasticity estimate for health insurance

spending (Table 5, column 3): an increase in the tax subsidy causes demand

for health insurance to fall. (All elasticity estimates for other spending

categories remain negative and significant.) The result is surprising but is in

fact not inconsistent with optimizing behavior by taxpayers. Since both

health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenditures are eligible for

the credit, the tax law leaves the relative price of market health insurance

and self-insurance unchanged. Consequently, the choice between the two is

affected by tax rules only to the extent that changes in after-tax income

change taxpayers’ capacity for risk tolerance. A decrease in an individual’s

tax rate in a proportional tax system (and hence an increase in the tax price

of health care) should cause the demand for health insurance to rise when the

6
  As specification checks we re-run all of the analysis omitting Quebec and omitting the 1986 data (before
the deduction turned into a credit) to ensure that neither of these single sources of variation are driving our
results. The results remain quite similar in both cases.


                                                      22
individual displays increasing relative risk aversion, and demand should be

unaffected in the central case of constant relative risk aversion. Indeed, our

particular result is in keeping with recent findings by Cutler (2002), who

finds evidence that recent increases in the total premium costs of health

insurance in the US have lead to increases in health insurance take-up.

Using our alternate the first dollar marginal tax rate instrument for the tax

price, however, reverses the sign of the estimate (Table 6). Combining the two

instruments, the coefficient estimate (and hence the elasticity) is once again

positive, but not quite significant at the 10 percent level (Table 7). Therefore,

while there is some evidence that individuals may trade off insurance

spending for risk sharing in the tax system, the evidence is not completely

robust to the choice of instrument.



7. Discussion and Conclusions



      We use the existing tax treatment of medical expenditures in Canada

in order to identify the tax price elasticity of demand for health care when

price changes are realized at the end of the tax year. Our findings suggest

that individuals respond to the tax credits in much the same fashion as they

do to variation in prices at the point of service. In fact, in our preferred

instrumental variables specifications we find price elasticities in the range of

–0.27 to –0.9 across different categories of medical care spending, well within




                                        23
the range of price elasticites reported in the literature. For prescription drug

spending in particular, our findings are quite similar to those found in the

RAND health insurance experiment (Newhouse, 1993), which found little

difference in price responsiveness between prescription drugs and other

forms of medical care.

      Since both health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenditures

are eligible for the credit, the tax law leaves the relative price of market

health insurance and self-insurance unchanged. We find some evidence that

increases in the tax price lead to increases in spending on health insurance,

consistent with individuals displaying increasing relative risk aversion.

      Our findings support the view advanced by some policy-makers that

the income tax system can be an effective method of influencing the use of

health care services. In the Canadian context, our results suggest that benefit

taxes collected at tax time would have effects similar to user charges at the

point of service. However, in the former case, low-income individuals who

know they will not be subject to benefit taxes would not be deterred from

using services. In the U.S. context, our results suggest that tax credits for

items such as prescription drugs are likely to be effective and promoting

prescription drug spending in providing some relief from high drug costs.

      One qualification to our results is that we estimate that more high-

income households should be claiming the medical care expense credit than

actually do. We estimate that 21 percent of households with incomes over




                                       24
$50,000 qualify for the credit, yet Canada Customs and Revenue Agency

suggests that only 6 percent of tax filers with taxable returns in this income

group actually do claim the credit. Low take up is by no means unique to this

program. The Medicaid program has long experienced low take-up rates

despite numerous efforts to inform eligible families of about the program

(Aizer, 2003). We suspect that the reason for low take up rates in the

Canadian case is that it can be cumbersome to collect and retain the receipts

necessary to make a claim. Further, some families might not anticipate that

annual expenditures will be high enough to qualify for the credit until part

way through the year, so that they would not begin to collect receipts until it

is effectively too late. Of course, the failure of some eligible households to

claim the credit should work against finding tax responsiveness in the data.

Nevertheless, we find robust evidence of significant price elasticities in our

estimates.
