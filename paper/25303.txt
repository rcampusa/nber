                                           ABSTRACT

We study the transmission of monetary policy shocks in a model in which realistic heterogeneity
in price rigidity interacts with heterogeneity in sectoral size and input-output linkages, and derive
conditions under which these heterogeneities generate large real effects. Empirically,
heterogeneity in the frequency of price adjustment is the most important driver behind large real
effects, whereas heterogeneity in input-output linkages contributes only marginally, with
differences in consumption shares in between. Heterogeneity in price rigidity further is key in
determining which sectors are the most important contributors to the transmission of monetary
shocks, and is necessary but not sufficient to generate realistic output correlations. In the model
and data, reducing the number of sectors decreases monetary non-neutrality with a similar impact
response of inflation. Hence, the initial response of inflation to monetary shocks is not sufficient
to discriminate across models and for the real effects of nominal shocks.

I     Introduction
Understanding how monetary policy transmits to the real economy and why nominal
shocks have real effects are vital questions in monetary economics. Recent insights suggest
heterogeneity on the household side might change completely the transmission mechanism
of monetary policy through general equilibrium effects on labor income (see Kaplan,
Moll, and Violante (2018)). But large heterogeneities are also present on the production
side of the economy. Firms differ in the degree of nominal rigidities, which can result
in strategic complementary in price setting; sectors differ in size, which might result
in aggregate fluctuations due to idiosyncratic shocks; and different sectors use different
intermediate input mixes to produce output, which can also give rise to idiosyncratic
origins of business-cycle fluctuations.1
     We present new theoretical insights into the transmission of monetary policy shocks
in an economy in which all three heterogeneities are present and interact with each other.
First, we show real effects of nominal shocks are bigger if the share of intermediate inputs
is high or if sticky-price sectors are important suppliers to the rest of the economy, to
large sectors and to flexible-price sectors on impact, but to sticky price sectors following
the shock.2 Second, the level of disaggregation is central for the real effects of monetary
policy. More granular economies result in larger real effects with similar price responses
on impact. Third, the importance of specific sectors for the transmission of monetary
policy shocks depends on which heterogeneities are present, and how they interact.
     On the empirical side, our contribution lies in the calibration of a detailed model
of the U.S. economy to study the quantitative importance of the different types of
heterogeneities. We calibrate a 350-sector version of the model to the input-output (I/O)
tables from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the micro-data underlying
the producer price index (PPI) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). First, we
find heterogeneity in price stickiness is the main driver of real output effects: It more
than doubles real effects relative to an economy with homogeneous price stickiness.
Additionally allowing for heterogeneity in consumption shares increases real effects by
16% on impact, and 4% cumulatively. The marginal effects of heterogeneous I/O linkages
are smaller than the effects of price stickiness.

     See, for example, the works of Carvalho (2006) and Nakamura and Steinsson (2008) for the importance
of heterogeneous price stickiness, and Gabaix (2011) and Acemoglu, Carvalho, Ozdaglar, and Tahbaz-
Salehi (2012) for the relevance of heterogeneities in sector size and input mixes.
   2
     Some of the results are well known. The dynamic prediction in the network setting is most distinctly
new (see Basu (1995), Huang and Liu (2004), Shamloo (2010)), and Bouakez, Cardia, and Ruge-Murcia
(2014))



                                                   2
    Second, the choice of disaggregation plays an important role empirically. A 350-sector
economy has a 20% (34%) larger cumulative real effect of monetary policy shocks than a
less granular 58-(8-)sector model. However, across choices of aggregation, the response of
inflation to the monetary policy shock is similar on impact and on average during the first
few periods. The large differences in real output effects with similar impact responses of
inflation across different levels of aggregation caution against drawing inference for the
conduct of monetary policy from the initial response of inflation to monetary policy shocks.
    Third, heterogeneity in price rigidity is key in determining which sectors are the
most important contributors to the transmission of monetary shocks. Relative to uniform
responses under homogeneous and flexible prices, heterogeneity in price rigidity results in
a differential sectoral response. Moreover, going from homogeneous to heterogeneous price
rigidity increases the response of the 10 most important sectors by a factor of 5 to 8. At
the same time, the 10 smallest sectoral responses remain relatively unchanged. Allowing
for other heterogeneities has effects that are smaller by an order of magnitude across
specifications. However, allowing for full network heterogeneity cuts the response of the
least important sectors by a factor of 3 to 4. In this context, we also show heterogeneity
in price stickiness is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to generate realistic output
correlations across sectors.
    Taken together, these results show (i) Heterogeneous price stickiness is the central
force for the real effects of nominal shocks; intermediate inputs increase the real effects
of monetary shocks, but heterogeneity in the I/O structure is less important; (ii)
disaggretation matters for the real effects of monetary policy shocks but leaves the impact
response of inflation largely unchanged; and (iii) price stickiness that differs across sectors
changes the identity and importance of the most important sectors for the transmission
of monetary shocks.
    What mechanisms drive these results? In the model, firms set prices as a markup
over a weighted average of future marginal costs. We identify four distinct channels
through which I/O linkages and the heterogeneities of sector size and price stickiness
affect the marginal-cost process. First, marginal costs of final-goods producers depend
directly on the sector-specific input price index. Second, sector-specific wages depend
indirectly on I/O linkages because the optimal mix of inputs depends on the relative price
of intermediate inputs and labor. Third and fourth, the heterogeneities across sectors in
total production, value-added, and intermediate inputs create wedges between sectoral
participation in total output, production, and total GDP that feed back into marginal
costs. These channels interact in shaping the response to nominal shocks in a very intuitive


                                              3
way: How important is the output of a given sector for final-goods production? How
flexible are the output prices of the goods the sector uses in production? How important
is the sector as a producer for total consumption?
     We develop further, analytical intuition for the interaction of the three heterogeneities
in a simplified model. In this economy, we gradually add each heterogeneity, and prove
results analytically when possible. We start with an economy that features I/O linkages
that can be homogeneous or heterogeneous across sectors. Key to this step is that price
rigidity is homogeneous across sectors, and sectoral participation in GDP equals sectoral
participation in total production. I/O linkages per se amplify the real effects of monetary
policy, as in Nakamura and Steinsson (2008). However, heterogeneity in consumption
shares and I/O linkages does not matter, because sectoral production and consumption
shares do not produce wedges.
     We then add heterogeneity in Calvo parameters. This addition generates a hump-
shaped response in consumption, because flexible-price firms compete with sticky-price
firms. Firms with flexible prices adjust prices in a staggered fashion and by less on impact
than in a model with homogeneous Calvo rates across sectors. The dispersion of price
stickiness amplifies cumulative real effects following an identical impact of consumption
as in Carvalho (2006), Carvalho and Schwartzman (2015), and Alvarez et al. (2016a).
Heterogeneity in I/O linkages and consumption shares does not affect the impact response
relative to an economy with homogeneous price stickiness and also does not have any
systematic effect following the impact response.
     Last, we allow for fully unrestricted heterogeneity in sector weights in GDP and in I/O
linkages. This additional degree of heterogeneity results in wedges between consumption
prices and sectoral intermediate input prices, which influence sectoral marginal costs.
Heterogeneity in I/O linkages can amplify or dampen the output response. For example,
the economy may resemble more of a flexible-price economy or a sticky-price economy,
depending on the interaction of sector size, the importance of sectors as suppliers to
other sectors, and sectoral price stickiness. We characterize the interactions and their
influence on real effects of monetary policy by three relations: (i) first-order out-degrees
to sector size, (ii) first-order outdegrees adjusted by average flexibility to sector size, and
(iii) covariances between sectoral linkages and size with price stickiness.


A.     Literature review
Our paper contributes new insights to the literature on the transmission of monetary
policy shocks in a network economy.         Basu (1995) shows a roundabout production

                                              4
structure can magnify the importance of price rigidities through its effect on marginal
costs, and results in larger welfare losses of demand-driven business cycles. Huang and Liu
(2004) study the persistence of monetary shocks in a multi-sector model with roundabout
production and fixed contract length. Their pioneering work theoretically shows that
intermediate inputs amplify the importance of rigid prices with no impact on wage
stickiness. Nakamura and Steinsson (2010) develop a multi-sector menu-cost model and
show in a calibration of a six-sector version that heterogeneity in price stickiness together
with I/O linkages can explain persistent real effects of nominal shocks with moderate
degrees of price stickiness. Carvalho and Lee (2011) show a multi-sector Calvo model
with intermediate inputs can reconcile why firms adjust more quickly to idiosyncratic
shocks than to aggregate shocks (see also Boivin et al. (2009) and Shamloo (2010)).
Bouakez, Cardia, and Ruge-Murcia (2014) estimate a multi-sector Calvo model with
production networks using aggregate and sectoral data, and find evidence of heterogeneity
in frequencies of price adjustments across sectors.
    We contribute several new insights to this literature. Our most important empirical
innovation is to study the importance of networks on the propagation of nominal shocks in
a detailed, 350-sector calibration of the U.S. economy. Second, we show both theoretically
and empirically that reducing the number of sectors in our model decreases monetary
non-neutrality. By contrast, the empirical impact response of inflation is similar across
aggregation choices, and hence is not a sufficient statistic for monetary non-neutrality.
Finally, we point out a new identity effect: Heterogeneity in price rigidity is key in
determining which sectors are the most important contributors to the transmission of
monetary shocks. Heterogeneity in price rigidity is also necessary to generate realistic
correlations in output across sectors to monetary policy shocks.
    A high degree of specialization is a general, key feature of modern production
economies. Gabaix (2011) and Acemoglu et al. (2012) show theoretically the network
structure and the firm-size distribution are potentially important propagation mechanisms
for aggregate fluctuations originating from firm and industry shocks. Acemoglu, Akcigit,
and Kerr (2015) and Barrot and Sauvagnat (2016) show empirical evidence for the
propagation of idiosyncratic supply shocks through the I/O structure. Carvalho (2014)
provides an overview of this fast-growing literature.      Idiosyncratic shocks propagate
through changes in prices. In a companion paper (see Pasten, Schoenle, and Weber
(2018)), we study how price rigidities affect the importance of idiosyncratic shocks as an
origin of aggregate fluctuations.
    Other recent applications of production networks in different areas of macroeconomics


                                             5
include Bigio and Lao (2017) who study the amplification of financial frictions through
production networks, and Ozdagli and Weber (2017), who empirically show I/O linkages
are a key propagation channel of monetary policy to the stock market. Additionally,
Kelly, Lustig, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2013) study the joined dynamics of the firm-size
distribution and stock return volatilities. Herskovic, Kelly, Lustig, and Van Nieuwerburgh
(2016) and Herskovic (2018) study asset-pricing implications of production networks.


II       Model
This section presents our full blown New Keynesian model. We highlight in particular
how heterogeneities in price rigidities, sectoral size, and the network structure enter the
model.


A.     Firms
A continuum of monopolistically competitive firms j operates in different sectors. We
index firms by their sector, k = 1, ..., K, and by j ∈ [0, 1]. The set of consumption
goods is partitioned into a sequence of subsets {=k }K                     K
                                                     k=1 with measure {nk }k=1 such that
PK
  k=1 nk = 1.
     The first, real heterogeneity – heterogeneity in sectoral I/O linkages – enters via the
production function of firm j in sector k, which is given by

                                           Ykjt = L1−δ  δ
                                                   kjt Zkjt ,                                       (1)

where Lkjt is labor and Zkjt is an aggregator of intermediate inputs

Here, Zkjt (r) denotes the intermediate input use by firm j in sector k in period t. The
aggregator weights {ωkr }k,r satisfy K

                                      r=1 ωkr = 1 for all sectors k. We allow these weights
to differ across sectors, which is a central ingredient of our analysis.
     In turn, Zkjt (r) is an aggregator of goods produced in sector r,

    Demand for intermediate inputs Zkjt (r) and Zkjt (r, j 0 ) is given by the following
demand equations
                                                                           −η
                                                                      Prt

Prj 0 t is the price firm j 0 in sector r charges, Prt is a sectoral price index, and Ptk is an
input-price index; we define both price indices below. In steady state, all prices are
identical, and {ωkr }K
                     r=1 is the share of costs that firm k, j spends on inputs from sector r
and, hence, equals cell k, r in the I/O Tables (see online appendix). We refer to {ωkr }K
                                                                                        r=1
as “I/O linkages.” As a result, in steady state, all nr firms in sector r share the demand
of firm k, j for goods that sector r produces equally.
    Away from steady state, a gap exists between the price index of sector r, Prt , and
the input price index, Ptk , that is relevant for firms in sector k. It distorts the share of
sector r in the costs of firms in sector k. Similarly, price dispersion across firms within
sector r determines the dispersion of demand of firms in sector k for goods in sector r.
Price indices relevant for the demand of intermediate inputs across sectors are defined as

defines aggregate labor in sector k. Equations (17) and (18) give aggregate wage (which is
a weighted average of sectoral wages) and aggregate labor (which linearly sums up hours
worked in all sectors). Equation (19) is Walras’ law for the output of firm j in sector k.


III      Heterogeneities and Marginal Costs
The dynamic behavior of marginal costs is crucial for understanding the response of the
economy to a monetary policy shock. This section develops intuition for the effects of
heterogeneity in price stickiness, I/O linkages, and sectoral size on marginal costs, and
the real effects of monetary policy. We focus on the role of heterogeneity in I/O linkages.
Our main, analytical propositions in the next section, however, do not require reading
this section first.


                                                  10
     We highlight how I/O linkages affect marginal costs and demand through four distinct
channels. In particular, a new wedge emerges that drives marginal costs: I/O linkages
create a wedge between the aggregate consumption price index and intermediate input
price indices that affects marginal costs.
     The reduced-form system that embeds marginal costs has K + 1 equations and
unknowns: value-added production ct and K sectoral prices {pkt }k=1 . In the following
description of the system, small letters denote log deviations from steady state. The first
equation is

               σEt [ct+1 ] − (σ + φc ) ct + Et pct+1 − (1 + φπ ) pct + φπ pct−1 = µt ,

which is a combination of the household Euler equation and the Taylor rule. The equation
describes how variations in value-added production, ct , and aggregate consumption prices,
pct , respond to the monetary policy shock, µt .

complete the system, where κk ≡ (1 − αk ) (1 − αk β) /αk measures the degree of price
flexibility.


A.      The effect of I/O linkages on marginal cost
Here, we show that I/O linkages crucially affect marginal costs. We distinguish between
the use of intermediate inputs per se (i.e., δ > 0) and heterogeneous usage of intermediate
inputs across sectors (i.e., ωkr 6= ωk0 r ∀k, ∀k 0 6= k, and ∀r). Although our focus is on I/O
linkages, heterogeneity in sectoral size ωck and in pricing frictions is also present through
κk . We first derive how I/O linkages affect several intermediate, key variables.
     First, I/O linkages affect the measure of sectors, {nk }K
                                                             k=1 . The measure reflects the
weighted average of the consumption share of sector k, ωck , and the importance of sector
k as a supplier to the economy, ζk

                                     nk = (1 − ψ)ωck + ψζkt ,                            (23)



                                                    11
where
                                                  K
                                                  X
                                        ζk ≡              nk0 t ωk0 k .                  (24)
                                                  k0 =1

We refer to ζk as the “outdegree” of sector k, analogous to Acemoglu et al. (2012). The
outdegree of sector k is the weighted sum of intermediate input use from sector k by all
other sectors ωk0 k , with weights nk0 t . In steady state, all firms are identical and we can
interpret nk as the size of sector k.
      Without intermediate inputs (δ = 0), ψ ≡ δ (θ − 1) /θ = 0, and only consumption
shares determine sector size.      By contrast, when firms use intermediate inputs for
production (δ > 0), heterogeneity in I/O linkages results in additional heterogeneity
in sector size. The outdegree of sector k is higher when sector k is a supplier to many
sectors or is a supplier of large sectors.
      The vector ℵ of sector sizes {nk }K
                                        k=1 solves

                                                                      −1
                                ℵ = (1 − ψ) [IK − ψΩ0 ]                    ΩC ,          (25)

where IK is the identity matrix of dimension K, Ω is the I/O matrix in steady state with
elements {ωkk0 }, and ΩC is the vector of consumption shares, {ωck }.
      Second, heterogeneity in I/O linkages implies each sector faces a different intermediate
input price index
                                                  K
                                                  X
                                        pkt   =           ωkk0 pk0 t .                   (26)
                                                  k0 =1

In particular, the sector-k intermediate input price index responds more to variation in
the prices of another sector k 0 when that sector is a large supplier to sector k.

A.1     Direct effect on sectoral marginal costs

With intermediate inputs in production (δ > 0), sectoral marginal costs are a weighted
average of sectoral wages, but also sectoral intermediate input price indices

                                  mckt = (1 − δ) wkt + δpkt .                            (27)

The sectoral intermediate input price index, pkt , reflects heterogeneity in I/O linkages.
All else equal, an increase in the price of another sector k 0 implies higher costs of the
intermediate input mix. Heterogeneity in I/O linkages allows this channel to differ across
sectors.



                                                     12
A.2     Indirect effect through sectoral wages

I/O linkages also affect sectoral wages {wkt } indirectly because the efficient mix of labor
and intermediate inputs in equation (5) depends on relative input prices. The production
function implicitly defines sectoral labor demand for a given level of production ykt

                                    ykt = lkt + δ wkt − pkt .
                                                           
                                                                                              (28)

      In a model without I/O linkages (δ = 0), sectoral labor demand is inelastic after
conditioning on sectoral production ykt . Here, I/O linkages (δ > 0) imply labor demand
depends negatively on wages, because higher wages lead firms to substitute labor for
intermediate inputs.
      Combining the production function and sectoral labor supply yields

                                  1 
                                      ϕykt + σct + δϕ pkt − pct + pct .
                                                               
                       wkt =                                                                  (29)
                               1 + δϕ

Thus, the optimal choice implies a wedge between sectoral intermediate input prices and
                                       
aggregate consumption prices, pkt − pct .
      What is the role of this wedge? In a model without I/O linkages (δ = 0), wages
respond one to one to variations in aggregate consumption prices pct through their effect
on labor supply. An increase in sector k 0 prices positively affects wages in sector k. The
relevant elasticity is tied to the consumption share of sector k 0 , ωck0 . This effect is captured
by the last term of equation (29).
      In the presence of I/O linkages (δ > 0), this last term continues to affect wages.
However, the wedge (pkt − pct ) now additionally comes into play: An increase in sector
k 0 prices has an additional, positive effect on sector k wages when the share of sector k 0
as a supplier of sector k is larger than its consumption share, that is, when ωkk0 > ωck0 .
Intuitively, if sector k 0 is a large supplier to sector k, a positive variation in pk0 t has a
larger effect on increasing the cost of intermediate inputs for firms in sector k. As a result,
firms in sector k increase the demand for labor, and sector k wages go up.

A.3     Effect on sectoral demand

Next, we show I/O linkages can heterogeneously affect how variations in aggregate demand
yt transmit into sectoral demand, {ykt }K
                                        k=1 . This follows because sectoral demand is given
by
                             ykt = yt − η [pkt − (1 − ψ) pct − ψe
                                                                pt ] ,                        (30)


                                                13
where
                                                  K
                                                  X
                                          pet ≡         nk pkt .                        (31)
                                                  k=1

      Sectoral demand depends on the sectoral relative price, pkt , relative to a weighted
average of aggregate consumption prices, pct , and an “average sector-relevant” price, pet .
The latter weights sector-relevant aggregate prices by the size of sectors. We can write it
as
                                                  K
                                                  X
                                          pet =         ζk pkt ,                        (32)
                                                  k=1

that is, the sum of variations in sectoral prices weighted by their outdegrees {ζk }K
                                                                                    k=1 .
      Following an increase in prices of another sector k 0 , the share of sector k in total
demand increases in the outdegree of that other sector. This increase is stronger than the
increase in an economy without intermediate inputs if that sector is a big supplier in the
whole economy: ζk0 > ωck0 .

A.4     Effect on total demand

Finally, aggregate demand, yt , also interacts with heterogeneity in I/O linkages.
Aggregating Walras’ law across all industries yields

                                      yt = (1 − ψ) ct + ψzt ,                           (33)

where zt is the total amount of intermediate inputs. The pure presence of intermediate
inputs creates a wedge between total production, yt , and value-added production, ct . The
dynamics of zt around the steady state depend on the heterogeneity in I/O linkages across
sectors.
      We solve for zt , combining Walras’ law, the aggregate production function, aggregate
labor supply, and the aggregation of efficient mixes between labor and intermediate inputs,

                                                                     pt − pct )
                         [(1 + ϕ) (1 − ψ) + σ (1 − δ)] ct − (1 − δ) (e
                  zt =                                                          .       (34)
                                        (1 − ψ) + ϕ (δ − ψ)

      In an economy with no I/O linkages (δ = 0, ψ = 0), output equals consumption,
yt = ct . With intermediate inputs (δ > 0), zt varies positively with ct : More value-added
production requires more intermediate inputs. This channel shows up as the first term in
the numerator of equation (34). At the same time, an increase in prices of a given sector
k 0 has a negative effect on zt when that sector is central in the economy. This second


                                                  14
                                 pt − pct ), the second term in the numerator of equation
effect is captured by the wedge (e
(34), equivalent to the condition that sectors are relatively more central than their GDP
share implies: ζk0 > ωck0 . Then, an increase in prices of big suppliers in the economy
results in higher prices for intermediate inputs for many sectors and/ or bigger sectors.
These sectors then substitute intermediate inputs for labor, and the aggregate demand
for intermediate inputs decreases.
     To simplify exposition, we write the relationship between yt and ct as

                                                            pt − pct ) ,
                                  yt = (1 + ψΓc ) ct − ψΓp (e                              (35)

                (1−δ)(σ+ϕ)                 1−δ
where Γc ≡    (1−ψ)+ϕ(δ−ψ)
                           , Γp   ≡   (1−ψ)+ϕ(δ−ψ)
                                                   .


B.     Overall solution for log-linearized marginal costs
We combine equations that we derived in the previous subsections to express marginal
costs in terms of value-added production and sectoral prices
                              
                    (1 − δ) ϕη c        1+ϕ k                      ϕψ (η − Γp )
                                                pt − pct + (1 − δ)               pt − pct )(36)
                                                        
     mckt   = 1+                 pt + δ                                         (e
                      1 + δϕ            1 + δϕ                       1 + δϕ
                (1 − δ) ϕη         1−δ
              −            pkt +          [σ + ϕ (1 + ψΓc )] ct .
                  1 + δϕ          1 + δϕ

     By contrast, in an otherwise identical economy with no I/O linkages (δ = 0), marginal
costs are given by
                           mcδ=0            c
                             kt = (1 + ϕη) pt − ϕηpkt + (σ + ϕ) ct .                       (37)

There, an increase in prices of other sectors, pk0 t , increases marginal costs.           This
effect uniformly depends on elasticities 1 + ϕη, and specifically, on the heterogeneity
in consumption shares ωck0 .
     In our setting, new effects arise. The first line of equation (36) shows how sectoral
prices affect sectoral marginal costs in an economy with I/O linkages (δ > 0). The effect
of prices of other sectors on sector k marginal costs – contained in aggregate consumption
prices via the first term – continues to be present, but is now mitigated because 1 +
(1 − δ)ϕη/(1 + δϕ) < (1 + ϕη). At the same time, I/O linkages create new channels. In
particular, prices of another sector pk0 t have a stronger effect on mckt if (i) sector k 0 is a
big supplier to sector k; that is, ωkk0 > ωck0 so that the wedge (pkt − pct ) > 0 (second term
on the right-hand side of equation (36)); and (ii) sector k 0 is a big supplier in the whole
economy; that is, ζk0 > ωck0 so that the wedge (p̃t − pct ) > 0 (third term on the right-hand


                                                       15
side of equation (36)). The overall direct effect of variations in pk0 t on mckt is

       (1 − δ) [1 + (1 − ψ) ϕη + ψϕΓp ]          1+ϕ                   ϕψ (η − Γp )
                                        ωck0 + δ        ωkk0 + (1 − δ)              ζk0 .   (38)
                     1 + δϕ                      1 + δϕ                  1 + δϕ

       The last two terms of equation (36) are standard. The fourth term on the right-hand
side of equation (36) shows sector k marginal costs decrease in sector k prices. The
demand for sectoral output is a decreasing function of its price, and hence, wages in
sector k. The fifth term on the right-hand side of equation (36) shows marginal costs
increase in value-added production ct .


IV        Theoretical Results
Here, we present new, closed-form results for the response of inflation and consumption to
a monetary policy shock. In doing so, we benchmark our economy with heterogeneity in
price rigidity against an economy where prices are homogeneously rigid. We highlight how
the I/O structure interacts with the pricing frictions and heterogeneity in sectoral size
and shapes our results. We show that the identity effect – which sector contributes the
most to monetary transmission – can be crucially affected. Also, the level of aggregation
can be key for the degree of monetary non-neutrality. The latter two insights provide
important guidance for monetary policymakers trying to correctly assess the transmission
of monetary policy shocks to output and inflation.


A.      Monetary non-neutrality in the simplified model
We start by introducing three assumptions that allow us to obtain results in closed form.
First, household utility is log in consumption, σ = 1, and linear in leisure, ϕ = 0, such
that
                                           wt = ct + pct .                                  (39)

       Second, a cash-in-advance constraint exists for final-goods consumption only,

                                           mt = ct + pct ,                                  (40)

              K
where pct ≡
              P
                    ωck pkt .
              k=1




                                                 16
    Third, firms fully discount the future when they adjust prices (β = 0), so

                                              p∗kt = mckt .                                       (41)

    Combining all these equations with the sectoral aggregation of prices

                                    pkt = (1 − αk ) p∗kt + αk pkt−1 ,                             (42)

yields

               pkt = (1 − αk ) (1 − δ) mt + δpkt + αk pkt−1 for k = 1, ..., K

where Ω denotes the matrix of I/O weights, Ωc the vector of consumption weights, and A
the diagonal matrix of αk .
    In the following, we use equations (40) and (43) to build intuition on the determinants
of monetary non-neutrality in the model. In particular, we assume the economy is in
steady state when a permanent monetary shock hits at period t∗ such that mt = m for all
t ≥ t∗ and mt = 0 for all t < 0. We focus on characterizing the response of the aggregate
consumption price index pct to the shock in three cases. In this simplified model, the
aggregate price response is a sufficient statistic for the real output response.
    First, we consider the case in which price stickiness is homogeneous across sectors.
This assumption sets up a useful benchmark for the following cases that feature
heterogeneity in price stickiness, as well as our subsequent discussion of the effect of
sectoral aggregation. At the same time, we are not placing any restrictions on the sectoral
GDP shares ωck and the I/O structure {ωkk0 } yet.

Proposition 1 When price stickiness is homogeneous across sectors, αk = α for all k,
the response of aggregate consumption prices to a permanent monetary policy shock is

irrelevant for the response of aggregate consumption prices to the monetary shock.

Proof. See Appendix.
          The proposition presents two insights. First, the stickiness of marginal costs increases
in δ; hence, the responsiveness of the aggregate consumption price index to the monetary
policy shock decreases in δ. As a result, a lesser price response means stronger monetary
non-neutrality. This results mimics the insights of the network multiplier in Basu (1995).
Second, heterogeneity of consumption shares and I/O linkages are irrelevant for monetary
non-neutrality with homogeneous price stickiness across sectors.
          What happens if we allow for heterogeneity in price stickiness? The next proposition
shows heterogeneity of price rigidity amplifies (mitigates) the response of output (prices)
in all periods except upon impact – when it has no effect. This result follows, as a first
step, from a simplified I/O structure. We fully relax this assumption in the subsequent
proposition.

Proposition 2 In an economy in which price stickiness is heterogeneous across sectors
and I/O linkages are identical to consumption shares, ωkk0 = ωck0 for all k, k 0 , the response
of aggregate consumption prices to a permanent monetary policy shock is

Proof. See Appendix
          Proposition 2 studies a simplified steady-state network economy in which sectoral
output is used in equal proportions by consumers and other sectors. In this economy,
sectoral heterogeneity in price stickiness amplifies monetary non-neutrality, as in Carvalho
(2006) and Carvalho and Schwartzman (2015).                   In particular, sectoral heterogeneity
of price stickiness does not affect the impact response, but increases the persistence


                                                   18
of monetary non-neutrality. However, in an economy in which firms set prices in a
forward-looking manner (β > 0), the increased persistence of monetary non-neutrality
would also imply stronger monetary non-neutrality on impact.
         What happens in the fully unrestricted case when price stickiness, sectoral size, and
I/O linkages are heterogeneous across sectors?

Proposition 3 Let pct denote the response of the aggregate consumption price index to a
permanent monetary shock in an economy with no restrictions on the sectoral heterogeneity
of price stickiness {αk }, sectoral size {ωck }, and I/O linkages {ωkk0 }. In this economy,

Proof. See Appendix.
         The fully unrestricted interaction creates an even richer transmission of monetary
policy shocks. In doing so, the exact interaction of nominal and real heterogeneities is
crucial for understanding the effects of a monetary shock on output and prices. The
implications we find are completely new to the literature.
         First, upon impact, the price effect is weaker – and hence monetary non-neutrality
larger – than under the restricted heterogeneity of I/O linkages in Proposition 2. This
effect happens when the largest sectors with the stickiest prices are also important
suppliers to the largest, most flexible sectors. Second, in subsequent periods, aggregate
price changes become more persistent given the three conditions in the second part of the
proposition. In conjunction with the first result, this increased persistence means more
persistence and larger monetary non-neutrality than under restricted heterogeneity.5
         In particular, a corollary of these results is a novel identity effect: The extent to
which a sector transmits monetary policy shocks depends on the exact interaction of
heterogeneity in pricing frictions and heterogeneity in sectoral size and I/O linkages. The

consumption weights, A the diagonal matrix    of αk , and  ι a unit vector. In the special

is pinned down

    where ek is the kth basis vector, Ω the matrix of input-output weights, Ωc the vector
of consumption weights and A the diagonal matrix of αk .

Proof. See Appendix.
    The importance of each sector crucially depends on the interaction of heterogeneities.
Timing also plays an important role, whether we consider the impact response, or
subsequent responses. The ranking of importance across the different cases can clearly
change. For example, sectors that are important upon impact may be less important
later on. Similarly, heterogeneity in I/O linkages can influence the importance of a sector.


                                                           20
Ultimately, the extent to which the interaction of heterogeneities can affect the relative
importance of sectors for aggregate fluctuations is an empirical question.
     We have not placed any restrictions on the total effect of monetary policy. Monetary
policy shocks could easily generate the same real effects under different assumptions about
which heterogeneities are present, whereas sectors are differently important in generating
the same real effects. For example, consider a two-sector economy that generates a
particular path of real output and prices following a monetary policy shocks. Now, if
we simply flip all parameter values for the two sectors, the aggregate paths of output and
prices remain identical. At the same time, the loading of monetary policy transmission
flips. This identity effect may be important, for example, when optimally targeting
monetary policy.


B.    The effect of sectoral aggregation
Most of the literature so far studies models with only a limited number of sectors such
as 6 or 30. In this subsection, we study in the simplified model whether the choice
of aggregation matters for the effect of monetary policy shocks on key macroeconomic
aggregates. In particular, we compare the effects of a permanent monetary policy shock
on aggregate consumption prices at two levels of disaggregation: one with K sectors
(denoted by pct ), and another in which random pairs of sectors are merged log-linearly, so
it has K/2 sectors (denoted by pct ). For simplicity, we assume K is even. In mathematical
terms, we compare

                                                 K
                                                 X
                                       pct   ≡           ωck pkt ,

                                                 K/2

                                       pct   ≡           ω ck0 pk0 t
                                                 k0 =1


such that

                             ω ck0 ≡ ωc2k0 −1 + ωc2k0 ,
                              pk0 t ≡ λk0 p2k0 −1 + (1 − λk0 ) p2k0 ,
                                           ωc2k0 −1
                              λk0 =                    .
                                      ωc2k0 −1 + ωc2k0

for k 0 = 1, ..., K/2. This specification is without loss of generality when merging two
consecutive sectors, because the ordering of sectors is arbitrary.


                                                   21
     In addition, Calvo parameters are aggregated among merged sectors by

                                              αk0 ≡ λk0 α2k0 −1 + (1 − λk0 ) α2k0 .

and their I/O linkages as

               ωk0 s0 = ξk0 (ω2k0 −1,2s0 −1 + ω2k0 −1,2s0 ) + (1 − ξk0 ) (ω2k0 ,2s0 −1 + ω2k0 ,2s0 )

for k 0 , s0 = 1, ..., K/2. The weights ξk0 equal the shares of sectors in total intermediate
input use of the merged sectors.
     First, we show that monetary non-neutrality is higher in a more disaggregated
economy in the absence of I/O linkages (δ = 0).

Proposition 4 When δ = 0, the difference in the response of consumption prices to a
permanent monetary shock at the two levels of disaggregation is given by

                                     K/2

                                     k0 =1


such that (i) pct = pct for t = t∗ , (ii) pct < pct for t > t∗ , (iii) pct − pct is increasing in the
dispersion of Calvo parameters among merged sectors, and (iv) pct − pct is increasing in
the consumption shares of merged sectors with the highest dispersion of Calvo parameters
among merged sectors.

Proof. See Appendix.
     This proposition is an application of Jensen’s inequality. The larger the dispersion of
frequency of price changes among merged sectors, the smaller the monetary non-neutrality
as the level of disaggregation becomes increasingly more coarse relative to a more finely
disaggregated economy. The difference in monetary non-neutrality across the two levels of
disaggregation increases as time passes after the impact response when both are identical.
The intuition for this result is the same as in our analysis above: Aggregating sectors
overstates the response of prices to a monetary policy shock, because the measure of
first-time responders is higher when the two sectors have the same frequency of price
changes than when they exhibit different frequencies but with the same mean.
     Next, we show a new result to the literature: Further disaggregation also leads to
more monetary non-neutrality by overstating the amplification introduced by intermediate
inputs. We show this result under restricted heterogeneity of the production network (
ωsk = ωck ).

where pct = 0 if t < t∗ . Results (i) through (iv) in the previous proposition continue to
hold and are amplified by the intermediate input channel.

Proof. See Appendix.
     Intermediate inputs introduce strategic complementarity in the response of prices to
a monetary shock, which implies consumption prices are more persistent at a finer level
of disaggregation. This effect is stronger when merged sectors with more heterogeneous
frequencies of price changes are also sectors with more homogeneous consumption shares,
for a stronger short-term response of aggregate prices. The effect also increases when
merged sectors with higher consumption shares have lower frequencies of price changes.
     Third, the next proposition relaxes any restriction in the I/O structure of the
production network. Now, the effect of aggregation on the amplification effect of monetary
non-neutrality introduced by intermediate inputs is an intricate combination of the
sectoral distributions of the frequency of price changes, consumption weights, and I/O
linkages.

Proposition 6 When δ ∈ (0, 1) and I/O linkages are unrestricted, the difference in
the response of consumption prices to a permanent monetary shock at the two levels of
disaggregation is given by

     So far, Jensen’s inequality captures the whole effect of sectoral aggregation, because
the response of aggregate prices to a monetary shock depends on the sum of non-linear
functions of the sectoral frequency of price changes, {αk }K
                                                           k=1 . The same is true in this
proposition for the first line on the RHS of the expression for pct − pct . However, it is
not true for the amplification term that is due to intermediate input use. In particular,
for each of the rounded parentheses in the second line in the above expression, now the
difference between the two levels of aggregation depends non-trivially on the I/O linkages.
Compared to Proposition 5, we now could have more or less monetary non-neutrality. In
the fully heterogeneous setting, the exact quantitative effect will therefore depend on the
joint distribution of heterogeneities, which we study empirically below.


V      Data and Calibration
A detailed calibration to the U.S. economy is one of the contributions of this paper. The
data we use can potentially provide the basis for many other model evaluations, including
detailed policy analyses. The main data contribution lies in pinning down three sources
of heterogeneity: different combinations of intermediate inputs for production, different
sectoral sizes, and heterogeneous Calvo rates. In making these choices, the granularity of
the I/O data determines the definition of sectors for the PPI data. We now describe the
data we use to construct the I/O linkages, measures of sectoral size, and price stickiness.


A.     Input-Output tables
The BEA produces I/O tables detailing the dollar flows between all producers and
purchasers in the U.S. Producers include all industrial and service sectors, as well as
household production. Purchasers include industrial sectors, households, and government
entities. The BEA constructs the I/O tables using Census data that are collected every
five years. The BEA has published I/O tables every five years beginning in 1982 and
ending with the most recent tables in 2012. The I/O tables are based on NAICS industry
codes. Prior to 1997, the I/O tables were based on SIC codes.
     The I/O tables consist of two basic national-accounting tables: a “make” table and
a “use” table. The make table shows the production of commodities by industry. Rows
present industries, and columns present the commodities each industry produces. Looking
across columns for a given row, we see all the commodities a given industry produces. The
sum of the entries comprises industry output. Looking across rows for a given column,
we see all industries producing a given commodity. The sum of the entries adds up to the

                                            24
output of a commodity. The use table contains the uses of commodities by intermediate
and final users. The rows in the use table contain the commodities, and the columns
show the industries and final users that utilize them. The sum of the entries in a row is
the output of that commodity. The columns document the products each industry uses
as inputs and the three components of “value added”: compensation of employees, taxes
on production and imports less subsidies, and gross operating surplus. The sum of the
entries in a column adds up to industry output.
       We utilize the I/O tables for 2002 to create an industry network of trade flows. The
BEA defines industries at two levels of aggregation: detailed and summary accounts. We
use both levels of aggregation to create industry-by-industry trade flows. The tables also
pin down sectoral size.
       The BEA provides concordance tables between NAICS codes and I/O industry codes.
We follow the BEA’s I/O classifications with minor modifications to create our industry
classifications. We account for duplicates when NAICS codes are not as detailed as I/O
codes. In some cases, an identical set of NAICS codes defines different I/O industry codes.
We aggregate industries with overlapping NAICS codes to remove duplicates.
       We combine the make and use tables to construct an industry-by-industry matrix
that details how much of an industry’s inputs other industries produce (see section II of
the online appendix for details).


B.      Price stickiness data
We use the confidential microdata underlying the producer price data (PPI) from the
BLS to calculate the frequency of price adjustment at the industry level.6 The PPI
measures changes in selling prices from the perspective of producers, and tracks prices of
all goods-producing industries, such as mining, manufacturing, and gas and electricity, as
well as the service sector.7
       The BLS applies a three-stage procedure to determine the sample of individual goods.
In the first stage, to construct the universe of all establishments in the U.S., the BLS
compiles a list of all firms filing with the Unemployment Insurance system. In the second
and third stages, the BLS probabilistically selects sample establishments and goods based
on either the total value of shipments or the number of employees. The BLS collects prices
   6
     The data have been used before in Nakamura and Steinsson (2008), Goldberg and Hellerstein (2011),
Bhattarai and Schoenle (2014), Gilchrist, Schoenle, Sim, and Zakrajšek (2015), Gorodnichenko and Weber
(2016), Weber (2015), and D’Acunto, Liu, Pflueger, and Weber (2016).
   7
     The BLS started sampling prices for the service sector in 2005. The PPI covers about 75% of the
service sector output. Our sample ranges from 2005 to 2011.


                                                  25
from about 25,000 establishments for approximately 100,000 individual items on a monthly
basis. The BLS defines PPI prices as “net revenue accruing to a specified producing
establishment from a specified kind of buyer for a specified product shipped under specified
transaction terms on a specified day of the month.” Prices are collected via a survey that
is emailed or faxed to participating establishments. Individual establishments remain in
the sample for an average of seven years until a new sample is selected to account for
changes in the industry structure.
     We calculate the frequency of price adjustment at the goods level, FPA, as the ratio of
the number of price changes to the number of sample months. For example, if an observed
price path is $10 for two months and then $15 for another three months, one price change
occurs during five months, and the frequency is 1/5. We aggregate goods-based frequencies
to the BEA industry level.
     The overall mean monthly frequency of price adjustment is 19%, which implies an
average duration, −1/ln(1−F P A), of 4.6 months. Table A.1 and Figure A.1 in the online
appendix summarize the distribution of the frequency of price changes and document
a large right tail. Substantial heterogeneity is present in the frequency across sectors,
ranging from as low as 4.01% for the semiconductor manufacturing sector (duration of
24.43 months) to 93.75% for dairy production (duration of 0.36 months).


C.    Parameter Calibration
We calibrate our model at different levels of detail to analyze monetary non-neutrality.
One contribution is the calibration of a highly disaggregated 350-sector economy, which
we discuss in this section, and contrast with a 58-sector model, but delegate the details
of the 58-sector model to the online appendix.
     We calibrate the model at the monthly frequency using standard parameter values in
the literature (see Table 1). The coefficient of relative risk aversion σ is 1, and β = 0.9975,
implying an annual risk-free interest rate of 3%. We set ϕ = 2, implying a Frisch elasticity
of labor supply of 0.5. We set δ, the average share of inputs in the production function, to
0.5, in line with Basu (1995) and empirical estimates. We set the within-sector elasticity of
substitution θ to 6, implying a steady-state markup of 20%, and the across-sector elasticity
of substitution η to 2, in line with Carvalho and Lee (2011). We set the parameters in
the Taylor rule to standard values of φπ = 1.24 and φc = 0.33/12 (see Rudebusch (2002)).
The persistence parameter of monetary shocks is ρ = 0.9.
     We investigate the robustness of our findings to permutations in parameter values in
section III of the online appendix. Overall, the main conclusions of this section remain

                                              26
unaffected by variations in assumptions. The robustness section also includes an analysis
of how changes in the tails of the frequency distribution affect our findings.


VI      Empirical Results

A.     Monetary policy shocks and monetary non-neutrality
In this section, we present our first empirical result: Heterogeneity in price stickiness is
the main driver behind real effects of monetary policy. At the same time, the interaction
of heterogeneous price stickiness, sector size, and I/O linkages can lower or amplify
real effects, but only by small amounts. This result, however, depends on the level
of granularity. The response of inflation is also mainly driven by heterogeneity in the
frequency of price changes, but little by heterogeneity in sector size or I/O linkages.
     We proceed by studying the response of consumption, inflation, and real marginal
costs to a 1% monetary policy shock. The benchmark economy is a homogeneous model
economy with homogeneous Calvo rates equal to the average Calvo rate, and sectoral sizes
and I/O shares equal to 1/K. We develop step-wise intuition analogous to section IV.
     We calibrate six different cases to arrive at our results. We start with an economy with
perfectly flexible prices, in which consumption shares and I/O linkages are homogeneous
(ωkk0 = ωck = 1/K), and add one kind of heterogeneity at a time. Table 2 lists the
different combinations of frequencies of price adjustments across sectors, sector sizes, and
I/O linkages we study. Table 3 and Figure 1 show our results.
     In our first case, prices are flexible and adjust fully on impact. We allow for the
existence of I/O linkages, but we constrain them to be homogeneous. That is, every
sector uses equal shares of inputs 1/K from all other sectors. When all sectors have
the same degree of price stickiness, the monetary shock affects all sectors equally, and
consumption prices, pct , and sectoral intermediate input prices, pkt , are identical. No price
wedges distort marginal costs (see equation 36). Our model boils down to a textbook New
Keynesian model in which the steady-state share of intermediate inputs, δ, also affects
the response of consumption. In a New Keynesian model with fully flexible prices, prices
fully absorb the monetary policy shock, and we do not see any effect on real consumption
or marginal costs (solid lines in Figure 1).
     We add homogeneous price stickiness across sectors that is equal to a consumption-
share weighted average in the economy of 19% in case 2. We know from the discussion
of case 1 that our model behaves like a standard New Keynesian model. Price stickiness
reduces the impact response of inflation by 30% (-1.98 vs. -2.94, see Table 3), and leads

to a large impact drop in consumption of 2.56%. Both the inflation and consumption
responses are persistent. Figure 1 shows the response in the blue lines marked by +.
    We do not study the interaction of homogeneous price stickiness, heterogeneous sector
size, and heterogeneous I/O structure. We know from Proposition 1 that the response
of consumption and inflation is independent of heterogeneity in sectoral size and I/O
linkages when price stickiness is homogeneous across sectors.
    In case 3, we introduce heterogeneity in price stickiness. We keep sectoral size and I/O
linkages homogeneous. As a result, sectoral prices react differently to a monetary shock,
because heterogeneity in price stickiness introduces complementarity in price adjustment.
Under the assumptions of this case, however, sectoral weights of all aggregate prices are
the same, so that pkt = pct = pet for all sectors k, and the wedges between price indices that
affect marginal cost are absent.
    We see in Figure 1 (blue dashed line) a negative selection effect – older prices are
less likely to change, and real effects are larger – dominates any of the other factors that
influence markups, and real effects of monetary policy are now substantially larger and the
price effect is muted. The real effects of monetary policy both on impact and cumulatively
more than double compared to an economy with homogeneous but equal average price
stickiness (see Table 3). The inflation response, instead, is substantially muted (see blue
dashed line in Figure 1). Our results confirm the intuition for economies with strategic
complementarity in price setting of Carvalho and Schwartzman (2015) and Nakamura and
Steinsson (2010) and Proposition 2 in our simplified model. Relative to the predictions of
the simplified model, the impact difference in the price response relative to the previous
case also highlights the role of forward-looking price setters.
    Case 4 introduces heterogeneity in consumption weights.           I/O linkages are also
heterogeneous but as a knife-edge case equal to consumption weights (ωkk0 = ωck ).
Empirically, allowing for heterogeneity in consumption weights on impact decreases the
real effects of monetary policy by 16% and increases the response of inflation by 36%
relative to case 3. Overall, the change in the assumption on consumption shares and
I/O linkages relative to case 3 only marginally decreases the cumulative real effects by
4%. However, it increases the total response of inflation by 52% compared to the case in
which we allow for heterogeneity in price stickiness only (compare blue dotted line to blue
dashed line in Figure 1). This finding is in line with Proposition 2, where heterogeneity
in consumption weights can have a dynamic effect.
    Case 5 examines an economy in which I/O linkages are homogeneous but consumption
weights are heterogeneous. This case corresponds to Proposition 3 in the simplified model,


                                             28
where we allow consumption and I/O weights to differ. It is now no longer the case that
pkt = pct and ζk = ωck , which opens up two additional wedges in marginal costs (see
equation (36)). Empirically, we find a small effect on output and inflation on impact,
relative to the previous case. Although the cumulative effect on output is also small,
going from -66.01 to -68.34, the cumulative effect on inflation is a bit larger, going from
-7.19 to -5.90 (see blue dash-dotted line in Figure 1).
     Case 6 studies the interaction in our fully unrestricted economy. The real effects of
monetary policy are now a bit smaller on impact than in the case of homogeneous I/O
linkages and equal sector size, by 18%, whereas the impact drop in inflation is larger
by 41%. The cumulative real effect is only 3% smaller, whereas the cumulative inflation
response is 58% larger (see blue x markers in Figure 1). Overall, the real effect of monetary
policy is quantitatively and qualitatively not substantially different from the previous cases
– once we allow for heterogeneity in the frequency of price adjustment.
     Intuitively, the interaction of all three heterogeneities is not important because
sectoral price stickiness, sector size, and outdegrees are empirically almost uncorrelated:
The correlation of price stickiness with consumption weights is 0.05, with first-order
outdegrees 0.47, and the correlation of outdegrees with sector size is 0.01.
     In summary, heterogeneity in price stickiness is the main driver of the real effects
of monetary policy shocks in our calibration of a 350-sector economy to the empirical
distribution of price stickiness from the BLS, and sectoral size and the I/O structure
from the BEA. I/O linkages and heterogeneity in sectoral size have some effect, but these
effects are smaller than the effects of price stickiness. These findings suggest no strong
systematic relationship between price flexibility and the importance of sectors as suppliers
of flexible sectors, or the economy as a whole.


B.    Heterogeneity across sectors, and identity effects
Our analysis shows substantial heterogeneity in the sectoral responses to the common,
monetary policy shock. Which sector transmits the monetary policy shock the most
depends crucially on our specification of heterogeneities. This finding presents another
new and important result of our paper, especially for policymakers. Heterogeneity in
markup responses reflects heterogeneity in real output and identity effects.
     We present these results by focusing on the 10 most and least important sectoral
output contributors to the real effects of monetary policy. Table 4 reports the respective
cumulative real effects of monetary policy shocks in Panels A and B for our different cases.
     We know from the discussion above and section IV that all sectors are equally

                                             29
responsive in cases 1 and 2. Only once we allow for heterogeneous price stickiness in case
3, we see differential sectoral responses. The heterogeneity in real effects across sectors is
substantially amplified for the most responsive sectors in Panel B, by a factor of 5 to 8. At
the same time, the least responsive sectors in Panel A are relatively less affected. As we
move across cases, some additional variation occurs, but overall, dispersion changes little.
This result confirms our findings above that heterogeneity in consumption shares or I/O
structure is not important for the amplification of monetary policy shocks empirically.
The only exception occurs for the least responsive sectors. Their response is cut by a
factor of 3 to 4 as we allow for heterogeneous input-output linkages in case 6. This is an
important result: Even if input-output linkages have little differential aggregate impact,
they matter for relative importance of sectors when monetary shocks are transmitted.
      The associated, underlying identity effects are also clearly visible. While we cannot
illustrate the differential ordering that arises only due to heterogeneous price stickiness,
Figure 2 illustrates the effect on the most and least responsive sectors when we go from case
3 to case 6. Rankings change beyond rank 7, but generally little for the most important
sectors. In line with the above, ranks substantially change for least important sectors,
by up to 60 ranks. Hence, the exact choice of heterogeneities is clearly important for the
identity of sectors in the transmission mechanism.
      Heterogeneity in markups reflects the heterogeneity in real output effects. Price
markups are of independent importance and interest, because they measure the
inefficiency in the economy and are equivalent to a countercyclical labor wedge (see Gali
et al. (2007)). In our setting, the product market wedge is the sole driver of the labor
wedge which is consistent with recent empirical work by Bils, Klenow, and Malin (2014).8
The level of markups in the full model is higher than in the homogeneous benchmark
case, and markups display a rich, dynamic pattern. We report these findings in Figure 3.
      The effect of fully interacted heterogeneities in our model becomes clear in comparison
to the completely homogeneous economy. The markup responses of the homogeneous
economy are summarized in Panel (a) of Figure 3. All sectoral responses are fast-decaying
and identical across all percentiles. The markup response is more than 3% on impact,
with a half-life of eight periods.
      By contrast, two differential facts emerge for the full model (case 6): First, the median
sectoral response is substantially larger. The initial median markup response increases
to approximately 6%. The solid, thick blue line summarizes the median response. The
half-life of the median response is twice as long as in the homogeneous case.
  8
    Shimer (2009) stresses the lack of work on heterogeneity in the product market, a channel we are
putting forward and expanding upon by allowing for interactions of different heterogeneities.


                                                30
     Second, substantial dispersion exists in the markup response. The top 5th percentile
of markups increases to over 10%; the bottom 5th percentile does not increase above 2%.
The sectoral markups also show very different dynamic patterns: The top percentiles
show a hump-shaped response that is very persistent, with a half-life of more than 30
periods. At the same time, the lowest percentiles decay exponentially with a half-life of
less than one period. These very different price-markup responses directly result from the
convolutions of the different underlying heterogeneities. The pattern in markup responses
open up new avenues to study how the interactions shape inefficiencies in the economy.


C.    Sectoral Aggregation and Real Effects
In this section, we study the response of our model economy to monetary policy shocks
for different levels of disaggregation. The choice of aggregation results in large differences
in real effects across model economies. We arrive at this conclusion in two steps.
     First, we compare the two levels of granularity published by the BEA: detail
(effectively 350 sectors) and summary (58 sectors). Figure 4 and Table 5 report our
findings. We report robustness results for the 58-sector calibration in the online appendix.
Cumulative real effects of monetary policy are 20% larger in the more disaggregated
350-sector economy than in the 58-sector calibration. The inflation response is interesting:
Upon impact, not only output but also inflation drops by more in the 350-sector economy.
Inflation drops by 14% more and output by 1% more. But over the first five periods, the
periods of immediate impact, the average inflation drop in the 350-sector economy and
the 58-sector economy is very similar. In fact, the impulse response functions of inflation
cross. In the long run, the cumulative inflation response is 20% smaller in the 350-sector
economy. This finding cautions against drawing inference for monetary policy from the
impact response of inflation to monetary policy shocks.
     Second, motivated by these findings as well as our theoretical results in section IV –
that the degree of granularity can matter for the real effects of monetary policy – we now
systematically show the importance of granularity.
     In Figure 5, we aggregate sectors with the most similar frequencies of price
adjustments. We go from a 350-sector aggregation to economies with 200, 100, 50, 25, 10,
and 8 sectors. Across aggregations, we keep the average frequency of price adjustment
constant. Overall, the response of real consumption, inflation, and real marginal costs are
very similar across the different levels of granularity. This result might appear surprising,
but we aggregate sectors with similar frequencies of price adjustments. Based on our
discussion in section IV and the results in Carvalho and Schwartzman (2015) and Alvarez

                                             31
et al. (2016b), we would expect similar real effects for different levels of aggregation if the
dispersion in the frequency of price adjustment does not change across aggregations. We
see in Figure A.2 of the online appendix this is indeed the case: The variance changes
little and only becomes spiky once a few sectors are left.
     Next, we aggregate sectors with the most similar size. In many models, sector size is a
good proxy for sector technology. Figure 6 shows the results. The real effects of monetary
policy are now dramatically affected. They are almost twice as large on impact for the
most disaggregated economy as for the most aggregated economy with only eight sectors,
even though the impact response of inflation is identical. Real effects are monotonically
increasing in the granularity of the economy. Figure A.3 in the online appendix shows
the dispersion in the frequency of price adjustment shrinks for less granular economies.
     Finally, we go through “empirical” aggregation levels, replicating the aggregation
chosen by the BEA. We aggregate sectors by industry codes starting with the actual
detailed data, which have up to 6-digit NAICS codes, going to an economy with 5 digits,
and so on. We find results in the current aggregation that are similar to the results we
saw for the size aggregation: Real effects are largest for the most granular economy and
shrink for higher levels of aggregation. The biggest jumps occur between 148 and 60,
and 60 and 20 sectors, respectively. Much coarser or finer aggregation choices than these
only have a marginal impact on the impulse response functions. Tables A.5 to A.7 in the
online appendix contain detailed results for the different aggregations.
     What mechanisms are empirically driving the aggregation effect? We find that
the interactions of heterogeneities are more important than the convexification of price
rigidities in creating aggregation effects, but they act with some delay. We show the
relative importance by computing the total consumption price paths in a 350 and an 8
sector economy, as well as the two components from equation (47), due to convexification
and interactions. Figure A.4 in the Online Appendix illustrates how the two channels
contribute to the total gap.


D.     Output correlations
Another contribution of our fully heterogeneous model lies in the realistic and wide degree
of output correlations it can generate following a common monetary policy shock. We
find the interaction of all three heterogeneities is important, and heterogeneity of price
rigidity is a necessary but not sufficient condition to generate realistic correlations. The
overall input share of I/O linkages also plays an important role.
     We use the annual GDP gross output data from the BEA to study this question,

                                              32
which maps closely to yk in the model. Empirically, the unconditional, mean (median)
sectoral output correlations for relatively more aggregate BEA data with 71 sectors
is 0.2620 (0.3999), whereas for disaggregated BEA data with 403 sectors, it is 0.3920
(0.6128). These raw correlations are unconditional; that is, they do not condition on any
shock. Because they include idiosyncratic shocks, they are likely too low to study output
correlations after monetary policy shocks but are a useful benchmark for our analysis.
       In the model simulations, we find heterogeneity of price rigidity is a necessary but
not sufficient condition to generate realistic correlations. To arrive at this conclusion,
we simulate output paths following a monetary policy shock, and compute summary
statistics on all cross correlations.        Table 6 presents the summary statistics for the
baseline calibration of the parameter on inflation in the Taylor rule in panel A and
a more responsive monetary policy in panel B.9 When prices are either fully flexible
or homogeneously rigid, then independent of the distribution of size and I/O shares,
correlations will always be 1 given a common monetary policy shock (cases 1 and 2).
However, as soon as price rigidity is heterogeneous, output correlations start dropping
(case 3). This drop holds regardless of the level of aggregation and regardless of the
systematic response of the monetary policy to inflation.
       The exact assumptions on the model heterogeneities, the level of aggregation, and
specification of monetary policy all play a role in bringing correlations down to more
realistic levels. Table 6 cases 3 - 6 show this result. For 350 sectors, our baseline fully
heterogeneous model (case 6) generates an average correlation of 0.89. For an economy
with more responsive monetary policy, the correlation is 0.80. Going through cases 3-6
shows each heterogeneity plays an additional role.
       We also add a new case 7, an economy with I/O share δ = 0.0001. Now, the
correlation drops even further to 0.45, and to 0.38 for the more responsive monetary
policy case. The 25th percentile, in this last economy, can even become negative, following
a common monetary policy shock.


VII        Concluding Remarks
We present new theoretical and empirical insights into the transmission of monetary policy
shocks when heterogeneity in price stickiness, the I/O structure, and sector size interact.
       Although rich theoretical predictions exist for how heterogeneity in sector size
and I/O structure interact with price stickiness to shape the real effects of monetary
   9
    Section III in the online appendix discusses results for a calibration with a more responsive monetary
policy rule.


                                                   33
policy shocks, we find empirically that heterogeneity in price stickiness is the central
mechanism for generating large and persistent real effects of nominal shocks. Empirically,
heterogeneity in I/O linkages only plays a marginal role. In addition, we document that
small-scale models might substantially underestimate real effects – even though the impact
response of inflation is almost identical across different levels of granularity. Finally, we
find that heterogeneity in price rigidity is key in determining which sectors are the most
important contributors to the transmission of monetary shocks. Heterogeneity in price
rigidity is also necessary to generate realistic output correlations in the model.

I           Proofs
Proposition 1
Proof. When αk = α for all k, we aggregate equations (43) using consumption weights
to obtain

                                           (1 − δ) (1 − α)            α
                               pct (α) =                   mt +               pct−1 (α) .
                                            1 − δ (1 − α)       1 − δ (1 − α)

Equation (45) follows by using the previous expression to solve for pct (α) when a
permanent monetary shock m hits at t∗ . (1) and (2) follow directly from equation (45).


           Proposition 2
Proof. The restriction ωkk0 = ωck0 for all k, k 0 implies pkt = pct for all k. Thus, according
to equation (43), sectoral prices solve


                                    pkt = (1 − αk ) [(1 − δ) mt + δpct ] + αk pkt−1 .

                                                       PK
Iterating backwards and using pct =            ωck pkt yields equation (46).
                                                          k=1

    (1) follows from setting pkt = 0 for t < t∗ and for t = t∗ , ( k ωck αk − ᾱ) = 0.
                                                                     P

    For (2), let denote pect (α) the solution for aggregate consumption prices in Proposition
1. Further assume pct−s = pect−s (α). Hence,
                                                                             !                      ∗                                        !

 Jensen’s inequality, pbct − pect (α) ≤ 0 and decreases in the dispersion of price stickiness
across sectors, {αk }kk=1 . In addition, pct−s ≤ pect−s for all s ≥ 1, which reinforces the result.


           Proposition 3


                                                                    1
Proof. Let denote pbct the response of aggregate consumption prices in Proposition 2.

          For (2), two additional terms come to play. The second term of equation (A.1)
is negative when for the sectors with most sticky prices ω k > ωck . The third term of
equation (A.1) is negative when the covariance term is positive for the most sticky sectors
and negative for the most flexible sectors. Relaxing the assumption that pkt−s = pbkt−s
reinforces these results.
          Finally, we can derive an expression that only contains parameters and the monetary
policy shock on the right-hand side. We have that


                                   pkt = (1 − δ) (1 − αk ) m + δ (1 − αk ) pkt + αk pkt−1                                        (A.2)


which in matrix form using the sectoral price vector pt becomes


                                  pt = [I − δ (I − A) Ω]−1 [(1 − δ) (I − A) ιm + Apt−1 ]                                         (A.3)

        The difference pct − pct is a sum of two terms. The first term in equation (A.10) is a
rescaled version of economy 1 so results 1–4 of Economy 1 still apply. The second term is a
measure of the amplification of monetary non-neutrality due to strategic complementarity
introduced by intermediate inputs. The higher this term, the smaller is the pct relative to
pct .
        From Jensen’s inequality

                                τ                                   τ                   τ

for α2k0 −1 6= α2k0 and t > t∗ .
        Thus, the difference in the consumption price response between baseline and merged
economies, pct − pct , is larger when the difference in frequencies, α, is higher for merged
sectors with higher combined weight, ω ck0 . Relaxing the assumption pct−τ = pct−τ for all
τ ≥ 1 reinforces the result regarding frequencies.



II          Industry by Industry Input-Output Matrix
We use the make table (M AKE) to determine the share of each commodity c that each
industry i produces. We define the market share (“SHARE”) of industry i’s production


                                                             4
of commodity c as


                          SHARE = M AKE           (I × M AKE)−1
                                                             i,j ,                 (A.12)


where I is a matrix of 1s with suitable dimensions.
      We multiply the share and use tables (U SE) to calculate the dollar amount that
industry i sells to industry j. We label this matrix revenue share (REV SHARE), which
is a supplier industry-by-consumer industry matrix,


                           REV SHARE = (SHARE × U SE).                             (A.13)


We use the revenue share matrix to calculate the percentage of industry j’s inputs
purchased from industry i and label the resulting matrix SU P P SHARE:


                 SU P P SHARE = REV SHARE              ((M AKE × I)−1   >
                                                                   i,j ) .         (A.14)


The input-share matrix in equation (A.14) is an industry-by-industry matrix and therefore
consistently maps into our model.



III      Robustness
In this subsection, we first show the specification of monetary policy crucially affects
our conclusions. We then analyze how changes in parameters and tails of the frequency
distribution affect our findings.
      As the first set of robustness checks, we vary the parameters of the Taylor rule. We
also study a specification with exogenous nominal demand, rather than closing the model
with a Taylor rule. We report the results in Figure A.6 and Table A.2 for the same six
cases we studied in the previous section.
      As our first experiment, we increase φπ , the systematic response of monetary policy
to inflation in the Taylor rule, from a baseline value of 1.24 to 2.5.
      We see in Figure A.6 a similar response of inflation independent of whether we study
heterogeneous or homogeneous price stickiness, sector size, and I/O structure. The impact
response of inflation is, however, roughly cut to one-third compared to our baseline in


                                              5
Figure 1, which comes from weaker demand effects. The inflation response tends to be
slightly more persistent with all three forms of heterogeneity, but the cumulative inflation
responses in an economy with φπ = 2.5 are still smaller than in an economy with φπ = 1.24
(compare panel B of Table 3 and Table A.2).
    The higher systematic response to inflation in the Taylor rule reduces the impact
response of consumption by a factor of up to four across different cases (compare panel A
of Table 3 and Table A.2). A model with heterogeneous price stickiness but homogeneous
sector size and I/O structure has an almost twice as large impact response compared to
an economy in which all three forms of heterogeneities interact (case 3 vs. case 6). A
higher weight on inflation stabilization in the Taylor rule for a given demand shock results
in a larger stabilization of output in the standard New Keynesian model. Once we allow
for heterogeneous price stickiness, the cumulative real effects of monetary policy shocks
contract by 40%, with a more stringent response to inflationary pressure in the Taylor rule.
We see similar results once we add heterogeneity in sector size and I/O structure. We see
in Panels A and C of Table 3 and Table A.2 that the different forms of heterogeneity
introduce a slightly more sluggish and persistent response in consumption and real
marginal costs, which explains the large real effects of demand shocks, despite the smaller
effects on impact. This finding is reminiscent of the responder-nonresponder framework
discussed in Carvalho (2006) and the selection effect of Carvalho and Schwartzman (2015).
    Changes in the systematic response to output growth have little impact on the
response of real consumption, inflation, or real marginal costs (not tabulated).
    In our second experiment, we close the model by positing exogenous nominal demand.
Figure A.7 report our findings. The dashed blue line represents our baseline response
with the Taylor rule, and the dash-dotted blue line represents the response for a model
with exogenous nominal demand. Real marginal costs barely move in the model with
exogenous demand, resulting in a small and transient impact response of inflation and
a one-percentage-point response of consumption on impact. The impact response of
consumption is smaller by a factor of five than the impact response with a Taylor rule.
    As a second set of robustness checks, we analyze how changes in parameters and tails
of the frequency distribution affect our findings. First, we study the effect of changes in
risk aversion, σ, the Frisch elasticity, ϕ, the average input share in production, δ, the
elasticity of substitution within and across sectors, η, θ, and the persistence of monetary

policy shocks, ρ, in our full-blown model (case 6 in Table 2). Specifically, we set (baseline
parameters in parentheses) σ = 2(1), ϕ = 1(2), δ = 0.7(0.5), η = 6(2), θ = 10(6), and
ρ = 0.95(0.90). Figure A.8 and Table A.3 report our findings.
    Overall, we see our results in the baseline calibration of Table 3 and Figure 1 are
robust to variations in parameter values. The only exception is the increase of the
coefficient of relative risk aversion, σ, from a baseline value of 1 to 2. The intratemporal
rate of substitution from leisure to consumption determines the real wage. The drop in
consumption results in a drop in the real wage, which increases in σ. Lower real wages
lower the response of real marginal costs and the overall demand pressure.
    Second, Figure A.13 and Figure A.14 plot the impulse response functions for a
trimmed distribution in the frequency of price adjustment. Specifically, we compare the
response of our baseline calibration for case 6 with a calibration that trims the 20%
stickiest sectors and a calibration with a large left tail rather than a large right tail as the
empirical distribution of the frequency of price adjustment. We keep the mean frequency
of price adjustment identical across calibrations. The economy with a right-trimmed tail
has the lowest real effects even though the economy with the large left tail has a similar
impact drop in output but then has much more persistent output dynamics. Our baseline
case has the largest initial drop.
