This paper models the causes of the 2008 financial crisis together with its manifestations, using a Multiple
Indicator Multiple Cause (MIMIC) model. Our analysis is conducted on a cross-section of 85 countries;
we focus on international linkages that may have allowed the crisis to spread across countries. Our
model of the cross-country incidence of the crisis combines 2008 changes in real GDP, the stock market,
country credit ratings, and the exchange rate. We explore the linkages between these manifestations
of the crisis and a number of its possible causes from 2006 and earlier. The causes we consider are
both national (such as equity market run-ups that preceded the crisis) and, critically, international financial
and real linkages between countries and the epicenter of the crisis. We consider the United States
to be the most natural origin of the 2008 crisis, though we also consider six alternative sources of the
crisis. A country holding American securities that deteriorate in value is exposed to an American crisis
through a financial channel. Similarly, a country which exports to the United States is exposed to
an American downturn through a real channel. Despite the fact that we use a wide number of possible
causes in a flexible statistical framework, we are unable to find strong evidence that international linkages
can be clearly associated with the incidence of the crisis. In particular, countries heavily exposed to
either American assets or trade seem to behave little differently than other countries; if anything, countries
seem to have benefited slightly from American exposure.

1. Introduction


       In Rose and Spiegel (2009), hereafter “RS”, we modeled the causes of the 2008 financial

crisis together with its manifestations, using a Multiple Indicator Multiple Cause (MIMIC)

model. In that paper, we focused on national causes and consequences of the crisis and

deliberately ignored cross‐country “contagion” effects. This paper is intended to fill that gap; it

empirically models various channels through which a shock that hits one or more countries

might then be transmitted internationally.


       We follow RS closely so as to make our results as complementary as possible. Our

analysis is conducted on the same broad cross‐section of countries. Our model of the incidence

of the crisis is the same, combining 2008 changes in a) real GDP, b) the stock market, c) country

credit ratings, and d) the exchange rate into a single measure of crisis incidence. We also

control for national causes of the crisis identified by RS, dated from 2006 and earlier. These

national causes are relevant parts of an early warning system if crises are country‐specific in

nature. They are also important if common international shocks hit a number of countries

simultaneously, but a country’s vulnerability to common shocks is determined by national

                                                 1
characteristics. However, the national focus of RS is inappropriate if crises begin in one country

and then spread contagiously across national borders. Accordingly, we expand our search and

focus on international linkages in this paper.


       We emphasize at the outset that this project has a limited scope. Two blinkers are

particularly important. First, our analysis is cross‐sectional in nature, and is focused

deliberately on a period of time when we know there was a major financial/economic crisis that

affected a large number of countries. That is, we make no attempt at all to model the timing of

the crisis. We consider the latter to be a more challenging objective than ours, which is merely

to determine the incidence of the 2008 crisis across countries. Success in predicting the cross‐

sectional intensity of the crisis is a necessary condition for a useful early warning system, but is

far from being sufficient. Second, with the benefit of hindsight, we do not have to model the

epicenter of the 2008 crisis, a critical ingredient for any model of contagion. Though we

consider a number of alternatives, it seems reasonable to model the United States as the

epicenter of the 2008 financial crisis. Even strong evidence of contagion would be difficult to

use in a serious early warning system, since future crises epicenters are unknown.


2. Literature Review


Concepts: Common Shocks vs. International Transmission of Shocks


       The existence of international linkages or “contagion” in previous crises (exchange rate,

banking, and financial) is controversial. The controversy begins with disagreement concerning

the appropriate definition of the phenomenon. The issue is that common movements at a

point in time may either be manifestations of common shocks that hit different countries

                                                  2
differently, or shocks from one or more countries that spill out contagiously via different

channels of transmission. Common shocks and contagion may be observationally similar.

However, they represent different phenomena, with radically different policy implications (for

instance, “isolation” is appropriate for contagion but not common shocks).


       A number of authors [e.g. Forbes and Rigobon (2001) and Edwards (2002)] take a more

narrow view of contagion. They argue that both common shocks and the international

transmission of external shocks are observed in tranquil periods as well as episodes of crisis. In

the tradition of epidemiological studies, “true contagion” is then a larger‐than‐expected effect

of foreign shocks. They therefore define contagion as an exceptional increase in the magnitude

of international linkages, such as the 50 percent fall in the Brazilian stock market subsequent to

the collapse of the Russian ruble in 1998. Forbes and Rigobon (2001) refer to this narrower

concept as “shift contagion.”


       Using this concept, Forbes and Rigobon (2002) find no evidence of “contagion” for a

number of crises. However, they do find what they call “interdependence,” the cross‐country

correlation of asset prices during tranquil and periods alike. Similarly, Bekaert, et al (2005) find

no evidence of increases in correlations subsequent to the 1995 peso crisis, although they do

find evidence after the 1997 Asian crisis. For the current crisis, Eichengreen, et al (2009) find

that sensitivity to common shocks increased at the Fall 2008 volatility peaks for bank credit

default swap spreads, using data for 45 large banks in Europe and the United States.


       For our cross‐sectional study of the 2008 crisis, examining whether correlations rise is

impossible, as our sample only considers a single episode. However, it seems possible, in


                                                 3
principle, to distinguish between country‐specific sensitivity to common shocks and the

country‐specific contagious responses to particular foreign shocks. A country’s response to a

common shock seems to be a multilateral phenomena (e.g., more financially developed

economies might respond to a common increase in risk aversion), while the contagious

response to an individual foreign shock seems to be intrinsically bilateral (e.g., countries with

more exposure to American assets might respond more to a decline in American asset prices).

In RS, we attempted to model multilateral phenomena using national data; in this paper, we

focus on bilateral phenomena in our search for contagion.


Empirical Evidence on Channels of Contagion


       Even if there is evidence of contagion, there are different channels of transmission

through which countries can be linked. Two are of particular interest: a real channel that

focuses on international trade, and a financial channel that is concerned with asset cross‐

holdings.


Trade Linkages


       Countries linked through international trade may experience contagion if their trading

partners devalue their currencies. That is, strong trade linkages may encourage devaluation (or

self‐fulfilling expectations thereof) in response to foreign currency shocks, since countries wish

to maintain external competitiveness. The basic mechanisms have been spelled out by Gerlach

and Smets (1995) and Huh and Kasa (2001). Crisis contagion can also hit economies through

declines in merchandise trade [e.g. Reisen (2008)].



                                                 4
         Most studies in the literature stress the channel of contagion through foreign trade

linkages. The intensity of trade linkages between two countries has been measured as the

share of bilateral trade between the two countries in total trade [e.g. Eichengreen, Rose, and

Wyplosz (1996) and Forbes and Chinn (2004)]. As a form of contagion of a specific crisis, trade

exposure has been measured in this manner relative to the “ground zero” country where the

crisis first started, as in Glick and Rose (1999) and Van Rijckeghem and Weder (2001), or in the

case of a regional crisis such as the 1997 Asian crisis, the sum of bilateral exposure to the

affected countries within the region, as in Baig and Goldfajn (1999). At the firm level, Forbes

(2004) measures the intensity of exposure of firms to the Russian and Asian crises of the late

1990s as a zero‐one variable based on whether sales to those countries exceeded 5% of total

sales.


         Other measures of trade linkages in the literature look for common competitors, as in

Baig and Goldfajn (1999), who examine exposure to the United States and Japan, or Glick and

Rose (1999), Van Rijckeghem and Weder (2001) and Forbes (2002), who measure the degree to

which a country’s exports compete with those of the ground zero country. For example, Forbes

(2002) measures this as the product of the share of exports from the ground zero country to

total global trade in that industry (a measure of the importance of the ground zero country in

global trade in that industry), and the share of trade in that industry in that country’s GDP (a

measure of the importance of trade in that industry to the affected country).


         In the case of the current crisis, the common competitor channel seems less important,

as the epicenter of the crisis was the United States, an important exporter globally, but one



                                                 5
whose export bundle and trading partners seems to be unique. It seems much more likely that

the primary trade impact of the crisis was lost export opportunities, initially in the United

States, but then in other countries as they experienced their own downturns. As such, we

concentrate on the exposure channel of the importance of a country as a trading partner

below.


         Most of the studies find evidence that trade linkages matter. Eichengreen, Rose and

Wyplosz (1996) find that trade linkages explain contagion patterns in currency crises across a

group of industrial countries. Glick and Rose (1999) find that currency crises tend to be

regional, supporting the notion that the importance of trade linkages affects the pattern of

contagion in currency crises. Similarly, Eichengreen and Rose (1998) find that while both

macroeconomic and trade channels play a role in conveying shocks internationally, trade

linkages dominate. Forbes (2004) finds that firms with higher exposure to Asia and Russia

experienced reduced equity returns during those countries’ crises. However, Lahiri and Vegh

(2003) find that central banks often actively resist devaluations during financial crises, shedding

doubt on the “contagion through competitive devaluation” hypothesis.


Contagion through Foreign Asset Exposure


         The most direct source of contagion on the financial side is through deterioration in a

country’s balance sheet because of capital losses on assets with international exposure.

International cross‐holdings of assets increased substantially in the run‐up to the 2008 financial

crisis. These cross‐holdings are desirable in tranquil periods, as shocks are usually imperfectly

correlated across countries, allowing international risk‐sharing; Allen and Gale (2000).


                                                 6
However, Allen and Gale also demonstrate that extreme shocks can lead to deterioration in

balance sheet positions which can then spread across regions, the classic definition of

contagion.


       Exposure to contagion through this financial channel may have been exacerbated in the

2008 crisis because of the prevalence of holdings of exotic financial instruments; these were

particularly vulnerable to capital losses in the wake of a general downturn. For instance, when

the market price of United States asset‐backed securities fell, European banks holding that

paper, as well as related conduits and structured investment vehicles (SIVs), experienced losses.

These losses then spread to the asset‐backed commercial paper market, as the institutions

holding these money‐losing instruments then turned to that market for funds, initiating a

decline in liquidity in that market as well; see Davis (2008).


       Coudert and Gex (2008) argue that credit default swap (CDS) market activity is also

prone to contagion, noting that that market had seen a large rise in correlations of asset prices

since August 2007. This induces investors to respond to bad news about an individual asset or

market with more concern about counterparty risk of related and seemingly unrelated assets.

In a similar vein, Gros and Micossi (2008) note that many European banks found themselves

exposed to foreign countries due to the activities of their affiliates on those countries. While

their balance sheets were formally separate, these banks centralized their asset and liability

management, ensuring that subsidiary financial difficulties would find their way to home

country lending policies.




                                                  7
       Vulnerability to adverse external shocks may be exacerbated due to poor balance sheet

positions. For example, Davis (2008) argues that leveraged investors increase the risk of market

contagion, as they may be forced to sell in illiquid situations, feeding a “fire‐sale” dynamic that

forces down prices further and results in the need for even more selling. Adrian and Shin

(2008) argue that mark‐to‐market practices exacerbate the severity of the impact of changes in

prices and perceived risks on market liquidity.


       As measures of direct financial exposure, Forbes and Chinn (2004) use the ratio of total

bank lending and foreign direct investment to a given country as a share of GDP. Ehrmann and

Fratzscher (2009) use all bilateral stocks of assets and liabilities for foreign direct investment,

portfolio investment and debt, and loans, as a share of GDP.


       Empirical evidence confirms the existence of “shift‐contagion” in financial markets. For

example, Calvo and Reinhart (1996) find an increase in the correlation on returns in Asian and

Latin American equity and bond markets following the Mexican peso crisis. Similarly, Baig and

Goldfajn (1999) find evidence of increased correlation in asset returns in emerging markets

following the 1997 Asian financial crisis.


Contagious “Sudden Stops” in International Credit


       A number of studies [e.g. Davis (2008)], argue that the international interbank market

may be a source of contagion and the global transmission of shocks. These markets typically

lack collateral, and moral hazard is often introduced through implicit government guarantees of

liquidity. This leads banks to conduct business in this market under conditions of low liquidity

and poor information. As such, when credit disruptions affect particular banks, other banks

                                                  8
often respond by rationing extensions of credit (rather than stiffening borrowing terms). The

market can then seize up, with the result that international extensions of credit cease as in the

Asian Financial crisis of 1997. In that crisis, weakly‐capitalized Japanese banks immediately

canceled credit lines of as much as 10 percent of GDP [Reisen (2008)].


       The notion that linkages may exist through mutual dependence on foreign creditors is

not new. Kaminsky and Reinhart (2000) divide borrowing countries into one set that

predominantly borrows from Japanese banks and another that predominantly borrows from

American banks. They find that once a number of countries in a given cohort exhibit crisis

characteristics, the unconditional probability that an unaffected country in that cohort will also

fall into crisis increases dramatically. Caramazza, et al (2000) also examine exposure to a

common creditor, measured as the share of a country’s borrowing from the country that lent

most to the ground zero country, the importance of the borrower for that creditor country, and

the product of these two measures, indicating mutual importance. They confirm that exposure

to a common creditor is a significant source of contagion. Van Rijckeghem and Weder (2001)

they develop and indicator of competition for funds, which measures the overall similarity

between the borrowing patterns of the country in question and the ground zero country, using

a methodology analogous to the measure of the intensity of trade competition with the ground

zero country used in the literature cited above.


       Similarly, Peek and Rosengren (1997) examine the case of the Japanese banking crisis,

and find that disruptions to banking “parents” had an adverse impact on their lending through

subsidiaries in the United States. They conclude that there may well be a role for contagion for



                                                   9
financial linkages over and above that identified for trade linkages, and indeed, that some of

the contagion previously identified as attributable to trade linkages may actually stem from

financial linkages, as the two are highly correlated in the data. However, in practice it has

proven difficult to empirically disentangle contagion due to trade linkages from that

attributable to financial linkages, as countries that are closely linked in one dimension tend to

also be linked in the other [e.g. Kaminsky and Reinhart (2002)].


       In addition, it should be noted that not all potential crises actually metastasize into

serious international financial crises. As discussed by Kaminsky, Reinhart and Vegh (2003),

there have been a number of potentially major financial crises (such as the 1999 Brazilian

devaluation and the 2001 Argentine default) that did not have dramatic international

implications in practice. They note that one common distinction between cases where

domestic financial crises did and did not lead to international spillovers was whether or not

there were other borrowers exposed to a common leveraged creditor. These common

leveraged creditors helped to foster contagion, as difficulties experienced in one borrowing

country led to deteriorated bank balance sheet positions. In that sense, they reconcile the

absence of contagion with a “fundamental,” namely the lack of a common creditor to spread

the shock internationally.


       As the case of the “common competitor” channel for trade exposure, the “common

creditor” channel is likely to be less relevant in the current crisis, where the downturn centered

in the world’s largest debtor, striking major creditors across the globe. As such, we concentrate

below on the channel of financial exposure through direct holdings of foreign assets.



                                                10
       Finally, while the literature has been generally upbeat about the possibilities of

successful early warning models, there are results that foreshadow the limited usefulness for

contagion‐type linkages that we search for in this paper. For example, Kaminsky and Reinhart

(2002) find no evidence that knowing that a single crisis is occurring somewhere in the world

raises the probability of a future crisis elsewhere. However, they do find predictive power for

“systemic” crises, where one‐half or more of the countries studied are having a crisis, to predict

an increased risk of crisis in the examined country. They conclude that the contagion

relationship is “highly nonlinear” and difficult to estimate precisely.


       Our reading of the literature leads to believe that contagious responses along both real

and financial channels are both theoretically possible and empirically plausible. Accordingly, we

now search for evidence of contagion in the 2008 crisis, using the measures suggested in the

literature insofar as possible.


3. The Sample of Data


       We are interested in examining a broad cross‐section of countries and territories.3 We

wish to include all the countries that have been dramatically affected by the crisis as well as a

number of other countries that have not been affected as badly (as controls). Since the

incidence of the crisis was notable among high‐income countries, we include all of them as well

as a large number of developing countries. In particular, we examine all countries with real

GDP per capita of at least $10,000 in 2003. To this set of countries, we add those with real GDP

per capita of at least $4,000 and a population of at least one million.4 After eliminating




                                                 11
countries with missing data, we are left with a sample of 85 countries; their names are

tabulated in Appendix Table A1.


Identifying Cross‐sectional Differences in Crisis Severity


          Identifying the incidence of a financial crisis (currency, asset, banking, or other) across

countries is no simple matter, let alone determining its severity (e.g. Berg, et al, 2004). Any

reasonable methodology should take into account the fact that potentially serious

measurement error is inherently present.


          Ours is a non‐structural approach. In particular, we consider four observable indicators

of the crisis, and model the incidence and severity of the crisis as being a latent variable that is

manifest through these variables. When measuring these manifestations of the crisis, we

restrict ourselves insofar as possible to data from 2008 (we sometimes use data from early

2009).5


          Our first measure of the 2008 crisis is real GDP growth over 2008, as estimated by the

Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU) in early March 2009.6 We also consider a broad range of

financial variables covering stocks, bonds, and international finance. Above and beyond

growth, we include: 1) the percentage change in a broad measure of the national stock market

over the 2008 calendar year (collected from national sources); 2) the percentage change in the

SDR (multilateral) exchange rate over 2008 (measured as the domestic currency price of a

Special Drawing Right and taken from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics); and 3) the

change in the country credit rating from Institutional Investor magazine. The latter are ratings

created by Institutional Investor that rank 177 countries on a scale between 0 and 100 where

                                                   12
100 represents the least likelihood of default (as of March 2009, Switzerland was the most

highly rated country with a score of 94.0, while Zimbabwe brought up the rear at 4.6).7

Institutional Investor publishes these rankings biannually in March and September; we use the

change between March 2008 and March 2009.8 We also use an analogue from Euromoney for

sensitivity analysis. Our four measures of the consequences/manifestations of the crisis are

presented for thirty countries in Table 1, sorted by the size of the 2008 stock market decline.


4. Linking Incidence and Causes with the MIMIC Model


        Our primary interest is in linking crisis incidence to its causes. To avoid endogeneity

issues and to stay within the setting of an early warning model, we restrict ourselves to data

from 2006 and earlier for our crisis causes. We link 2006 (and earlier) causes of the crisis with

2008 measures of its intensity using a Multiple Indicator Multiple Cause (MIMIC) model.


        The MIMIC model was introduced to econometrics by Goldberger (1972); see also

Aigner et al (1984) and Gertler (1988). The model consists of two sets of equations:


                                           yi , j = β jξ i + υ i                                     (1)


                                          ξi = γ k xi , k + ζ i                                      (2)


where: yi,j is an observation on crisis indicator j for country i, xi,k is an observation for potential

crisis cause k for country i; ξi is a latent variable representing the severity of the crisis for

country i; β and γ are vectors of coefficients, and ν and ζ are well‐behaved disturbances.9

Equation (1) links J consequences and manifestations of the crisis (denoted by y) to the



                                                    13
unobservable measure of crisis severity. In practice, we model this measurement equation

using our ( J = 4 ) indications of the crisis (the 2008 national changes in: a) real GDP, b) the

stock market, c) the credit rating, and d) the exchange rate). The second equation models the

determination of the crisis as a function of K causes (x’s, dated 2006 or earlier).


       By substituting (2) into (1), one derives a model which is no longer a function of the

latent variable ξ. This MIMIC model is a system of J equations with right‐hand‐sides restricted

to be proportional to each another. These proportionality restrictions constrain the structure

to be a “one‐factor” model of the latent variable; with the addition of normalization, they

achieve identification of the parameters in (1) and (2). One of the features of the MIMIC model

is that it explicitly incorporates measurement error about a key variable – the incidence and

severity of the crisis – in a non‐trivial and plausible way. Indeed, this is one of the chief

attractions of the MIMIC model to us.10


       We estimate our MIMIC models in STATA with GLLAMM; Rabe‐Hesketh et al (2004a, b)

provide further details. The iterative estimation technique begins with adaptive quadrature

which is followed by Newton‐Raphson.11 We normalize and achieve identification by imposing

a factor loading of unity on the stock market change.12


       In RS, we examined more than eighty possible national determinants of the crisis

suggested by the literature. We found that only two variables worked consistently well; the

natural logarithm of 2006 real GDP per capita, and the percentage change in the stock market

between 2003 and 2006. We include both as controls in all of our analysis, as well as the log of

2006 population.


                                                  14
       In Table 2 we report MIMIC estimates of γ when we include our three control variables

as potential causes in (2); we use our four default indicators as measures of the crisis. We also

provide sensitivity analysis in Table 2. First, we replace the Institutional Investor country credit

rating with its analogue from Euromoney. Secondly, we drop the exchange rate indicator from

our four manifestations of the crisis, since some countries use the exchange rate as a tool of

monetary policy. Thirdly, we replace our 2008 growth estimate with the 2009 estimate made

by the Economist Intelligence unit in September 2009. Our results consistently indicate that

size has no significant impact on the incidence of crises across countries, while income has a

significantly negative impact. Further, countries that experienced larger stock market rises

between 2003 and 2006 also experienced more severe crises in 2008. These intuitive results

mirror those of RS.


5. Contagion via International Financial Linkages


       We now add each of the potential financial linkages suggested by our literature review

to the default MIMIC model of Table 2 one by one, and report the estimates in Table 3.

Throughout, we consistently retain size, income and the 2003‐6 stock market rise as causes

(x’s). The coefficients tabulated in Table 3 are taken from our default MIMIC model augmented

by the cause recorded in the extreme left‐hand side; four crisis indicators are used to model ξ,

while size, income, and the stock market rise are included as causes ( x ’s), but not recorded so

as to conserve on space. Standard errors are recorded in parentheses, and coefficients

significantly different from zero at the .05 (.01) level are marked by one (two) asterisk(s).




                                                 15
       We also include in Table 3 four other columns of sensitivity analysis. Each perturbs the

methodology in some way so as to show the sensitivity of our results. The first column to the

right of the default uses the Euromoney country credit ranking in place of that from Institutional

Investor, while the next drops the exchange rate change as a crisis indicator. The two

additional columns at the right‐hand side both drop the size control (which is rarely statistically

significant) and replace it with either the current account or net foreign assets, both measured

as percentages of GDP.


       The first row of Table 3 adds to our default specification the share of external assets

(taken from the IMF’s 2006 CPIS data set) that are held in the United States. At the end of

2006, Canada held a total of US$633.05 externally in total portfolio investments, of which some

US$325.84 billion (or 51.5%) were held in the United States. Canada was thus more heavily

exposed to American financial risk than say the UK, which held only 26.6% of its external

financial assets in America. The top left cell in Table 3 is the (γ) coefficient for the marginal

effect of the share of foreign assets held in the United States on the latent variable of crisis

incidence (ξ).13 The coefficient is positive and significantly different from zero at the .05 level;

countries with more exposure to American financial assets seem to have experienced less

intense crises. Further, this result seems to be insensitive to the exact econometric

specification of the statistical model.


       The result that countries with greater exposure to American assets experienced less

severe crises may seem initially surprising, especially given the wide‐spread chatter in the

popular press about toxic American assets. However, it seems to be present in the data and is



                                                  16
not a mere statistical illusion. Figure 1 provides simple scatter‐plots of our four manifestations

of the crisis graphed against the share of external assets held in the United States. Countries

that had larger shares of their 2006 foreign wealth in America seem systematically to have

experienced smaller stock market declines in 2008.14


       It seems reasonable to view the USA as the epicenter of the crisis, but other candidates

exist. In Western Europe, a number of countries have experienced particularly severe

downturns, including the UK, Germany and Spain. Two large economies in East Asia – Japan

and Korea – are also reasonable candidates for the dubious distinction of “crisis epicenter.”

Finally, a number of smaller countries in Europe – Iceland, Ireland, the Ukraine, and the three

Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – have also had dramatic contractions (we refer to

these as the “small crisis” countries). Accordingly, the next six rows of Table 3 replace the

fraction of external assets held in the United States with analogous measures for e.g., the

fraction of foreign assets held in the UK (Germany, Japan, etc). However, none of these

coefficients is statistically distinguishable from zero.


       Thus far, we have considered only the fraction of total foreign assets held in the United

States (and our other candidate epicenters). However, not all assets are created equal and the

2008 crisis is sometimes particularly closely linked with poor loans, which were often

securitized and sold off as debt. Accordingly, we also consider the share of total external debt

(both total and long‐term debt) held in various countries; our results are again tabulated in

Table 3. Narrowing our focus to these sub‐sets of external financial exposure only seems to




                                                  17
blur the result further, though greater exposure to the United States still seems to be

associated with somewhat less intense crises (as always, holding other things constant).


       We explore our financial linkages further by taking advantage of a data set unique to

America, the Treasury International Capital (TIC) system, which records foreign holdings of

various American assets by residents of foreign countries.15 This data set only includes

American securities, so we normalize e.g., Canadian holdings of American assets by Canadian

GDP (for the CPIS data set, we are able to express Canadian holdings of American assets as a

share of total external Canadian assets). However, when we add these international financial

linkages to the United States to our default MIMIC model, we find only statistically weak and

sensitive results; six types of American assets are included in Table 3.


       Our last pair of financial linkages is taken from the World Bank’s Global Development

Finance data set. Both refer to the currency composition of public and publicly‐guaranteed

(PPG) debt; we have shares of PPG debt denominated in both yen and US$. We try both of

these series in the final rows of Table 3. The higher the share of debt denominated in yen, the

more intense the crisis seems to be, though this result is not usually different from zero at

standard levels of statistical significance. By way of contrast, countries with higher fractions of

dollar debt had less intense crises.16 Figure 2 presents scatter‐plots of the four crisis

manifestations graphed against the fraction of PPG debt denominated in dollars, and shows

evidence of weak positive correlations.


       To summarize, there is little strong evidence of an international financial linkage which

might have allowed a crisis centered initially in America to spread to other countries


                                                 18
contagiously.17 Despite looking across a number of different potential measures of

international financial linkage as well as different potential epicenters of the 2008 crisis,

evidence of contagion seems weak. If anything, it appears that countries with closer financial

ties to the United States seem to have experienced less intense crises.


Trade Linkages


       The evidence presented in Table 3 covers a number of different financial channels that

might link the epicenter of the 2008 crisis to other countries. But the channel through which

the crisis was transmitted might have been real, not financial. Accordingly, we now search for

evidence that the channel for contagion was real, and can be measured through bilateral trade

exposure.


       Table 4 is an analogue to Table 3 but examines trade linkages instead of financial

linkages. Specifically, we include the fraction of total 2006 exports that a country sends to the

United States as a fraction of its total exports. Canada, Mexico, and Haiti each sent over 80% of

their exports to the United States while Cyprus, Qatar, and Macedonia sent less than 1% of

their exports to America.18 The former three countries might logically have expected their

trade to suffer more than the latter in the event of an American recession. Does this measure

of export vulnerability help explain relative crisis performance? The results in the top row

indicate that the answer is affirmative; greater export dependence on the United States leads

systematically to less intense financial disruptions. Figure 3 provides the relevant graphical

evidence, scattering the four crisis manifestations against export dependence on America. This

relationship does not characterize other potential epicenters of the crisis; there is no systematic


                                                 19
strong evidence that export dependence on any except the small crisis countries matters.

However, countries with substantial exports to the small crisis countries – especially those in

the Baltics – are systematically associated with more intense crises.19


       The top half of table 4 focuses on export exposure to the United States (and other

potential epicenters of the 2008 crisis). The bottom half is analogous, but substitutes two‐way

trade – the sum of bilateral exports and imports, divided by total exports and imports – in place

of exports. However, this does not change the results substantively. Countries that traded

more with the USA in 2006 seemed to experience less intense crises in 2006; the visual

analogue is graphed in Figure 4.20


Including both Real and Financial Linkages Simultaneously

       Thus far, the analysis has focused on searching for a single transmission channel for

international crisis contagion. However, there may be more than one channel in which a crisis

can spread contagiously. Accordingly we include a number of different transmission

mechanisms simultaneously in Table 5.


       In Table 5a, we tabulate coefficient estimates for a number of different causes which we

include in the MIMIC model simultaneously. Above and beyond our three default causes (2006

size, 2006 income, and the 2003‐2006 stock market rise), we include four channels of

contagion. Two are financial: the fraction of external assets held in American securities and the

fraction of PPG debt denominated in dollars. The other two are real: exports to both the

United States and the small crisis countries. As always, we provide a number of different




                                                20
perturbations of the model to check on the robustness of our findings. Table 5b is the analogue

to Table 5a in every way, but substitutes trade with America in place of exports to America.


       The results in Table 5 are weak; almost none of the channels for contagion seem to have

statistically discernible effects on crisis intensity. The only exception is the real channel to the

United States; countries that proportionately either exported more to or (especially) traded

more with the United States in 2006 experienced less severe 2008 crises. However, there is

little evidence of contagion spreading through a financial channel.


6. Summary and Conclusion


       In this short paper, we model the causes of the international financial crisis that hit

much of the world in 2008 . We use a flexible econometric methodology which takes into

account the facts that the intensity of the crisis varies across countries, is only imperfectly

measured, and may have multiple causes and manifestations. We rely on our previous work to

model the national causes of the crisis, using data from 2006 and earlier. Above and beyond

these national causes, we search for evidence that the 2008 financial crisis spread contagiously

from the United States to other countries, via a number of both financial and real channels that

might have transmitted the crisis from its epicenter. While we believe that it is natural to

model the origins of the crisis as American, we also test for six other potential epicenters.


       Despite our broad‐ranging search, we are unable to find strong evidence of contagion.

Indeed, countries that were more exposed to the United States ‐‐ those that held

disproportionate amounts of American securities or depended heavily on exports to the United

States – seem if anything to have experienced smaller crises, holding other factors constant.

                                                 21
Overall though, we find remarkably little evidence that the intensity of the crisis across

countries can be easily modeled using quantitative techniques and standard data that is either

country‐specific or links countries to the source of the crisis. This negative finding in the cross‐

section is powerful since we know, with the benefit of hindsight, both the approximate timing

and the epicenter of the 2008 crisis. It makes us skeptical of the ability of “early warning

systems” which must be able to predict the incidence of future crises across both countries and

time.

3
   We refer below to all these entities as “countries” simply for the sake of convenience.
4
   We use 2003 since we used the Penn World Table Mark 6.2 which ends in 2004 and has a number of missing
values for that year. Our measure of income in the PWT6.2 is “rgdpl”.
5
   Using 2008 seems like a reasonable choice to us. Though some of the real effects of the crisis began before 2008
(the NBER Dating Committee uses December 2007 as the cyclic peak for the United States), the dramatic
downturns took place in the latter part of 2008. Similarly while some financial distress began in the late summer
of 2007 (or somewhat earlier), restricting our analysis to the larger events of 2008 seems reasonable, given that
our focus is cross‐country in nature. But we restrict our attention to crisis causes from 2006 and earlier to avoid
any overlap between causes and consequences of the crisis.
6
   The EIU forecast of 2009 growth is highly positively correlated across countries with their 2008 estimates. Since
countries have differing underlying growth rates, one would prefer to account for this by e.g., using the size of the
output gap, but we know of no source for such data.
7
   Institutional Investor states that their ratings “… are based on information provided by senior economists and
sovereign‐risk analysts at leading global banks and money management and securities firm”; further details are
available at: http://www.iimagazinerankings.com/rankingsRankCCMaGlobal09/methodology.asp.
8
   We note in passing that we gathered data on changes in sovereign ratings (short‐ and long‐term on both
domestic and foreign debt, as relevant) from Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch. However, these ratings
change little over the course of 2008, so we were unable to integrate sovereign rating changes sensibly into our
measure of crisis incidence.
9
   Our normalization implies that the latent variable estimate should be interpreted as decreasing in crisis severity.
10
    Much of the previous literature on the determinants of financial crises (e.g. Kaminsky, Lizondo and Reinhart,
1998) and Berg and Patillo, 1999) follow Eichengreen et al (1996) and use discrete characterizations of economies
as being in or out of crisis, either in an ad hoc way or based on some objective criteria; this variable as then treated
as observed without error. In actuality, the severity of a crisis is like to be a continuous variable, and one that is
only observed with error. The MIMIC framework accounts for both measurement error and continuity.
11
    Occasionally we use a different iterative technique to achieve convergence.
12
    We follow Breusch (2005) in choosing to load first on the stock market because it delivers a better fit in a
bivariate regression than our three other crisis indicators.
13
    The number of observations available varies by cause because of data availability.
14
    Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia, Bermuda, and Costa Rica all had more than 60% of their foreign assets in the
United States, and had relatively small stock market declines compared with countries with less than 10% of their
foreign wealth invested in America (which include Romania, Latvia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Spain, Austria, and
Cyprus).
15
    Details are available at http://www.treas.gov/tic/.
16
    It is worth nothing that this result does not depend on using the exchange rate depreciation as a measure of
crisis manifestation; indeed, the fraction of 2006 PPG debt denominated in dollars has a smaller correlation with
2008 depreciation than with e.g., 2008 growth.
17
    Little of substance changes if we substitute 2009 growth estimates as a crisis consequence in place of those for
2008.
18
    Iran and Cuba also sent less than 1% of their exports to the United States, though for more political reasons
than the other three countries.
19
    Much of this is not of particular interest, since there is considerable intra‐Baltic trade, and the Baltics are all
included in the regressions, unlike the regressions which link other countries to e.g., the United States and do not
include the United States as an observation (since American cannot export to America).
20
    Again, trade with the small European crisis countries is strongly correlated with greater crisis intensity.
21
    This includes series on: population; real GDP per capita; current account/GDP; stock market capitalization/GDP.
