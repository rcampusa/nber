How will a nation’s aggregate urban productivity be affected by climate change? The joint
distribution of climate conditions and economic activity across a nation’s cities will together
determine industrial average exposure to climate risk. Air conditioning (AC) can greatly reduce
this heat exposure. We develop a simple model of air conditioning adoption by heterogeneous
firms within an industry. Our analysis suggests that high productivity firms are more likely to
adopt AC since they suffer larger productivity losses when it is hot. Given that the most
productive firms produce a disproportionate share of industry-level output, we present
aggregation results highlighting how the industry’s output is insulated from the heat. Our
empirical analysis of the impacts of heat on total factor productivity in U.S manufacturing yields
findings broadly consistent with our model’s predictions.

I. Introduction


      Temperatures above the human comfort zone can cause fatigue, loss of focus, and even
cognitive impairment, all of which can diminish one’s workplace performance. Indeed, a wide
range of studies have found a negative relationship between temperature and worker
performance as temperatures begin to exceed 75 degrees Fahrenheit (e.g. Ramsey, 1995;
Seppanen et al., 2004; Hancock et al., 2007; Adharvyu et al., 2014). Recent economic studies
that have exploited quasi-experimental variation in temperature exposure have documented
similar results at a national scale (Deryugina and Hsiang 2014, Graff Zivin and Neidell 2014)
and cross-national scale (Hsiang, 2010; Dell et al., 2012; Heal and Park, 2013). Thus, absent
effective adaptation strategies, climate change is expected to significantly reduce labor
productivity.
      One adaptation strategy for coping with increased heat is to adopt air conditioning.
Residential air conditioning adoption has been shown to greatly reduce heat-induced mortality
and to increase quality of life in hot humid places (Barecca et al., 2015; Barreca et al. 2016,
Biddle 2008, Deschenes and Greenstone 2011, Oi 1996). Evidence on the industrial side
suggests that productivity impacts are concentrated in industries and countries that are least
likely to have adopted climate control technologies (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014 and Heal and
Park, 2013, respectively). That poorer countries experience a larger negative marginal effect of
heat on macroeconomic performance is also consistent with the notion that access to cooling
infrastructure may play an important role in adaptation to climate change (Dell et al., 2013).
      Indeed, government officials in nations close to the equator are well aware of the challenges
their nations face. Singapore’s founding father Lee Kuan Yew was asked what the keys were to
Singapore’s fast economic growth over the last 50 years. He replied, “Air conditioning was a
most important invention for us…. It changed the nature of civilization by making development
possible in the tropics. Without air conditioning you can work only in the cool early-morning
hours or at dusk.”1

    The Singapore case highlights the potential for costly air conditioning (AC) to insulate
certain economic sectors from exposure to heat. The degree to which firms adapt to climate
change by adopting air conditioning has macroeconomic consequences.
    How will a nation’s aggregate urban productivity be affected by climate change? The joint
distribution of climate conditions and economic activity across a nation’s cities will together
determine industrial average exposure to climate risk. Such risks will change over time as this
joint distribution evolves. Conditional on a firm’s locational choice, a firm can invest in air
conditioning to offset heat exposure. When a firm invests in air conditioning it incurs a fixed
cost of installation and an operating cost of purchasing energy to generate these cooling services.
A profit maximizing firm will tradeoff any gains from adopting air conditioning against these
costs.
    In this paper, we develop a simple model of air conditioning adoption by heterogeneous
firms. The modern IO literature has focused on studying the causes and consequences of within
industry firm heterogeneity (see Syverson 2011, Davis and Haltiwanger 1994, Davis,
Haltiwanger and Shuh 2004). This within industry heterogeneity is important because firm-level
productivity influences the benefits from AC adoption. In particular, we show that high
productivity firms are more likely to adopt AC since they suffer larger productivity losses when
it is hot. As the climate warms, some firms in the middle of the productivity distribution will
find it optimal to adopt AC and will no longer be impacted by temperature extremes. At the
same time, low-productivity firms will persist without air conditioning and thus suffer under
climate change, while high-productivity firms remain unaffected by climate since they already
adopted AC.
    Since firms at the higher end of the productivity distribution account for a disproportionate
share of industry-level output, and those are precisely the firms mostly likely to insulate
themselves from ambient temperatures, the macroeconomic effects of climate change will be
smaller than a naïve model of adaptation might predict. As in Gabaix (2011), shocks to large
firms (or in our case the absence of those shocks) play an oversized role in determining
aggregated economic impacts. Our key insight is that air conditioning adoption is not orthogonal
to fundamental productivity parameters and thus a proper accounting of the impacts of climate
change on industrial output requires additional information on the distribution of firm types
within an industry.
      We then extend this model to allow workers to treat air conditioning as a workplace amenity,
such that in the hedonic compensating differentials equilibrium, firms without air conditioning
must pay higher wages (Rosen 2002). In this case, the results from our simple model are
strengthened. More firms adopt air conditioning, adaptation to climate change is larger, and the
impacts of climate change on the macro-economy is more muted.
      The theoretical work is followed by an empirical analysis of the impacts of temperature on
the manufacturing sector within the US. Our focus on manufacturing is partly driven by
practical concerns about data availability, but also because this is the sector in which we expect
to see the most action in terms of AC adoption. It is a marginal sector in the US, where air
conditioning penetration is neither infeasible (e.g. agriculture and construction) or nearly
complete (e.g. office work). As predicted by theory, our industry-level regressions show
increased AC usage in response to greater temperature exposure and no aggregate impacts on
TFP within manufacturing.
      These manufacturing results are particularly interesting because manufacturing is an
increasing share of GDP in lower-middle income nations (see Figure 1 based on the World
Bank’s WDI data), where falling hardware prices and reliable electricity supplies are making AC
adoption increasingly feasible.2
      The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents our basic theoretical model along with
some extensions. Section III is focused on our empirical exercise. Concluding remarks are
made in Section IV.


II. The Firm’s Joint Air Conditioning and Labor Demand Decision


           In this section, we develop a model of the air conditioning investment decision in an
industry with heterogeneous firms and homogenous workers. In particular, we assume that firms
exogenously differ along one dimension, such that each firm has a productivity parameter called
θ whereby firms produce more output (holding inputs constant) if they are endowed with a
higher θ. Syverson (2011) documents the existence of firm heterogeneity even within narrowly
defined industries.



2
    See Davis and Gertler (2015) for evidence of residential AC adoption in LDCs.
         Given microeconomic evidence on the relationship between heat and labor productivity
(Heal and Park, 2013; Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014; Adharvyu et al., 2014), we assume that the
firm’s productivity is decreasing in cooling degree days, a measure of temperature utilized by
electric utilities to assess energy demands for air conditioning.3 In particular, we use a
transformed measure of heat (H) that lies between 0 and 1 to reflect the percentage reduction in
productivity. Thus, a firm with productivity parameter θ equal to .8 that faces heat H equal to
0.5 will have a productivity level of 0.4.
         For simplicity, we assume that air conditioning can completely eliminate the productivity
effect from heat. The costs of air conditioning include an upfront fixed cost in hardware,
denoted F, and variables costs due to energy consumption from running the equipment, denoted
E. The costs of energy are assumed to be convex in heat and independent of firm size such that
hiring additional workers does not mechanically change air conditioning expenditure.4


II.A. Air Conditioning as a Pure Investment


         Let subscript A denote firms that do not adopt air conditioning and thus operate a
workplace at ambient temperatures. Similarly, let C denote firms that operate cooled workplaces
as a result of air conditioning adoption. Profits for each can be expressed as follows:


                                                                                                                   (1)
                                                                             ,                                     (2)


where P denotes output prices,            denotes labor hired by firms without air conditioning,
denotes labor hired by firms with air conditioning, and               is less than 1 such that there is
                                                   5
decreasing marginal productivity of labor.


  Cooling degree days (CDD) is a measure of the number of degrees by which the average temperature in a given
3

day exceeded 65 degrees Fahrenheit. For example, a day with an average temperature of 80 degrees corresponds to
15 CDD and a day with an average temperature of 50 degrees corresponds to 0 CDD.
4 Note that scale independence is an assumption of convenience that can be readily relaxed but which complicates
interpretation since more firms will now need to consider the output gained from one additional worker against the
(potential) increased costs of air conditioning. In practice, the additional air conditioning costs for any worker on
the margin will be very small.
5 We recognize that an alternative way to introduce heat exposure is to model it as scaling down the effective
quantity of labor that the firm can use. We present the multiplicative structure because it simplifies the algebra. In
The first order condition for each type of firm are as follows:



                                                                                                                   (3)


                                                                                                                   (4)



where     denotes the optimal choice of labor for each type of firm. Firms hire labor such that the
marginal value product of labor is equal to the wage. Since wages are identical for either type of
firm (an assumption we will relax in the next section) and labor is more productive in cooled
firms, those firms that find it optimal to adopt AC will hire more labor. Indeed, combining
equations 1’ and 2’ reveal the following relationship between optimal labor hiring levels across
the two types of firms:

                                                                                                                   (5)


As mentioned in the introduction, our primary interest here is in industries in which air
conditioning penetration is neither technologically infeasible (e.g. agriculture and construction)
nor complete because the costs of adoption are quite low (e.g. office work). Rather, we focus on
industries such that some firms within the industry find it profitable to adopt air conditioning and
other firms do not. In such a setting, industry-level AC penetration can be determined by solving
for a cutoff firm who has a productivity value of             such that its optimized profits are equal
whether it installs air conditioning or not. Setting equation 1 equal to equation 2 (when
employment levels are defined by equations 1’ and 2’) and algebraic manipulation yields the
following cutoff , which we will denote               :




this model, we are holding the capital stock fixed (so we are solving for short run labor demand). Later in the paper,
we discuss how our comparative statics would be affected if both labor and capital can be adjusted once the outdoor
heat is known. If capital is less affected by the heat, then this will affect the optimal input mix.
                                                                                                    (6)



Any firm whose θ is greater than      will adopt air conditioning and any firm below it will not.
Note that     will decrease with respect to heat – more firms will adopt AC – if the variable cost
of AC increases at a slower rate than the productivity gains from cooling as temperature
increases. More formally, differentiating equation 6 with respect to H suggests that AC adoption
will increase in temperature if the following condition holds:


                                                                                                    (7)


This inequality will hold if and only if the expression in the numerator is negative. Algebraic
manipulation and multiplying both sides by H suggests that this condition can be re-expressed as
follows:



                                                                                                    (8)



The probability of AC adoption is increasing in heat if the elasticity of the changes in costs from
AC adoption with respect to H is smaller than the elasticity of the gains in revenue from AC
adoption with respect to H. This assumption, which we will maintain throughout the modeling
exercise, reflects the usual economic argument in the literature that more firms will engage in
adaptation strategies under climate change as the returns to adaptation increase. An important
distinction in our case is that it is the most productive firms that drive adaptation.
       Turning our attention to the macro-level, we can now express aggregate industry-level
output as the following:



                                                                                                    (9)
Equation (9) shows that aggregate output is a weighted average of output from firms with and
without AC, given their optimal labor choices. Since the most productive firms are the ones that
adopt AC and hire more workers per firm, the impact of heat on industry-level output will be
smaller than if air conditioning adoption was determined at random.
         More formally, we can express the impacts of climate change on industry-level output by
differentiating equation 7 with respect to H. This yields the following expression:



                                                                                                                (10)



         The first set of terms captures impacts on the intensive margin. Under climate change,
firms without air conditioning will produce less output. The second set of terms captures
impacts on the extensive margin. Climate change will induce some additional firms to adopt AC
under the assumptions about cost curves outlined above, and the cooled environment will
improve productivity within those firms.
         Thus, the aggregate impacts of climate change on output can be viewed as the sum of
impacts on three types of firms. Low productivity firms in the left tail of the distribution do not
adopt air conditioning and suffer under climate change. High productivity firms in the right tail
of the distribution are inframarginal since they always had air conditioning and are thus
unaffected by climate change.6 Marginal firms between the two extremes adopt air conditioning
as a result of climate change and are thus newly shielded from the impacts of heat. Depending
on the degree to which heat is detrimental to labor productivity and the magnitude of climate
change, these marginal firms may even experience a boost in productivity relative to their pre-
warming levels (although profits will clearly remain lower since they will now incur AC costs
that were previously suboptimal to incur).
         As in the model of macroeconomic shocks by Gabaix (2011), the ‘granular’ impacts
experienced by large firms exert a non-trivial influence on the aggregate. Only in this case, the
effect works in the opposite direction. Since highly productivity firms account for a



 Their output will remain unchanged in the heat but their profit will decline as they spend more on operating their
6

air conditioners.
disproportionate share of aggregate output, and those firms are insulated from the impacts of
heat, climate shocks will yield rather modest impacts in the aggregate.


II.B. Air Conditioning as an Investment in Worker Productivity and as an Amenity


       In this section, we modify our model to capture the fact that a worker’s utility is an
increasing function of her wage and her comfort on the job. We build on the compensating
differentials literature by simultaneously studying the productivity and amenity benefits of AC
adoption (Rosen 2002). In particular, we assume that workers prefer a climate-controlled work
environment for reasons that are distinct from how that heat affects their productivity. This
could arise, for example, if heat exposure during the workday diminishes the marginal utility of
leisure after work due to fatigue or because they generally dislike working under hot conditions.
If workers face zero mobility costs across jobs and have full information about each job’s
attributes, they will demand a wage premium for heat exposure on the job (Rosen 2002). Letting
X denote this ‘extra’ pay, we can now express profits for firms without AC as follows:


                                                                                                (11)


Profits for firms with AC remain unchanged from the earlier model. In this setting, the
difference in the sizes of labor forces between firm types will be even larger since labor is more
productive and less expensive in climate-controlled firms. Combining the first order conditions
from equations 2 and equations 9, and algebraic manipulation reveals the following:



                                                                                                (12)



Optimal labor choices are now denoted by a tilde to distinguish from those chosen optimally
when AC was a pure investment good.
As before, the threshold firm skill level theta can be determined by equating optimized profits
with and without AC. Let this cutoff level of     be denoted by      . The value of      is equal to the
following:



                                                                                                   (13)



It is clear by inspection that   as defined in equation 11 is smaller than the      defined in
equation 6. Intuitively, when workers require combat pay to face the heat, more firms find it
worthwhile to adopt AC. Moreover, if the elasticity conditions described by equation 8 hold,
simple inspection reveals that AC adoption will also be increasing in temperature when AC is a

workplace amenity and that it will increase at a faster rate (i.e.               ) for any given level

of initial heat   .


Industry-level output remains a population weighted average of output for firms with and
without AC as can be seen here:



                                                                                                   (14)



Two key differences are noteworthy. First, as mentioned above, more firms will install and
operate AC so that the set of firms that can be affected by climate change is smaller. Second,
firms that continue to operate without AC will hire less labor and produce less output than they
did when heat-exposure on the job was not treated as a workplace amenity since labor is now
more expensive.
        Of particular interest here, is how industry output changes under climate change.
Differentiating equation 14 with respect to heat H yields the following expression:
                                                                                                                 (15)




Recalling that       is smaller than      ,     is smaller than      , and                  , it is clear that, for

any initial level of heat       , the impacts of climate change on aggregate output will be smaller in
a world where AC is treated as both an investment and an amenity valued by workers relative to
one in which it is a pure investment good.


II.C. A Discussion of Labor Market Extensions


         The model developed in Sections II.A and II.B illustrate the importance of heat on the
marginal value product of labor and wages in determining optimal AC adoption. In this section,
we briefly discuss several extensions to our simple characterization of labor in this setting and
their implications for AC adoption and adaptation to climate change.
         While our model assumed well-functioning labor markets, real-world labor market
imperfections will influence the tradeoff between wages and air conditioning in equilibrium.
Two such imperfections seem particularly important in this context. First, the tax treatment
between financial compensation and the air conditioning amenity are uneven, with the latter
receiving much more favorable tax treatment under the current law. This will clearly skew firms
toward more AC adoption when workers treat climate control as a workplace amenity and further
insulate firms from the negative impacts of climate change. On the other hand, minimum wage
laws, which establish a floor on the financial portion of the wage, will discourage AC adoption
for firms where the marginal productivity of labor is most likely to fall below the mandated
minimum wage.7 Since these firms cannot pay workers a lower financial wage as a result of


7
  Consider the case of Amazon’s warehouse in Allentown, Pennsylvania during the summer of 2011. Despite the
summer weather, there was no air-conditioning in the depot, and Amazon refused to let fresh air circulate
by opening loading doors at either end of the depot—for fear of theft. Inside the plant there was no slackening of the
pace, even as temperatures rose to more than 100 degrees. On June 2, 2011, a warehouse employee contacted the US
Occupational Safety and Health Administration to report that the heat index had reached 102 degrees in the
warehouse and that fifteen workers had collapsed. On July 25, with temperatures in the depot reaching 110
degrees, a security guard reported to OSHA that Amazon was refusing to open garage doors to help air circulate and
that he had seen two pregnant women taken to a nursing station. Calls to the local ambulance service became so
frequent that for five hot days in June and July, ambulances and paramedics were stationed all day at the
improved work conditions under AC, they are less likely to adopt it. As we have already shown,
low productivity firms are already less likely to adopt AC, so the degree to which the minimum
wage further discourages adaptation will depend upon how far up the firm skill ladder it binds.
        Adding capital to the firm’s production function offers the potential of some additional
insights. If the productivity of capital is less sensitive to extreme heat than the productivity of
labor, then labor-intensive firms will be more likely to adopt air conditioning. In industries
where air conditioning is costly and labor and capital are reasonable substitutes for one another,
we might also see firms becoming more capital-intensive under climate change. Whether firms
shift to capital or adopt AC to insulate their workers from extreme heat, the long run impacts of
climate change on output will again be smaller than short-run estimates might suggest.
        Lastly, a natural extension to the model we developed earlier is to introduce
heterogeneity in the skills of workers. In this case, the most skilled workers will match to most
skilled firms since this is where their marginal product is highest, and all of our earlier results
will be magnified. High skill firms will account for an even greater proportion of industry output
and since they are precisely the firms most incentivized to adopt AC, a greater share of industry
input will be insulated from effects from climate change. It is also interesting to note that since
AC is a skill biased amenity, it will increases inequality across workers by keeping down the
productivity of those with the least skill (and also provide them with more hostile work
environments).




III. Data and Empirics


        Our empirical results will primarily focus on manufacturing data from the United States.
Manufacturing is a particularly interesting setting since the nature of production facilities and
what they imply about the costs of AC adoption means that AC penetration is neither zero nor


depot. Commenting on these developments, Vickie Mortimer, general manager of the warehouse, insisted that “the
safety and welfare of our employees is our number-one priority at Amazon, and as general manager I take that
responsibility seriously.” To this end, “Amazon brought 2,000 cooling bandannas which were given to every
employee, and those in the dock/trailer yard received cooling vests.”

complete. On more pragmatic grounds, it is also one of the few sectors with a long time-series of
rich productivity data. In particular, the NBER Productivity Database provides sectoral annual
measures of total factor productivity by 473 6-digit NAICS industry from 1959 to 2009 (see
Becker et. al. 2013). These data also report for each industry in each year its real output, labor,
capital and energy consumption, and a measure of the share of its workers who are not
production workers. Klenow (2005) finds that the share of workers in an industry who are non-
production workers proxies for the industry’s human capital level.
         The NBER data set provides no information on the heat exposure for each industry in
each year. To create such heat exposure measures by six digit NAICS industry by year, we
combine data from the County Business Patterns (CBP) with state/year data on the count of
cooling degree days.8 The CBP data are available by state/NAICS/year from 1998 to 2012. For
each industry, we construct the share of that industry’s employment located in each state in each
year.9
         Our climate data source is NOAA. NOAA provides monthly total cooling degree days
(on a 65 degree basis) for each month in each year by state from 1895 to the present (see
ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/climdiv/). We use these data to measure each state’s
cooling degree days in each year from 1998 to 2009.10
         Define industry l in state j at time t, we seek to calculate the average cooling degree days
that this industry is exposed to in a given year.



                                                                                                           (16)

  Cooling degree days (CDD) are a measure of temperature designed to assess energy demands for air condition.
CDD equals the number of degrees by which the average temperature in a given day exceeded 65 degrees
Fahrenheit. For example, a day with an average temperature of 80 degrees corresponds to 15 CDD and a day with
an average temperature of 50 degrees corresponds to 0 CDD.

  Due to top coding, we use the categorical variables and use the midpoints of employment in each category. For
firms with over 1000 people, we assume they have 1400 people. We have experimented with this assumption. A
second issue that arises with the CBP data is that the industries are defined by SIC codes over the years 1986 to
1997 and by NAICS codes from 1998 to 2009.

CDD equals the number of degrees by which the average temperature in a given day exceeded 65 degrees
Fahrenheit. For example, a day with an average temperature of 80 degrees corresponds to 15 CDD and a day with
an average temperature of 50 degrees corresponds to 0 CDD.
In this equation, cooling degree days stands for state j’s time t count of cooling degree days. As
shown in the equation, we weight this using the CBP data on the share of the industry l’s jobs in
state j in the year t. The share variable sums to one for each industry l in year t and the share is
based on employment defined as;




This cooling degree exposure represents the count of cooling degree days that the average
worker was exposed to in that industry/year. We recognize that within state variation in summer
temperature introduces measurement error but given the high degree of within state spatial
correlation in climatic conditions this suggest that the measurement error concern is limited to
larger states such as Texas and California. In results available on request, we reproduce our
core results based on analysis that excludes these large states and our results are qualitatively
unchanged.
       Table One uses equation (16) to calculate the employment-weighted exposure to cooling
degree days by industry over the years 1998 to 2009. Recall that an industry’s climate exposure
is a function of where it clusters and the count of cooling degree days in that area. Profit
maximizing firms will calculate their indirect profit function in each location and choose the
location that maximizes their profits (see Carlton 1983, Kahn and Mansur 2013). While
industries cluster in specific locations, we will document below they are spread across the United
States and this creates some spatial diversification against heat shocks.
       We report the weighted mean for the entire year and for the summer months. In the right
columns of Table Two, we report the empirical distribution. For example consider the 25th
percentile for NAICS 313. It equals 984. This means that 75% of workers in NAICS 313 were
exposed to more than 984 cooling degree days on average per year. The right tail at the 90th
percentile suggests that all industries experience significant amounts of heat (and thus have latent
demand for AC) in the extremes.
       Since cooling degree exposure could be high for a given industry because it tends to
cluster in hot places (such as the South) or because the location it located in suffered a severe
heat wave in that year, it is informative to look at the distribution of industries over space. Table
Two takes the County Business Patterns and reports the concentration of employment in the five
states with the largest share of the industry. These five states differ depending on the industry;
very few industries are highly clustered in a single state. NAICS 315 is the only industry with a
greater than 20% concentration in any one state. Table Two highlights that U.S manufacturing is
spatially diversified against spatial climate shocks. Manufacturing takes place across many
states. While heat shocks are likely to be spatially correlated, this spatial variation offers a
source of diversification that merits future research.
       In Table Three, we compare the empirical distribution of cooling degree exposure (based
on equation 18) for the entire U.S population (in the years 1980, 1990 and 2000 and for the
distribution of manufacturing employment in 1998 and 2012). Firms tend to locate in hotter
places than the general population, perhaps reflecting limited industrial activity in the upper
latitudes within the US. In hotter environments, the exposure of firms and the general population
looks rather similar.


III.A. The Empirical Framework


       We seek to test whether U.S manufacturing industries’ aggregate TFP has been affected
by the heat during the time period 1998 to 2009. The unit of analysis is a 6 digit NAICS/year.


                                                                                                   (17)


In estimating equation (17), we will report results using several different dependent variables and
one of them will be the log of a given industry’s TFP in a given year. As shown in equation (17),
we include 3 digit industry fixed effects and year dummies. For several outcome indicators, we
seek to test whether    is negative and statistically significant. Our other dependent variables
include, the                                                          , the log(energy per worker),
the log(energy per unit of capital) and the log of the capital to labor ratio. The standard errors are
clustered by six digit NAICS.
       Table Four presents the main results. We report eight estimates of equation (17).
Cooling degree days has a mean of 1,176 and a standard deviation of 284. In column (1), we
find that a standard deviation increase in CDD would increase energy consumption per unit of
output by 5.9% and would increase energy consumption per worker by 12.5%. Column (5)
presents the TFP regression. We fail to reject the hypothesis that heat is unassociated with
industry TFP. In column (7) we find that heat is associated with substituting from labor to
capital.
           We recognize that there could be a non-linear relationship between heat exposure and
these outcomes. In columns (2,4,6,8) we report these same regressions where we replace cooling
degree days and instead spline it with one knot at the median of the empirical CDD distribution
for the industry/year sample (CDD=1,148). The results are interesting and intuitive. Below the
median, greater heat reduces energy per unit of output and energy per worker (perhaps because
less natural gas is used). Above the median, increases in CDD are associated with greater
energy consumption per unit of output and greater energy consumption per worker. As shown in
column (6) industry TFP is not negatively affected by heat above the median.
           In Table Five, we further explore the nonlinear relationship between heat and industry
outcomes by introducing a four knot spline (at the CDD distribution 0-25th, 25th-50th, 50-75th,
75th). Interestingly, energy consumption per worker is most positive for the highest knot, and
TFP is not negatively affected by this heat.
           These industry-macro results support the hypothesis that U.S manufacturing has made
investments to insulate itself from heat damage.




III.C. Testing for Heterogeneous Cross-Industry Effects


           In this section, we report augmented estimates of equation (17) in which we interact
cooling degree days with industry level attributes. Table Six reports data from one novel data
source.11 We use data from the Manufacturing Consumption Survey for the years 1998, 2002
and 2010 to calculate for 3 digit NAICS industries the percentage of electricity consumed for air
conditioning and the quantity of total kilowatts of electricity consumed for air conditioning per
worker. The EIA’s Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey was conducted in 1998, 2002,
2006 and 2010.12        The table highlights that industries such as Petroleum use much more
electricity for air conditioning than industries such as plastics.

     http://www.eia.gov/consumption/manufacturing/data/2010/
         In Table Seven, we report estimates of equation (17) where we include three interaction
terms. We allow industries to differ along three dimensions. First, we examine the role of
establishment size. Using the 1998, we calculate average employees per plant using the national
sample. If air conditioning is a local public good and costs are decreasing in scale, we would
expect larger firms to have AC and thus temperature to have less of an effect on firm
productivity. Our second industry attribute is the human capital measure (the % of workers who
are not production workers). Firms that employ more human capital should be more likely to
adopt AC to ensure labor productivity stays close to its frontier. Our third measure is the
variable reported in Table Six’s 4th column (the 1998 3 digit NAICS electricity consumption on
air conditioning per worker).
         The results reported in Table Seven indicate that industries with more human capital are
not less sensitive to the heat. We do find that industries with larger firms are more likely to adopt
air conditioning. One intuitive finding is that industries with a higher baseline air conditioning
per worker increase energy consumption per worker when it is hotter outside. Again, we find
that industry TFP is not associated with outdoor heat.


IV. Conclusion


         In an urbanized economy, our ability to adapt to the challenge of climate change hinges
on its impact on worker productivity. An active research agenda seeks to estimate how the
demand for residential air conditioning will be affected by climate change (see Auffhammer
2011 and Auffhammer and Aroonruengsawat 2014). The micro economics of firm air
conditioning adoption has been a neglected topic. If climate change disrupts work schedules
and lowers productivity for workers, then per-capita income will grow at a slower rate and
consumers will have less disposable income to purchase products to help them offset challenges
posed by hotter temperatures and greater weather variability.
         In this paper, we have presented a model of AC adoption by heterogeneous firms hiring
homogenous workers.13 The complementarity embedded in the production function means that




  Future research should introduce heterogeneous workers. Such a model could study what are the implications for
13

both income and quality of life inequality from increased heat caused by climate change. If the lowest skill workers
more productive firms have a higher marginal product of labor. If heat exposure diminishes
worker productivity, the most productive firms will be the ones most likely to adopt air
conditioning and thus the most sheltered from climate shocks. When workers require combat
pay for extreme heat on the job, firms further down the productivity ladder will also adopt air
conditioning, and a greater fraction of the economy will be insulated from the impacts of climate
change.
        The key insight from these models is that the decision to adopt AC is not independent of
other fundamental parameters that shape firm-level productivity. Since more productive firms
are more likely to adopt AC, aggregate industry-level output is less exposed to climate shocks
than any randomly selected firm within the industry. A proper accounting of the impacts of
climate change on macroeconomic output requires additional information on the distribution of
firm types within and across industries.
        Our empirical estimates from the US manufacturing sector are consistent with our model
predictions. Hotter temperatures lead to more AC usage and no discernible impact on aggregate
TFP. It is worth noting, however, that data limitations preclude our ability to test the more subtle
predictions of our models. With suitable micro-level data, one could estimate quantile
regressions to test whether the heat-output gradient does indeed vary monotonically as a function
of the firm’s productivity level.




work for the low productivity firms and earn low wages and are not air conditioned, then climate change will
increase over inequality in well being to increase.
