Inference of Bidders’ Risk Attitudes in Ascending Auctions with Endogenous Entry

                                               ABSTRACT

Bidders' risk attitudes have key implications for choices of revenue-maximizing auction formats. In
ascending auctions, bid distributions do not provide information about risk preference. We infer risk
attitudes using distributions of transaction prices and participation decisions in ascending auctions
with entry costs. Nonparametric tests are proposed for two distinct scenarios: first, the expected entry
cost can be consistently estimated from data; second, the data does not report entry costs but contains
exogenous variations of potential competition and auction characteristics. In the first scenario, we
exploit the fact that the risk premium required for entry – the difference between ex ante expected
profits from entry and the certainty equivalent – is strictly positive if and only if bidders are risk averse.
Our test is based on identification of bidders' ex ante profits. In the second scenario, our test builds
on the fact that risk attitudes affect how equilibrium entry probabilities vary with observed auction
characteristics and potential competition. We also show identification of risk attitudes in a more general
model of ascending auctions with selective entry, where bidders receive entry-stage signals that are
correlated with private values.

1       Introduction
    We propose nonparametric tests to infer bidders’ risk attitudes in ascending (or open
out-cry) auctions with endogenous entry. In these auctions, potential bidders observe some
entry costs, e.g., bid preparation/submission costs and/or information acquisition costs, that
they need to incur before learning private values, and decide whether to pay the costs to be
active in the bidding stage. In any Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE), bidders make rational
entry decisions by comparing expected utility from entry with that from staying out, based
on their knowledge of entry costs or preliminary signals of private values to be realized in
the subsequent bidding stage.
    Inference of bidders’ risk attitudes have important implications for sellers’ choices of
revenue-maximizing auction format. When participation of bidders is exogenously given
and …xed, the Revenue Equivalence Theorem states that expected revenues from …rst-price
and ascending auctions are the same if bidders are risk-neutral in symmetric independent
private values (IPV) environments. If bidders are risk-averse, however, Matthews (1987)
showed that in such environments …rst-price auctions yield higher expected revenues than
ascending auctions. Bidders’ risk attitudes also a¤ect revenue rankings among symmetric
IPV auctions when participation decisions are endogenous. For risk-neutral bidders, Levin
and Smith (1994) showed that any given entry cost induces the same entry probabilities in
…rst-price auctions (with entrants observing the number of other entrants) and in ascending
auctions. Thus the Revenue Equivalence Theorem implies expected revenues must be the
same from both …rst-price and ascending formats under endogenous entry. On the other
hand, Smith and Levin (1996) established the revenue ranking of …rst-price over ascending
auctions under endogenous entry for risk-averse bidders, except for the case with decreasing
absolute risk aversions (DARA).1
    While some earlier papers had studied the identi…cation and estimation of bidders’risk
attitudes in …rst-price auctions (e.g. Bajari and Hortascu (2005), Campo, Guerre, Perrigne
and Vuong (2011) and Guerre, Perrigne and Vuong (2009)), inference of risk attitudes in
ascending auctions remains an open question. Athey and Haile (2007) pointed out that
bidders’ risk attitudes cannot be identi…ed from bids alone in ascending auctions where
participation is given exogenously. This is because bidding one’s true value is a weakly
dominant strategy in ascending auctions, regardless of bidders’risk attitudes. Thus, bidders

    1
     Even in the case with DARA, …rst-price auctions yield higher expected revenues than ascending auctions
when entry costs are low enough. To see this, consider a simple case where entry costs are low enough so
that the di¤erence between entry probabilities in …rst-price and ascending auctions are su¢ ciently small. In
such a case, these two probabilities are both close to 1 and only di¤er by some small " > 0. By Matthews
(1987), conditioning on any given number of entrants, ascending auctions have smaller expected revenues
than …rst-price auctions. With di¤erence between the two entry probabilities " small enough, such a revenue
ranking result will be preserved.

with various risk attitudes could generate the same distribution of bids in Bayesian Nash
equilibria. The distribution of bids from entrants alone is therefore not su¢ cient for inferring
bidders’risk attitudes.
    In this paper, we propose tests for bidders’ risk-attitudes based on transaction prices
and entry decisions under two empirically relevant data scenarios. In the …rst scenario, we
assume that the data has information that allows researchers to consistently estimate the
expectation of entry costs; and in the second scenario, we assume that the data does not
provide any information about the level of entry costs, but does contain variations in the
number of potential bidders and some auction-level heterogeneities. In both cases, we show
how to relate the distribution of transaction prices and entry decisions to the underlying risk
attitudes nonparametrically.
    In the …rst scenario, considered in Section 4, we require that the data contains some noisy
measures of entry costs so that the mean of entry costs in the data-generating process can be
consistently estimated. This is motivated by the fact that entry costs are often measurable
(at least up to some noises) in applications. Examples of entry costs include bid preparation
costs (e.g., mailing costs), admission fees or other information acquisition expenses, which
are often reported in data with noises.
    The main insight for our test in this scenario can be illustrated using the mixed-strategy
entry model (which is analogous to that considered in Levin and Smith (1994) for …rst-price
auctions). In the entry stage, all potential bidders observe some common entry cost and
decide whether to pay the cost and enter an ascending auction in the bidding stage. In a
Bayesian Nash equilibrium, potential bidders’participation in the auction will be in mixed
strategies with the mixing probability determined to ensure that a bidder’s expected utility
from entry equals that from staying out. Hence bidders’ risk attitudes can be identi…ed
by comparing the expected pro…ts from entry and its certainty equivalent. As long as the
expectation of entry costs can be identi…ed from data, the distribution of transaction prices
and entry decisions alone can be used to make such a comparison.
    We apply the analog principle to construct a non-parametric test statistic, using data
on transaction prices and entry decisions as well as estimates of the mean of entry costs.
We characterize the limiting distribution of this statistic, and propose a bootstrap test that
attains correct asymptotic level and is consistent under any …xed alternative of risk-aversion
or risk-loving. We provide evidence for its …nite sample performance through Monte Carlo
simulations.
    In the second scenario, considered in Section 5, we assume that the data does not provide
information about the level of entry costs, but does contain some auction-level heterogeneities
(such as feature of the auctioned object) and variations in the numbers of potential bidders.
We propose a nonparametric test for risk-aversion for this case, under the assumption that
variations in potential competition are exogenous (in the sense that it does not alter the


                                               2
marginal distribution of private values once conditional on the observed auction features).
Refraining from parametric restrictions on how observed auction features change the dis-
tribution of private values, we formalize how risk attitudes determine entry probabilities
under various auction features and potential competition. Our test is based on the idea
that the curvature of utility functions a¤ects how the ratios between the changes in bidders’
interim utilities compare with the ratios between the changes in expected private values,
under di¤erent pairs of observed auction features. The main …nding is that, even if entry
costs are unreported in data, we could relate these two ratios to the observed distributions
of transaction prices and entry decisions, by exploiting the variations in auction features and
potential number of entrants.
    In Section 6, we discuss possible extensions of our tests by removing two of the key
assumptions. First, we show that when bidders’values are a¢ liated, it is possible to derive
testable implications for risk attitudes using existing results on sharp bounds for the surplus
of risk-neutral bidders in ascending auctions (Aradillas-Lopez, Gandhi and Quint (2012)).
Second, we show that if entry becomes selective (e.g., due to the presence of preliminary
signals correlated with private values to be drawn in the bidding stage), then the idea
of testing risk attitudes through identi…cation of risk-premium applies, provided the data
contains continuous variations in observed entry costs.
    It is worth noting that by “inference of risk attitudes”we mean to make a data-supported
conclusion about whether bidders’utility functions are concave, linear or convex. We do not
deal with the recovery of the full utility functions per se, which is a question left for future
research.
    The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the related
literature; in Section 3 we present the model of ascending auction with endogenous entry; in
Sections 4 and 5 we describe the theoretical results for our tests under two data scenarios,
and discuss inference using proposed test statistics; in Section 6 we discuss how to extend
our test to auctions with selective entry or a¢ liated private values; and in Section 7 we
conclude. Proofs are collected in the appendices.


2    Related Literature
    This paper contributes to two branches of the literature on structural analyses of auction
data. The …rst branch includes papers that analyze the equilibrium and its empirical impli-
cations in auctions with endogenous entry and risk-neutral bidders. These include Levin and
Smith (1994), Li (2005), Ye (2007) and Li and Zheng (2009). Marmer, Shneyerov and Xu
(2011) studies a model of …rst-price auctions with risk-neutral bidders and selective entry,
and discusses testable implications of various nested entry models. Roberts and Sweeting
(2010) estimates a model of ascending auctions with selective entry and risk-neutral bid-

ders. Gentry and Li (2013) provides partial identi…cation results for ascending auctions with
risk-neutral bidders when entry is selective (as potential bidders observe preliminary signals
that are a¢ liated with their private values). They derive sharp bounds on the distribution
of private values conditional on signals, using variations in factors that a¤ect bidders’entry
behaviors (such as the number of potential bidders and entry costs). They also apply these
results to bound counterfactual seller revenues under alternative auction rules. Aradillas-
Lopez, Gandhi and Quint (2012) provides partial identi…cation results for ascending auctions
where bidders’private values are a¢ liated, exploiting exogenous variations in the number of
entrants, or active bidders.
    The second branch includes papers that study the identi…cation and estimation of bid-
ders’utility functions and the distribution of private values in …rst-price auctions without
endogenous entry. Campo, Guerre, Perrigne and Vuong (2011) shows how to estimate a
semiparametric model of …rst-price auctions with risk-averse bidders when the identi…cation
of a parametric utility function is assumed. Bajari and Hortascu (2005) uses exogenous vari-
ations in the number of bidders in …rst-price auctions to semi-parametrically estimate the
utility function while leaving the distribution of bidders’private values unrestricted. Guerre,
Perrigne and Vuong (2009) uses exogenous variations in the number of potential bidders to
non-parametrically identify bidders’utility functions along with the distribution of private
values in …rst-price auctions. Lu and Perrigne (2008) considers a context where data contain
bids from both …rst-price and ascending auctions that involve bidders with the same utility
function and the same distribution of private values. They …rst use bids from ascending auc-
tions to recover the distribution of private values, and then use bids from …rst-price auctions
to recover the utility function.
    Our work in this paper contributes to these two branches of empirical auction literature by
studying a model which endogenizes bidders’entry decisions and relaxes the risk-neutrality
assumption at the same time. To the best of our knowledge, our paper marks the …rst e¤ort
to non-parametrically infer bidders’ risk attitudes in ascending auctions with endogenous
entry. Smith and Levin (1996) presents some results on the revenue ranking of auction
formats in terms of seller revenues when auctions are known to involve risk-averse bidders
who make endogenous entry decisions. Their focus is not on the identi…cation of bidders’
risk attitudes.
    Ackerberg, Hirano and Shahriar (2011) studies a class of e-Bay auctions where a typical
online ascending auction is combined with an option of paying the buy-out price posted
by the seller in order to immediately purchase the object. They show how to identify the
bidders’utility functions and the distribution of private values using exogenous variations in
the buy-out prices and other auction characteristics. The format of auctions they consider is
qualitatively di¤erent from the one we consider in this paper, which is a standard ascending
format with endogenous entry. We do not embark on a full identi…cation of the utility


                                              4
function in this paper, and therefore require fewer sources of exogenous variations to perform
the test. (With observed and exogenous variations in entry costs, identi…cation of the utility
function may be possible in our model as well.) Our approach does not rely on variations in
entry costs, thus our test can be performed for any given level of entry costs. Moreover, we
go beyond identi…cation and propose a method of robust inference.
    Our paper also …ts in a category of empirical auction literature on nonparametric tests
of the empirical implications/predictions of auction theory. Earlier works in this category
include tests of bidders’rationality in …rst-price auctions with common values in Hendricks,
Pinkse and Porter (2003), assessment of winner’s curse in …rst-price auctions with common
values in Hong and Shum (2002), tests for presence of interdependent values in Haile, Hong
and Shum (2004), and test for a¢ liations between bidders’private values in Li and Zhang
(2010) and Jun, Pinkse and Wan (2010).2 The test proposed by Li and Zhang (2010) uses
bidders’entry decisions for testing a¢ liations between bidders’private values.
    Li, Lu and Zhao (2012) studies …rst-price and ascending auctions with risk-averse bidders
and selective entry (due to bidders’observation of preliminary signals that are a¢ liated with
private values in the bidding stage). They …nd the ranking between bidders’expected utility
under these two auction formats depend on the speci…c form of risk-aversion (DARA, CARA
or IARA). Consequently, the ranking of entry probabilities across these two auction formats
must also depend on the form of risk-aversions. Based on these observations, they propose
an original test for inferring the form of bidders’risk-aversions using entry behaviors, using
data from both …rst-price and ascending auctions at the same time. Our research focus in
this paper di¤ers from theirs in that we study the inference of risk attitudes (with hypotheses
being risk-neutral, risk-taking or risk-aversion). Since we do not aim at inferring the form of
risk-aversion, our test does not require observation of data from competing auction formats.


3        Ascending Auctions with Endogenous Entry
   Consider an empirical context where researchers observe data from a large number of in-
dependent single-unit ascending auctions. Each of these auctions involve N potential bidders
who have symmetric independent private values and make endogenous entry decisions. The
entry model we consider here is similar to those used for …rst-price auctions with risk-neutral
bidders in Levin and Smith (1994), Li and Zheng (2009) and Marmer, Shneyerov and Xu
(2011). In the entry stage, each potential bidder decides whether to incur an entry cost K to
become active in the bidding stage. The entry cost is common knowledge among all potential
bidders. There is a binding reserve price r in the auction and it is observed by all potential
bidders in the entry stage. Following their entry, each entrant i draws a private value Vi , and
competes in ascending auctions in the bidding stage. Across auctions, private values and

entry costs are independent draws from distributions FV1 ;:;VN jK and FK respectively, which
are common knowledge among all potential bidders prior to entry decisions. Upon entry,
each entrant may or may not be aware of the total number of entrants (which we denote
by A). All bidders in the data share the same bounded von Neumann-Morgenstein utility
function u : R+ ! R with u0 > 0 and the sign of u00 does not change over R+ . A winner who
has a private value Vi and pays a price Pi receives a utility of u(Vi Pi K).
    With a slight abuse of notation, we use N and A to denote the number as well as the
set of potential bidders and entrants respectively. Let F 1 ; 2 , F 2 j 1 denote respectively the
joint and conditional distributions of generic random vectors ( 1 ; 2 ). We use upper cases to
denote random variables and lower cases to denote their realizations. We take N as given
and …xed in this section and, to simplify exposition, we drop N in notations when there is
no ambiguity.

Assumption 1 Given K, private values Vi are i.i.d. draws from the same continuous dis-
tribution FV jK that has positive densities almost everywhere on the support [v; v]. Entry costs
across auctions are i.i.d. draws from the same distribution FK with support [k; k].

    This assumption states that bidders have symmetric, independent private values in the
                                               Q
sense that Pr(V1     v1 ; :; VN  vN jK = k) = i2N FV jk (vi ) for all k and (v1 ; :; vN ). Each
entrant i in a bidding stage follows the weakly dominant equilibrium strategy to drop out
at his true value Vi if A 2. When A = 1 in the bidding stage, the lone entrant wins and
pays the reserve price r.
    Let A i denote the set (and the number) of entrants that i competes with if he enters.

with FPi ( jk; i ) being the distribution of Pi when K = k, and i’s potential competitors
enter with probabilities   i . Due to symmetry in private value distributions across bidders,

FPi (:jk; i ) does not change with the bidder identity i, and therefore ! does not depend
on the bidder identity i. The following lemma characterizes the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium
(BNE) in the entry stage:

Lemma 1 Suppose Assumption 1 holds. For any entry cost k with !(k; (1; :; 1)) < u(0) <
!(k; (0; :; 0)), there exists a unique symmetric BNE in which all bidders enter with probability
 k , where k solves !(k; ( k ; :; k )) = u(0).


    Whenever !(k; (0; :; 0)) u(0) (respectively, !(k; (1; :; 1)) u(0)), the equilibrium entry
probabilities are degenerate at 0 (respectively, 1). Thus the condition that !(k; (1; :; 1)) <
u(0) < !(k; (0; :; 0)) can be tested, as long as entry decisions are reported in data. The
equilibrium entry process is non-selective, as potential bidders’entry decisions are not based
on any information correlated with private values to be drawn in the bidding stage.
    It is worth noting that we can generalize the model to incorporate auction heterogeneities
Z that are known to all potential bidders and reported in data. To do this, we need to
condition private value distributions on Z as well. The characterization of entry and bidding
strategies in equilibrium can be derived using arguments similar to Lemma 1, for any given
z. In fact, auction heterogeneities reported in data provide additional identifying power for
inferring bidders’risk attitudes when entry costs are not reported in data. (See Section 5.)
    We assume researchers know the number of potential bidders in auctions. This means
either the data reports the number of potential bidders directly, or researchers can construct
a measure of N from the data based on institutional details in the speci…c environments.
Such an assumption holds in a variety of applications considered in the literature. For
example, Li and Zheng (2009) considers highway mowing auctions by Texas Department of
Transportation. In that case, the number of potential bidders for each auction is reported
as the observed number of contractors who have requested the o¢ cial bidding proposal
for the project. Similarly, in Krasnokutskaya and Seim (2011), potential bidders in highway
procurement auctions in California are de…ned as companies that have purchased the detailed
project plan from California Department of Transportation. Such purchases are recorded for
all projects in data. Athey, Levin and Seira (2011) studies US Forest Service (USFS) timber
auctions. They measure the number of loggers potentially interested in an auction by the
number of logging companies that had entered auctions in the same geographic area in the
prior year. Such a proxy is constructed by combining data from timber auctions with the
US Census data.


4    Inference of Risk Attitudes Using Entry Costs
    We now introduce a test for bidders’ risk attitudes when the data allows researchers
to construct a consistent estimator for the expectation of entry costs in the data-generating

                                               7
process. In some contexts, a …xed amount of entry costs, sometimes also known as admission
fees, is charged to all entrants and recorded in data. Such admission fees occur in contexts
such as: auctions of used or new cars in the U.S. and U.K.; auctions of vintage wines in the
U.S.; and auctions of art items, etc. In other applications, entry costs are not admission fees
but nevertheless are measurable, at least up to random noises through additional surveys.3
That said, it is also likely that these noisy measures may systematically underestimate true
costs, and taking the average of these noisy measures would lead to a biased estimator for
the actual mean. Thus the test based on the sign of risk-premia would be biased towards the
direction of risk-averse alternatives. We provide some simulation exercises about the impact
of such bias in Section 4.4 below.
    In addition to its empirical relevance, there is also a theoretical motivation for this as-
sumption: without variations in potential competition or information about entry costs,
bidders’risk attitudes can not be inferred from entry decisions and transaction prices alone
without imposing additional parametric assumptions on the structure. To …x ideas, consider
a simpli…ed model where all auctions in data share the same …xed entry cost k that is not
reported in data. The private value distribution is identi…ed from the distributions of trans-
action prices and the number of entrants using standard arguments using order statistics;
and the equilibrium entry probability is directly recovered from entry decisions. Nonetheless,
u ( ) and the unknown entry cost k cannot be jointly identi…ed in this case.
    To see this, suppose bidders are risk-neutral with a continuous utility function u ( ), entry
cost k, and entry probability       2 (0; 1). Fix a continuous private value distribution and let
it be independent from entry costs. Now consider a slightly concave utility u~ ( ) 6= u ( ) so
that E[~  u ((Vi Pi )+ k) j ] > u~(0). Because the left-hand side is continuous and strictly
monotone in k, we can increase k to k~ > k so that the indi¤erence condition is restored
for (~        ~ 6= (u ( ) ; k). That is, the equilibrium entry probability observed, , can be
      u ( ) ; k)
rationalized by more than one data-degenerating processes. Thus, without variations in
potential competition or auction heterogeneity, inference of risk attitudes from in English
auctions with endogenous entry must utilize at least some partial knowledge of entry costs.
    3
      For example, in USFS timber auctions considered in Athey, Levin and Seira (2011), entry costs for
potential bidders (i.e., millers and loggers located in nearby geographic region) consist largely of information
acquisition costs. These costs are incurred while performing “cruises”over the auctioned tracts to learn the
distribution of diameters and heights of trees, etc. Such private cruises are standard practices institutionalized
in the industry, and their costs vary little across millers and loggers. Thus cruise costs can be treated
as practically identical for all potential bidders. Besides, it is plausible that researchers can construct a
consistent estimator of average costs for cruising tracts with given characteristics, because cruise costs are
likely to be measured up to random errors through additional …eld work of data collection (such as surveys or
industry interviews). As cruise costs are orthogonal to bidders’private values (or realized pro…tability) upon
entry, one could reasonably expect there to be no incentive to systematically under- or over-state cruise costs
in surveys. In this case, survey data, if collected, could well be expected to provide a consistent estimator
for expected entry costs.

    All in all, we acknowledge that the assumption of observable entry costs used in the
current section is strong. In addition to empirical and theoretical motivations above, we also
hope to motivate the test under such an assumption as a useful benchmark that shows how
entry behaviors can be informative about bidders’ risk premia, which in turn is useful for
inferring their risk attitudes.


4.1    Identifying Bidders’Risk Attitudes
    Assume that the number of potential bidders is …xed and known to researchers. Our
test for risk attitudes in this subsection builds on the simple intuition that the certainty
equivalent for risk-averse bidders is strictly less than ex ante expected pro…ts from entry.
To …x ideas, we …rst show the di¤erence between these two quantities can be recovered from
observed distributions of entry decisions and transaction prices when entry costs are …xed
and reported in data. Later in this subsection, we show how to extend this approach under a
more practical scenario where data does not report perfectly the realizations of entry costs,
but allows researchers to construct a consistent estimator for its mean.
    First, we show that bidders’ex ante expected pro…ts are identi…ed. Let k denote entry
probabilities in the symmetric BNE when the common entry cost is k. Let (k) denote the
ex ante pro…t for a bidder i if he enters, conditional on entry cost k and that each of his
potential competitors enters with probability k . That is, (k) E[(Vi Pi )+ Kj K = k].
(Strictly speaking, the de…nition of (k) is conditional on the event that “ j = k 8j 6= i”.
We suppress this from the notation to simplify notations.) Note ( ) is independent from
bidder identities due to the symmetry in private value distributions. For all s m, let V (s:m)
denote the s-th smallest among m independent draws of private values from some parent
distribution FV jk . Let FV (s:m) jk denote the distribution of this order statistic given entry cost
k.

Proposition 1 Suppose Assumption 1 holds and entry costs are reported in data. For any
k with 0 < k < 1, (k) is identi…ed from bidders’ entry decisions and the distribution of
transaction prices.

    Proof of Proposition 1 is included in Appendix A. The intuition builds on two simple
observations: First, Assumption 1 guarantees FV jk can be recovered from the distribution
of transaction prices under cost k. This is because, with the number of entrants A reported
in data, the distribution of prices is a distribution of the second-largest order statistics out
of a known number of i.i.d. draws from FV jk . Second, once FV jk is recovered, (k) can be
calculated as a known functional of the distribution of private values. It is worth noting that
identi…cation of ex ante surplus E[(Vi Pi )+ jk] per se does not rely on assumed knowledge
of entry costs from data. Rather, it could be recovered for an unknown entry costs k, as long
as researchers are aware of which auctions in data share this particular level of entry cost k.

                                                 9
Proposition 2 Suppose Assumption 1 holds. For any k such that 0 < k < 1, (k) = 0
if and only if bidders are risk-neutral, and (k) > 0 (or < 0) if and only if bidders are
risk-averse (or risk-loving).

Proof. Lemma 1 showed that for any such k and in a symmetric BNE, bidders enter with
probability k , where !(k; k ) E[u((Vi Pi )+ k)jk; “ j = k 8j 6= i”] = u(0). Thus, zero
is the certainty equivalent associated with u( ) and the distribution of (Vi Pi )+ given an
entry cost k and the value distribution FV jk . It then follows that (k) > 0 if u00 < 0 (bidders
are risk-averse). Likewise, (k) = 0 (or (k) < 0) if bidders are risk-neutral (or risk-loving).

    If the exit prices by all losing bidders are reported in data, the distribution of other order
statistics V (m:m)
              ~
                    with m~     m 2 provides a source of over-identi…cation of (k). This is
because the one-to-one mappings between FV jk and FV (m:m)   ~  jk exists for m
                                                                              ~    m 2 as well.
Such over-identi…cation should be exploited to improve e¢ ciency in the estimation.
    We now turn to the more practical scenario where data provide enough information to
identify the expectation of entry costs, but do not report realized entry costs in each auction.
Such a scenario is relevant, for example, where data does not report K but provides noisy
measures of costs K  ~ = K + with E( ) = 0. In such cases, K E(K) = E(K)            ~ is directly
identi…able.

Corollary 1 (of Proposition 2.) Suppose Assumptions 1 hold. (a) If 0 < k < 1 for all
k 2 [k; k], then E[ (K)] = 0 when bidders are risk-neutral, and E[ (K)] > 0 (or < 0) when
bidders are risk-averse (or risk-loving); (b) If K is independent from (Vi )i2N and E(K) is
known to the researcher, then E[ (K)] is identi…ed from entry decisions and the distribution
of transaction prices.

    Proof of Corollary 1 is included in the appendix. The key idea underlying this result
is that, with the sign of u00 (:) assumed …xed over its domain, the testable implications in
Proposition 2 are preserved after integrating out entry costs under conditions for Corollary
1. Thus, with the expectation of entry costs assumed known in Corollary 1, the test only
requires researchers to recover E[ (K)] (i.e., ex ante pro…ts after K is integrated out).
The latter is achieved by exploiting two facts. First, once conditioning on the number of
entrants, bidders’ expectation of their surplus (Vi Pi )+ is independent from entry costs.
This is because of the orthogonality condition between private values and the entry costs
assumed in Part (b) of Corollary 1. Thus the expectation of (Vi Pi )+ given the number
of competing entrants A i can be recovered from the data as in Proposition 2. Second, the
properties of the (binomial) distribution of the number of entrants can be used to relate
the unconditional distribution of the number of competitors for i in the bidding stage to
observed distributions.

                                               10
    Our approach here can be extended to allow for observed auction-level heterogeneities in
data. To do so, we need to modify Proposition 1 and 2 and Corollary 1 by conditioning the
assumptions and results therein on observable realizations of auction-level heterogeneities.
    The main limitation of the approach in this subsection is of course its reliance on the
existence of a consistent estimator for the mean of entry costs. This assumption does not
hold when the noisy measures of entry costs in data are subject to systematic omissions or
overstatement. In those cases, the average of these noisy measures yields a biased estimator
for expected entry costs.4 In Section 5 we propose an alternative test that does not require
knowledge of entry costs and thus is not subject to this limitation. This is done by exploiting
exogenous variations in potential competition and auction heterogeneities reported in data.


4.2     Test Statistic and Bootstrap Inference
    We propose a statistic for testing bidders’risk attitudes under the conditions of Corollary
1. To reiterate, the entry costs K vary across auctions independently from (Vi )i2N , and for
each auction the researcher only observes a noisy measure of the entry cost K~ = K + , where
  has zero mean and is independent from K and (Vi )i2N . To rule out uninteresting cases
with degenerate entry behavior, we maintain that 0 < k < 1 for all k 2 [k; k] throughout.
To simplify exposition, we …x N and suppress it from notations throughout the section and
in Appendix B. The following conditions are maintained in our derivation of the limiting
distribution of the test statistic.
Assumption R. (i) Across all auctions, the (N + 2)-vector ((Vi )i2N ; K; ) are i.i.d. draws
from the same joint distribution. (ii) All coordinates in (Vi )i2N ; K and are mutually
independent with …nite second moments and E( ) = 0. (iii) Within each auction, the private
values Vi are independent draws from the same continuous marginal distribution FV , which
has positive densities over [v; v), and has a probability mass at v. (iv) The reserve price r
is …xed and binding ( r >v) throughout the data.
    That Vi is independent from K is required for identifying the ex ante risk premium
E[ (K)], as shown in Corollary 1. That has a zero mean ensures the sample mean of K           ~
in data is an unbiased and consistent estimator for E(K). Finite second moments of (K; )
are needed for applying a multivariate central limit theorem while deriving the limiting
distribution of our test statistic. That FV has a probability mass at the upper bound v is
a technical condition that simpli…es the proof for weak convergence of our estimator for FV
below. It is not needed in our argument above for recovering bidders’risk attitudes. In what
   4
     If the direction of bias is known to be upward then averaging these noisy measures gives a consistent
estimator for some upper bound on expected entry costs. One can still test the null that ex ante surplus
E[(Vi Pi )+ jk] does not exceed the upper bound of expected entry costs. If the null is rejected then we can
conclude bidders are risk averse. Nonetheless such a test has limited value in practice, for it is inconclusive
about risk attitudes when the null is not rejected.

follows, we let r (s)ds be a shorthand for the improper integral limv"v r (s)ds, where
   is a generic integrable function, for the rest of this section and in Appendix B. While
correlation between noises and entry costs K is allowed in Corollary 1, the orthogonality in
Assumption R-(ii) helps simplify derivations of the asymptotic property of the test statistic.
That the reserve price is binding means FV (r) > 0, which is empirically relevant in lots of
contexts.
     Our goal is to infer which of the three hypotheses below is best supported by data:

                     H0 :         0   = 0 (risk-neutral);
                     HA :         0   > 0 (risk-averse); and HL :             0   < 0 (risk-loving).

where 0 E[ (K)]. The data contain T independent auctions, each of which is indexed by t
and involves N potential bidders. Let At denote the number of entrants in auction t. Let Wt
de…ne the transaction price in auction t. If the object is sold, then Wt = maxfr; V (At 1:At ) g
when At 2 and Wt = r when At = 1. If the object is not sold, then de…ne Wt < r.
    Our test statistic ^T is a multi-step estimator for the unconditional expectation of a
bidder’s pro…t E[ (K)] based on the sample analog principle. First, for m 2, estimate the
distribution of transaction prices:
                                              P                                       P

for any r      s < v. Then for any m                     2, estimate the private value distribution by:

stated conditions, which is veri…ed in Appendix C by using results from Beran and Ducharme

under the alternative.7

     In this section we present Monte Carlo evidence for the performance of our test in …nite
samples. We consider the following data-generating process (DGP). Each auction involves
N potential bidders who face a common entry cost K. Upon entry, bidders draw private
values from the support [v; v] = [0; 10]. There is a probability mass of 2% at v and the rest
of the probability mass is uniformly spread over the half-open interval [v; v). The reserve
price is set at r = 3. The data set contains prices paid by the winners and the number of
entrants in each auction. In the rare case where the reserve price screens out all entrants
(i.e. realized privates values for all entrants are lower than r), transaction prices are de…ned
to be an arbitrary number smaller than r. The entry cost in each auction is drawn from a
multinomial distribution over the support f0:7; 0:8; 0:9g with identical probability masses.
The data reports noisy measures of entry costs K     ~ = K + but not K, where is drawn from
a uniform distribution [ 0:5; 0:5]. Bidders’ von-Neumann-Morgenstern utility is speci…ed
              c+5
as u(c)        10
                    , so that they are risk-neutral (or respectively, risk-averse or risk-loving) if
   = 1 (or < 1 or > 1).We experiment with the number of potential bidders N = 4 or
N = 5, and sample sizes T = 1; 500 or T = 3; 000.
     To improve the test performance in small samples, we modify our estimator for risk-
premium ^T slightly by replacing the averaged estimators for the value distribution FV in
(3) with inverse-variance-weighted average estimators. That is, while constructing ^T , we
                                             P      ^
replace F^V;T (s) in (4) by F~V;T (s) N 1 1 N                1 ^
                                                m=2 m (s) m (FW jm;T (s)) for s   r, with ^ m (s)
   2         1    PN       2         1       2
 ^ m;T (s)     = m0 =2 ^ m0 ;T (s)     and ^ m;T being the standard errors for the estimator of FV
using observations with m entrants. The test statistic then uses the weighted version F~V;T in
subsequent steps. As the test statistic remains a smooth function of sample averages, we use
bootstrap estimates for critical values in its sampling distribution (as explained in Section
4.2) in our inference procedures below.

                               [Insert Figure 1 (a), (b), (c), (d) here.]

     Our bootstrap inference uses an asymptotically non-pivotal statistic T (^T      0 ). One could construct
asymptotically pivotal statistics using the pre-pivoting approach. This would help attain asymptotic re…ne-
ments in the approximation of test statistic distribution relative to …rst-order asymptotic approximation or
bootstrap using asymptotically non-pivotal statistics. This is computationally intensive due to bootstrap
iterations and therefore we do not pursue this approach here.

                                                     14
    Panels in Figure 1 report test performance under various DGP and sample sizes T . For
each grid point of between 0:75 and 1:25 (with grid width 0:05), we calculate an integrated
measure of relative risk-aversion ( ), de…ned as integral of cu00 (c)=u0 (c) over the support
of c = (Vi Pi )+ K. (Thus positive values for ( ) correspond to risk-averse and negative
values to risk-loving bidders.) For each and sample size T = 1; 500 or 3; 000, we simulate
S = 250 samples.
    For each simulated sample, we calculate the statistic ^T , and then perform the test
using critical values estimated from B = 300 bootstrap samples drawn from this simulated
sample. We reports test results for signi…cance levels = 5%, 10% and 15%. Solid curves
in each panel show the proportions of S samples in which our test fails to reject the null
of risk-neutrality (H0 : ( ) = 0). The dashed curves (and dotted curves respectively)
plot the proportions of S samples in which the test rejects the null in favor of alternatives
HA : ( ) > 0 (and HL : ( ) < 0 respectively). Each panel of Figure 1 reports the result
for a given pair of T and N , with the integrated measure of risk-aversion ( ) plotted on the
horizontal axis.
    In all panels of Figure 1, the test approximately attains targeted levels under the null.
Also, in all panels, the power of our test approaches 1 as the absolute value of the inte-
grated measure of risk-aversion ( ) increases.8 The comparison of panel (a) with (b) and
the comparison of panel (c) with (d) suggest, as sample sizes increase, errors in rejection
probabilities under the null decrease while the power under any …xed alternatives increases.
    Table 1 further quanti…es these changes in test performance for 2 f0:8; 0:9; 1:0; 1:1;
1:2g and N 2 f4; 5g by reporting numerical results. Each row corresponds to some pair of
(N; ) and some sample size T , while the column headings are targeted signi…cance levels.
For each cell in Table 1, we report from the left to the right, the proportions of S simulated
samples, where the test rejects H0 in favor of HL , where the test does not reject H0 , and
where H0 is rejected in favor of HA respectively.
    Table 1(a) shows results for auctions with four potential bidders. Even with a moderate
sample size T = 1; 500, the test attains rejection probabilities that are reasonably close to
the targeted level under the null, and reasonably high probabilities for rejecting the null
in favor of the correct alternative when 6= 1. When 6= 1, the probability for “Type-III”
error (i.e. rejecting the null in favor of a wrong alternative) is zero across all speci…cations
and sample sizes.




   8
    In the presence of directional alternatives (i.e. HA and HL ), we de…ne the power of the test as the
probability of rejecting the null in favor of the true alternative in the DGP.

    With the sample size as small as T = 1; 500 or 3; 000, the power of the tests appears
low at = 0:9 or = 1:1. We argue that this should not be interpreted as evidence of
unsatisfactory …nite sample performance of our test. Rather it is mostly due to the fact that
the curvature of utility functions are close to being linear for = 0:9 or = 1:1. The power
does improve substantially either as the sample size increases, or as moves further away
from 1.
    Table 1(a) also quanti…es the improvement of test performance as the sample size T
increases. For a …xed level of , increasing sample sizes from T = 1; 500 to T = 3; 000

reduces the error in the rejection probability by a small amount under the null with = 1.
On the other hand, such an increase yields more substantial improvements in the power
under each …xed alternatives. Table 1(b) reports results for auctions involving …ve potential
bidders. Overall, it registers the same pattern as in Table 1(a).
   Comparisons between Table 1(a) and 1(b) suggest the impact of a larger number of
potential bidders on the errors in rejection probabilities under the null is ambiguous. On
the other hand, the impact of a large N on the power of the test under any …xed alterative
seems unambiguous: For all 6= 1 and given any sample size, the power appears to be higher
with N = 4 for all . Such a di¤erence in comparison is related to the following fact: Under
any alternative, the magnitude of the risk-premium is partly determined by the shape of
the distribution of (Vi Pi )+ given N ; on the other hand this magnitude remains …xed at
0 as the distribution of (Vi Pi )+ changes with N under the null. Since the size of risk
premia, subject to estimation errors in data, essentially determines how likely it is to detect
non-risk-neutrality, we conjecture this di¤erence in comparative statics might explain the
above pattern.


4.4    Mismeasurement of Entry Costs
    This subsection provides further simulation evidence about the test performance when
entry costs K are mismeasured. We report results in a DGP where the noisy measures of
entry costs systematically underestimates the true entry costs known to potential bidders.
The speci…cation of the DGP is the same as that used above, except that the noisy measures
K~ now has a downward bias equal to ~-percent of the true entry cost K. We experiment
with ~ = 5 or 10 in simulations. Table 2 reports results with S = B = 200 (where S is the
number of simulate data sets and B is the number of bootstrap samples used for estimating
critical values in each simulated sample).

    As expected, the two panels in Table 2 show that, compared with Table 1, underestimat-
ing the mean of entry costs results in larger errors in rejection probabilities under the null.
For instance, for ~ = 5 and = 5%, the probability for rejection the null is 17% (of which
14:5% leads to conclusions in favor of the risk-averse alternative HA ) when T = 1500; and
is 8:5% (of which 7% is in favor of HA ) when T = 3000. Also the power against risk-loving
alternatives is lower than in Table 1 due to the underestimation of entry costs, while that
against the risk-averse alternative becomes higher than in Table 1. Similar patterns persist
for tests with higher signi…cance levels = 10% and = 15%.
    A comparison between the two panels of Table 2 suggests that, as the magnitude of bias
increases, the performance of the test worsens both in the sense of larger errors in rejection
probabilities and lower power against the risk-loving alternatives. Besides, the probability
for Type III error could be positive for tests with higher signi…cance levels and larger bias.

                                                  18
With a large bias ~ = 10 and = 1:1, the power actually decreases with sample sizes. This
can be explained by the fact that the bias in estimating entry costs is large relative to the
di¤erence in risk premia under the null and the risk-loving alternative = 1:1.
    By construction, the errors in projection probabilities under H0 due to the underestima-
tion of expected entry costs will not diminish to zero as the sample size approaches in…nity.
Also, for a range of risk-loving alternatives that are su¢ ciently close to the null, the test
may be inconsistent (the probabilities for rejecting the null given those alternatives do not
approach 1 as the sample size increases). However, on a more positive note, for risk-loving
alternatives farther away from the null (e.g.     1:2), the test appears to be consistent, with
the power against any such alternative approaching 1 as the sample size increases. In sum,
the impact on test performance under mismeasurement of entry costs depends on the size
of the bias in the estimation of entry costs as well as the distance between the null and the
alternatives (as measured by the di¤erence between the risk premia under the null and the
alternative).


4.5     Mismeasurement of N
    The number of potential bidders N could also be mismeasured in data for several distinct
reasons, each of which has a di¤erent impact on the performance of our test.
    First, under-measurement of N could happen due to …nite sample limitations. For exam-
ple, consider the case where equilibrium entry probabilities are low and the set of potential
bidders is measured as the union of entrants observed in the sample. In such a case, a
potential bidder may not be counted in because it never entered as an active bidder in the
…nite sample. Our estimator for entry probabilities is thus biased upward under this mis-
measurement, because potential bidders who decide not to enter in any auction reported in
data are not counted in the denominator. On the other hand, this mismeasurement does
not impact the estimation of the private value distribution, since the number of entrants is
correctly reported in data.
    To see how this a¤ects our test, recall bidders’risk premia are weighted sums of interim
pro…ts from entry. Such an under-measurement in N has no impact on the estimation of
these interim pro…ts, which only depend on the private value distribution, the number of
competing entrants A i , and the expectation of entry costs. On the other hand, it does a¤ect
estimates for the weights, or probability masses for A i , through its impact on estimates of
entry probabilities. Unfortunately the sign of the resultant bias in the estimator for risk-
premia is indeterminate, for it depends on the way those interim pro…ts vary with A i ,
and how the distribution of A i changes with entry probabilities.9 Nevertheless, it is worth

   9
     That the estimators for entry probabilities are knwon to be biased upward under this mismeasurement
is not su¢ cient for deriving the sign of bias in our risk-premium estimator. This sign is determined by

                                                  19
noting that, as the real N increases in DGP, the e¤ect of under-measurement on the bias in
the estimator for entry probabilities and risk premium decreases.
    The second possibility for mismeasurement is over-counting N due to problematic as-
sumptions. Again, consider the case where potential bidders are measured as the union of
entrants observed in data. An implicit assumption is that a bidder who shows up in one auc-
tion is by default also a potential bidder in other auctions in data. This risks over-counting N
when there are bidders who pay the costs to enter in some auctions but are not interested as
a potential bidder in the others, say, due to budget or time constraints. Such over-counting
leads to a downward bias in the estimator for entry probabilities but has no bearing on the
estimation of interim pro…ts. Again, the ultimate impact of such a bias on test performance
is indeterminate, but diminishes as the real N increases.
    Yet a third scenario is that the number of potential bidders reported in data, denoted
by N ~ , is a persistent random under-measurement of the real N in the DGP. In this case,
the conditional distribution of N ~ given N , denoted by g~(N  ~ jN ), is an additional parameter
to be identi…ed. This di¤ers qualitatively from the …rst possibility (under-measurement due
to …nite sample limitations) in that the distribution g~ is a model primitive that does not
vary with the sample size. An, Hu and Shum (2010) studied the estimation of a related
model of …rst-price auctions where the number of actual bidders are misclassi…ed due to the
truncation by binding reserve prices. It turns out we can apply their argument to the current
context to identify the joint distribution of (N; N~ ), and the distribution of transaction prices
given N . Consequently, the entry probabilities conditional on N are also identi…ed and tests
for risk attitudes can be constructed as before.
    For easy exposition of how the argument in An, Hu and Shum (2010) can be applied
here, …x entry costs and let N  ~ = f~(N; ~) and N = f (Z; ), where Z are some instruments
that a¤ect bidders’potential participation but not the distributions of their private values.
Assume bidders’private values, ~ and Z are mutually independent conditional on N . This
implies that the transaction price W is independent from N        ~ and Z given N , and that N    ~
is independent from Z given N . Provided the joint support of (Z; N         ~ ) satisfy a mild full-
rank condition, the conditional distribution of N    ~ given N , the conditional distribution of
W given N , and the joint distribution of (Z; N ) are jointly identi…ed using a typical matrix
diagonalization argument. (See Theorem 1 in An, Hu and Shum (2010) for a proof.) Knowl-
edge of these distributions, together with the directly identi…able distribution of W given
the number of entrants, implies that the entry probabilities are identi…ed and consistently
estimable. The proposed test for bidders’risk attitudes can then be constructed. We leave
the implementation of a test based on such an idea for future research.

true equilibrium entry probabilities).

5    Inference of Risk Attitudes with Unobserved Entry
     Costs
    In lots of empirical environments, auctions reported in data di¤er in observed character-
istics of the auctioned object. Besides, the number of potential bidders N may vary across
auctions. In this section, we show how to use these sources of variations to infer bidders’
risk attitudes, when entry costs known to bidders are not reported in data.

Assumption 2 Vi = h(Z) + i for all i, where Z is a vector of auction characteristics
reported in data, and i are i.i.d. draws from some distribution F that is independent from
Z and N .

    The function h( ) is a model primitive unknown to the econometrician. It is directly
identi…able under a location normalization E[ ] = 0. To see this, let FV jZ denote the distri-
bution of Vi conditional on Z, where the subscript i is dropped due to symmetry. By the
same argument used in Proposition 1 in Section 4.1, FV jZ is identi…ed from the distribution
of transaction prices FW jZ . Assumption 2 and E[ ] = 0 then imply h(z) is identi…ed as
                  R
h(z) = E[Vi jz] = vdFV jz (v) for all z.
    Independence of from N in Assumption 2 is analogous to the assumption of exogenous
variations in N in Haile, Hong and Shum (2004) and Guerre, Perrigne and Vuong (2009). As
shown in Guerre, Perrigne and Vuong (2009), it is possible to identify bidders’risk attitudes
even when N is endogenous, as long as the data contains valid instruments once conditioning
on some control variables. We provide detailed discussions about this in Section 5.4.1.
    Under Assumption 2, a test for risk attitudes can be constructed even when entry costs
are not reported in data. The idea is to exploit the fact that bidders’risk attitudes a¤ect
how entry probabilities vary with Z and N in equilibrium. To illustrate this idea, it is
instructive to investigate the indi¤erence condition in equilibrium. Such conditions equate
bidders’ utility from the certainty equivalent, u(0), with their ex ante utility from entry.
By construction ex ante utility from entry is a weighted average of “interim” utility, which
conditions on the number of competing entrants with expectations taken with respect to
private values. Entry probabilities enter ex ante utilities in the indi¤erence condition through
the weights assigned to interim utilities. These weights correspond to probability mass
functions for the number of competing entrants. As Z and N vary, the entry probabilities
(and therefore the weights) change endogenously in order to respect indi¤erence condition
in equilibrium.
    The idea of our test builds on the following simple observation. If bidders are risk-
neutral, then variations in Z induce the same rate of changes in interim utilities as that in
expected private values. On the other hand, this equality fails when bidders are risk-averse
(or risk-loving) due to the decreasing (or increasing) rate of increase in utility. Under the

                                              21
orthogonality and additive separability conditions in Assumption 2, the rate of changes in
expected private values is over-identi…ed as the ratio between changes in expected transaction
prices.10 Thus, a test for bidders’risk attitudes would be feasible if the rate of changes in
interim utilities can be related to the distribution of entry decisions and transaction prices.
    We construct a linear system that characterizes the indi¤erence conditions for various
Z and N . Under Assumption 2, the number of unknowns in the system (i.e. the interim
utilities) increases at the same pace as the number of equations. As long as the matrix of
coe¢ cients in the linear system (i.e. weights for interim utilities under various Z and N )
has full-rank, we can recover the rates of changes in interim utilities from the distribution
of prices and entry decisions.11 This allows us to conduct a test for risk attitudes based on
the afore-mentioned idea.


5.1     Identi…cation
   Suppose the entry cost k is …xed across auctions but not reported in data.12 For easy
exposition, assume there is no binding reserve price. Let z;n denote bidders’ equilibrium
entry probabilities in auctions with Z = z and the number of potential bidders N = n. For
0 a n 1, de…ne:
                                                              n 1            a               n a 1
                  a;z;n   Pr(A     i   = ajZ = z; N = n) =     a
                                                                    (   z;n )    (1     z;n )        :      (8)

In the Bayesian Nash equilibrium of the entry stage,
                                                                          Pn       1
                   u(0) = E [u((Vi        Pi )+    k)jZ = z; N = n] =            a=0   a (z) a;z;n          (9)

where a (z)     E[u((Vi Pi )+ k)j A i = a; Z = z], and A i ; Vi ; Pi are de…ned as in
Section 3. Under Assumptions 2, (Vi Pi )+ does not depend on n given z and the number
of competing entrants A i = a. For all a 1, a (z) is de…ned as:
                                                         h                  i
                                                                 (a:a)
          a (z) E[u((V i  P i )+ k)jZ  = z; A i = a] = E   u  i        +
                                                                         k    ,

         (a:a)
where            is the largest among a independent draws from F . Also, by construction,

                           0 (z)   = E[u(Vi       k)jZ = z] = E[u(h(z) +          i    k)]
   10
      Alternatively, we could recover the rate of changes in E(Vi jZ) due to Z from the conditional distribution
FVi jZ , which is over-identi…ed from the distribution of transaction prices conditional on Z and the number
of entrants.

      See Assumption 3 and discussions after Lemma 2 below for details about the su¢ cent rank condition.

      We could generalize this section by allowing entry costs to vary across auctions in the data-generating
process as well. To do this, we could let the vector of auction heterogeneities consist of two subvectors
     ~ and let k be an unknown function of Z~ alone. Our inference method below applies as long as we
(Z; Z),
could condition on Z~ and exploit the variations in Z.

                                                       22
where the second equality follows from independence between i and z. Clearly                                                                               a (z)    does
not depend on z for a 1; thus we let a       a (z) for all a 1 and any z.

Assumption 3 There exists z; z 0 ; z 00 and n on the support of (Z; N ) in the data-generating
process such that 0 < z;s < 1 for all 2 s n, and z0 ;n ; z00 ;n 2 (0; 1).

    Assumption 3 requires there be enough variation in auction characteristics and in poten-
tial competition in data. The condition that entry probabilities are in the interior of (0; 1)
rules out uninteresting cases with degenerate entry behaviors. This condition can be directly
veri…ed from data in principle.
    The characterization of entry probabilities for Z = z and N = s for 2 s n leads to a
system of (n 1) equations:
                                      Ps 1
                        0 (z) 0;z;s +  a=1 a a;z;s = u(0) for s = 2; ::; n.              (10)

We also have additional equations from auctions with di¤erent observed features z 0 or z 00
and N = n. That is,
              0
                            Pn 1                                       0             00
          0 (z ) 0;z 0 ;n +  a=1 a a;z 0 ;n = u(0); and likewise with z replaced by z . (11)

Stacking the system of equations from (10)-(11) and moving the terms that involve                                                                                   1   to
the right, we have:
                                                                                                                     0               1

The linear system has n + 2 unknowns (i.e. 0 (z 00 ); 0 (z 0 ); 0 (z) and f a : 1 a n 1g)
and n + 1 equations. Nonetheless, the next lemma shows how (12) can be used to relate the
ratio of changes in interim utilities 0 to entry probabilities as z varies.
    Under Assumption 3, the coe¢ cient matrix in (12) has a full rank of n + 1. (See the
proof of Lemma 2 in Appendix A.) Now replace u(0) by 0 and replace 1 by some arbitrary
constant c, and solve for the n + 1 unknowns ( 0 (z 00 ); 0 (z 0 ); 0 (z); f a : 2 a n 1g)
in (12). Denote the unique solutions by ( ~ 0;z00 ; ~ 0;z0 ; ~ 0;z ; f ~ a : 2 a n 1g).

    Assumption 3 is su¢ cient but not necessary for (13) to hold under Assumption 2. We
could relax Assumption 3 and only require the data-generating process to contain enough
variations in Z and N so that a linear system similar to (12) can be constructed for at least
three di¤erent values of Z with the coe¢ cient matrix in (12) being non-singular.13 The next
proposition states a testable implication of bidders’risk attitudes when entry costs are not
recorded in data.

Proposition 5 (a) Under Assumption 2,

                   h(z1 )       h(z2 ) = E(W jZ = z1 ; A = a)           E(W jZ = z2 ; A = a)

for any (z1 ; z2 ) and a        2. (b) Suppose Assumptions 2-3 hold for (z; z 0 ; z 00 ) such that h(z 00 ) >
h(z 0 ) > h(z). Then

                                                                                   < < >

                                                                   h(z)         00

                                                    <                                >

    To construct a test based on Proposition 5, one needs to locate a triple (z; z 0 ; z 00 ) such
that with h(z 00 ) > h(z 0 ) > h(z). Under Assumption 2, this sequence of strict inequalities
is equivalent to E[W jz 00 ; A = a] > E[W jz 0 ; A = a] > E[W jz; A = a] for all a       2. (See
the proof of part (a) of Proposition 5.) Thus such a triple can be found using observed
distribution of prices conditional on Z and the number of entrants. Note this does not
require the location normalization E[ i ] = 0.
    In some other contexts, it is possible to locate such a triple using the shape restrictions
on h that are known a priori to researchers. For example, economic theory or common sense
sometimes may restrict the function h(:) to be monotonic in one of the coordinates in Z, or
may suggest FV jZ is stochastically ordered among a known triple (z; z 0 ; z 00 ). In such cases,
the choices of the triple to be used in the test are immediate. In the following subsection,
we assume a triple (z; z 0 ; z 00 ) with h(z 00 ) > h(z 0 ) > h(z) is known and …xed.14


   13
       Speci…cally, a weaker su¢ cient condition for Lemma 2 is as follows: “There exists J 3 values of Z,
denoted fz j : 1 j Jg, and J overlapping sets of integers on the support of N , each of which is denoted
 j
        fnj;1 ; nj;2 ; ::; nj;Mj g with Mj   #f j g, such that the matrix of coe¢ cients for f 0 (z j ) : j     Jg
                                                                                              P
and ( 2 ; :; n 1 ) (where n            maxf[j J f j gg) has full-rank in the linear system of  j J M   j equations
characterizing the equilibrium entry probabilities for various Z and N .” This condition necessarily requires
P
   j J Mj        n + J 2. Note Assumption 3 is a special case of this condition with J = 3, (z 1 ; z 2 ; z 3 ) =
               1
      0 00
(z; z ; z ),     = f2; 3; ::; ng, and 2 = 3 = fng.
    14
       In this case, we need a preliminary step for selecting a triple satisfying the inequalities, based on
comparing the estimates of E(W jZ; a). We leave issues such as how to account for the impact of pretesting
in inference to future research.

                                                             24
5.2     Test Statistic
    We now construct a test statistic based on Proposition 5 and some triple (z; z 0 ; z 00 ) and
some n known to satisfy Assumption 3. First, estimate the coe¢ cient matrix on the right-
hand side and the coe¢ cient vector on the left-hand side in (12) by plugging in sample analogs
of the entry probabilities into (8). Next, replace u(0) with 0 and 1 with an arbitrary negative
constant c in (12) and solve it to get estimates for ( ~ 0;z00 ; ~ 0;z0 ; ~ 0;z ; f ~ a : 2 a n 1g).15
Denote these estimates by ^ 0 (z); ^ 0 (z 0 ); ^ 0 (z 00 ) and f ^ a : 2 a n 1g respectively. Our
test statistic is
                                           ^ (z 0 ) ^ (z)
                                     ~       0             0
                                                                    R^
                                         ^ 0 (z 00 ) ^ 0 (z 0 )
where                                                                           !
                                  Pn            ^
                                               E(W  jz 0 ; a)   ^
                                                                E(W jz; a)
                             ^
                             R         1
                                                                                                       (15)
                                     a=2 q
                                         ^a
                                               ^                ^
                                               E(W jz 00 ; a)   E(W jz 0 ; a)
       ^
with E(W   jz; a) being kernel estimators for expected transaction prices given z and the
number of entrants A = a; and f^    qa : 2   a    n 1g are data-dependent weights. In the
                                    2 Pn 1      2
simulations below, we use q^a ^ a =( s=2 ^ s ), where ^ a is the standard error for the ratio
of di¤erences in the parenthesis on the right-hand side of (15).
    We now brie‡y discuss the asymptotic property of our test statistic ~. It is instructive
to look at the case where the support of Z is discrete, which is also what we consider in
the simulations of Section 5.3 below. In this case, ~ is by construction a smooth function of
sample averages. (To see this, note ^ z;n are sample averages and E(W
                                                                   ^    jz; a) are ratios whose
numerators and denominators are sample averages. It then follows that ^ 0 (z); ^ 0 (z 0 ); ^ 0 (z 00 )
and R ^ are smooth functions of sample averages.) Under Assumptions 2 and 3 and the
conditions on …nite second moments of transaction prices, the Delta Method can be applied
to show that ~ converges at the parametric rate to its population counterpart , which
is de…ned as the di¤erence between the two ratios compared in (14). Furthermore, the
asymptotic distribution of ~ is normal with a zero mean and a …nite variance.
    A test for risk attitudes follows a procedure similar to that of Section 4.2, with critical
values estimated using bootstrap resampling. With ~ being a smooth function of sample
averages, the bootstrap estimator for the exact …nite sample distribution of ~ is consistent.
For the same reason, the test using bootstrap critical values is expected to perform at least
as well as one based on …rst-order asymptotic approximation both in terms of the errors in
rejection probabilities and its asymptotic power.



  15
     To identify the ratio of di¤erences between interim utilities 0 under various z, the sign of the chosen
constant c does not matter. However, using a negative c has the additional bene…t of recovering the correct
ordering of 0 under di¤erent z. (See the proof of Lemma 2 in Appendix A for details.)

                                                    25
5.3    Monte Carlo Simulations
    This subsection presents some Monte Carlo evidence for the performance of the test
above in …nite samples. The DGP is as follows. The distribution of auction characteristics
Z is multinomial over a discrete support Z 2 f1; 2; 3g with equal probability masses. Upon
entry, a bidder i’s private value is 1 + 2 Z + i , where             ( 1 ; 2 ) are parameters to
be experimented with and i are i.i.d draws from a uniform distribution over [ 2; 2]. The
support of potential bidders is f2; 3; 4; 5; 6g. Conditional on Z, the distribution of N is
stochastically increasing: Pr(N = njZ = 1) = 31 for n = 2 and 16 for all n 6= 2; Pr(N =
njZ = 2) = 13 for n = 4 and 16 for all n 6= 4; and Pr(N = njZ = 3) = 13 for n = 6 and
1
6
   for all n 6= 6. Such a speci…cation is meant to capture the possibility that the value
of the auctioned object is positively correlated with potential competition. An alternative
DGP where the distribution of N is restricted to be invariant in Z produces similar results.
                                                                      1+c
Bidders’von-Neumann-Morgenstern utility is speci…ed as u(c)            10
                                                                           . The speci…cation in
this section di¤ers slightly from that used in Section 4.3. This is mostly due to the fact that
the speci…ed supports of private values are di¤erent across the two sections. We adopt these
utility speci…cations so that for any given the curvature of the utility function over the
respective supports of V are comparable in Sections 4.3 and 5.3. The entry costs observed
by potential bidders is …xed at K = 1 in all auctions. As explained in Section 5.1 above, the
test does not require knowledge of the true entry cost in the DGP.
    Table 3 reports equilibrium entry probabilities under this DGP for = (2; 5) and (2; 3)
respectively. As the theoretical model suggests, for a …xed , the entry probabilities are
monotonically decreasing in N and increasing in Z (due to the monotonicity of h(Z)). Also,
as the marginal e¤ect of Z diminishes from 2 = 5 to 2 = 3, bidders are less likely to
enter the bidding stage for any given Z and N . Under the current utility speci…cation, risk-
aversion appears to result in lower entry probabilities ceteris paribus. Most importantly, the
entry probabilities are in the interior of (0; 1). This is essential for the full-rank condition
on the coe¢ cient matrix in (12) to hold.

    We report performance of the test in simulated samples that contain T = 3; 000 or
T = 5; 000 auctions with variations in Z and N . For each pair ( ; ) and a sample size T , we
simulate S = 400 samples.16 For each simulated sample, we calculate a test statistic ~ and
record a decision under signi…cance levels 2 f5%; 10%; 15%g respectively, based on critical
values estimated from B = 400 bootstrap samples. Table 4 summarizes the performance of
the test for 2 f0:6; 0:7; 0:8; 1:0; 1:2; 1:3; 1:4g.
    Each row in Table 4 corresponds to a DGP with a pair ( ; ) and a sample size T . The
numbers in each cell are the proportions of S simulated samples in which HL ; H0 ; HA are
accepted respectively.
    Table 4 (a) reports the test results when the auction heterogeneity Z has a larger marginal
impact on bidders’values ( 2 = 5). With a moderate sample size T = 3; 000, the probabilities
for rejecting the null is reasonably close to the targeted signi…cance levels under the null.
Errors in rejection probabilities also decrease as the sample size increases to T = 5; 000. For
both sample sizes and all signi…cance levels , the power of the test are reasonably high for
almost all alternatives except = 0:8. Besides, the power is also shown to approach 1 as
sample sizes increase. The probability for “Type-III”error (i.e. rejecting the null in favor of
a wrong alternative) is practically zero across all speci…cations and sample sizes.




  16
     Note we use larger sample sizes T compared to those in Section 4.3. This is because we need su¢ cient
observations given each pair (z; n) in the estimation of entry probabilities. (Recall that the test in Section
4.3 conditions on the number of potential bidders )

    Our empirical estimates for the power of the test are low against the risk-averse alternative
  = 0:8. For example, when the signi…cance level is = 5% in Table 4(a), our empirical
estimates for the power is 11:5% with T = 3; 000 and 19:25% with T = 5; 000. However,
the power improves at a fast pace as the alternative moves farther away from the null. For
example, in the same Table 4(a), when = 0:7 and = 5%, the estimates for power under
T = 3; 000 and 5; 000 increase substantially to 62% and 84% respectively. Also, for ’s with
the same distance from the null value 1, the power reported against risk-loving alternatives
are considerably higher than those against risk-averse alteratives. For instance, in Table 4(a),
when = 5% and = 1:2, the power is 48:5% for T = 3; 000 and 56:25% for T = 5; 000,
which are a lot greater than their counterparts under = 0:8.
    That the reported power can be low against the alternatives with 2 [0:8; 1) is due to the
combination of two factors. First, as mentioned in Section 4.3, these risk-averse alternatives
correspond to utility functions with curvatures not too far from that for a linear function.
Thus the di¤erence between the ratios compared in Proposition 5 (i.e. the probability limit
of ~, denoted ) is close to zero under these DGPs. On the other hand, the standard error
for estimating conditional entry probabilities are large relative to the absolute value of this
di¤erence     because of smaller sample sizes after Z and N are controlled for. (Recall the
T observations consists of auctions with 15 possible combinations of (Z; N ) in the DGP
considered.) This in turn translates into relatively large standard errors for ~. To sum up,

                                               28
the test statistics are asymptotically normal both under = 1 and = 0:8, with variances
large relative to the di¤erence between the means. This could explain the observed lower
power against alternatives 2 [0:8; 1). Similar to the case with Section 4.3, we argue this
should not be interpreted as evidence of unsatisfactory …nite sample performance of our test.
Rather it is due to the fact that the curvature of utility functions are close to being linear
for 2 [0:8; 1). To reiterate, the power of the test does improve substantially either as the
sample size further increases, or as moves farther away from 1.

    Table 4(b) reports the test performance when = (2; 3). Overall, it registers the same
patterns as those discussed above for Table 4(a). More interestingly, a comparison between
Table 4(a) and 4(b) suggests that, for any T; and a …xed alternative 6= 1, the power of
the test is larger in the DGP with a greater marginal e¤ect of auction heterogeneity. Such
a pattern across the two panels is aligned with the idea that underlies our test: The iden-
ti…cation of risk attitudes is driven by the di¤erence between the rate of changes in interim
utilities and the rate of changes in expected private values as the auction characteristic Z
vary exogenously. The distance between these two ratios under any alternative depends on
the di¤erence in expected private values as Z varies, which depends on the marginal e¤ect
of Z on h(:).

5.4     Further Discussions
5.4.1    Endogeneity in the number of potential bidders

     It is possible to extend the results from Sections 5.1-5.2 to the case where the number
of potential bidders N are endogenous. The main idea is to use additional auction het-
erogeneities reported in data as instrumental variables under certain exclusion restrictions.
Guerre, Perrigne and Vuong (2009) introduced an instrument-based argument to recover
bidders’utility functions in …rst-price auctions. Below we discuss how their argument can
be applied in the current context.
     Let the number of potential bidders be given by a structural equation N = (Z; X; ),
where (Z; X) are auction heterogeneities reported in data; and is some auction-level variable
not reported in data. As before, we maintain Vi = h(Z) + i for all i. Now assume the
idiosyncratic component i is independent from (X; Z) conditional on . Across potential
bidders, i are independent draws from the same distribution F i j with E[ i j ] = 0.
     Under these conditions, the number of potential bidders may remain endogenous even
after conditioning on (Z; X). This is because these conditions allow for dependence between
   and i even after conditioning on (Z; X). On the other hand, these conditions imply that
  i are orthogonal to both (Z; N ) conditional on . Note X di¤ers from Z in that X only
a¤ects potential competition but not bidders’private values. The existing literature abound
in examples of such variables. In e-bay coin auctions studied by Bajari and Hortacsu (2003),
sellers’reputation a¤ects bidders’participation decisions but not their values. In U.S. Forest
Service auctions considered in Athey, Levin, and Seira (2004), road costs and density of
timber were found to a¤ect participation but not bidders’values.17
     Following Guerre, Perrigne and Vuong (2009), assume = N E[N jZ; X]. That is,
can be recovered from data as the residual of the nonparametric regression of N on (Z; X).
Our identi…cation arguments from Section 5.1 apply after conditioning on . Speci…cally,
the interim utilities a (z; ) and the entry probabilities a;z;n ( ) on the right-hand side of (9)
now all depend on , whose realized values can be recovered through regressions under our
assumption above, and therefore can be controlled for. Identi…cation of risk attitudes then
follows from the same arguments as in Proposition 5 after conditioning on .

5.4.2    Full identi…cation of the utility function

    We conclude this section with brief discussions about the possibility to use auction het-
erogeneities observed from data to fully recover bidders’utility functions. Consider a cross-
sectional data with a large number of independent auctions, which share the same entry costs
  17
     To be precise, the exclusion restriction in these papers are stated for entry decisions as opposed to
decisions to become a potential bidder. Nevertheless, the arguments used in those papers could also be
applies here to justify the use of these variables in W as de…ned above.

k (unknown to econometricians) and the same number of potential bidders N , but di¤er in
their auction-level heterogeneities Z. Then in Bayesian Nash equilibrium of the entry stage,

where Yi     (Vi Pi )+ and FY jZ;N denotes its distribution given (Z; N ). The distribution
of Y depends on Z both directly through FVi jZ and indirectly through equilibrium entry
probabilities, which a¤ect the distribution of Pi through the distribution of the number of
entrants A. Note for a given k, (16) is an integral equation in u(:), with the kernel being
the conditional density fY jZ;N which is identi…ed by arguments in Proposition 1 in Section
4.1. Besides, with assumed exogenous variation in Z and N , we can augment a system of
integral equations in u(:) by including additional equations similar to (16) that are derived
for di¤erent numbers of potential bidders and Z. We conjecture it is possible to establish
uniqueness of solution in u(:) and k in such a system of integral equations, after imposing
location and scale normalizations (such as u(0) = 0 and u0 (0) = 1) and additional primitive
conditions that restricts how FY jZ;N varies with (Z; N ). We leave this as a direction for
future research.18


6        Extensions
6.1      A¢ liated Private Values
    The assumption of independent private values is instrumental for recovering the dis-
tribution of private values from the distribution of transaction prices, for it guarantees a
one-to-one mapping between a parent distribution and the distribution of the second-largest
order statistic it generates. However, independence between private values fails in certain
situations, e.g. if bidders’values are correlated through auction heterogeneities that bidders
observe but are not reported in data. With a¢ liated private values, the joint distribution
F(Vi )i n jk is no longer point identi…ed for a given N (see Athey and Haile (2002)). Never-
theless, Aradillas-Lopez, Gandhi and Quint (2012) constructs sharp bounds on bidders’ex
ante expected surplus, using exogenous variation in the number of active bidders (see their
Theorem 1).

    18
                     R
     Let (u)(z)         u(t k)dFY jZ;N (tjz). That is,     is a linear operator mapping from the space of
continuous, bounded functions over the support of Y into the space of continuous, bounded functions over
the support of Z. If the model is correctly speci…ed (i.e. FY jZ;N recovered from data is indeed generated
by our model), the null space of the linear operator is necessarily a non-singleton. This is because both the
truth u(:) in the DGP with u0 (:) > 0 and a constant function u
                                                              ~ with u~(s) u(0) for all s are solutions of the
integral equation (16). Hence one would at least need to impose further restrictions on the space of solutions
in order to ensure uniqueness of the solutions in u(:).

                                                     31
    In our model, exogenous variation in the number of entrants A follows from a more
primitive condition of exogenous variation in the number of potential bidders N and from
the fact that mixed-strategy entry equilibria are non-selective. As a result, we can apply
the partial identi…cation result from Aradillas-Lopez, Gandhi and Quint (2012) to construct
bounds on bidders’ex ante expected surplus from entry. Comparing these bounds with entry
costs reported in data may reveal some information about risk preference.
    To see this, consider a model with no binding reserve price. Fix the number of poten-
tial bidders at n and the entry cost at k. If the joint distribution F(Vi )i n jk are a¢ liated
and exchangeable in bidders’indices, then there exists symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibria
in entry stage where bidders enter independently with probability k as characterized in
Lemma 1 (see Lemma A2 in Appendix A for details). In addition, we maintain the following
assumption about exogenous variation in the number of potential bidders. Let n denote the
largest integer on the support of the number of potential bidders N in the data-generating
process.
Assumption 1’For any k, the random vector (Vi )i n is a¢ liated and its joint distribution
is continuous and exchangeable in bidders’identities over the support [v; v]n . For any realized
number of potential bidders n n, the joint distribution F(Vi )i n jk equals the corresponding
marginal distribution derived from F(Vi )i n jk .
    This assumption, together with the non-selective mixed-strategy entry equilibrium (which
means the joint distribution F(Vi )i2A jk equals the corresponding marginal distribution derived
from F(Vi )i n jk for any a  n), suggests that the variation in the number of entrants A is
exogenous (in the sense that it is not correlated with the distribution of private values).
Thus the approach in Aradillas-Lopez, Gandhi and Quint (2012) can be applied to bound
the ex ante expected pro…ts from entry. Let 'a (k) denote the expected surplus (Vi Pi )+
for i conditioning on competing with A i = a entrants and entry cost k.
Proposition 6 (An Application of Theorem 1 in Aradillas-Lopez, Gandhi and Quint (2012).)

   The intuition of this result is as follows. First, an application using the Law of Total
Probability reveals:
                                               1                       a+1
                          FV (a+1:a+1) jk =      F

                                                                   +       F
                                                                       a+2 V (a+2:a+2) jk
                                                                                          .

                                                       32
Then recursive substitutions show that FV (a+1:a+1) jk (which is not point-identi…ed from trans-
action price distributions due to a¢ liation) can be written as a linear combination of distri-
butions of second-largest order statistic FV (m 1:m) jk for m = a + 2; ::; n (which is directly iden-
ti…able from the data) and the distribution of the largest order statistic FV (n:n) jk . Second, it
can be shown that the distribution of V (n:n) given k is bounded between [ n 1 (FV (n 1:n) jk (:))]n
and FV (n 1:n) jk (:). These bounds are derived by exploiting the link between the distribution
of …rst- and the second-order statistics of Vi (i.e. FV (n;n) jk and FV (n 1:n) jk ) under two extreme
scenarios: full independence or perfect correlation among private values. These two results
imply that FV (a:a) jk is bounded between FV+(a:a) jk;a and FV (a:a) jk;a for all a n 1. Proposition
6 then follows from the fact that the ex ante surplus 'a (k) can be expressed as the di¤erence
           1
               Rv                               1
                                                  Rv
between a+1      v
                    tdF V (a+1:a+1) jk (t) and
                                               a+1 v
                                                     tdFV (a:a+1) jk (t).
    It then follows from Proposition 6 that a bidder’s ex ante surplus prior to entry in
the presence of n potential bidders (denoted by ' (k; n)) is bounded between 'L (k; n) and
'U (k; n) for all n < n, where
                                Pn   1
                    'h (k; n)      a=0   'ha (k) Pr(A   i   = ajk; n) for h 2 fL; U g.           (17)

Unlike in the case with independent private values where we could point identify ' (k; n),
here we can only recover a pair of bounds 'L (k; n) and 'U (k; n) when private values are
a¢ liated. However, provided entry costs are observed from data, one can still test the
chain of inequalities 'L (k; n)    k    'U (k; n) against the alternatives of “k < 'L (k; n)”
and “k > 'U (k; n)”, using a test statistic based on sample analogs (whose …nite sample
distribution can be estimated using the bootstrap). If the null is rejected in favor of one of
the alternatives, we can conclude there is evidence in the data that supports hypotheses of
risk-aversion or risk-loving. Unfortunately, on the other hand, a failure to reject the null does
not necessarily allow us to conclude whether there is signi…cant evidence for risk-neutrality
or not.
    The argument in the preceding paragraph can be extended where entry costs are only
measured with noises, and are orthogonal from the joint distribution of private values. In
this case, bounds on ex ante surplus ' (k; n) in (17) still hold for all k given any n, except
that the bounds on interim surplus f'ha gh=L;U no longer depend on the unobserved cost
k. Thus, similar to the case with IPV in Corollary 1, we can identify E['h (K; n)jn] as
Pn 1 h
   a=0 'a Pr(A i = ajn) for h = L; U . Thus, provided the measurement errors are zero-mean
so that E[K] can be consistently estimated, we can construct a consistent test for the null
“E['L (K; n)jn] E[K] E['U (K; n)jn]”against the alternatives “E[K] < E['L (K; n)jn]”
and “E[K] > E['U (K; n)jn]”. As before, a rejection of the null would provide statistically

6.2     Selective Entry with Informative Signals
    Consider a model where each potential bidder observes in the entry stage a private
signal correlated with his private values. Thus entry decisions depend on these informative
signals. We identify bidders’risk attitudes in such a model, assuming data report continuous
variations in entry costs across auctions. As before, we …x N (the number of potential
bidders) and suppress it from the notations. Auction models with endogenous and selective
entry have been studied in Ye (2007), Gentry and Li (2013) and Marmer, Shneyerov and
Xu (2013). Li, Lu and Zhao (2012) considers the same model of auctions with risk-averse
bidders, a¢ liated signals and selective entry. Their emphasis is on the inference of the form
of risk-aversions using data from both …rst-price and ascending auctions.
    The model is speci…ed as follows. In an entry stage, each bidder i observes a private
signal Si and decides whether to pay costs k and enter the bidding stage. The entry cost
is commonly known and the same for all bidders. Upon entry in the bidding stage, each
entrant draws a private value Vi , and competes in an ascending auction with a reserve price
r. The joint distribution F (S1 ; :; SN ; V1 ; :; VN ) and r are common knowledge among potential
bidders. Each entrant may not be aware of the number of active competitors A while bidding.
Assumption S (i) (Si ; Vi ) are identically and independently distributed across potential
bidders ( F (S1 ; :; SN ; V1 ; :; VN ) = N
                                         i=1 F (Si ; Vi )); (ii) For each i, (Si ; Vi ) are a¢ liated; (iii)
Marginal distributions of Si and Vi , denoted FS and FV respectively, are continuous and
increasing over bounded support [s; s] and [v; v] respectively.
    Suppose the reserve price is binding with r > v. Let ! i (si ; k; s i ) denote ex ante utility
for bidder i with signal si if potential competitors follow monotone, pure-strategy Bayesian
Nash equilibria characterized by cuto¤s s i              (sj )j6=i . That is, ! i (si ; k; s i ) E[u((Vi
Pi )+ k)jSi = si ; A i = fj 6= i : Sj sj g; i 2 A].

Lemma 3 Under Assumption S, ! i (si ; k; s i ) is increasing in si and non-decreasing in s                 i
for any k.

    Let !(s; k) be a shorthand for ! i (s; k; (s; :; s)) = E[u((Vi Pi )+ k)jSi = s; A i = fj 6=
i : Sj sg; i 2 A]. Under Assumption S, !(s; k) is the same for all i, and is increasing in s
due to Lemma 3. An arguments similar to that in Lemma 1 show that under Assumption S,
there exists the following unique pure-strategy BNE in the entry stage: A potential bidder
i enters i¤ si   sk , where sk solves !(sk ; k) = u(0) if !(s; k) u(0) !(s; k). Otherwise,
sk = s (or sk = s) if !(s; k) > u(0) (or !(s; k) < u(0) respectively). Entry decisions in this
model are selective in that the distribution of private values conditional on entry di¤ers from
their unconditional distribution.
    To …nd bidders’ risk attitudes when there is selective entry, we again exploit the fact
that concave utilities lead to positive risk premia in the entry decisions. Let (s; k)
E[(Vi Pi )+ kjSi = s; A i = fj 6= i : Sj sg], which is identical for all i under Assumption

                                                    34
S. By the same argument as in Section 4.1, we can construct a test for bidders’risk attitudes
as long as (sk ; k) is identi…ed from distributions of transaction prices and entry decisions
for any k that yields non-degenerate entry probabilities in equilibrium. Speci…cally, consider
some costs k with s < sk < s so that uninteresting cases involving degenerate entry decisions
are ruled out. (Whether a level of entry cost k leads to any non-degenerate entry probabilities
is testable using the distribution of entry decisions from data.) Then, under Assumption S,
  (sk ; k) = 0 when bidders are risk-neutral; and (sk ; k) > 0, or < 0, when bidders are
risk-averse, or respectively risk-loving.
    The test for risk attitudes introduced in Section 4.2 is not directly applicable under
selective entry, because it leads to distorted decisions in favor of risk-aversion even when
the true DGP has risk-neutral bidders. Such distortion arises from the a¢ liation between
private values Vi and entry signals Si . To see why, recall from the preceding paragraph that,
with selective entry, bidders’risk attitudes are linked only to the sign of risk-premia for a
marginal bidder whose signal equals the cuto¤ sk that characterizes the equilibrium entry
strategy. If we were to apply the test from Section 4.2 under the current context of selective
entry, it would amount to testing the sign of ex ante payo¤s for a generic entrant whose
signal is not restricted to be equal to the cuto¤ (that is, ~ (sk ; k) E[(Vi Pi )+ kjSi sk ;
A i fj 6= i : Sj sk g]). However, the a¢ liation between Si and Vi suggests ex ante payo¤s
for other non-marginal entrants must be greater than the marginal entrant’s risk premium
  (sk ; k). That is, ~ (sk ; k) is bounded below by (sk ; k). Consequently, applying the test
from Section 4.2 for models with selective entry leads to over-rejection of risk-neutrality in
favor of risk-aversion.19
    The next proposition shows how to recover (sk ; k) from entry probabilities and the
distribution of transaction prices. To do this, it su¢ ces to recover the distribution of Vi
given Si = sk and the distribution of Pi given A i = fj 6= i : Sj sk g from data.

Proposition 7 Suppose (i) Assumption S holds with (Vi ; Si )i2N independent from entry
costs; (ii) for some …xed k, there exists " > 0 such that s < sk0 < s for all k 0 2 (k "; k + ");
and (iii) entry costs are observed in the data. Then (sk ; k) is identi…ed from the distribution
of transaction prices and entry probabilities.

    Implementing a test based on Proposition 7 would require the researcher to observe a
continuous variation of entry costs known to potential bidders. As discussed in Section
4, such an assumption is strong and has limitations. It could fail under various empirical
environments (say due to bias in the measurement of entry costs). It remains an open
question whether additional exogenous variations could be exploited to construct a test under
a¢ liated endogenous entry without requiring such knowledge. We also leave the de…nition
of a test statistic based on Proposition 7 and its asymptotic properties to future research.

7    Conclusion
    We propose tests for bidders’risk attitudes in ascending auctions where potential bidders
make endogenous entry decisions based on their information of entry costs and ex ante
knowledge of the distribution of private values. First, we show that risk premium can be
non-parametrically recovered from the distribution of transaction prices and entry decisions,
as long as the expected entry cost is identi…ed from the data. A test is proposed and shown
to have good …nite sample performance under various data-generating processes. Second,
we show how exogenous variations in number of potential bidders and observed changes
in auction features could provide additional identifying power to infer risk attitudes even
when knowledge about entry costs is not available. Finally, we extend our results to identify
bidders’ risk preference in a more general model where entries into auctions are selective.
Discussions about possible extensions to cases with a¢ liated private values are also provided.
    There are several directions for future research. First, is it possible to recover the full
utility functions, not just the sign of risk attitudes? We conjecture this is possible with
additional variations in entry costs or auction heterogeneities reported in data. Some addi-
tional restrictions on how these factors a¤ect private values may be needed to complete this
task. Second, can we extend the analysis to ascending auctions with discrete increments?
Haile and Tamer (2003) show how to form sharp bounds on value distributions using price
distributions in this case. These bounds could in turn lead to bounds on expected risk pre-
mia. Thus a test could be constructed to test the null that zero is covered by these bounds
on risk premia. Similar to the case with a¢ liated private values in Section 6.1, rejection of
the null could lead to a decision on risk attitudes while failure in rejections leaves the test
inconclusive. It remains an open question how to construct more informative tests under
additional economic restrictions on the model structure.

A     Proofs of Identi…cation
Proof of Lemma 1. We use the following property of expected utility from entry.

Lemma A1 Under Assumption 1, !(k;                    i)   is continuous and decreasing in                      i   for all k.

Proof of Lemma A1. By Law of Iterated Expectations,
                                             Z v
                 !(k; i ) = u( k)FV jk (r) +     h(v; k;                             i )dFV jk (v)                      (A1)
                                                                 r

where for v > r,
                                                                       Z   v
        h(v; k;    i)       u(v       r    k)FPi (rjk;          i) +           u(v    p     k)dFPi (pjk;           i)
                                                                       r
                   +        u( k)[1         FP i (vjk;        i )]


and we have used the independence between private values Vi conditional on entry costs.
Note for any t 2 [r, v], the event "Pi t" can be represented as

                        \j2N nfig f"j stays out" or "j enters \ Vj                        t"g.

Due to the independence between entry decisions and between private values, FPi (tjk; i ) =
Q
  j6=i [1  j + j FV jk (t)]. The marginal e¤ect of j on this conditional probability is strictly
negative for all j 6= i at j 2 [0; 1] and t 2 [r; v]. (Recall FV jk (r) > 0 when r is binding.)
This implies h(v; k; i ) is decreasing in i for any k. Hence !(k; i ) is decreasing in i .
Continuity follows from Dominated Convergence Theorem. Q.E.D.
The rest of the proof is similar to the risk-neutral case in Levin and Smith (1994) and
omitted.

Proof of Proposition 1. Conditional on k, entry decisions are independent across bidders,
and jointly independent from private values. Besides, private values are i.i.d. across bidders
given k. Hence, once conditional on k and the realization of A i , (Vi ; Pi ) are independent
from mixed strategies adopted by potential competitors. Thus
                                      PN     1
             E[(Vi      Pi )+ jk] =       a=0    E[(Vi    Pi )+ jk; A          i   = a] Pr(A     i   = ajk).            (A2)

With k and entry decisions observed from data, k is directly identi…ed as the probability
that a bidder enters under cost k. Consequently, Pr(A i = ajk) can be recovered as a
binomial distribution with parameters N 1 and k . Conditional on entering with cost k,


                                                         37
private values are independent draws from FV jk . Let 1f:g denote the indicator function. By
Law of Iterated Expectations, E[(Vi Pi )+ jk, A i = a] is

     E[(Vi Pi )1fVi > Pi > rgjk, A i = a] + E[(Vi r)1fVi > rg1fPi = rgjk, A                                          i   = a]

                                        a           a
   =         (s v) dFV jk (s) dFV jk (v) + FV jk (r)      (v r) dFV jk (v)                                                (A3)
           r     v                                                               r

for all A i = a 1, due to independence between Vi and Pi given k. Applying integration
by parts to the …rst term on the right-hand side of (A3), we have
                                            Z v
                 E[(Vi Pi )+ jA i = a; k] =      FV jk (v)a FV jk (v)a+1 dv
                                                                  r
                                                                 Rv
for a 1. Besides, E[(Vi Pi )+ j A i = 0; k] = E[(Vi r)+ jk] = r 1 FV jk (v) dv.
    With k observed from data, (k) is recoverable as long as FV jk (v) is identi…ed for v r.
Let W denote transaction prices observed in data. If no entrants bid above r, then de…ne
W < r. The symmetric IPV assumption implies for any m           2, Pr(W < rjA = m; k) =
     (m:m)
Pr(V       < rjk) = FV jk (r) and Pr(W = rjA = m; k) = mFV jk (r)m 1 [1 FV jk (r)]. Hence
                             m

for any m 2 and t r,

          Pr(W           tjA = m; k) = Pr(W < rjm; k) + Pr(W = rjm; k) + Pr(r < W                                  tjm; k)
                     m                     m 1
    = FV jk (t) + mFV jk (t)                     [1     FV jk (t)] = FV (m   1:m) jk   (t).

For any m 2, de…ne m (t) tm + mtm 1 (1 t) so that FV (m 1:m) jk (t) = m (FV jk (t)). Since
  m (t) is one-to-one for any m 2 over t 2 [0; 1], FV jk (t) is (over-)identi…ed for each t r
from the distributions of W conditional on k and A = m.

Proof of Corollary 1. Part (a). By Proposition 1 and the condition in part (a), (k) = 0
for all k 2 [k; k] if bidders are risk-neutral, and (k) > 0 (or (k) < 0) for all k if bidders
are risk-averse (or risk-loving). Integrating out k using FK proves (a).
    Part (b). Independence between K and (Vi )i2N implies that, given A i = a, the vector of
order sorted values fV (s:a+1) ga+1
                                s=1 is independent from K. Thus 'a    E[(Vi Pi )+ jA i = a; k]
does not depend on k for all a 0 (recall Pi r when A i = ?). By Law of Total Probability,
E[ (K)] is:
      Z    k
                         PN      1                                           PN    1

       k

                                      Rk
To identify Pr(A          i = a) (or k Pr(A i = ajk)dFK ), note that given any k and N , A                                 i    is
binomial (N 1;            k ) while A is binomial (N; k ). By construction,

                                                      N a                      a+1
                         Pr(A        i   = ajk) =      N
                                                            Pr(A = ajk) +       N
                                                                                       Pr(A = a + 1jk)                    (A5)

                                                                 38
for all k and 0 a N 1. Integrating out k on both sides of (A5) implies Pr(A i = a) =
N a
  N
     Pr(A = a) + a+1N
                       Pr(A = a + 1). Since the unconditional distribution of A is directly
identi…ed, so is the distribution of A i .20 With K assumed known, this implies E[ (K)] is
identi…ed.

Proof of Lemma 2. First note                                             1    6= u(0) under Assumption 3. [To see this, consider the
case with z and N = 2. Then                                           0;z;2   0 (z)    +      1;z;2      1     = u(0) with                       0;z;2     > 0,      1;z;2   > 0 and
 0;z;2   +    1;z;2   = 1. It follows from Assumption 2 that                                                         0 (z)      >       1.   This implies                1   < u(0).]
By construction, the r-th row of the coe¢ cient matrix on the left-hand side of (12) and the
r-th coordinate of the coe¢ cient vector in front of                                                          1    on the right-hand side of (12) add up
to 1. Hence we can write (12) as

                                           00                0                                    0
                        M [(        0 (z        );    0 (z       );    0 (z);     2 ; :::;    n 1)                 u(0)] =              1    [    1        u(0)] .               (A6)

where M denotes the (n + 1)-by-(n + 1) matrix of coe¢ cients on the left-hand side of (12);
and 1 denotes the (n + 1)-by-1 vector of coe¢ cients in front of 1 on the right-hand side of
(12).
       Next, we show that the matrix of coe¢ cients M has full-rank n + 1. To do this, it su¢ ces
to show each one of the n + 1 rows cannot be a linear combination of the other n rows.
Under Assumption 3, 0;z00 ;n > 0 and 0;z0 ;n > 0, so neither of the …rst two rows is a linear
combination of the other n rows. As for the third row, it cannot be a linear combination
of the other n rows, with nonzero weights for the …rst two rows that correspond to z 0 and
z 00 . Next, suppose it were a linear combination with nonzero weights for the last n 2 rows
of the coe¢ cient matrix in (12) only. Then this would contradict the assumption that the
(n 1)-by-(n 1) block in the lower right corner of the coe¢ cient matrix is a lower triangular
matrix with all entries below (and including) the diagonal vector being positive.
       With 1 < u(0) and the coe¢ cient matrix M being non-singular, (A6) can be rescaled
and written as
                                                     M ( ~ 0;z00 ; ~ 0;z0 ; ~ 0;z ; ~ 2 ; ::; ~ n                  1)

The lemma then follows immediately.

Proof of Proposition 5. Part (a). It su¢ ces to note that, under Assumption 2, E(W jZ =
z; A = a) = h(z) + E[ (a 1:a) ] for all z and a 2, and E[ (a 1:a) ] is independent from z.

     In fact this provides us with a set of testable implications that can be used for testing the model
speci…cation of symmetric IPV.

                                                                                           39
   Part (b). By construction,

                              0 (z)     E[u(Vi          k)jz] = E[u(h(z) +                      i         k)]

where the …rst expectation is taken with respect to Vi given Z = z and the second is with
respect to i alone while z is …xed at a realized value. By Lemma 2, ( ~ 0;z0 ~ 0;z )=( ~ 0;z00 ~ 0;z0 )
equals [ 0 (z 0 )              00
                  0 (z)]=[ 0 (z )
                                         0
                                     0 (z )], which in turn equals:

                             E[u(h(z 0 ) +        i     k)]        E[u(h(z) +              i            k)]
                                                                                                            .                             (A8)
                             E[u(h(z 00 ) +       i     k)]        E[u(h(z 0 ) +           i            k)]
By independence between Z and in Assumption 2 and the Mean Value Theorem, (A8)
equals:
                   [h(z 0 ) h(z)] E[u0 ( h(z 0 ) + (1 )h(z) + i k)]
                      00      0     0   0   00        0 )h(z 0 ) +
                                                                          (A9)
                 [h(z ) h(z )]E[u ( h(z ) + (1                     i k)]
for some and 0 2 (0; 1) that depend on (z; z 0 ) and (z 0 ; z 00 ) respectively. By the ordering
of h(z 00 ), h(z 0 ) and h(z), it must be the case that

                 h(z 0 ) + (1         )h(z) +     i     k<         0
                                                                       h(z 00 ) + (1                0
                                                                                                        )h(z 0 ) +        i     k

for any k, i , and 0 .
    If bidders are risk-neutral, then

     u0 ( h(z 0 ) + (1      )h(z) +         i   k) = u0 ( 0 h(z 00 ) + (1                  0
                                                                                               )h(z 0 ) +        i            k) > 0     (A10)

for all k, i , and 0 , and (A9) equals [h(z 0 ) h(z)]=[h(z 00 ) h(z 0 )]. Otherwise if bidders
are risk-averse then the equality in (A10) is replaced by a strict inequality “>”for all k, i ,
   and 0 due to the concavity of u. It then follows from the independence between i and
Z that
                          E[u0 ( h(z 0 ) + (1   )h(z) + i k)]
                             0  0    00         0
                                                                   >1
                         E[u ( h(z ) + (1         )h(z 0 ) + i k)]
when bidders are risk-averse. Therefore (A9) is strictly greater than [h(z 0 ) h(z)]=[h(z 00 )
h(z 0 )] under risk-aversion. Symmetric arguments show the reverse strict inequality holds
when bidders are risk-loving.


Lemma A2 Let the joint distribution of private values F(Vi )ni=1 jk be a¢ liated and exchange-
able for a given number of potential bidders n and entry cost k. If !(k; (1; :; 1)) < u(0) <
!(k; (0; :; 0)) where ! is de…ned as in (1), then there exists a unique symmetric BNE in which
all bidders enter independently with probability k , where k solves !(k; ( k ; :; k )) = u(0).

Proof of Lemma A2. It su¢ ces to show FPi (tjk;                            i)   is decreasing in                      i       given k and n. To
see this, note by the Law of Total Probability,
                                                Pn  1
                         FPi (tjk;     i)         a=0   FV (a:a) jk (t) Pr(A           i   = aj             i ; k),


                                                              40
where FV (a:a) jk (t) denotes the distribution of the largest order statistic from a a-dimensional
random vector (Vi )i a ; and de…ne FV (0:a) jk (t) 1 for t 0. Under the assumptions of the
lemma, FV (a0 :a0 ) jk …rst-order stochastically dominates FV (a:a) jk if a0 > a. Besides, Pr(A i =
aj i ; k) is stochastically increasing in i since bidders enter independently with respective
probabilities. Thus FPi (tjk; i ) is decreasing in        i given k and n. The rest of the proof
follows from the same arguments of Lemma A1.

Proof of Lemma 3. Let Pi maxj2Anfig fmaxfVj ; rgg. Under Assumption S, F (pi jvi ; si ; s i ) =
F (pi js i ) and F (vi jsi ; s i ) = F (vi jsi ). Thus by the Law of Iterated Expectations,
                                                              Z v
                 ! i (si ; k; s i ) = u( k) Pr(Vi rjsi ) +        h(v; k; s i )dFVi jSi (vjsi )
                                                                           r
                                                                  Rv
where h(v; k; s i ) u(v r k)FPi jS i (rjs i )+                        r
                                                                          u(v       p   k)dFPi jS i (pjs i )+ u( k)[1
FPi jS i (vjs i )]. By the Leibniz Rule,
                                                    Z                 v
                        0
     @
    @v
       h(v; k; s i ) = u (v r k)FPi jS i (rjs i ) +                       u0 (v     p   k)dFPi jS i (pjs i ) > 0       (A11)
                                                                  r

Thus h is increasing in v for …xed s i and k. By the a¢ liation of Vi and Si for all i, the
distribution F (:jsi ) is stochastically increasing in si . Hence ! i (si ; k; s i ) is increasing in si
given k and s i . To show ! i (si ; k; s i ) is non-decreasing in s i given si and k, it su¢ ces to
show FPi jS i (pjs i ) is stochastically non-decreasing in s i for all p r, which would imply
h(v; k; s i ) is non-decreasing in s i for any v 2 [v; v]. Note for any t 2 [r; v], the event
“Pi t”can be written as

                              \j6=i f"Sj < sj " [ "Sj                     sj \ Vj       t"g
                                                 Q
Under Assumption S, Pr(Pi            tjs i ) =       j6=i [FSj (sj ) + Pr(Vj             t; Sj        sj )]. Also note for all
t and any s0j > sj ,

                 FSj (sj ) + Pr(Vj      t; Sj    sj )           FSj (s0j ) + Pr(Vj            t; Sj     s0j ).

Hence FPi jS i (tjs i ) is non-decreasing in s         i   for all t 2 [r; v].


Lemma A3 Under Assumption S, for any k such that s < sk < s, FV (tjSi sk ) is identi…ed
for t  r from the distribution of W conditional on any k and any number of entrants a
(with a 2).

Proof of Lemma A3. By de…nition, for any t r, Pr(W             tjk; A = a) is identical to the
distribution of the second-highest order statistic among a independent draws from the same
conditional distribution FV (:jSi sk ). That is, for any t r
                                   Pa            n
             Pr(W      tjk; a) =      m=a 1      m
                                                     FV (tjSi              sk )m [1     FV (tjSi        sk )]a   m



                                                           41
Thus for all a 2, there exists a one-to-one mapping a so that FV (tjSj sk ) = a (Pr(W
tjk; a)). (Note the mapping a does not depend on k as (Vi ; Si ) is assumed to be independent
from entry costs.) That Pr(i entersjk) > 0 for k implies Pr(A 2jk) > 0. Thus FV (tjSi sk )
is over-identi…ed for t   r, because the identi…cation arguments above can be applied for
any a such that Pr(A = ajk) > 0.


Lemma A4 Under Assumption S, FV (tjSi = sk ) is identi…ed for any t r and any k s.t.
s < sk < s, provided Pr(W tjk; a) and Pr(i entersjk) are observed in an open neighborhood
around k for some a 2.

Proof of Lemma A4. Given Lemma A3, FV (tjSi             sk ) is identi…ed for any such k using
distributions of entry decisions and transaction prices. Hence

                   Pr(Vi      t; Si       sk ) = FV jS (tjSi                  sk ) Pr(i entersjk)
                                                              1
                                                  =      a        (Pr(W         tjk; a)) Pr(i entersjk)                (A12)

is also identi…ed using any a such that Pr(A = ajk) > 0. We consider this joint distribution
as known for the rest of the proof. For any t       r, di¤erentiating this distribution with
respect to entry costs at k gives:

where we have used the independence between (Vi ; Si ) and entry costs. [Gentry and Li (2013)
used this derivative-based argument in their derivation for bounds on value distributions in
auction models with endogenous entry.] Hence

because FS (sk ) = Pr(i does not enterjk) in the pure-strategy BNE and dK   FS (sK ) = dK Pr(i
does not enterjK). The denominator is non-zero under the assumption of the proposition.
Hence FV (tjSi = sk ) is identi…ed for t r as long as Pr(W      tjk; a) and Pr(i entersjk) are
observed in an open neighborhood around k for some a 2.

Proof of Proposition 7.         Because (Vi ; Si ) are independent across bidders, the joint dis-
tribution of (Vi ; Pi ) conditional on A i = fj 6= i : Sj        sk g and Si = sk , evaluated at
(Pi ; Vi ) = (p; v), are factored as:

                                       FPi jA   i =fj6=i:Sj       sk g (p)FVi jSi =sk (v).                             (A13)

To identify , it su¢ ces to recover the two conditional distributions in (A13) at all p and
v r. Because (Vi ; Si ) are identically distributed across i, for any t r,

where N is the number of potential bidders (including i). The subscript i is suppressed to
simplify notations. By construction, FS (sk ) = Pr(i enters j k) is identi…ed. Let a denote
the realized number of entrants. First, under Assumption S, FV jS sk (t) is over-identi…ed
for t    r from the distribution of prices W under k and any a         2. (See Lemma A3 of
Appendix A for details.) Next, Lemma A4 in Appendix A shows that, under Assumption S,
FV (tjSi = sk ) is identi…ed for any t r provided that for some a 2, Pr(W         tj k; a) and
                                       0
Pr(i entersj k) are observed for all k in an open neighborhood around k. This is because
                                                                           @
the independence between private   h information and ientry costs implies @K Pr(Vi     t and i
entersjK)jK=k = FV (tjS = sk ) dFS sk~ =dKjK=k . Thus the conditional distributions in
(A13), as well as (sk ), are identi…ed.



B      Limiting Distribution of Test Statistic

   First o¤, we show E[(Vi Pi )+ jA i = a] = r FV (v)a [1 FV (v)]dv under Assumption
                                                                                  Rv
R. With a slight abuse of notation, for any generic integrable function , we use     (s)ds
    R                                                         Rv                  R
and r (s)ds as shorthands for the improper integrals limv"v       (s)ds and limv#r v (s)ds
respectively. By de…nition, E[(Vi Pi )+ jA i = a] is
       E[1fPi < vg(Vi      Pi )+ jA   i   = a] + E[1fPi = vg 0jA             i    = a]

where q0    1 limv"v FV (v) and (p)      (v p)q0 + p (v p)dFV (v). Thus we can write
E[(Vi Pi )+ jA i = a] as:
     Z v              Z v                                    Z v

Using integration by parts, the …rst term on the R.H.S. of (B15) is

By an application of the Bounded Covergence Theorem and integration by parts, the second

The …rst term on the R.H.S. of (B17) is 0 while the second equals r (v r)dFV (v) FPi ja (r).
By another application of the Bounded Convergence Theorem, the third term of (B17) is:

Substituting (B16)-(B18) into (B15), we get:
                                                                                Z       v

                                                                                    r
    We now introduce some notations used for deriving the limiting distribution of the test
statistic in Section 4.2. Let P0 denote the true probability measure for (W; A) in data-
generating process. Let PT denote the corresponding empirical measure. For any signed
                             R
measure Q, let Qf               f dQ (e.g. P0 1fW        sg = Pr(W     s)). Let FW jm denote the
distribution of W given A = m, and FW~ jm denote fFW jm (t) : t 2 [r; v)g. Let F^W~ jm;T denote
estimators for FW~ jm as de…ned in Section 4.2. Let ^ T;m         PT 1fA = mg, ^ T     (^ T;m )N
                                                                                               m=0

and       ( m )m=0 where m P0 1fA = mg. By de…nition, FW jm (s) Pr(W sjA = m) =

    Recall the distribution FW;A in the data-generating process (DGP) takes the form of a
                                   R
mixture distribution: FW;A = FW;Ajk dFK . First o¤, we characterize in Lemma B5 below the
joint asymptotic property of three building blocks of our test statistic: F^W~ jm;T for 2 m
               P       ~ t . Introduction of some notations in the characterization are in order.

for any s < v on [r; v). Let [N 0 ; N ]0 denote a multivariate normal random vector in RN +1 ,

its covariance with N ;a is E[1fA i = agK]               a K . Covariance between the processes

Proof of Lemma B5..          De…ne three classes of functions with domain over the support of
(W; A):

                 FW         f1fW       sg: s 2 [r; v)g;
                 FA         f1fA = mg : 0         m        N g; and

Let FW;A ffW ^ fA : fW 2 FW ; fA 2 FA g f1fW s, A = mg: s 2 [r; v), 0 m N g
denote a class formed by taking the pair-wise in…mum of FW and FA . Note FW and FA are
both Donsker Classes. By Theorem 2.10.6 in van der Vaart and Wellner (1996), both F
and FW;A are Donsker classes, and consequently F F W;A [ F is Donsker. For a set S, let
B(S) denote the space of bounded, real-valued functions with domain S, equipped with the
sup-norm. By Theorem 2.1 (and the semi-metric de…ned on page 16) in Kosorok (2008), the
                        p
empirical process GT      T (PT P0 ) indexed by F converges weakly to a tight zero-mean
Gaussian Process G in B(F), with covariance P0 f f 0 P0 f P0 f 0 for any f; f 0 2 F.

     It is worth noting that uncorrelation in (ii) holds for all a; m including m = a       1; a; a + 1. This is due
to the assumption that (error in K) ~ is orthogonal to (W; A).

Method (Theorem 2.8 in Kosorok (2008)) applies to characterize the weak convergence in
(B19). The covariance function is derived by applying a …nite-dimensional, multivariate
delta method to the limiting process evaluated at …nite sets of elements from the index
set [r; v) f2; :; N g f0; :; N 1g. Mutual independence between the zero-mean Gaussian
processes fFW~ ;m gN
                   m=2 and their joint independence from N follow from an application of the
delta method to random vectors. Covariance between N and Gaussian processes fFW~ ;m gN    m=2
and N also follows from an application of the multivariate delta method to F^W~ jm;T (s); ^T;a
and sample mean of K   ~ t for any s; m; a.

Recall S[r;v) denotes the set of positive, bounded and integrable Cadlag functions over [r; v).
Equipped with a sup-norm, S[r;v) is normed linear spaces with a non-degenerate interior.
Proof of Proposition 3.. It follows from Lemma 20.10 in van der Vaart (1998) that the

                                                   p
Proof of Lemma C7.. By Proposition 3, T (^T                   0 ) converges weakly to a zero-mean
normal distribution whose variance depends on F0 . Across auctions in data, (Wt ; At ; K      ~ t ) are
i.i.d. draws from F0 , and by the Uniform Law of Large Numbers, the empirical distribution
              ~ t ) converges in probability to its population counterpart uniformly over the joint
of (Wt ; At ; K
support. Also by Proposition 3, for any permissible joint distribution of (W; A; K)        ~ in data-
                                                       p
generating process, the limiting distribution of T (^T              0 ) is continuous over R. Next,
we will show that for any sequence of permissible distributions HT that converge to H0 in
                                                                  p
sup-norm as T ! +1, the …nite sample distribution of T (^T                     0 ) under the DGP FT
(denoted by GT (:; HT )) converges to G1 (:; H0 ) pointwise on the real line. Note for any s 2 R
and pair of permissible distributions H1 ; H2 ,

  jGT (s; H1 )   G1 (s; H2 )j     jGT (s; H1 )   G1 (s; H1 )j + jG1 (s; H1 )   G1 (s; H2 )j .   (C22)

For any s, the …rst term on the right-hand side of (C22) converges to 0 as T ! +1
by weak convergence of the test statistic under H1 . Let k:k1 denote the sup norm. It
follows from the continuity of the limiting distribution in Proposition 3 that, for any s 2 R
and " > 0, there exists > 0 (possibly depending on s; ") such that for any H1 ; H2 with

                                                  48
kH1 H2 k1        , the second term is smaller than " for T large enough. Now consider any HT
converging to H0 in sup-norm as T ! +1. The observation above implies that for any " > 0,
jGT (s; HT ) G1 (s; H0 )j    " for T large enough (or equivalently for kHT H0 k1 small
enough). The lemma then follows from Beran and Ducharme (1991) (or Theorem 2.1 in
Horowitz (2000)).

     To simplify notations, we suppress dependence of N on joint distribution of (W; A; K)     ~
                                                                      p
in DGP for the rest of the proof. Since the limiting distribution of T (^T       0 ) is absolutely
continuous with positive densities almost surely over R, an immediate corollary of the pre-
ceding lemmas is that our bootstrap estimator c^1 =2;T converges in probability to the actual
1       =2 quantile of the limiting distribution (c1 =2 ). Such consistency holds regardless of
bidders’risk attitudes in DGP.
                                                                           p
