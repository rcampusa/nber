                                             ABSTRACT

How much are people willing to forego to be honest, to follow the rules? When people do break the
rules, what can standard data sources tell us about their behavior? Standard economic models of crime
typically assume that individuals are indifferent to dishonesty, so that they will cheat or lie as long
as the expected pecuniary benefits exceed the expected costs of being caught and punished. We investigate
this presumption by studying the response to a change in tax reporting rules that made it much more
difficult for taxpayers to evade taxes by inappropriately claiming additional dependents. The policy
reform induced a substantial reduction in the number of dependents claimed, which indicates that many
filers had been cheating before the reform. Yet, the number of filers who availed themselves of this
evasion opportunity is dwarfed by the number of filers who passed up substantial tax savings by not
claiming extra dependents. By declining the opportunity to cheat, these taxpayers reveal information
about their willingness to pay to be honest. We present a novel method for inferring the characteristics
of taxpayers in the absence of audit data. Our analysis suggests both that this willingness to pay to
be honest is large on average and that it varies significantly across the population of taxpayers.

1    Introduction

The rational actor model that forms the basis for microeconomics has been fruitfully extended to

many realms of human behavior, including criminal activity. The benchmark model of crime goes

back to Becker (1968), which posits that an individual will commit a crime when the expected

benefits exceed the expected costs. This same framework has been used to study the decision to

evade taxation, beginning with the seminal contribution of Allingham and Sandmo (1972). These

models assume that individuals face no psychological cost of breaking the law – they bear no

intrinsic cost for being dishonest, but instead make a purely pecuniary calculation.

    In the area of tax compliance, existing research has demonstrated a strong negative correlation

between evasion and the probability of being caught, which broadly supports a model of rational

calculation without refuting the possibility of a preference for honesty. For example, audit data

show that sources of income that are not subject to third-party reporting are far more likely to

be underreported (Klepper and Nagin 1989), to the extent that less than half of all income from

self employment is claimed (Slemrod 2007). Recent research has pushed this claim further. Based

on a randomized audit experiment, Kleven, Knudsen, Kreiner, Pederson and Saez (2010) conclude

that “overall tax evasion is low, not because taxpayers are unwilling to cheat, but because they are

unable to cheat successfully due to the widespread use of third-party reporting” (p. 3).

    Yet, other authors have concluded that the observed levels of tax compliance are too high to

be explained by the standard Allingham and Sandmo (1972) framework, arguing that some desire

to be honest or to comply with social norms must be important (Andreoni, Erard and Feinstein

1998). Directly asking taxpayers does not clarify their motivations for compliance. In 2010, 87%

of taxpayers surveyed stated that it is not acceptable to cheat at all, and 97% agreed with the

statement that “It is every American’s civic duty to pay their fair share of taxes.” But, 64% said

that fear of audit was important in inducing them to pay their taxes honestly (Internal Revenue

Service Oversight Board 2011). This paper contributes to the literature on tax compliance by using

a novel strategy for detecting tax evasion and quantifying the willingness to pay to be honest, based

on an examination of taxpayer response to a change in enforcement.

    In 1987, millions of children suddenly “went missing” from the rolls of federal income tax

returns. The reason was a change in reporting requirements, which eliminated an important avenue


                                                 2
for evasion. To claim a dependent prior to 1987, a filer needed only to list the dependent’s first

name on his tax return. Since the Internal Revenue Service had no easy way to verify that these

dependents existed or to ensure that they were not listed on multiple returns, the system may

have tempted filers to either invent dependents or to claim ineligible individuals as dependents.

Below, we show that many filers availed themselves of this opportunity and claimed fictitious or

otherwise ineligible dependents. On the other hand, we estimate that a majority of taxpayers in

our sample were unwilling to cheat to gain around $500 in 2010 dollars, equivalent to roughly 1% of

the mean after-tax income and 7% of the mean taxes owed in 1986. We interpret this as evidence

that many taxpayers have a substantial taste for honesty, and that an unwillingness to cheat is thus

an important component of the economics of tax evasion, and perhaps crime more generally. We

also demonstrate how the response to the enforcement change can be used to uncover differences

in characteristics across cheaters and honest taxpayers without relying on audit data. Our findings

suggest that cheaters and honest taxpayers are fairly similar in many observable characteristics,

including the tax value of cheating.1

       Our analysis is performed on a panel of tax return data that spans the Tax Reform Act of 1986

(TRA86), which included the reporting change. As of 1987, filers were newly required to report

a Social Security Number (SSN) for all dependents over the age of 5. Given this information, it

was relatively easy for the IRS to verify the existence of dependents and to check that they were

not listed on multiple returns, and consequently the probability of cheating without detection fell

precipitously. The response to this change in reporting rules was pronounced. Our data show

that the number of dependents claimed in 1987 fell by 5.5%, which is equivalent to 4.2 “missing

children”.

       We are not the first to document this decline in the number of dependents claimed. An IRS

report detailed the motivation for the policy change and provided estimates of the change in the

number of dependents claimed in response to the reform (Szilagyi 1990). Moreover, the episode is

cited in two popular public finance texts (Slemrod and Bakija 2008; Gruber 2009) and a mainstream

book on economics (Levitt and Dubner 2005). But, while the basic facts of this event are known,
   1
     A number of studies using audit data have tested for differences in evasion across income categories, gender and
tax rates (Clotfelter 1983; Feinstein 1991; Christian 1994). These articles do not, however, indicate whether these
evasion differences are due to different opportunities to evade or different propensities conditional on opportunity.
Our case study has the advantage of being an opportunity that is readily available to all taxpayers, which allows us
to isolate evasion predilection.


                                                         3
no prior work has studied the behavioral responses in detail, nor has any other research used this

incident to quantify evasion, measure the willingness to pay to be honest, or estimate the differences

in characteristics between honest taxpayers and cheaters, as we do here.

       Early waves of empirical research on tax evasion were based on audit data, survey data and

laboratory experiments, each of which has strengths and weaknesses.2 Our work relates more

closely to a newer stream of research that uncovers indirect evidence of evasion, which Slemrod

and Weber (Forthcoming) call “traces of evasion.” An early example of this strategy is Pissarides

and Weber (1989), which compares national income product account and reported taxable income

to infer underreporting. Feldman and Slemrod (2007) infer evasion by comparing the marginal

increase in charitable donations with respect to sources of income subject to different third-party

reporting requirements. Our analysis differs from these by leveraging a natural experiment from a

change in enforcement policy to uncover facts about evasion without the benefit of audit data.3

       Researchers within and outside of economics have incorporated a variety of social factors into

models of compliance. Tyler (1990) argues that citizens obey the law out of a sense of allegiance

to a government they view as a legitimate authority. Smith (1992) applies this idea to the case of

tax filing, documenting with survey evidence that self-reported voluntary compliance is positively

correlated with viewing the tax authority as fair and responsive. Cowell (1992) considers a general

model of evasion where the equity of the tax system influences preferences without specifying a

functional form, and Bordignon (1993) models an environment in which social concerns create a

constraint on the amount of evasion available. Related implications have been tested in laboratory

experiments. There is evidence that evasion responds to cues about fairness (Spicer and Becker

1980) and to the uses of revenue (Becker, Büchner and Sleeking 1987).

       The models most closely related to our work incorporate honesty directly. Block and Heineke

(1975) introduce a “preference for honesty” into a labor supply model, allowing the disutility of work

to differ for activities that are legal versus illegal. Erard and Feinstein (1994) introduce compliance

behavior by assuming that some fraction of consumers will never cheat. Gordon (1989), which
   2
     For a thorough discussion and critique of the literature see Andreoni et al. (1998) and Slemrod (2007). Of
particular interest to our work is the finding from laboratory studies that some people comply with the tax authority,
even when the probability of audit is known to be zero, which implies a desire to be honest (Baldry 1987; Alm,
McClelland and Schulze 1992)
   3
     Our approach also has an affinity with non-income-tax studies that uncover cheating indirectly, such as Jacob
and Levitt (2003), Fisman and Wei (2004), and Oliva (2010).

is perhaps most similar to our model, adds a psychic cost to the Allingham and Sandmo (1972)

framework where the consumer faces a continuous evasion choice. Individuals with the highest

psychic costs rarely evade, but, assuming decreasing absolute risk aversion, are predicted to evade

more when the tax rate increases. Our model is distinct from existing work in analyzing a discrete

choice to cheat (by claiming a dependent) and in providing a direct parameterization that we take

to data in order to quantify the willingness to pay to be honest.

    Our analysis proceeds as follows. In section 2, we provide additional details about the change

in reporting policy and the other tax law modifications in TRA86 relevant to our analysis. In

section 3 we describe our data, which is a panel of tax returns spanning the reform. In section 4 we

document the decline in the number of dependents claimed in 1987. We argue that the substantial

decline cannot be accounted for by other changes in dependent rules that were part of TRA86.

    In section 5 we flip to the other side of the coin and document the tax savings foregone by the

majority of filers who did not claim additional dependents and were therefore unaffected by the

policy reform. We show that average tax savings given up by honest taxpayers from claiming one

inappropriate dependent would have been roughly $250 in 1986 dollars on average, which equates

to $500 in 2010 dollars, or 1% of after-tax income and 7% of the average total tax paid. We show

that accounting for risk preferences has a limited impact on these magnitudes.

    In section 6 we impute the average characteristics of cheaters, as compared to groups of honest

taxpayers, and conclude that they look different on several dimensions, including filer status and

claiming of the Child Care Credit. The average cheater does not, however, appear to have a higher

monetary gain from cheating than the average honest taxpayer. This suggests that the variation in

the decision to cheat is not driven primarily by the tax savings at stake, but instead by variation

in the willingness to pay to be honest. We interpret this as a second piece of evidence in support of

the notion that a taste for honesty is quantitatively important for the analysis of evasion. Section

7 concludes.



2    The introduction of Social Security information on tax returns

Prior to 1987, a tax filer needed to include only the first names of any dependent children he wished

to claim on his return. In contrast, starting in 1987, the 1040 required the full name and SSN of all


                                                 5

       Note: The figure shows portions from the 1040 form in 1986 and 1987. The 1986 1040 required only
       the first names of dependents, whereas the 1987 required the full name, birth date and Social Security
       Number for all children over age 5.



children over age 5. The relevant portions of the 1040 from 1986 and 1987 are shown in figure 1.

The SSN requirement was extended to all dependents age 2 and older beginning in tax year 1989,

to all dependents at least one year old in 1991, and finally to all dependents in 1995.4 The IRS

took this step out of concerns that there was significant misreporting. Regular audits had revealed

that a significant fraction of audited tax returns involved adjustments for personal exemptions that

were disallowed (Szilagyi 1990). The gradual reduction in ages affected by the SSN requirement

was designed to give families time to obtain Social Security Numbers for children.5

       While the reporting requirement for claiming a dependent exemption changed in 1986, the
   4
     In the early years of the dependent SSN requirement, the IRS did little verification of this new information. Only
3 percent of dependent SSNs were computer matched to uncover dual claiming of dependents or violations of the age
and income tests (General Accounting Office 1993).
   5
     Today more than 90% of SSNs issued to children are issued at the time of birth (GAO 2005). This is made
possible through the Enumeration at Birth program, launched in 1989. This partnership between the Social Security
Administration and state vital statistics agencies allows parents to request an SSN for their child as part of the birth
certificate registration process.

underlying definition of a dependent did not change. Five tests must be met in order for a taxpayer

to claim another individual as a dependent. The dependent must be a U.S. citizen or a resident of

the U.S., Canada, or Mexico. The dependent cannot file a joint return. The dependent’s income

cannot exceed the personal exemption amount, with exceptions made for a taxpayer’s own child

under the age of 19 or under the age of 24 if a full-time student. The dependent must either live

with or be related to the taxpayer claiming her. Finally, more than half of the dependent’s support

must be provided by the taxpayer claiming her. None of these tests changed between 1986 and

1987. Analysis by the General Accounting Office (1993) shows that, with the SSN requirement in

place, violations of the support test are the most common reason for a dependent exemption to be

disallowed.6

    The Tax Reform Act of 1986 did make changes that may have influenced the dependent status

of some individuals. Prior to the reform, a child who was claimed as a dependent by his parents but

who also filed his own return could claim a personal exemption for himself. This “double-dipping”

was eliminated by TRA86. Beginning in 1987, dependents were not permitted to claim a personal

exemption and in most cases could claim only a limited standard deduction. This may have created

some negotiation between parents and children about how long to remain a dependent.7 The value

to parents of claiming an additional exemption also changed in 1986. The nominal value of a

personal exemption rose from $1080 to $1900 while marginal tax rates fell for most taxpayers. We

return to these changes below when interpreting our data.



3     Tax return panel data

We use data from the University of Michigan tax panel, compiled by the Office of Tax Policy

Research (OTPR). The starting point for this dataset is the annual cross-sections of tax return

data released by the Statistics of Income (SOI) division of the IRS. These cross-sections report
    6
      Recent research on dependent overclaiming focuses on the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). McCubbin (2000)
describes data from a 1994 audit of randomly selected EITC claimants. Approximately 26% of EITC dollars claimed
were overturned upon audit, and about 70% of these overclaims involved an error in claiming an EITC-qualifying
child. McCubbin further finds that misclaiming a child is sensitive to the size of the associated benefit. She estimates
that a $100 increase in the tax savings from claiming a child increases the probability of erroneously claiming an
EITC-qualifying child from a mean of 8% to 8.4%. Liebman (2000) estimates the extent of EITC misclaiming by
matching March 1991 CPS respondents to 1990 tax return data. At the time, the EITC was exclusively available to
filers with children. Liebman estimates that 11 to 13% of 1990 EITC recipients did not have a child in their CPS
household as of March 1991, and 10% did not have a child in the household one year earlier.

      See Whittington and Peters (1996) for evidence that the tax effect on this decision is small.

information from most lines of the tax return and from many supporting schedules. There is

information on the total number of exemptions (including extra exemptions for filers who are blind

or over age 65), the number of exemptions for dependent children (reported separately for children

living at home and children living away from home), and the number of exemptions for dependents

other than children. To protect taxpayer confidentiality, income amounts are blurred and the

number of exemptions is topcoded in some cases.8 The panel links the tax returns of individuals

who appear in multiple SOI cross-sections from 1979 to 1990.

        Selection into the panel is based on the last four digits of the primary filer’s SSN. The number

of four-digit combinations included in the panel changed over time, leading to wide variation in

the number of tax returns included in different years. Approximately 45,000 returns are included

in the years with the most widespread coverage, while slightly over 9,000 returns are included in

tax years 1982, 1984, and 1986. The number of tax filing units present in all 12 years of the panel

is 4,982, and the number present in both 1986 and 1987 is 9,099. A change in marital status may

cause an individual to be dropped from the panel, as only the SSN of the primary filer is used

in linking returns across years. If an individual has been filing as a single person, marries, and

is subsequently listed as the secondary filer, returns from before and after her marriage will not

be linked. On the other hand, if she is listed as the primary filer after marriage her returns will

be linked. Similarly, if a married couple divorces only the primary filer will be tracked over the

remainder of the panel. Because men are more likely to be listed as primary filers, men have lower

rates of attrition from the tax panel. In contrast to other longitudinal datasets, there is no reason

to expect movers to exit from the panel, unless they stop filing tax returns. The taxpayer’s address

is not used in linking cross-sectional files.



4        Many people cheated on their tax returns

Our tax panel data allow us to look at the number of filers who lose net dependents each year by

comparing the number of dependents in one year against the number claimed the following year.

If many filers were cheating up until 1986, then we would expect to see a large number of filers
    8
    For returns with adjusted gross income (AGI) greater than $200,000, the number of exemptions for children living
at home is topcoded at 3. This topcoding is unlikely to affect our results, as only 7 filing units observed in both 1986
and 1987 are affected. The number of filing units affected in any other pair of years over which dependent loss is
calculated is never greater than 22.

           Note: Estimates are the authors’ calculations from the OTPR tax panel. The number of
           dependent exemptions claimed is the sum of exemptions for children living at home, children
           living away from home, parents, and other dependents. In computing the share of returns
           losing dependents in year t, the denominator is the set of filing units observed in both t and
           t − 1 and claiming a positive number of dependent exemptions in t − 1. In computing the
           share of returns gaining dependents in year t, the denominator is all filing units observed in
           both t and t − 1.


losing dependents in 1987. Figure 2 plots the percentage of filers who lost at least one dependent

in each year of our panel, conditional on claiming a dependent in the previous year. There is a

dramatic spike in 1987, when 20.3% of filers lose a dependent, compared to an average of 14.0% in

all other years.9 The number of “excess” dependent-losing filers in 1987 is equal to 2.5% of the filing

population. Figure 2 also plots the fraction of filers who gain at least one dependent in each year,

which shows no commensurate change between 1986 and 1987. Some cheaters may have chosen to

claim more than one fictitious dependent. The percentage of filers losing multiple dependents is
   9
    There are other cases in which requiring a taxpayer to provide a straightforward piece of supporting evidence has
generated a large change in reporting. Fack and Landais (2011) show that when France first required that receipts
be submitted with the tax return for any charitable contributions claimed, reported charitable contributions fell by
75%.

4.4% in 1987, substantially greater than the 2.2% to 2.9% losing multiple dependents in any other

year of the panel. We view this as further evidence of cheating, but throughout the paper we focus

on the decision to claim a marginal extra dependent.

   We can also compare the number of child dependents claimed on tax returns to the number

of children in the population from Census estimates. Figure 3 shows the ratio of the number of

child dependent exemptions claimed (for children living at home and children living away from

home) to the number of children under age 19 and to the number of children under age 24. Most

people under age 19 are eligible to be claimed as dependents, but we expect this ratio to be less

than one due to non-filing. Many people between ages 19 and 23 who are full-time students will

also be eligible to be claimed as a dependent. As is evident in the figure, the relationship between

the number of child dependents and the number of children in the population was quite steady


                                                     10
until 1987, at which time there was a significant fall in the number of dependents that does not

correspond to any change in the underlying population. This pattern is evident both in the OTPR

panel data (solid lines) and in aggregate child dependent counts (dashed lines).10 Despite the small

size of the OTPR panel, the values we impute from it are a close match to values computed from

aggregate data.

    A simple estimate of the number of inappropriate dependent claims can be derived under the

assumption that filers lost more dependents in 1987 than in other years solely because many people

were cheating prior to the reform, but stopped cheating in 1987. Under that assumption, the

“extra” dependent losses observed in the panel between 1986 and 1987 correspond to 4.2 million

improperly claimed dependents, or 5.5% of all dependents claimed in 1986.11 These estimates are

broadly similar to the conclusion reached by an IRS research report, which concluded that the

reform lowered the number of dependents claimed by around 7 million, or 9% (Szilagyi 1990).

Szilagyi (1990) also reports that the 1987 policy change reversed a long-run trend in the number of

dependent exemptions that were determined to be erroneous in the Tax Compliance Management

Program data, which shows a rise from 4.3% of dependent exemptions being erroneous in 1965 to

11.2% in 1979.


4.1    Could the change in dependents be due to those lacking SSNs?

The policy reform in 1987 required that filers record the Social Security Number of dependents

to be claimed, but not all people have a Social Security Number. Could the spike in dependent

reductions be due to many dependents not having an SSN, and thus being left off of the return?

    Several factors weigh against this explanation. First, in 1987, children under the age of 5,

who were the most likely not to have an SSN, were exempted from the requirement. Second, we

suspect that anyone who stood to gain from having a dependent exemption would have acquired

an SSN for the relevant dependent upon learning of the requirement. Data from the Social Security

Administration support this view, showing a surge in SSN applications shortly after the policy

     TRA86 increased the value of the standard deduction and the personal exemption, which increased the income at
which a person is required to file a tax return. This change in the filing threshold could cause children of low-income
parents to disappear from tax data if their parents are no longer required to file. If we restrict our sample to filing
units with real income above the 1987 filing threshold, we estimate a loss of 3.8 million dependents between 1986 and
1987.

         Note: Each line in the figure corresponds to a different subsample from the OTPR panel, the
         set of filing units losing at least one dependent in a particular year. The bold line corresponds
         to the 721 filing units observed losing at least one dependent in 1987. We follow each sample

         later year.


change. The number of new SSNs issued had been between 5.4 and 6.7 million in each year from

1980 to 1986. This number increased to 11.6 million in 1987, 11.4 million in 1988, and then

gradually fell back to pre-87 levels by 1993.

   Finally, if many filers failed to claim true dependents in 1987 because of the SSN requirement,

we expect that they would have acquired an SSN for these dependents in subsequent years. This

would imply that people who lost a dependent in 1987 should have been especially likely to gain a

dependent in the subsequent several years, once they had acquired the SSN.

   To look for this pattern, figure 4 plots the fraction of filers gaining a dependent, conditional

on having lost a dependent in a particular year. The horizontal axis measures time relative to the

year in which a dependent was lost. Each line represents a different set of filers, those losing a

dependent in a given year of the sample. The bold line shows filers who lost dependents in 1987.


                                                                  12
Overall, the data show considerable churning. Relative to year zero (when a filer lost a dependent),

filers are relatively likely to have gained a dependent immediately before or after that loss. This

results in part from short-lived marriages in which one member of the couple has children and from

confusion about who can claim a dependent following a divorce. If many filers lost a dependent in

1987 because of missing SSNs, we would have expected a large increase in dependent gains for those

filers in subsequent years, relative to the gain experienced by filers who lost dependents in non-

reform years. This is not the case; 1987 appears typical. If anything, gains are low immediately after

1987 losses, which is consistent with cheaters being less likely than legitimate losers of dependents

to regain the dependent in the subsequent year.12


4.2      Could the change in dependents be due to other changes in TRA86?

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 involved many other tax changes. Could any of these be the source of

a large reduction in dependents? The most obvious feature of TRA86 relevant here is a change in

the tax treatment of dependent filers. Prior to 1986, a child who filed his own return could claim a

personal exemption on his return and still be claimed as a dependent by his parents. After 1987,

this was not allowed, so children and parents had to choose whether the child would file with zero

exemptions, and allow the parents to claim the exemption, or vice versa. If many families chose to

allow income-earning children, who qualified as dependents, to claim themselves instead of claiming

them as dependents on the parents’ return, then this could generate a one-time drop in dependents

claimed in 1987.

       The number of such cases is likely to be small, however, because the exemption would have

rarely been worth more in tax savings to children than to parents. The value of the exemption

depends entirely on the marginal tax rate. Thus, in short, for it to be tax-minimizing for a child

to claim herself, that child would need to earn sufficiently more money than her parents so as to

be in a higher tax bracket, and yet still live in her parents’ home and obtain more than 50% of her

financial support from her parents, so as to qualify as a dependent.

       Such arrangements are rare, as is shown in table 1, which uses March Current Population Survey
  12
    Aggregate data on total annual dependent counts are consistent with the view that most of the dependents lost
in 1987 did not reappear in later years. The total number of dependents claimed divided by the total number of
returns filed had been above 0.75 in years 1980-1985, fell from 0.75 in 1986 to 0.67 in 1987, and hovered between 0.66
and 0.69 over the next ten years. We thank Brian Erard for pointing us toward this evidence.

     Data are from the March 1987 CPS, available via IPUMS. The sample is restricted to children of household
     heads, and to those either between the ages of 15 and 18 or between the ages of 19 and 23 and enrolled
     in school full-time.



(CPS) data from 1987. We constructed a sample of children, between the ages of 15 and 23, living

with one or both parents. The lower age cutoff reflects the fact that only individuals aged 15 or

older report income information in the CPS. All children between ages 15 and 18 are included,

while children between ages 19 and 23 are included only if they are full-time students. Table 1

shows that 66.2% of these potential dependents had some form of income, and 54.7% had wage

income. Not surprisingly, the median ratio of a child’s income to his parents’ income is 0.015. Only

2.8% of children had income equal to 75% of their parents’ income, and just 2% had income equal

to or greater than their parents’.

   In sum, given the low probability that it would have been tax-minimizing for children to claim

themselves, we expect that this aspect of the TRA86 reform is unlikely to explain an important

fraction of the drop in dependents. The vast majority of the missing dependents were likely from

filers who had been cheating prior to the enforcement reform.

5         Many other people paid to be honest

Our data suggest that around 2.5% of taxpayers were cheating by improperly claiming dependents

in 1986. Conversely, this means that 97.5% were not cheating in this way. This is perhaps the more

surprising statistic, given the substantial amount of income that could have been taken at relatively

low risk by claiming fraudulent dependents. Importantly, the 97.5% of tax payers who did not avail

themselves of this opportunity to cheat implicitly demonstrated that they would rather give up

several hundred dollars in income than cheat the government. Overall, we think this is striking

evidence of a broad willingness to pay to be honest across the taxpayer base.

         How much did honest taxpayers forgo? Ideally, to answer this question we would like to eliminate

the tax cheaters from the sample and tabulate the distribution of tax savings from claiming an extra

dependent that would have been enjoyed by the honest taxpayers had they cheated. Unfortunately,

there is no way to directly identify the cheaters in the data. We can, however, identify groups

of filers who were almost certainly honest. One such group is the set of filers who did not lose a

dependent between 1986 and 1987, who make up 92% of filers. Below, in section 6, we show how

similar assumptions can be combined with estimates of the number of cheaters to infer differences

in average characteristics between cheaters and honest payers. Here, we focus just on the tax values

of honest payers.

         Table 2 shows the average 1986 tax savings associated with the marginal dependent for filers

who appear in the panel in both 1986 and 1987. These statistics are obtained by comparing

the after-tax income of filers given the actual number of dependents reported in the data against

their hypothetical after-tax income when they have one additional (or one fewer) dependent, as

calculated by TAXSIM.13 The after-tax income gain that would have accrued to families from

claiming one additional child represents the gain to be had from cheating. On average, those who

did not lose a dependent between 1986 and 1987 would have saved $275 on their 1986 taxes by

claiming an additional dependent. The mean savings is even higher, $291, for those who claimed

zero dependents. We view both of these groups as consisting of honest taxpayers. These savings

are in 1986 dollars; inflating by the CPI to 2010 dollars doubles the estimates to $547 and $579.14

         Are these tax savings, foregone in the interest of civic piety, large? To put the magnitudes in

context, table 2 also shows the average after-tax income and average income tax paid for filers across

these categories. The foregone gains from cheating, among those who did not lose a dependent in

response to the reform, amount to 1.3% of after-tax income, and 7.1% of taxes paid. These are

substantial amounts.

   Figure 5 shows the distribution of tax savings that would have accrued to filers if they had

claimed an additional dependent in 1986, for the sample of returns that did not lose dependents

between 1986 and 1987 (and are therefore assumed to be honest payers). Dependent exemptions

are non-refundable, so claiming an additional dependent has zero impact for low-liability filers.

Among those not losing a dependent between 1986 and 1987, 7.3% would have gained nothing.

The average tax savings from an additional dependent among the remaining filers was larger. In

this sample of presumably honest taxpayers, 69.4% stood to gain at least $200, and 18.0% stood

to gain at least $400 by claiming an extra dependent.

   In real dollars, the average foregone tax savings presented in table 2 are as large as the Child

Tax Credit when it was introduced in 1998, and they are 80% of the size of the maximum tax rebate

for single filers in the 2008 stimulus plan. Moreover, past research has found evidence of fertility

responses to benefits of this size. Whittington, Alm and Peters (1990) estimate that TRA86’s

increase in the personal exemption, from $1080 to $2000, raised the number of births by 7.53 per

thousand women at risk, though these estimates have been called into question (Crump, Goda and

Mumford 2011). Dickert-Conlin and Chandra (1999) estimate that a $500 benefit would increase

the fraction of mothers who give birth in the last week of December rather than the first week of

January, so as to accelerate tax savings, by 26.9%. The fact that existing research estimates that

real behavioral responses are induced by tax savings of this magnitude suggests that these savings

are “large” in some behavioral sense. This affirms our claim that foregoing these benefits due to a

taste for honesty is a phenomenon of important magnitude.

5.1   Might audit risk explain a low prevalence of cheating?

Evading taxes is risky. The average tax benefits from claiming an extra dependent are, ex ante,

eroded by the possibility of detection and subsequent fines. To determine how much this audit

risk lowers the benefits of cheating, we adapt the tax evasion model of Allingham and Sandmo

(1972). Allingham and Sandmo (1972) model a risk averse taxpayer making a decision about what

fraction of his tax bill to evade in order to maximize expected utility in a static setting. We modify

this structure in two ways. First, we add a non-pecuniary cost of cheating, which allows for the

possibility that taxpayers have a distaste for lying to the government (equivalently, a willingness to

pay to be honest). Second, rather than model a continuous choice about how much to evade as in

Gordon (1989), we model a discrete evasion decision, meant to mimic the decision about claiming

an incremental fictitious dependent. This setup is useful in that it formalizes our parameter of

interest, the willingness to pay to be honest, in an optimizing framework.

   We assume that the filer’s utility function exhibits constant relative risk aversion, with utility

where z is net income (assumed to be equivalent to consumption) and γ is the coefficient of relative

risk aversion. Filers choose whether to claim the appropriate number of dependents, in which

case they receive their true after-tax income Y with certainty. Alternatively, filers may choose to

claim an additional, inappropriate dependent, which may reduce their taxes paid but also triggers

a psychological cost of cheating, measured in dollars. If a cheating filer is caught he incurs an

additional monetary penalty. For filer i, the payoffs are written as:

where p is the probability of audit, ∆Ti is the tax savings from cheating, φ is the penalty for

cheating (expressed as a fraction of the amount evaded), and θ is the monetized psychological cost

of cheating.15 We assume that all audits are successful in detecting any improper dependent claims.

       A filer will choose to cheat if the expected payoff to cheating exceeds the expected payoff to

honesty, accounting for risk aversion and the distaste for deceit. Thus, filers cheat if and only if

                                 (Yi + ∆Ti − θi )1−γ    (Yi − φ∆Ti − θi )1−γ  Y 1−γ

This formula does not yield a closed form solution for θ, but the left-hand side is monotonically

decreasing in θ so that, all else equal, a filer will cheat so long as θ is below some critical threshold,

which we will label G. Gi is the psychological cost that would make filer i indifferent between

cheating and not cheating, defined implicitly as:

                                (Yi + ∆Ti − Gi )1−γ    (Yi − φ∆Ti − Gi )1−γ  Y 1−γ
                      (1 − p)                       +p                      = i    .                               (5)
                                       1−γ                    1−γ            1−γ

A tax filer will cheat by claiming an extra dependent if and only if θi ≤ Gi . This critical value

Gi is an implicit function of the other parameters, including income, taxes saved by cheating, the

penalty, risk aversion and the probability of audit. To determine how much risk assessment erodes

the nominal value of cheating, we can calculate G, given parameter values for the other variables,

and compare G to ∆T . If the two are similar, it means that risk has little impact on the nominal

value of cheating – you would have to take away a large amount of money for sure in order to make

the decision-maker indifferent between cheating and not.

       Table 3 presents results from this exercise. We start by calculating the value for someone with

the mean after-tax income in our 1986 sample of filers who did not lose a dependent in 1987, which is

$21,670. We model a tax savings equal to the mean in our sample for these filers, $275. The fraction

of tax returns audited in 1986 was around 2%, so we begin with p = .02 as our baseline probability

of detection.16 For risk aversion, we begin with γ = 2, which is close to estimates in Chetty (2006)

and Attanasio and Paiella (2011). There are two classes of penalties for underpayment of taxes,

described in sections 6662 and 6663 of the Internal Revenue Code. Any part of underpayment due

to “negligence or disregard of rules or regulations” is subject to a 20% penalty, while any part of
  15
     We have in mind an internal cost that is independent of whether cheating is discovered and publicized, in contrast
to a notion of shame felt only when any wrong-doing is made known to others.
  16
     Between 1977 and 1986, the audit rate gradually fell from 1.88% to 1% (Dubin, Graetz and Wilde 1990). Between
1988 and 1995, the audit rate ranged between values of 0.92% and 1.67% (General Accounting Office 1996).

                    make the taxpayer indifferent between cheating and not if G = 0, p∗ .



underpayment attributable to fraud is subject to a 75% penalty. If taxpayers can claim plausible

confusion about their mispayment, they will pay the 20% rate, which applies to the vast majority

of cases. We use this as our baseline, so φ = .2. Throughout this exercise, we assume filers are not

cheating in any way other than misclaiming a dependent.

   The first row of table 3 shows our baseline estimates. An individual who could save $275 in

taxes by improperly claiming a dependent would be willing to do so as long as his psychological cost

of cheating is below $268. This suggests that, for our baseline parameters, risk is not an important

explanation for why so many taxpayers failed to cheat. Another way to see this is to calculate the

probability of audit that would make a filer indifferent between cheating and not cheating, which we

label as p∗ , given the other parameters and assuming G = 0. For our baseline case, that break-even

probability is an extremely high 83%.

   For robustness, we vary these parameters, starting with the risk coefficient γ. The top panel



                                                       20
shows that, even at the higher IRS penalty rate, raising the risk coefficient 50-fold has a negligible

impact on the value of cheating.17 The middle panel of table 3 shows what happens when we lower

the starting income value to one-half of the mean, which is the 34th percentile of our non-cheating

1986 sample, or one-tenth of the mean, which is the 6th percentile. Even at higher values of risk

aversion and with the higher IRS penalty and very low starting income, risk assessment only lowers

the value of cheating by about 13%.

    The only parameter that substantially changes the value of cheating is the probability of audit,

which is shown in the third panel. Obviously, if filers believe that the probability of audit is 100%,

then cheating would never be worth doing under any circumstances. If filers believe the probability

of being caught is 20%, instead of the generic 2%, then the payoff falls by around one-quarter, to

$208. If we assume the higher risk aversion, halve income, and raise the penalty rate, then this

estimate falls further to $160. Table 3 also shows what happens if the chance of getting caught is

40% or 60%. This further erodes the value, but note that cheating is still a net positive, except in

the very last scenario, which combines all of the most extreme assumptions.

    Might taxpayers believe the probability of audit is extremely high? Precise survey data are

not available, but some information about perceived audit probabilities is available from the 1987

Taxpayer Opinion Survey. When asked about the likelihood of their 1986 returns being audited,

35% of respondents said it was not very likely, 42% said it was highly unlikely, and another 15%

were not sure. Might taxpayers believe that conditional on claiming an additional dependent the

probability of audit is extremely high? The IRS does use a formula to determine audits (the

Discriminant Index Function), but it is highly unlikely that claiming a dependent can change the

formula by much. Even if all audits were confined to returns with dependents, this would have a

modest impact on audit probabilities, relative to the differences needed to alter values qualitatively

in table 3. This is another advantage of our study – we analyze an evasion opportunity that is

especially unlikely to trigger audit.18
  17
     Estimates of the coefficient of relative risk aversion based on observed equity return premiums are in the neigh-
borhood of 50 (DeLong and Magin 2009).
  18
     It is plausible that frequent changes in the number of dependents claimed might trigger audit. If so, the decision
to falsely claim a dependent in one year might lock a taxpayer into making the same false claim for several years.
We have investigated whether the 1987 dependent losers have unusually high variance in the number of dependents
claimed across earlier years, as would be the case if cheaters fabricate dependents for just one or a few years at a
time. There is no evidence of differences in the variance of children claimed for likely cheaters and for likely honest
taxpayers.



                                                          21
    This framework formalizes the economic interpretation of our data from the 1986 reform. Those

people who did not cheat must have a θi ≥ Gi , where Gi will be roughly 97.5% of the estimated

tax savings in table 2 for our base case, and well over 90% for even the most extreme scenarios,

unless taxfilers believe their probability of being caught is much higher than the actual audit rates.

Based on this, we conclude that the taste for honesty is substantial, even accounting for risk.19


5.2    Might ignorance explain a low prevalence of cheating?

An alternative interpretation is that filers who did not claim fictitious dependents prior to the

reform were not doing so out of love of country, but instead because the opportunity to cheat had

simply never occurred to them. Unfortunately, there is no way to directly measure the number

of people who lacked the insight to cheat in this way. That said, this evasion opportunity is very

simple and easy to achieve. It is also especially transparent, as the box for dependents claimed is

right at the top of the 1040, as shown in figure 1. Moreover, if filers do not have a distaste for

cheating, then we would expect them to invest some time in searching for low-hanging evasion fruit,

like the dependent exemption. If filers were ignorant because they had no intention of cheating

and therefore did not look for easy ways to cheat, then this is a round about way of affirming our

hypothesis that they are willing to pay to be honest.

    We suspect that people who claimed dependents at some point in time, and particularly those

who had a change in the number of dependents, are aware of the tax value of dependents and

the limited information required to claim those dependents prior to the reform. For filers who

appear in all years of the tax panel, 66% had a dependent at some point in time, and 59% have a

change in the number of dependents claimed during the sample period.20 Narrowing in on a group

likely to be honest, filers who do not lose a dependent between 1986 and 1987, 34% are claiming a

dependent, and 32% had changed the number of dependents before 1986. This suggests that there

is a substantial opportunity to learn about the potential gains from claiming dependents and the

relative ease of doing so.
   19
      In principle, estimates of the distribution of the willingness to pay to be honest could be estimated by comparing
the amount of cheating at different tax values, given an additional assumption about the joint distribution of ∆T and
G. We pursued this empirical strategy but determined that the available tax panel data are of insufficient sample
size given the observed variation in tax values to produce meaningful estimates.
   20
      For filers who appear at least once in the panel, 44% had a dependent at some point and 27% have an observed
change in number of dependents claimed.



                                                          22
    In sum, there is no way to know whether any particular individual who failed to use the child

loophole to lower his tax bill did so out of ignorance. Moreover, it is impossible to know what

fraction of the honest taxpayers fall into that category. It seems likely, however, that filers with a

thirst for cheating would have come across this possibility, particularly if they had experience with

dependent exemptions, as most taxpayers do.



6     Who cheated and why?

6.1   Cheaters have differences in tax return characteristics

Who cheated? Are they different from honest payers on observable characteristics? To answer

such questions, we would ideally like to know who cheated in pre-reform years, and compare their

characteristics to honest taxpayers. Our panel data allow us to identify those who lost a dependent

in 1987, but there is no immediate way to distinguish those who lost a dependent for legitimate

reasons from cheaters who reacted to the reform.

    Fortunately, we can detect large differences in observable characteristics between cheaters and

non-cheaters by looking at changes in summary statistics across treatment years, where the number

of cheaters present in particular subsamples varies widely and measurably. We pursue three different

comparisons that use this basic approach. All three combine mild distributional assumptions with

estimates of the number of cheaters in particular subsamples (taken from changes in observable

statistics in response to the policy reform) to uncover facts about the characteristics of cheaters.

These approaches may prove useful in other contexts. Here, they are especially compelling because

all three approaches yield similar estimates, indicating that cheaters were more likely to be heads

of household, less likely to be married filing jointly, and more likely to claim the Child Care Credit.

    First, suppose that cheaters and non-cheaters have different distributions for some characteristic

X. If the set of 1987 dependent losers includes a substantial number of cheaters, then the value

of taxpayer characteristics among those who lost a dependent will be different in 1987 than in

earlier years. This assumes that anyone losing a dependent in an earlier year, when misclaiming a

dependent was quite simple and involved little risk of detection, must be honest. Specifically, the

mean value of characteristic X among all those who lost a dependent in 1987, denoted µx , can be

written as a weighted sum of the mean of X for cheaters µcx and non-cheaters µhx , where the weights


                                                  23
are equal to the probability that someone in the sample is a cheater ρ:


                                       µx = ρµcx + (1 − ρ)µhx .                                    (6)


This equation can be rearranged to form an equation for the difference in means between cheaters

and non-cheaters:


                                       µcx − µhx = (µx − µhx )/ρ.                                  (7)


Thus, given an estimate of the pooled mean µx , the mean of honest taxpayers µhx , and the proportion

of the 1987 sample that were cheaters ρ, we can calculate an estimate of the difference in mean

characteristics between cheaters and non-cheaters. We have a ready estimate of µx from our sample

of returns, since it is simply the mean of all 1987 dependent losers. In section 4 we estimated that

31% of those losing a dependent in 1987 were cheaters, which provides an estimate of ρ.

   To obtain an estimate of µhx we use the mean of characteristic X for filers reporting a dependent

loss in an earlier year. TRA86 created many changes in the tax code that might cause differences in

observable characteristics. To avoid conflating these changes with the differences between cheaters

and non-cheaters, we measure the characteristics of the 1987 dependent losers in 1986, the year

prior. For consistency, we compute means in the year before dependent loss for the comparison

group of honest taxpayers.

   Table 4 shows the results of this exercise. Column 1 shows the sample mean of characteristics

listed measured in 1985 for taxpayers who lost a dependent in 1986. This is our estimate of the mean

characteristic for honest taxpayers who lose a dependent. Column 2 shows the mean characteristic

on 1986 tax returns (before the reform), for those taxpayers who lost a dependent in 1987 (when the

reform took effect). Asterisks indicate that this value is statistically different from column 1 at the

10% level based on a simple comparison of means. Column 3 shows our estimate of the difference

in each characteristic between cheaters and honest losers of dependents, based on equation 7 and

assuming ρ = 0.31.

   Column 3 of table 4 shows that there are significant differences between cheaters and those

who lost a dependent for legitimate reasons. In particular, cheaters were much less likely to be

Dollar amounts are in real 1990 dollars. The * indicates difference between preceding two columns is statistically
significant at the 10% level or better. Column 3 is the estimated difference in means between cheaters and honest

groups.



married filing jointly, and much more likely to file as head of household. Moreover, far more cheaters

experienced a change in their filing status in 1987. This is driven in large part by 1986 head of

household filers shifting to the less generous single filing status in 1987, though the difference is

statistically imprecise. Head of household filing status is only available to unmarried individuals

with children. Cheaters were also much more likely to claim the Child Care Credit, which is a tax

credit for child care expenses incurred to enable parents or guardians to work. Taken together, the

evidence shows that cheaters gained not only from claiming an additional dependent exemption,

but also from moving to the head of household rate schedule and claiming (possibly fraudulent)



                                                          25
credits for child care expenses.21 Cheaters were also less likely to contribute to an IRA and to

make a contribution to the presidential election campaign fund (which is plausibly correlated with

a sense of civic engagement). Other characteristics fail to show a statistically significant difference.

    A second, related method of identifying differences in characteristics of cheaters and honest

taxpayers comes from delineating two subgroups within the set of filers who lost a dependent in

1987. We hypothesize that having lost a dependent in years prior to the reform, when there was

no change in the enforcement technology for detecting misclaimed dependents, is an indication of

honesty. Thus, the group of individuals who lost dependents in 1987 and in earlier years likely

contains a high proportion of honest taxpayers. The group of individuals who lost dependents in

1987 but never before likely contains a higher proportion of cheaters. Table 4 shows the means

across these two subgroups, which are of roughly equal size, in columns 4 and 5. Asterisks in

column 5 indicate that there is a statistically significant difference at the 10% level using a simple

comparison of means across the two columns.

    This alternative procedure shows the same qualitative results about filing status as the analysis

in columns 1-3. First-time dependent losers were less likely to be married filing jointly in 1986, and

more likely to be filing as a head of household. Many more first-time losers experienced a change of

filing status in 1987. Similarly, significantly more first-time losers claimed the Child Care Credit in

1986. This alternative comparison also suggests that differences in AGI, the fraction itemizing, the

fraction contributing to an IRA, and the fraction contributing to the election fund are statistically

different. With the exception of election fund contributions, the differences go in the same direction

as in the previous comparison of cheaters and honest filers.

    To address likely correlations across taxpayer characteristics, we next estimate a probit regres-

sion predicting dependent loss. We pool filers who are observed in two consecutive years up to and

including 1987, and restrict the sample to those claiming at least one dependent in the earlier year

of each pair. We control for a number of taxpayer characteristics, and interact each of these charac-

teristics with a dummy for 1987 observations. This allows us to test whether a given characteristic

affects the probability of dependent loss differently in the year when many losses represent cheating.

     The IRS began requiring a Social Security Number or Taxpayer Identification Number for the care provider for
anyone claiming the Child Care Credit in 1989. As discussed in O’Neil and Lanese (1993) and cited by Slemrod
and Bakija (2008) (pp. 238-9), this reform was followed by a substantial increase in the number of claims of self-
employment income, a response similar in spirit to what we analyze here.

          The sample includes filers at risk of losing a dependent between 1980 and 1987, those who claimed
          at least one dependent in the previous tax year. The dependent variable is a dummy variable coded
          as 1 if the filer lost a dependent between years t − 1 and t. The *, ** and *** indicate statistical
          significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels.



The results are shown in Table 5. In this specification, only measures of household composition

appear to be associated with cheating. While filing as head of household, relative to filing as a

single taxpayer, is always associated with a significantly higher probability of dependent loss, this

effect is larger in 1987. The same is true for having experienced a change in filing status between

the two consecutive tax years. Other characteristics appear to affect dependent loss in the same

way in 1987 as in earlier years. Broadly, the results corroborate our conclusions above.

      Third, we use a different decomposition to infer the difference in characteristics across honest

taxpayers and cheaters. The prior two methodologies were premised on a comparison of taxpayers

who lost a dependent at different times, under different enforcement regimes. We can also compare

filers who lost a dependent to filers who gained a dependent.22 We start by noting that the mean

of some characteristic X, among those who gain a dependent (henceforth “a gainer”) in a given
 22
      We are especially grateful to Damon Jones for suggesting this approach.


                                                          27
tax year t, can be written as the weighted sum of the mean of that characteristic for cheaters and

honest taxpayers, where the weight is the probability that a gainer in year t is a cheater:


                                          µgx,t = ρgt µg,c         g g,h
                                                       x,t + (1 − ρt )µx,t .                                (8)


Here µgx,t is the average characteristic for gainers in year t (which is directly observable), µg,c
                                                                                                x,t is

the average characteristic for gainers who are cheaters in year t, µg,h
                                                                    x,t is the average characteristic

for gainers who are honest in year t, and ρgt is the probability that a gainer is a cheater in year t.

The same decomposition can be written for those who lose a dependent (“losers”) in a given year:

µlx,t = ρlt µl,c         l l,h
             x,t + (1 − ρt )µx,t .

    If we make assumptions about the stability of mean characteristics for cheaters and honest

taxpayers, then a comparison of the change in mean characteristics of gainers and losers spurred

by a change in enforcement (which is observable) can be used to infer the difference in mean

characteristics of cheaters and honest types (which is not directly observable). Specifically, we

assume that cheaters have the same characteristic mean, in both 1986 and 1987, regardless of

whether they are gainers or losers. That is, µg,c     l,c     g,c     l,c     c
                                              x,87 = µx,87 = µx,86 = µx,86 ≡ µx . We make a parallel

assumption for honest taxpayers: µg,h     l,h     g,h     l,h     h
                                  x,87 = µx,87 = µx,86 = µx,86 ≡ µx . Under these assumptions,

it is straightforward to show that the difference in the mean characteristics between gainers and

losers can be written as:

                                                                         
                                     µgx,t − µlx,t = ρgt − ρlt µcx,t − µhx,t .                              (9)


This same expression can be calculated for years before and after a reform that changes the proba-

bility that gainers and losers are cheaters in estimable ways. Writing out the difference in difference

between characteristics of gainers and losers across years ((µg87,t − µl87,t ) − (µg86,t − µl86,t )) using equa-

tion 9 and rearranging yields an expression for the difference in means across cheaters and honest

taxpayers, our object of interest:

                                                                              

The left-hand side of equation 10 is exactly the same object as the one estimated by our first

method and shown in column 3 of table 4. The numerator on the right-hand side is the difference-

in-difference across gainers and losers from 1986 to 1987. Each object in the numerator is directly

observable. The denominator is the difference-in-difference in the probability that gainers and losers

are cheaters between 1986 and 1987. Intuitively, this inference procedure examines the difference-

in-difference in a characteristic across gainers and losers – groups whose fraction of cheaters should

change sharply in 1987. The difference-in-difference inflated by the change in fraction of cheaters

present in each pool yields an estimate of the difference between cheaters and honest taxpayers.

    The probabilities in the denominator are not observable directly, but they can be inferred

with relative precision under the assumption that the only reason that there were more losers and

fewer gainers in 1987 was the reaction of cheaters to the introduction of the SSN requirement for

dependents. Then, the change in the number of taxpayers gaining or losing a dependent provides

an estimate of the change in the probability that a gainer (loser) was a cheater.23 Proceeding

under that assumption, we can use equation 10 to calculate an estimate of the mean difference in

characteristics across cheaters and honest taxpayers.

    Table 6 shows the results of this exercise. Our previous estimates of µcx − µhx , from table 4,

are shown in column 1. Several characteristics from table 4 are omitted because they apply only

to dependent losers, and the second methodology requires means for gainers. The second column

shows estimates from the difference-in-difference decomposition for dependent gainers and losers.

Overall, the results are strikingly similar, given that they come from the comparison of different

subsamples and are motivated by different assumptions. The sign of the estimated difference is

the same for all characteristics except our measure of geographic mobility (changing states), which

was not statistically different in our first comparison. Moreover, the magnitude of the difference is

qualitatively similar for most variables. This reaffirms our conclusion that cheaters were less likely

to be married, more likely to be heads of household and more likely to claim the Child Care Credit.

    Our first decomposition relied on the assumption that the mean characteristic for taxpayers who

lost a dependent in 1986 was an unbiased estimate of the mean characteristic of honest taxpayers
  23
     An assumption about exactly how many cheaters were in each group in 1986 is still required because this influences
the denominator in the probability calculations. We assume that no one losing a dependent in 1986 is a cheater, and
that no one gaining a dependent in 1987 is a cheater. Modifying these assumptions has a very modest impact on our
estimates.

  Column 1 repeats the estimate of the difference in the mean of the characteristic for cheaters and honest types
  from table 4. The second column is an estimate of the same parameter (the difference in the mean of the
  characteristic for cheaters and honest types) based on the difference-in-difference statistic from equation 10.




who lost a dependent in 1987. In the second decomposition, we instead make the assumption that

honest taxpayers have the same mean characteristic in 1986 and 1987, regardless of whether they are

gainers or losers. Similarly, we assume that cheating taxpayers who gain a dependent in 1986 have

the same mean characteristics as cheating taxpayers who lose a dependent in 1987. (As a reminder,

we are measuring characteristics in year t − 1, so the mean characteristics are not influenced by

the changes in the tax code included in TRA86 in either method.) Neither assumption is free of

potential criticism, but having two distinct sets of assumptions allows us to check for the robustness

of our conclusions from the first methodology.24
  24
     We have calculated parallel comparisons that compare 1987 to pooled means across 1980-1986, which has the
advantage of increasing the sample size. Most of our findings are robust to this change in comparison group, but the
differences between the two methodologies is inflated for several characteristics, including claiming of the Child Care
Credit, itemizing, and IRA contributions. This may not be surprising, however, because there are other changes in
the tax code in that time period which make assumptions about stability of means across different time periods much
stronger than in the two-year comparison.

6.2       Cheaters do not have particularly large tax benefits from dependents

What explains the fact that some people cheat on their taxes by claiming inappropriate dependent

exemptions and others do not? Is the difference driven mostly by variation in the willingness to

pay to be honest, or mostly by variation in the tax savings associated with claiming an additional

dependent? One possibility is that there is a limited amount of variation in the willingness to pay

to be honest. In the extreme, suppose that all people have the same willingness to pay to be honest.

Then, the only determinant of whether or not a person cheats is his tax gain from doing so. This

implies that cheaters will have noticeably higher tax savings from the marginal dependent than will

honest payers.

       A second possibility is that there is considerable variation in the willingness to pay to be honest.

In this scenario, the link between the monetary gain from cheating and the probability of cheating

might be weak, depending on the correlation between tax savings (largely a function of income) and

honesty. Assuming that tax savings and honesty are not too tightly correlated, as the variation in

the willingness to pay to be honest rises, the relationship between cheating and tax savings from an

additional dependent will dissipate. Thus, qualitatively, if there is a weak relationship between tax

savings and cheating, we will conclude that heterogeneity in honesty is the primary determinant of

cheating behavior, but we will conclude the opposite if the link is strong.25

       To test whether or not tax savings are closely correlated with cheating, we first refer back to table

2, which shows the tax savings from changing the number of dependents for different subsamples.

We focus on comparing the average tax savings of filers who lost a dependent in 1987, about one-

third of whom are cheaters, to other groups of filers who contain few or no cheaters. Table 2 shows

that those losing a dependent in 1987 had a mean tax savings for their last dependent claimed in

1986 of $253 (the benefit from cheating for an observed cheater is the tax change associated with

losing the marginal dependent claimed).

       Groups devoid of cheaters had similar, or even slightly larger, tax savings from cheating. Those

who claimed no dependents in 1986 clearly were not cheating. The benefit from cheating for that

group is equal to the value of gaining a first dependent, which is on average $291 in 1986. Similarly,
  25
     Note that this setup assumes relatively little variation in risk preferences and the probability of audit. Because
risk has little impact on the valuation of evasion, this portion of the assumption is innocuous, but if there is substantial
heterogeneity in the subjective probability assigned to being audited, then this could also play a significant role in
explaining the decision to evade.

those who had a dependent in 1986 but did not lose a dependent in 1987 are unlikely to be cheaters.

This group had a mean tax value of $243. The last row in table 2 shows these two groups combined.

Together, they could have gained $275 on average from claiming a false dependent. This indicates

that cheaters and honest filers faced similar incentives.

   An alternative way to infer the tax savings enjoyed by cheaters involves a comparison across

different years. Table 7 presents the average tax savings associated with claiming a dependent in

each year of our panel. We believe that the values in the t − 1 = 1986 row of columns 2 and 4

contain a large number of cheaters. If cheaters have systematically higher tax savings from claiming

a dependent, and if those who lost a dependent for legitimate reasons in 1987 had tax savings similar

to those who lost a dependent in prior years, then we would expect particularly high tax savings

in the t − 1 = 1986 sample. Such a pattern is not evident. This sample had an average tax value of

$254 from losing their last dependent. This is exactly the same as the average value in the previous

year, and quite similar to all of the values stretching back to the beginning of our sample in 1979.

This is further evidence that cheaters and honest taxpayers had similarly-sized tax benefits from

claiming a dependent.

tax values for relevant subsamples. Figure 6a shows the distribution for those who lost a dependent

in 1987 and those who did not lose a dependent in 1987. If the driving force behind cheating is tax

savings, we would expect that those who lost a dependent in 1987 – many of whom were cheaters –

would have higher tax values than those who did not cheat. This is not the case. The distribution

for those losing a dependent lies above the distribution for those who did not lose a dependent,

which implies that they had lower gains from claiming an additional dependent.

    Figure 6b shows the same comparison for years before the policy reform. This shows that


                                                             33
the distributions are fairly similar, though there is a difference in the number with a zero tax

value – more of those who lost a dependent in pre-1987 years had a zero value from an additional

dependent. To eliminate any differences in the distribution due strictly to the zero values, figures 6c

and 6d show the same distributions, limited to those with positive estimated tax values. Now, the

pre-reform years look very similar, which suggests that, when there is no change in the incentive to

cheat, the tax value distributions of those losing a dependent and those not losing are quite similar.

Nevertheless, the policy reform year still shows a difference – those who lost a dependent had lower

tax values.

    Overall, this evidence suggests that cheaters did not have especially large gains from claiming

additional children. This implies that the main driver of the decision to cheat was not the amount

of money at stake, but rather variation in the taste for honesty.



7    Conclusion

The case of the missing children provides a unique opportunity for examining taxpayers’ evasion

behavior. Two main lessons emerge from our analysis. First, this episode demonstrates that while

a substantial number of taxpayers lied to the IRS in order to save on their taxes, a much larger

fraction of taxpayers passed up an easily accomplished evasion opportunity. These honest taxpayers

gave up hundreds of dollars of tax savings, which amounted to an average of 7% of their tax bill.

This choice reveals a substantial and widespread willingness to pay to be honest. We think this

is an important addendum to recent research that concludes that evasion is driven primarily by

access to evasion opportunities and monitoring efficacy, as in Kleven et al. (2010). The evidence

here suggests a greater role for a preference for honesty.

    Second, the available evidence indicates that heterogeneity in willingness to cheat outweighed

heterogeneity in the tax savings associated with children in determining who cheated and who

did not. Cheaters do appear to be different from honest taxpayers, on average, in some key

characteristics, like filing status, but these differences do not translate to substantial differences in

the average tax savings from claiming children. This suggests that something other than variation

in the tax benefit of a child plays an important role in determining who cheated and who did

not. We interpret this as evidence that there is important variation in the willingness to pay to be


                                                   34
honest.

   Finally, we believe that our methodology for inferring the characteristics of cheaters, our use

of a natural experiment, and our analysis of an evasion opportunity available to virtually all tax-

payers constitute contributions to the larger literature on the economics of income tax evasion. In

particular, our work contributes to the emerging research stream of research that studies “traces

of evasion” (Slemrod and Weber Forthcoming) by showing an additional way of learning about

evasion in the absence of audit data.
