1       Motivation
In the large empirical literature on models of capital accumulation, there
is ample evidence that financial variables, such as profits, are significant
regressors for current investment.1 The empirical finding of significant profits
often appears in empirical investment studies based upon “Q theory”. These
findings have been very influencial: they appear to underlie the position
that capital market frictions are necessary to explain observed investment
behavior.
    The basic idea of Q theory is to solve the dynamic optimization problem of
a firm with convex costs of capital adjustment. The firm will optimally weigh
the current marginal costs of investment against the future marginal returns.
Under some assumptions (essentially homogeneity restrictions on the profit
and adjustment cost functions), this marginal gain can be proxied for by the
value of the firm relative to its capital stock, a value called “average Q”.
The power of this approach to investment is that an observeable, average Q,
completely summarizes the expected discounted present value of additional
investment. Under this theory: current profits should not explain current
investment.
    To many economists, the finding that profit measures are significant in
investment regressions is taken as prima facie evidence of capital market
imperfections. Thus these results provide motivation for numerous theories
of credit frictions. Further, the statistical significance of profits, along with
the large costs of adjustment generally found in these empirical papers have
lead to the conclusion that the Q-theory approach is an empirical failure.
    This paper argues that these conclusions may not be warranted. Much
of the existing empirical work rests upon the substitution of average Q in
place of marginal Q since the former is observable. However, this is appro-
priate only under very strict assumptions concerning the profit and cost of
    1
    Surveys of this literature are numerous. See, for example, the discussion in Chirinko
[1993] and Caballero [1997] and the references therein. Noteworthy recent papers dis-
cussing this evidence are Gilchrist and Himmelberg [1995, 1999], Cummins, Hasset and
Oliner [1999] and Erickson-Whited [2000].


                                           2
adjustment functions. Our analysis studies investment models which do not
satisfy the Q-theory assumptions: firms may have market power as sellers.2
Hence, marginal and average Q are not identical so that empirical models
using average Q are misspecified. Potentially this misspecification can ”ex-
plain” the failures of the Q model.3 Specifically, this paper addresses the
following question: can the significance of profit flows found in Q-based in-
vestment regressions be explained by an empirically relevant model without
capital market imperfections?4 Further, can this model also explain the large
estimated adjustment costs?
    The diﬃcult aspect of addressing these questions is the lack of analytic
results for the types of investment models we wish to study: i.e. those in
which the specification of technology and adjustment costs do not satisfy the
restrictions of Q theory. Evaluation of models outside of the Q-framework is
diﬃcult empirically since these alternatives are not easily reduced to simple
linear relationships.5
    Our empirical approach is structural in nature. We analyze a dynamic
programming problem for a firm with market power which we solve numer-
ically and compare to the data. We estimate relevant parameters by com-
paring the moments generated by our simulated model with the data. In
particular, we use an indirect inference approach so that the parameters of
   2
      The fact that marginal and average Q will diverge when firms have market power
is discussed by Hayashi [1982, Proposition 2]. Galeotti and Schiantarelli [1991] estimate
an investment model allowing for market power and find support for it Their analysis,
however, does not attempt to ”explain” the findings in the more traditional Q theory
based empirical literature.
   Hayashi and Inoue [1991] estimate a Q model for Japanese firms and argue that the
model may fit the light industry firms poorly, with cash flow significant, because these
firms have market power.
    3
      The recent contribution of Erickson-Whited [2000] also focuses on measurement er-
rors. However, their analysis introduces measurement error into Tobin’s Q but maintain
conditions such that average and marginal Q are the same though they recognize that
violations of these assumptions could influence the inference. On this, see the discussion
on pg. 1036-37 of Erickson-Whited [2000]. Our approach, in contrast, is to relax assump-
tions of homogeneity in the profit function and thus allow for a gap between average and
marginal Q.
    4
      We use the term ”empirically relevant” here to constrain our search for parameteriza-
tions that are not at variance with other investment facts.
    5
      Tractability, of course, is one of the arguments in favor of the linear quadratic struc-
ture. Our findings indicate the cost of this simplication: results based upon this structure
may be misleading.



                                              3
our models are selected to match observed Q-theory regressions augmented
by cash flow measures.6 This is a methodological innovation that comple-
ments the more general approach we are taking to understanding investment.
    Our findings are first that with the addition of a reasonable amount of
curvature in profit functions, one can reproduce the regression results com-
monly found in the Q theory based empirical investment literature. In par-
ticular, profits enter the regression significantly and with a coeﬃcient close to
that reported by others without the introduction of borrowing restrictions
into the firm’s optimization problem. Second, the parameterization of the
quadratic adjustment costs function is quite reasonable: the estimated cost
of adjustment function is close to the quadratic model.7 Third the level of
adjustment costs is much lower than that inferred by other researchers. Fi-
nally, we find that our unconstrained model can also match empirical results
based upon sample splits which were intended to partition the sample into
constrained and unconstrained firms. In our results, no firms are constrained
and diﬀerences between ”large” and ”small” firms reflect small diﬀerences in
adjustment costs and other parameters.
    Overall, our findings challenge the prevailing wisdom that Q theory based
investment regressions support the view that firm’s face borrowing restric-
tions. In fact, our results do not indicate that Q theory is alive and well:
only that is has been buried for the wrong reasons.


2       Dynamic Capital Accumulation
Our approach to the neoclassical investment model is easily understood from
examining a dynamic optimization problem in which a firm chooses the level
of capital that maximizes the discounted expected value of its profits.8 The
firm incurs adjustment costs when investing a nonzero amount. New capital
is productive in the following period and depreciates at an exogenous rate,
    6
     This approach is presented in Gourieroux, and Monfort [1996], Gourieroux, Monfort
and Renault [1993]. Cooper and Haltiwanger [2000] use this approach to study investment
with nonconvex costs of adjustment. Adda and Cooper [2000] use a structural estimation
approach to study the impact of scrapping subsidies on new car purchases. Willis [1999]
estimates the distribution of price adjustment costs using indirect inference as well.
   7
     However, our specification does not allow for nonconvex costs of adjustment as in, for
example, Cooper and Haltiwanger [2000].
   8
     Out approach builds upon Lucas-Prescott [1971] though they restrict attention to a
competitive framework.


                                            4
δ.
    Letting K denote the current stock of capital, A, a shock to productivity
or demand, π(K, A) the profit level in state (K, A), p the relative price of cap-
ital, the optimization problem can be expressed as a dynamic programming
problem. 9 The value function for the firm V (K, A) solves:


 V (K, A) = max
              0
                π(K, A)−p(K 0 −K(1−δ))−C(K 0 , K)+βEA0 |A V (K 0 , A0 ) (1)
                    K

Here π(K, A) represents a reduced form profit function generated by the
firm’s solution over other, freely adjustable factors of production.
    In this problem, the firms faces no borrowing constraints. For example,
investment expenditures do not have to be financed out of current profits.
The firm chooses tomorrow’s capital (K 0 ) using its conditional expectations
of future profitability, A0 . Of course, to the extent that A0 is correlated with
A, current profits will be correlated with future shocks and thus informative
about future profits.
    Assuming that V (K, A) exists, an optimal policy, denoted by K 0 =
h(K, A) must satisfy:

                            CK 0 (K 0 , K) + p = βEA0 |A VK 0 (K 0 , A0 )                  (2)
where subscripts on the functions denote partial derivatives. The right side
of this expression is conventionally termed ”marginal Q” and denoted by
q. Note the timing: the appropriate measure of marginal Q is the expected
discounted marginal value of capital in the following period due to the one-
period investment delay. Using (1), this expression can be simplified to an
Euler equation:


         CK 0 (K 0 , K) + p = β{EA0 |A π K (K 0 , A0 ) + p(1 − δ) − CK 0 (K 00 , K 0 )}.   (3)

    The diﬃcult aspect of this theory is its empirical implementation. As
the value function and hence its derivative is not observable, (2) cannot be
directly estimated. Thus the theory is tested either by finding a suitable
proxy for the derivative of V (K, A) or by estimating the Euler equation, (3).
     9
    This representation of the firm’s problem does ignore variations in the cost of capital
which are more likely to be relevant for a time series analysis, as in Abel-Blanchard [1986],
than for our study which is based largely on cross sectional variations.

                                                 5
We focus here exclusively on estimates based upon using the average value
of the firm as a substitute for the marginal value of an additional unit of
capital.10

2.1     Q Models
The traditional Q theory model places additional structure on (1). In par-
ticular, following Hayashi [1982], assume that: π(K, A) is proportional to K,
and that the cost of adjustment function is quadratic:

                                      γ K 0 − (1 − δ)K 2
                       C(K 0 , K) =     (             ) K.
                                      2        K
With this specification, one can show that V (K, A) is proportional to K so
that marginal q equals V (K, A)/K, a term that is called ”average Q” and
denoted here as q̄. 11
    Using this relationship between average and marginal Q, (2) implies that
the investment rate is a linear function of the expected value of future q̄.
Note that the theory implies that q̄ contains all the information necessary to
determine the firm’s optimal investment. In particular, the theory does not
suggest that past investment rates or any measures of current profits and/or
financial variables are needed to ascertain the optimal investment plan for
the firm.

2.2     General Profits and Cost of Adjustment Functions
This section returns to the more general dynamic capital accumulation prob-
lem given in (1) without the added restrictions of Q theory. Instead of
assuming current profits are linear in capital, as required by the Q theory
model, consider

                                  π(K, A) = AK α                                    (4)
  10
     Given the prominence of this approach in the literature, it is natural to focus our
analysis on these results.
  11
     The argument follows Lucas-Prescott [1971] and Hayashi [1982]. Note that the
quadratic adjustment cost is suﬃcient, homogeneity of the adjustment cost function is
necessary.




                                           6
where α parameterizes the curvature of the profit function. This curvature
most naturally reflects market power by the seller. Further, we suppose that
C(K 0 , K) is given by:
                                            Ã                    !θ
                            0          K 0 − (1 − δ)K
                      C(K , K) = (γ/θ)                                K.                  (5)
                                              K
This is a slight generalization of the quadratic cost of adjustment though it
is still homogenous in (I, K).
    The key step away from the traditional Q model is simply allowing α < 1.
Hayashi [1982] demonstrates that in this case marginal Q is always less than
average Q. So, the curvature of the profit function creates a measurement
error in the standard investment regression model as there is a gap between
average and marginal Q due to the strict convavity of the profit function.
    The extension to non-quadratic costs of adjustment has a similar mo-
tivation. While the quadratic case, when combined with homogeneity as-
sumptions, clearly makes the investment problem tractable, there is clearly
no a priori logic for this curvature assumption. Our methodology allows
us to explore more general specifications and thus to evaluate the quadratic
restriction.12


3      Empirical evidence
There are numerous surveys of the investment literature with appropriate
emphasis on results using average Q as a proxy for marginal Q. Here we focus
on empirical evidence using the Q framework and then turn to estimation of
our structural model.

3.1     Evidence on Q Models
The theory predicts a very specific investment equation for the Q theory
models: the investment rates depends only on the expected value of average
  12
    Abel and Eberly [1999] and Barnett and Sakellaris [1999] also allow for non-quadratic
costs of adjustment. Further, there is a significant literature investigating the implications
of nonconvex costs of adjustment, as in Caballero, Engel and Haltiwanger [1995] , Cooper,
Haltiwanger and Power [1999] and Cooper-Haltiwanger [2000]. Relatedly, Caballero-Leahy
[1996] study the relationship between investment and Q in a nonconvex environment.



                                              7
Q.13 Letting it denote period t observation for firm i, tests of Q theory on
panel data are frequently conducted using an empirical specification of:

                      (I/K)it = ai0 + a1 E q̄it+1 + a2 (π it /Kit ).                     (6)
The theory implies that the coeﬃcient on expected average Q, a1 , should
equal 1/γ. The constant term is allowed to pick up firm specific heterogeneity
that may arise from diﬀerences in the adjustment processes across firms, as
in Gilchrist and Himmelberg [1995]. Note that this specification includes
the profit rate, (π it /Kit ). In fact, Q theory does not suggest the inclusion of
profit rates in (6). Rather, this variable is included as a way of evaluating
an alternative hypothesis in which the eﬀects of financial constraints are
not included in average Q. Hence researchers focus on the statistical and
economic significance of a2 .14
    The results obtained using this approach have been mixed. Two ”prob-
lems” have emerged: (i) the relatively high value of the adjustment cost
parameter and (ii) the significance of profits or other financial variables as a
regressor.15
    On the first, point, while specifications and thus estimates of the coef-
ficients certainly vary across studies, it is not uncommon to find extremely
low estimates of a1 and thus an inference of large adjustment costs. In his
original study of this model, Hayashi [1982], found a1 = 0.0423. Abel and
Blanchard [1986] obtain nonsignificant coeﬃcients for contemporaneous aver-
age Q. Fazzari Hubbard and Petersen [1988] obtain extremely low coeﬃcients
(for example, a1 = 0.0065 in one of their specifications) while Gilchrist and
Himmelberg [1995] obtain an estimate for a1 of 0.033.
  13
     Again, the timing assumption is that there is a one-period delay associated with the
delivery and installation of new capital. In some applications, new investment is assumed
to be immediately productive so that the appropriate measure of average Q is the current
one.
  14
     Gomes [1998] makes an important point here: even if there are borrowing restrictions,
they will appear in the value of the firm.Whether they are properly accounted for in average
and marginal Q is less clear and again depends on the homogeneity of the underlying profit
and cost functions and on the nature of the borrowing restrictions.
  15
     In fact, the view that these models ”fail empirically” is commonly held. See the
concise discussion in Erickson and Whited [2000] for example. Other common results in
Q regressions are that residuals are serially correlated and lagged variables are significant
(Chirinko [1993], Abel and Blanchard [1986]). This is a further sign that the model is
misspecified, see West [1998].



                                             8
    To appreciate the magnitude of the estimates, a coeﬃcient of a1 = 0.05
implies γ = 20. With an adjustment cost function of γ2 (I/K)2 K, this implies
an average adjustment cost of 10 ∗ (δ)2 K,using the steady state restriction
of I = δK. With δ = 0.15, we get an adjustment cost relative to the steady
state capital stock of 22.5%, which is very large. Put diﬀerently, a1 = 0.05
implies a 6% adjustment in the first period, 50% within 8 periods and 23
periods until full adjustment, a fairly slow process.16
    On the second point, many studies find that a2 is positive and significantly
diﬀerent from zero which is a rejection of the Q theory. For example, Fazzari,
Hubbard and Petersen [1988] divide their panel into three classes of firms
determined by the ratio of dividends to income. They report significant
eﬀects of cash flow on investment for all types of firms though firms with
higher dividend/income ratios have smaller cash flow coeﬃcients.17 However,
their R̄2 measures fall dramatically from the low to the high dividend firms
(from 0.53 to 0.19). Both the Q variable and the cash flow variable explain
more for the low dividend firms: apparently whatever makes cash flow more
significant also makes Q more significant.
    Gilchrist and Himmelberg [1995] obtain stronger results in favor of fi-
nancial frictions. One of the important aspects of the Gilchrist-Himmelberg
study is their construction of a proxy for marginal Q. As they note, one of
the problems interpreting the significance of cash flow variables in investment
regressions is that these factors may be forecasting future profits rather than
constraining current investment. Using their panel, they estimate forecasting
equations for marginal Q and argue that any remaining explanatory power
of financial variables will reflect capital market imperfections. 18 With this
measure of Q, which they term ”Fundamental Q”, Gilchrist and Himmelberg
  16
     This is derived from an experiment where α = 0.7, γ = 20, δ = 0.15, θ = 2, β = 0.94.
There are two possible states where the transition matrix for Markov process has 0.9 on
the diagonal. The firm is assumed to start at the steady state associated with the low
state of probitability. The profitability shock then jumps to the high state. It takes 23
years to get to the high steady state.
  These numbers change significantly (but not overwhelmingly) if we have a1 = 0.5 or
γ = 2. Then 14% of the adjustment occurs in the initial period and 54% within 5 periods,
up to 18 periods to full adjustment.
  17
     See their Table 5, instrumental variable estimation results. Cash flow coeﬃcients
are 0.455 (0.029) for low ratios, 0.418 (0.038) for middle ratios and 0.238 (0.010) for high
ratios. Low ratios are defined as less than 10% for at least 80% of the sample observations,
between 10% and 20%, and more than 20%.
  18
     In doing so, they assume that the profit function is linearly homogenous of degree one.

report (see their Table 2) that for their full sample Fundamental Q is not sig-
nificant and cash flow is barely significant.19 However, for their sample splits,
financial variables are insignificant for their ”unconstrained” subsample and
are sometimes significant for their ”constrained” subsample.
    Cummins, Hassett and Oliner [1999] take an alternative approach to sep-
arating the informational content of profit fluctuations. For their data set,
they do report familiar findings in terms of standard Q regressions.20 In par-
ticular, the response of investment rates to variations in average Q are quite
small (implying a large value of γ) and cash flow is a significant regressor.
However, when they replace average Q with their measure of Q based upon
earnings expectations, financial variables are no longer significant.

3.2     Empirical Implications of the More General Model
Our perspective on these results is quite diﬀerent. We argue here that the
apparent failure of Q theory stems from misspecification of the firm’s opti-
mization problem as it ignores market power. Suppose that the profit and/or
cost functions did not satisfy the conditions specified in Hayashi [1982]. As
a consequence, average and marginal Q diverge so that the use of q̄it in the
standard investment regression induces measurement error that may be posi-
tively correlated with profits.21 Hence one might find positive and significant
a2 in (6) in a model without any capital market imperfections.
    Consider a version of (1) using the profit and cost of adjustment functions
given in (4) and (5). Our goal is to estimate the key parameters character-
izing the profit and adjustment cost functions: (α, θ, γ).The key question
is whether empirically plausible profit and adjustment cost functions can
reproduce the regression results from estimating (6).
    Our methodology follows the indirect inference procedures described in
Gourieroux and Monfort [1996] and Gourieroux, Monfort and Renault [1993].
This is a version of simulated method of moments in that the structural pa-
rameters are chosen to minimize the distance between moments generated by
the data and those calculated from the simulated data. As the moments of the
   19
      In contrast, for their regressions without cash flow measures, the coeﬃcient on funda-
mental Q exceeded that from their results using Tobin’s Q. Further, this coeﬃcient was
significantly diﬀerent from zero.
   20
      In particular, see their Table 5.
   21
      We do not attempt to characterize this measurement error analytically but use our
simulated environment to understand its implications.


                                            10
simulated data depend on the underlying structural parameters, minimizing
this distance will, under certain conditions, provide consistent estimates of
the structural parameters. The innovation associated with indirect inference
is to use the coeﬃcients of a reduced form regression to establish moments
from the data and then to match these coeﬃcients from estimating the same
regression oﬀ the simulated data. The reduced form coeﬃcients from the
regression on the simulated data will be close to those from the actual data
at the ”true” values of the structural parameters.
    The appealing feature of this approach is that it allows a researcher in-
terested in a structural model to link results explicitly to existing less struc-
tural empirical evidence. For our purposes, we use the results of Gilchrist-
Himmelberg [1995] as representative of the Q theory based investment liter-
ature. Denote their estimates of the investment relationship parameters,(6),
by (a∗1 , a∗2 ). Further, they present evidence for their full sample and for sam-
ple splits based, for example, on firm size and/or the dividend behavior of a
firm.
    We initially focus on results from their pooled panel sample and then
return to understanding their sample splits. At this stage, our goal is to
understand the foundations of empirical results based upon Tobin’s Q. For
this specification, they estimate a1 = .03 and a2 = .24.22 As these results
are based upon a panel data set, our simulation/estimation exercise will be
conducted within a panel structure too. To do so, we decompose the shocks
to profitability into two components: an aggregate shock common to all firms
and a firm specific shock.
    The aggregate shock process is taken from the Cooper-Haltiwanger [2000]
analysis of profitability shocks in the LRD. We represent this process as a
two-state Markov process with a symmetric transition matrix in which the
probability of remaining in either of the two aggregate states is .8.23
  22
     These estimates are reported in their Table 2. Note that these regressions included
time dummies and were estimated in first diﬀerences to remove firm fixed eﬀects. Since
we have no fixed eﬀects build into our model, we do not need to remove them and hence
focus on regression results in levels.
  23
     In fact, our estimates are not very sensitive to the aggregate shocks. Instead, the
model is essentially estimated from the rich cross sectional variation, as in the panel study
of Gilchrist-Himmelberg [1995].




                                             11
3.2.1    Estimates of (α,γ)
Our initial estimation exercise assumes the quadratic cost of adjustment spec-
ification (θ = 2) and focuses on estimating the curvature of the profit function
(α) and the level of the adjustment costs (γ). So, the only variation from
the standard Q theory model is firm market power. In order to focus the
initial estimation on these key parameters, we set other parameters at levels
found in previous studies: δ = .15 and β = .95. This leaves (α,γ) and the
stochastic process for the firm-specific shocks to profitability as the param-
eters remaining to be estimated. We estimate both the serial correlation (ρ)
and the standard deviation (σ) of the profitability shocks.
      Our approach to estimation requires two pieces: solving the dynamic
programming problem and then simulating a panel data set. For each value
of the vector of parameters, Θ ≡ (α,γ, ρ, σ), we solve the firm’s dynamic
programming problem, using value function iteration. In order to solve the
dynamic programming problem at the firm level, conditional expectations
need to be formed using the parameters of the stochastic process for the
firm specific shocks, (ρ, σ). The method outlined in Tauchen [1986] is used to
create a discrete state space representation of the process for any (ρ, σ). Since
the estimation makes extensive use of the cross sectional properties of the
panel data set, we allowed 16 elements in the state space for the idiosyncratic
profitability shock.24
      Once the dynamic programming problem is solved, a panel data set can
be created by simulation using the estimated processes for the shocks and
the policy functions derived from the solution of the dynamic programming
problem. For the simulations, we assumed there were 400 firms and 50 years
of data.
      Given this data set, the Q theory model is estimated and other relevant
moments are calculated. The regression was of the same form as (6). Thus
for each value of Θ, we obtain estimates of the parameters of (6), call them
(â1 , â2 ), where we have ignored the constant term. Further, we use three
other moments reported by Gilchrist-Himmelberg: the serial correlation of
investment rates (.4), the standard deviation of profit rates (.3) and the
average value of average Q (3).25
  24
     Allowing for finer grids for capital and the shocks or increasing the number of firms
or years had no noticeable eﬀect on our estimates.
  25
     The average value of average Q and the standard deviation of the profit rate (measured
as cash flow) comes from Table 6 in Gilchrist-Himmelberg [1995]. The serial correlation


                                            12
    Let Ψd denote the vector moments from the data and Ψs (Θ) denote the
corresponding moments from the simulated data, given the vector of param-
eters Θ. For our problem,

                               Ψd = [.03 .24 .4 .3 3].

    As in all moment matching exercises, a discussion of why these partic-
ular regression coeﬃcients/moments were chosen to match is appropriate.
Clearly, given the motivation of trying to understand the reduced form em-
pirical evidence from investment regressions, coeﬃcient estimates from (6)
are obviously important to the exercise. The serial correlation of investment
rates and the standard deviation of profit rates are necessary to pin down
the parameters of the driving process. Finally, average Q was included to
guarantee that our estimates of the curvature of the profit function did not
produce unreasonably high profit rates since average Q is determined by the
discounted present value of average profit rates. Beyond the economic rel-
evance of these moments, it is also important that they are responsive to
variations in the underlying parameters of our problem. This property was
verified in our simulations and underlies the standard errors of our estimates.
    We compute a statistic, J(Θ), defined as:

                     J(Θ) = (Ψd − Ψs (Θ))0 W (Ψd − Ψs (Θ))                          (7)
where W is an estimate of the inverse of the variance-covariance matrix of
Ψd .26 The estimate of Θ, Θ̂, solves:

                                      min J(Θ).
                                       Θ

The diﬃcult aspect of this problem is in characterizing the highly nonlinear
mapping from the structural parameters Θ to the objective function J(Θ).
of the investment rate comes directly from Charles Himmelberg and we are grateful to
him for supplying this calculation.
   26
      We used a multi-stage procedure to estimate the parameters and to determine W . We
first estimated the parameters assuming that W was the identity matrix. This produces
consistent estimates. We then simulated multiple panels using these estimated parameters
and for each panel reestimated the basic Q regression and recalculated the moments. We
then computed the variance-covariance matrix from these moments. This new estimate
of W was then used to reestimate the coeﬃcients. This procedure was repeated until the
parameter estimates did not change much. This same estimate of W was used to compute
the standard errors, following Gouriéroux and Monfort [1996,Chpt. 4]

two regression coeﬃcients and three moments using only four parameters.

    The model, with its four parameters, does a good job of matching four
of the five estimates/moments. The model is unable to reproduce the high
level of serial correlation in plant-level investment rates. This appears to be
a consequence of the fairly low level of γ which implies that adjustment costs
are not very large.
    In terms of interpreting our results, the estimated curvature of the profit
function of .689 implies a markup of about 15%.29 This estimate of α and
hence the markup is not at variance with other estimates in the literature.
It (α) is larger than the curvature estimate reported by Cooper-Haltiwanger

[2000] for their analysis of plant-level profit functions. Gilchrist and Himmel-
berg [1999] estimate the marginal profit function and, by our calculations,
find a curvature of between .5 and .8.30 Galeotti and Schiantarelli [1991] find
significant market power for firms and a markup of about 33%.31 Finally,
Hayashi and Inoue [1991] estimate a Q model on Japanese manufacturing
data and argue that ”The poor performance of the Q model for light indus-
try may be attributable to the fact that the market for this industry is mostly
domestic and more or less protected from international competition.” 32
    The other interesting parameter is our estimate of the level associated
with the quadratic cost of adjustment, γ. As noted above, under the null of
Q theory, this parameter is the inverse of the coeﬃcient on average Q in the
investment regression. Hayashi initially estimated this parameter at about
20. Subsequent work has led to lower estimates, including that produced by
Gilchrist and Himmelberg [1995] who find parameter estimates as high as .33
and thus γ = 3 for their ”unconstrained firms”.33
    An interesting point from our results is that the estimate of γ is not
identified from the regression coeﬃcient on average Q. While this inference
is correct when the profit function exhibits constant returns to scale, it is
not true when the function is strictly concave. In fact, the estimated value
of γ = .149 is far from the inverse of the coeﬃcient on average Q (about 4).
    Thus, in the presence of market power, we see: (i) why profits are sig-
nificant in the standard Q regression and (ii) that actual adjustment costs
are much smaller than those inferred under the standard Q regression. Es-
sentially, the misspecification of (1) by assuming perfect competition creates
a measurement error in the standard Q investment model as average and
marginal Q are not the same. It is this measurement error that lies at the

     If one uses cash flow their estimates using sales imply (see their footnote 10) a mean
value of 0.76 and a range of 0.25 to 1.88, and if one uses operating income one gets a mean
value of 0.49 and a range of 0.16 to 1.17.
  31
     This estimate is based upon their discussion of their Table 1 estimates.
  32
     Though they assume a perfectly competitive firm, they go on to note that ”Cash flow
can be significant because of its correlation with monopoly rent.” Our results confirm
these views. In fact, this suggests an exercise of looking cross sectionally at markups and
regression coeﬃcients from the Q model. We are grateful to Peter Klenow for discussions
of this point.
  33
     Note though that this result does not come from a regression with Tobin’s Q. So, the
inference from the standard Q theory, which requires average and marginal Q to be equal,
does not apply here.

3.2.2    Sample Splits
The large empirical Q literature also distinguishes between firms that are
likely to be constrained in financial markets and those that are not. One
distinction is often made between large and small firms with the presumption
being that the former are less likely to be constrained. Since there is no model
of credit market frictions contained in most of these papers, the fact that large
and small firms behave diﬀerently is not ”explained”. This is particularly
troublesome given the constant returns to scale environment which implies
that size should not matter.
    An interesting issue is whether our model can explain diﬀerential find-
ings by firm size. In Table 2 we report regression results from Gilchrist-
Himmleberg [1995] for their large and small firm splits, as well as our esti-
mation results. Using their discussion of the data, we assume that the serial
correlation of investment rates, the standard deviation of profit rates and
average Q do not vary by firm size.35 As in Table 1, we report the struc-
tural parameter estimates as well as the moments for each of two samples in
Tables 2a and 2b.36 Note that here we again impose the quadratic cost of
adjustment.

  34
     Another way to see this point is to note that if one regresses investment rates on
average Q, the regression errors (which contain investment fluctuations not explained by
average Q) are positively correlated with profit rates. This does not arise when we regress
investment rates on a measure of marginal Q.

    It is important to note that our exercise does not make use of an auxillary
model to impose diﬀerences in firm size. Rather, we let the data tell us
whether there are significant economic diﬀerences between large and small
firms by doing separate estimation exercises for diﬀerent subsets of empirical
results. As before, our inputs to the process are the moments we wish to
match and our output is the same set of moments (approximately matched)
and the corresponding estimated parameters.
    This exercise is fairly successful. We are able to match the diﬀerential
responses of investment to cash flow coeﬃcients which is a crucial element
of the financial frictions empirical literature. The estimation procedure does
this by finding a slightly smaller adjustment cost parameter (γ) for large firms
and a larger serial correlation of shocks for small firms. To the extent that
current profits are informative about future profit opportunities, the higher
estimate of ρ for smaller firms is consistent with the increased responsiveness
of investment to profit flows (a2 ) in the reduced form regressions reported
in Table 2b. Another interesting characteristic of these results is that the
estimation procedure finds the same concavity of profits for the two sets of
firms, basically unchanged from the one obtained when matching the full
sample results.
    Given these parameter estimates it is not diﬃcult to generate size diﬀer-
ences across firms. One could augment the production process by incorpo-
rating some measure of managerial ability into the production function. The
induced diﬀerences in productivity would create additional size diﬀerences
but do not change the estimated structural parameters very much.37
 37
      This results we obtain by simulation of a model where we vary the mean of the

                                          17
3.2.3    Estimates of ( α,γ, θ)
As a final exercise, we focus jointly on the curvature of the profit and the
cost of adjustment function. Instead of forcing the adjustment function to be
quadratic (i.e. setting θ = 2 in (5)), we allow the curvature of the adjustment
cost function to be determined by the data. We proceed as above by finding
the values of these parameters that minimize J(Θ) where Θ = (α, γ, ρ, σ, θ).
From here it is quite clear that the model with quadratic costs is not a
bad specification: the estimated value of θ is quite close to 2.38 . The other
parameter estimates, not surprisingly, remain relatively unchanged.


4       Conclusions
Our model can produce regression results very close to those obtained in
empirical studies based upon the Q theory model. In stark contrast to the
conclusions reached in those studies, our model does not contain any capital
market imperfections. Instead, it diﬀers from the standard model by adding
market power and so moving away from the linear-quadratic structure gen-
erally taken as given in those exercises. Thus, the statistical significance
of profit rates in the standard Q investment regression may not
reflect capital market imperfections.
    Additional insights into these competing models can be obtained by look-
ing explicitly at the implications of a model with borrowing constraints. Ap-
parently, there has been little systematic study of the alternative model to
determine whether the rejections of the basic Q model could reflect capi-
tal market imperfections. One exception is Gomes [1998] who introduces a
finance cost for external funds. Interestingly, he finds that capital market
imperfections of this form will be summarized in marginal Q and thus, un-
der the right assumptions, captured by average Q as well. This finding is,
indirectly, additional support for our argument.39
profitability shock A to mimic diﬀerences across firms. While these changes in profitability
clearly influence the size of the firm, they have relatively little eﬀect on the reduced form
estimates and moments calculated from the simulated data, as in Table 2.
   38
      Abel-Eberly [1999] report a curvature estimate such that the marginal adjustment
cost function is convex as do Barnett-Sakellaris [1999].
   39
      In fact, Gomes [1998] says that ”This provides support to the argument that the empir-
ical success of cash flow augmented investment regressions is probably due to measurement
error in q.”


                                             18
    Of course, there are many models of capital market imperfections to con-
sider and also other formulations of adjustment costs beyond the quadratic
specification that underlies the Q model. Particularly appealing might be a
model with non-convex market participation. This would model the conjec-
ture that firm size is important for capital market imperfections and, more
generally, to allow the constraints on firms to be endogenous. Further, this
might tie in with evidence on the lumpiness of investment expenditures.
