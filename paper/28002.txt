                                            ABSTRACT

Long-term data show that the dynamic efficiency condition r>g holds when g is represented by
the average growth rate of real GDP if r is the average real rate of return on equity, E(re), but not
if r is the risk-free rate, rf. This pattern accords with a simple disaster-risk model calibrated to fit
observed equity premia. If Ponzi (chain-letter) finance by private agents and the government are
precluded, the equilibrium can feature rfE(g), a result that does not signal dynamic inefficiency.
In contrast, E(re)>E(g) is required for dynamic efficiency, implied by the model, and consistent
with the data. The model satisfies Ricardian Equivalence because, without Ponzi finance by the
government, a rise in safe assets from increased public debt is matched by an increase in the safe
(that is, certain) present value of liabilities associated with net taxes.

        The familiar dynamic efficiency condition is r>g, where r is a real rate of return and g is

a rate of economic growth, for example, of real GDP. This condition applies to the steady state

of the infinite-horizon neoclassical growth model, as developed in Cass (1965) and Koopmans

(1965) and elaborated in Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004, Ch. 2). The condition rules out

excessive saving and investment; specifically, capital is not accumulated in the long run beyond

the golden-rule level described in Phelps (1961). In contrast, r<g is possible in the steady state

of the overlapping-generations model developed by Diamond (1965), so that reduced saving and

investment can be Pareto improving. In this OLG environment, expansions of public debt and

enlargement of pay-as-you-go social security systems may be welfare enhancing. The condition

r>g was highlighted in Abel, et al. (1989), and it arises in many analyses of wealth accumulation

and public debt, such as the recent studies by Piketty (2011) and Blanchard (2019).

        Whether r>g applies empirically depends mainly on how one defines r. The bottom line

from the available data since 1870 for 14 OECD countries, shown in Table 1, is that the

condition holds if r is gauged by the average of the realized real rate of return on equity and does

not hold if r equals the average of the realized real rate of return on short-term government bills. 1

The latter variable likely approximates the average of safe real interest rates. Since the r>g

condition holds when r is based on risky returns (on equity) but not when r is based on safe

returns (approximated by government bills), a key underlying element is the large gap between

the expected real rate of return on equity and the safe real interest rate; that is, the equity




1
 This perspective is consistent with the discussion in Abel, et al. (1989, p.2), who considered estimates of the
productivity of capital but did not look at rates of return on equity. The results accord with the returns data
presented in Barro and Ursúa (2008, Table 5), which appear in updated form in Table 1. The underlying numbers
come mostly from Global Financial Data. Longer-term patterns are studied in Homer and Sylla (1996) and
Schmelzing (2020).

                                                        2
premium. This substantial premium provides a lot of space in which g can fit, so that g can be

simultaneously below the risky rate and above the safe rate.

         The r-g condition depends also on the definition of g, which is typically based on the

long-run growth rate of real GDP. In the usual version of the neoclassical growth model, the

relevant transversality condition involves the growth rate of the level of real macroeconomic

aggregates, not quantities per capita. This result emerges from a specification in which

individuals currently alive are connected as parents to members of future generations; for

example, through altruistic linkages. In this case, current households consider the asymptotic

present value of all future real income, whether growing per capita or because of population

growth.

         To be more specific on the long-term empirical patterns, Table 1 shows the means since

1870 (or a more recent year when earlier data are missing) of real rates of return and growth rates

for 14 OECD countries with available data. The returns refer to averages of realized arithmetic

real rates of return on stocks (based on broad indices such as the S&P 500), short-term bills

(analogous to Treasury Bills), and government bonds (around 10-year maturity). The growth

rates refer to real GDP per capita, real personal consumer expenditure per capita, and population

(which enables calculations of growth rates of levels of real GDP and consumer expenditure).

When averaging over the 14 countries, the average annual real rates of return were 7.0% on

stocks, 1.1% on bills, and 2.6% on bonds. Averages for annual growth rates were 1.9% for per

capita GDP, 1.7% for per capita consumer expenditure, and 0.9% for population. Hence, for

levels, the average annual growth rates were 2.8% for GDP and 2.6% for consumer expenditure. 2



2
 Results are similar if samples start in 1960, rather than 1870. In the 1960 case, the averages over the 14 countries
were 7.8% for stock returns, 1.4% for bill returns, 3.5% for bond returns, 2.1% for per capita GDP, 2.0% for per
capita consumer expenditure, and 0.7% for population.

                                                          3
These numbers show that, over the long term, the growth rates of GDP and consumer

expenditure were clearly below the real rate of return on equity and above that on bills. In

contrast, real rates of return on bonds were close to the growth rates of GDP and consumer

expenditure.

        To understand what measure of r-g matters, one needs a theoretical model that can

explain a large equity premium. The standard neoclassical growth model is unsatisfactory for

this purpose because, in its deterministic setting, there is a single real rate of return and no equity

premium. A satisfactory framework requires uncertainty that is sufficient to generate a large

equity premium; that is, to resolve the equity-premium puzzle of Mehra and Prescott (1985). I

use a simple representative-agent model with disaster risk, following Barro (2009), which built

on Rietz (1988) and Barro (2006). The analysis could also be pursued in alternative frameworks

that can generate a large equity premium. Prominent possibilities here are the long-run risks

framework of Bansal and Yaron (2004) 3 and the heterogeneous-consumers model of

Constantinides and Duffie (1996).



I. Fruit-tree Model with Stochastic Depreciation

        I use the simplest representative-agent model I have thought of that has sufficient

aggregate uncertainty to generate a realistic equity premium and that also determines

endogenously the rate of economic growth and the investment/saving decision. The model is an

"AK" version of the Lucas fruit-tree model:

        (1)                                          Yt = AKt,




3
 This model features variations in the mean and volatility of long-run growth rates. Other models, such as Gabaix
(2012), allow for volatility of disaster risk.

                                                         4
where Yt is output (of fruit or seeds) and Kt is the capital stock in the form of trees. The model is

constructed in discrete time but the length of the period is allowed to approach zero. The timing

is specified so that Kt represents the capital stock available at the start of period t and Yt the

output produced during period t. The productivity level, A>0, is assumed constant but

productivity shocks can be introduced. These shocks would be analogous to the stochastic

depreciation introduced below. A simplifying assumption is that the marginal product of capital

(equal to the average product) does not diminish as capital is accumulated. This absence of

diminishing returns seems most plausible when capital stock and capital services are interpreted

broadly to encompass human capital, household durables, intangible capital, etc.

         During period t, output can be consumed as fruit, Ct, or invested as seed, It, so that

         (2)                                  Ct = Yt - It = AKt - It.

The creation of new trees through planting seeds (that is, gross investment) is assumed to be

rapid enough so that, as in the conventional one-sector production framework, the fruit price of a

unit of capital is pegged at a price normalized to one. 4 Therefore, in the simplest setting, the

price, Pt, of equity--in the sense of a claim on all of the trees--always equals Kt. This result

corresponds to "Tobin's q" equaling one. In terms of changes over time, the equity price ratio,

Pt+1/Pt, would equal the capital-stock ratio, Kt+1/Kt, which equals the output ratio, Yt+1/Yt.

Therefore, the volatilities of equity prices and output would be the same. In contrast, empirically

observed equity prices are far more volatile than output, gauged by real GDP.

         In practice, there are many reasons that equity valuations for businesses would depart

from the reproduction cost of the underlying capital stock. As an example, the price of goods

sold might be a variable markup, 1+t,, of the underlying cost of production, and variations in t


4
 Irreversibility of investment would affect this result if the constraint that gross investment cannot be negative is
sometimes binding. However, in the present model, gross investment is always chosen to be positive.

                                                            5
would generate fluctuations in Pt independently of those in Kt and Yt. Another possibility is that

the cost of shifting between consumables and new capital goods in the production process does

not stay fixed (at unity), and a further idea is that the productivity of old capital might vary

stochastically relative to that of new capital.

       To capture these types of effects, the price ratio for equity, Pt+1/Pt, is allowed to deviate

from that for the capital stock by a random term:
                                       +1         +1
       (3)                                  =          + +1 .
                                                  


The shock +1 is assumed to have zero mean, serial independence, and to be distributed

independently of Kt+1/Kt. This specification means that an epsilon shock, possibly representing a

change in markups or a shift in the rate of transformation between consumables and capital on

the production side, has a permanent effect on the level of the equity price. For asset-pricing

purposes, an important condition is that +1 will be distributed independently of consumption

growth, +1 / (because +1 is assumed to be independent of capital-stock growth, +1 / ).

In this case, the epsilon shock will not influence asset pricing in the model's baseline

specification but will allow for the equity price to be more volatile than capital stock and output.

       The model allows for rare disasters by having stochastic depreciation of the capital stock;

that is, destruction of trees. The capital stock evolves because of gross investment and

depreciation, t+1Kt:

       (4)                             Kt+1 = Kt + It ­ t+1Kt.

The depreciation rate, t+1, is stochastic and equal to

       (5)                             t+1 =  + ut+1 + vt+1,

where 0<<1. The ut+1 shock, normally distributed with mean 0, variance 2, and serial

independence, represents normal economic fluctuations. This shock has a permanent effect on


                                                     6
depreciation and, therefore, on the level of the capital stock. (Since ut+1 can be negative, it is

possible that t+1 would be negative.) The vt+1 shock represents rare disasters, modeled as large-

scale destruction of trees. With probability 1-p, vt+1=0, and with probability p, vt+1=-dt+1; that is,

the fraction dt+1 (0< dt+1<1) of the trees is (permanently) destroyed in a disaster event. The

disaster size, dt+1, is subject to a time-invariant probability distribution. (This disaster shock is

one-sided because there are no bonanzas associated with the sudden appearance of new trees.) A

natural extension, as in Gabaix (2012), would allow for stochastic variations in disaster

probability, p, or in the distribution of disaster sizes, d.

        One part of tree output is paid out as dividends, which correspond to consumption of fruit

by owners. The other part is retained within the tree business to finance investment in new trees.

From the standpoint of equity holders, the first part of the return on equity is the dividend yield,

which equals the ratio of consumption, Ct, to the capital stock, Kt. 5 The second part consists of

equity price appreciation, Pt+1/Pt, given in equation (3). Therefore, using equation (2), the gross
                             
one-period return on equity,  , is

                                      +1                          +1
        (6)               =  +               + +1 =  -  +              + +1.
                                                                  


        Equations (4) and (5) imply that the growth of the capital stock is given by
                         +1            
        (7)                    = 1 +  -  - +1 - +1 .
                                          


Substitution of equation (7) into the right-hand side of equation (6) yields:
                         
        (8)               = 1 +  -  - +1 - +1 + +1 ,

so that the net rate of return,  = 
                                    - 1, is

        (9)               =  -  - +1 - +1 + +1 .



5
 With a markup ratio 1+, the dividend payout in value terms is (1+)Ct and the equity price is (1+)Kt.
Therefore, a change in  does not affect the dividend yield.

                                                       7
       In equation (9), the shocks +1 and +1 have zero mean, and the disaster shock +1 has

mean    (). Therefore, the expectation of the one-period net rate of return is

       (10)                     ( ) =  -  -    ().

An assumption is that A>+pE(d) and, hence,  ( ) > 0. Since productivity, A, disaster

probability, p, and mean disaster size, E(d), are time invariant,  ( ) is constant over time.

       The next step concerns the determination of the ratio of gross investment to the capital

stock, It/Kt. Gross investment equals gross saving (for a closed economy with no government

sector) and can be determined from dynamic conditions for consumer optimization.

       Barro (2009) uses a specification of preferences for the representative consumer based on

the analysis of Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1990), described as EZW preferences. This

specification, corresponding to Barro (2009, equation [10]), features constant values of the rate

of time preference, , the coefficient of relative risk aversion, , and the intertemporal elasticity

of substitution (IES), 1/, where = holds in the standard power-utility formulation. The

condition >1 is required for the model to have a chance of generating an equity premium in the

neighborhood of that observed empirically. In that case, the standard representation would

require >1 and, hence, IES<1. Barro (2009) followed Bansal and Yaron (2004) to argue that

the property IES<1 generates counter-factual predictions regarding equity pricing. In the present

analysis, >1 is crucial, but <1 is less important.

       In general, EZW preferences do not allow for simple formulas for pricing assets.

However, when the underlying shocks are i.i.d., as in the present model, the analysis simplifies

dramatically. Specifically, Barro (2009, equations [12] and [13]) used results from Giovannini

and Weil (1989, appendix) to show that a standard-looking asset-pricing condition applies:

                                           1
       (11)                    Ct- = (         )  Et ( Rt  Ct-
                                                             +1 ) ,
                                         1+  *

                                                     8
where Rt is the gross return on any asset between dates t and t+1. Two features that differ from

those in the standard power-utility model (where =) are worth noting. First, the exponents on

Ct and Ct+1 in equation (11) involve , the coefficient of relative risk aversion, not , which is the

reciprocal of the IES. Second, the effective rate of time preference, *, differs from  when 

and  diverge. The formula for * is, if 1,

                                                1               
    (12)  =  - ( - )   ( ) - 2   2 - -1  [ (1 -  )1- - 1 - ( - 1)  .

The term E(gt) is the economy's expected growth rate and is derived below.

         Because the shocks ut+1 and vt+1 are i.i.d. (permanent to the levels of capital stock and

output), the ratio of gross saving to the capital stock will be optimally chosen as a constant,

denoted by . The value of  can be determined by applying the consumption-based asset-

pricing formula in equation (11) to the gross return on equity, given in equation (8). The result

(applying as the length of the period approaches zero) is: 6

                             1                      1                            1-
         (13)     =  + ()  -  -  - 2 (1 - )   2 -   -1 [ (1 -  )1- - 1].

         Equation (13) implies that, if >0, the sign of the effect of uncertainty (, p, or the

distribution of d) on the gross saving ratio, , depends on the IES, 1/, not the degree of risk

aversion, . If <1, so that the IES exceeds 1, the "substitution effect" dominates, and more

uncertainty (higher  or p or an outward shift of the d-distribution) decreases . For the

parameter values used subsequently to calibrate the model (in Table 2), the main effect from




6
 For equation (13) to be valid, the associated level of consumption has to be positive, corresponding to <A.
Equation (13) implies that the condition <A can be expressed as:
                                                     1          
                            > (1 - )  -  -    2 - ( )[ (1 -  )1- - 1].
                                                    2          -1
If this inequality does not hold, the optimization problem is not well defined because the attainable expected utility
is unbounded. The inequality is satisfied for the parameter values assumed later. (An analogous inequality
condition applies in the standard deterministic neoclassical growth model, where 2=p =0.)

                                                           9
uncertainty on the saving ratio comes from disaster risk--the term involving p on the far right of

equation (13). The term involving 2 is quantitatively unimportant.

         In the present model, the growth rates of the macroeconomic variables--capital stock,

output, and consumption--are always the same. This common growth rate, denoted by gt, is

given from equation (7) as
                                  +1
         (14)               =          - 1 =  -  - +1 - +1 ,
                                   


where recall that ut+1 is the normal shock and vt+1 is the disaster shock. A higher gross saving

ratio, , in equation (13) implies a higher growth rate in equation (14).

         The expected growth rate is constant and given from equation (14) by

         (15)                        ( ) =  -  -    ().

An assumption is that the parameters imply  ( )>0, given that - is determined from

equation (13).

         The relationship between the expected rate of return on equity,  ( ) from equation (10),

and the expected growth rate,  ( ) from equation (15), is given by

         (16)                        ( ) -  ( ) =  - .

Therefore, if A>--meaning that output exceeds gross investment and, hence, that consumption

is positive (see n. 6)--the expected rate of return on equity exceeds the expected growth rate. 7 In

other words, the r>g condition holds in the model when the r applies to the expected rate of

return on equity.

         To get perspective on equation (16), note that the expected net rate of return on equity is
                                                         +1             
         (17)                        ( ) =  +  (               - 1) =      +  ( ),
                                                                        



7
 The condition A> corresponds to the criterion for dynamic efficiency proposed in Abel, et al. (1989, p.2): " ... an
economy is dynamically efficient if it invests less than the return to capital ..." In the present model, A equals the
marginal (and average) product of capital and, therefore, corresponds to the gross return on capital.

                                                          10
where  / is the dividend yield and E(gt) is the expected rate of capital gain. Rearranging

equation (17), assuming  ( )   ( ), yields a formula for the price-dividend ratio of an

equity claim:
                                                            1
         (18)                                     = ( )-( ) .
                                                                 


Equation (18) is usually called the "Gordon growth formula." 8 This formula relates the price-

dividend ratio for equity to the reciprocal of the difference between the expected net rate of

return on equity and the expected growth rate (of dividends; that is, of Ct in the present model).

Equation (18) implies that Pt/Ct will be positive and finite only if  ( ) >  ( ), as already

noted in equation (16).

         Another way to think about the result is that claims on capital give owners the rights to a

stream of dividends (fruit) that is expected to rise at the rate  ( ). If this expected growth rate

were at least as high as the discount rate--which corresponds to the expected rate of return on

the asset,  ( )--then the present value of the claim would be infinite. This result is

inconsistent with an equilibrium in which consumption is chosen optimally over time. However,

this inconsistency does not arise if  ( ) >  ( ).

         Consider now the risk-free real interest rate, denoted by rf. In the model, risk-free claims

are internal instruments, amounting to private bonds that represent loans from one agent to

another. 9 The aggregate of risk-free assets always equals zero; that is, these assets are in zero net

supply. Section III considers government bonds, which may be in positive net supply.

         Although the aggregate quantity of risk-free assets will be zero, the model still

determines a shadow real interest rate, rf, applying to these assets. The value of rf, which is

 See Campbell (2018, p. 130). The reference to Gordon refers to Gordon and Shapiro (1956, equation [7]).
9
 The assumption is that there do not exist storable goods or other real assets that yield a risk-free real rate of return
above the equilibrium rf that arises in the model.

                                                            11
constant, can be determined from the asset-pricing condition in equation (11) along with the

result that Ct+1/Ct equals the value gt given in equation (14). The solution is

         (19)                           =  -  -  2 -    [  (1 -  )- ].

More uncertainty--higher  or p or an outward shift of the d-distribution--decreases rf. 10 For

the parameter values used to calibrate the model (in Table 2), the main effect from uncertainty

on rf comes from the disaster term, which involves p on the far right of equation (19). With these

parameter values, including =3.5, and for the observed histogram of disaster sizes, the term

 [  (1 -  )- ] equals 1.7, implying that a (once-and-for-all) rise in disaster probability, p, by

0.010 per year lowers   by a substantial 0.017 per year. The effect associated with the normal

shock, which involves 2, is quantitatively unimportant. Reasonable parameter values accord

with a value of rf close to zero in equation (19). For the values specified in Table 2, the

equilibrium rf is 0.001, essentially zero. 11 By comparison, long-term averages for OECD

countries of realized real rates of return on government bills, as shown in Table 1, are around

0.01 per year.

         The equity premium is given from equations (10) and (19) by

         (20)                ( ) -   =  2 +    {  [(1 - )- - 1]}.

For the parameter values specified in Table 2 (which include =3.5), the predicted equity

premium from equation (20) is around 0.06 per year. This result accords with measured equity



10
   Since the model has i.i.d. shocks, the term structure of risk-free rates is flat; that is, rf is the short-term and long-
term risk-free rate. Therefore, the model does not explain why, in Table 1, the average real rate of return on 10-year
government bonds exceeds that on short-term government bills.
11
   This low value of rf reflects the fatness of the disaster tail, not the skewness, which arises from the exclusion of
bonanzas. Skewness would not apply if there were a bonanza probability, q, that equaled p and if the distribution of
bonanza sizes were the same as that for disasters. In this case, in turns out that the calibrated model's equilibrium
value of rf becomes 0.005, rather than 0.001. To put it another way, with a small rise in p=q, which turns out to be
from 0.040 to 0.042, the equilibrium rf would still be 0.001, despite the lack of skewness. Skewness is unimportant
because, with the substantial "diminishing marginal utility" implied by =3.5, the positive tail from bonanzas counts
little for the equilibrium rf.

                                                            12
premia, gauged by the gap shown in Table 1 between long-run averages of realized real rates of

return on equity and short-term government bills. 12 The dominant part of the equity premium in

the model reflects disaster risk, which appears in the term in equation (20) that contains the

disaster probability, p. The other part,  2 , is quantitatively unimportant, as in the related

analysis of the equity-premium puzzle in Mehra and Prescott (1985). Note that, in the model, the

positive effect of disaster risk on the equity premium reflects the negative impact on rf in

equation (19), not an effect on the expected rate of return on equity,  ( ), in equation (10). 13

          The gap between rf and the expected growth rate,  ( ), is given from equations (19) and

(15) by

          (21)              -  ( ) =  -  -  2 -    {  [(1 - )- - 1]}.

The parameter values considered below suggest that this gap is likely to be negative (because the

model's predicted value for rf in equation (19) is likely to be close to zero). In any event, the

model does not require the r>g condition to hold when the r refers to the risk-free rate. Thus,

there is no conflict between the theory and the empirical observation that this condition fails to

hold when r is measured by the average real rate of return on government bills.

          In terms of portfolio allocation, the representative agent in period t holds claims on all of

the capital stock, Kt, at price, Pt, and holds a zero net position in risk-free assets. That is, in the

equilibrium--for the distribution of  implied by equation (9) and for the value of   given in

equation (19)--the agent is willing at all points in time to hold 100% of assets in risky capital

and 0% in risk-free claims.



12
   The observed stock returns from Table 1 should be adjusted downward because of leverage associated with bond
financing to match up with the  in the model. However, the computation of the expected net marginal product of
capital requires an upward adjustment to account for taxation of earnings at the corporate level.
13
   Equation (10) implies a small negative effect from the disaster probability, p, on  ( ). This effect would not
arise if bonanzas were treated symmetrically with disasters, as in n. 11.

                                                       13
       Because the representative agent ends up with a zero net position in risk-free assets, the

equilibrium would be the same if risk-free assets did not exist. However, the existence of these

assets would matter if households were heterogeneous; differing, for example, by coefficients of

relative risk aversion, . In that case, agents with relatively high  would tend to be net positive

in safe assets, thereby lending funds on a risk-free basis to those with relatively low .

       Consider now whether an outcome with     ( ) violates a transversality condition.

To assess this possibility, consider the position of the representative agent, who, in equilibrium,

holds all assets as risky equity with a zero net position in safe assets. Suppose that this agent in

period t perturbs his or her position by issuing the quantity Bt of safe bonds and using the

proceeds to raise Ct. Suppose further that the agent plans never to repay this debt; that is, the

debt is rolled over in perpetuity, so that the stock of debt grows at the rate   . All other parts of

the plan for consumption and portfolio allocation subsequent to date t are assumed to be

unchanged (and   and the time path of  are unaffected by an individual's perturbation). If this

new plan were feasible, the agent's expected overall utility would rise, corresponding to the

increase in Ct and unchanged values of Ct+1, ... That is, the agent would not actually have been

optimizing, and the proposed equilibrium would be invalid.

       The key element is the agent's debt, which, in the proposed perturbation, equals  >0 at

date t. If this debt is rolled over in perpetuity at the rate   , the debt at date t+N is + =

 (1 +   ) . The present value, computed at the rate   , is, therefore,  >0; hence, the present

value does not go to zero as N tends to infinity. In order for this perturbation to be feasible, other

agents would have to be willing to accumulate risk-free assets so that the present value remains

positive as N tends to infinity. However, no agents would be willing to accumulate risk-free

assets in this manner because they would be better off using the assets at some date in finite time


                                                  14
to raise consumption. To reconcile this inconsistency, the credit market has to require each

individual to choose a time path of debt so that the present value, + /(1 +   ) , approaches

zero as N tends to infinity. Importantly, this condition applies independently of the values of

  and the expected growth rate, E(g), and the result     () is possible. 14

        The key condition needed to validate the equilibrium is the exclusion of a form of Ponzi

or chain-letter finance in which an individual borrows at the risk-free rate and then fully rolls

over the added debt in perpetuity. Individuals can consider an array of perturbations to the

equilibrium in which they change the amount consumed in any period t and then change the

amount consumed in any other period, such as t+1, while shifting correspondingly the amounts

held in risk-free form during the two periods. That is, shifts in the timing of consumption

associated with the rate rf are allowed among any periods within a finite horizon. These

perturbations away from the equilibrium are not optimal for the individual because equation (19)

guarantees that the first-order conditions for intertemporal choices of consumption (associated

with rf ) are all satisfied.



II. Illustrative Calibration of the Model

        Table 2 shows how the model works quantitatively for a reasonable set of parameter

values. The most important settings in the calibration relate to disaster probability and size

distribution. The values for disaster probability, p, and the distribution of disaster sizes, d, come

from an updated version of the numbers in Barro and Ursúa (2008). Specifically, peak-to-trough

disaster events of size 10% or more for per capita GDP were isolated for 185 cases,




The condition   >  ( ) may hold in the model. For example, if there is no uncertainty, so that p=2=0, then
14

 would equal  ( ), and both returns would exceed the expected growth rate,  ( ).
 


                                                     15
corresponding to data for 40 countries going back as far as 1870 and up to 2012. 15 This sample

shows an average proportionate disaster size, E(d), of 0.21. Taking account of the duration of

each disaster event, the implied disaster probability, p (the chance of entering into a disaster

state), is 0.04 per year. The objects E(1-d)-, E(1-d)1-, and E[d((1-d)-] equal 4.0, 2.3, and 1.7,

respectively, for a coefficient of relative risk aversion, , of 3.5 and for the observed histogram of

disaster sizes. 16 This value of , when used in equation (20) (along with the value of p and the

size distribution of d), generates an equity premium that accords with empirically observed

values around 0.06 per year. 17 The variance of the normal shock, 2, is set at 0.0004 per year to

accord with the observed annual volatility of real GDP growth. However, in the relevant range,

the results on the equity premium and other outcomes are insensitive to the value of 2.

        The deterministic part of the depreciation rate, , is set at 0.05 per year, the average BEA

number from 1948 to 2018 for fixed assets (including government assets but excluding consumer

durables other than residential housing). The value set for A, 0.12 per year, is chosen to generate

realistic levels of the real rates of return, which turn out to be 0.062 per year for E(re) and 0.001

per year for rf. The values of =0.04 per year and =0.5 determine the gross saving and

investment ratio, , to be 0.090 per year 18 and the expected growth rate, E(g), to be 0.032 per

year (the long-run average U.S. growth rate of real GDP).



15
   Colombia is the only one of the 40 countries to experience no GDP-based contractions of size 10% or more.
Malaysia and Singapore, which have long-term GDP data, were excluded from the calculations because of the large
gaps in data around World War II.
16
   An alternative approach, pursued in Barro and Jin (2011), assumes that disaster sizes follow a power-law
distribution. The results are similar to those based on the observed histogram.
17
   This calculation views each disaster event as permanent for the level of real GDP. Barro, Nakamura, Steinsson,
and Ursúa (2013) and Barro and Jin (2020) assume, instead, that disasters are only partly permanent. The estimated
eventual recovery fraction is about 50% of the initial contraction. An allowance for the partly temporary nature of
macroeconomic disasters raises the value of  required to match the observed equity premium.
18
   The values of  and  both contribute to  and E(g). The value of  would also affect the sensitivity of the gross
saving rate to dimensions of uncertainty--p, the size distribution of d, and 2. However, in the present analysis,
these uncertainty parameters are fixed. Therefore, the results shown for outcome variables in Table 2 could be
generated with alternative combinations of  and .

                                                        16
       The implied ratio of gross investment to GDP is /A=0.75. An interpretation of this high

ratio is that, as mentioned before, the underlying AK production function should be interpreted in

terms of a broad definition of what constitutes capital and investment.



III. Government Bonds
              
       Let  be the real quantity of government bonds outstanding at the start of period t.

These bonds are assumed to be analogous to the safe short-term bonds that private agents were

able to issue. The real interest rate applicable to government bonds is assumed to be rf, the same

rate as that for private bonds. This assumption of equal interest rates is not far from reality for

the United States if one identifies private bonds with prime corporate obligations. For example,

from 1920 (which has the first data on securities comparable to U.S. Treasury Bills) to 2019, the

average of annual nominal yields was 0.034 for 3-month Treasury Bills and 0.041 for 90-day

commercial paper; that is, the spread was only 0.007. The average annual real rate of return on

10-year U.S. government bonds over this period was 0.029, whereas that on Moody's AAA

corporate bonds was 0.036, again a spread of 0.007.

       The government collects lump-sum real taxes net of transfers of Tt during period t. The

quantity Tt is treated as a random variable. Neglecting government purchases of goods and

services (government consumption and investment), the government's budget constraint is:
                                                      
       (22)                    +1 -  =     -  .

Hence, the budget deficit equals the excess of spending (for interest and transfers) over revenue

(from net taxes). The real interest rate   is assumed to be constant and known in period t, as in

the model worked out before without a government sector. Net taxes, Tt+j, in each future

period (j1) are stochastic from the perspective of period t, and the evolution of these net taxes


                                                 17
                                                                 
determines the future quantities of government bonds, +2 , +3 , ... These quantities are random

from the perspective of period t, but the realizations of these quantities are linked to the

realizations of net taxes from the government's budget constraint in equation (22).

       A key object for the equilibrium is the present value of net taxes, computed using as a

discount rate the safe real interest rate,   . Iterating equation (22) into the future for N1 periods

yields an intertemporal budget constraint for the government:
                                              
       (23)                                            
                       =1[+-1 /(1 +  ) ] =  - + /(1 +  ) .


Therefore, aside from the final term on the right-hand side, the present value of net taxes,

computed as of period t, is non-stochastic and pinned down to equal the stock of government
         
bonds,  , at the start of period t.

       The previous infinite-horizon model corresponds to N tending to infinity. A key issue is
                                                                
how the final term on the right-hand side of equation (23), + /(1 +   ) , behaves as N

approaches infinity. The asymptotic behavior of this term is analogous to the Ponzi-type

borrowing considered before for an individual agent in the model without government. In the

previous setting, the term had to approach zero because no private agents would be willing to

hold bonds with an asymptotically positive present value. The same argument applies now to
                                 
government bonds. The term + /(1 +   ) has to approach zero as N approaches infinity

because private agents are unwilling to hold bonds with asymptotically positive present value.

This result rules out Ponzi borrowing by the government, and equation (23) becomes, when

expressed over an infinite horizon:
                                                   
       (24)                                  
                               =1[+-1 /(1 +  ) ] =  .




                                                 18
Equation (24) says that the government can choose the timing of tax collections (and, therefore,

budget deficits), but the present value of taxes is pinned down to equal the starting amount of

public debt.

        The model described before still applies for private agents. The only new elements are
                                                                              
that the representative agent holds the initial stock of government bonds,  , and has to pay the

stream of lump-sum net taxes,  , +1 , ... However, the present value of the latter over an
                                                                                           
infinite horizon (evaluated at the rate   ) is pinned down from equation (24) to equal  .
                                                                                      
Therefore, the net wealth of the representative agent is unaffected by the level of  or the timing

of taxes and budget deficits. It follows that the model satisfies Ricardian Equivalence--the

equilibrium with respect to real rates of return, investment, and economic growth is invariant

with choices related to public debt.

        Another way to look at the results is in terms of quantities of safe assets. Government
         
bonds,  , are a form of safe asset, which pays the safe real interest rate,   . However, net taxes

owed to the government amount to a safe (that is, certain) liability--although the timing of taxes

is uncertain, the overall obligation has a fixed present value when evaluated using the rate rf.

Equation (24) implies that the net of the asset and liability is nil, implying no change in the

economy's net quantity of safe assets. In this sense, the presence of public debt does not mean

that safe assets are in positive net supply.

       The model can be extended to allow for a path of government purchases, Gt. Future

values Gt+1, Gt+2, ... are stochastic from the perspective of period t. These choices might reflect

war and peace, changing preferences for public programs, and so on. If Ponzi finance by the

government is still ruled out, the government's intertemporal budget constraint over an infinite

horizon in equation (24) becomes:


                                                 19
                                           
       (25)                                                 
                       =1[+-1 /(1 +  ) ] =  + =1[+-1 /(1 +  ) ].

                                                                                        
Equation (25) implies that the present value of taxes is no longer pegged to equal  . Instead,
                                                                 
as time evolves, the changing present value of taxes (above  ) reflects randomness in the

present value of government purchases.

       The equilibrium of the economy depends on the realization of Gt, the stochastic process

that generates future values Gt+1, Gt+2, ... and the ways that government purchases affect

household utility or production. The equilibrium also takes into account that Gt adds to Ct and It

as a use of current output, Yt. However, Ricardian Equivalence concerns effects from changes in

public debt and taxes for a given behavior of government purchases. That is, the issue is how the
                                        
economy responds to variations in  and the path of taxes (and budget deficits), for a given

path of Gt, Gt+1, ... In equation (25), the probability distribution of the present value

              
=1[+-1 /(1 +  ) ] is held fixed in this experiment, and the changes related to public debt

                                     
still have no impact on the net of  over the present value of taxes,               
                                                                     =1[+-1 /(1 +  ) ]


(although this net term is now random and does not equal zero). Therefore, as in the model that

excluded government purchases, these fiscal changes have no effect on the net wealth of the

representative agent, and Ricardian Equivalence holds.



V. Summary Observations

       The empirical pattern for several OECD countries back as far as 1870 indicates that the

familiar dynamic efficient condition r>g holds when g is the average growth rate of real GDP if

r is the average real rate of return on equity, re. The condition does not hold if r is the risk-free

rate, rf, proxied by the average real rate of return on Treasury Bills. This pattern accords with a

simple disaster-risk model calibrated to fit observed equity premia. The model features

                                                  20
stochastic depreciation of capital, with the potential for disaster events in which large portions of

capital are destroyed.

         As long as Ponzi-type finance for private agents and the government are precluded, the

equilibrium can feature a risk-free rate, rf, below the expected growth rate, E(g), and possibly

close to zero. (The model assumes that there do not exist real assets that deliver a positive, safe

real rate of return.) The result rfE(g) does not signal dynamic inefficiency. In contrast, the

inequality E(re)>E(g) is required for dynamic efficiency, implied by the model, and consistent

with the data. The model satisfies Ricardian Equivalence for public debt because, with Ponzi

finance by the government excluded, a rise in safe assets from increased government bonds is

matched by an increase in the safe (that is, certain) present value of liabilities associated with net

taxes.

         Alternative versions of the model that could be considered feature productivity shocks,

shifts in the relative cost of producing new capital goods, changes in the value (productivity) of

old capital, and variations in markup ratios. Another extension is the allowance for

heterogeneity across agents; for example, with respect to coefficients of relative risk aversion

and shocks to labor income. However, the present results for a representative-agent economy

provide a baseline setting for models that incorporate heterogeneity.

Stock return refers to broad stock-market indexes and includes dividends. Bill return refers to
short-term securities analogous to 3-month Treasury Bills. Bond return refers to government
bonds, typically with maturity around ten years. C refers to personal consumer expenditure.

Sample periods are 1870-2019 for annual real rates of return, 1870-2017 for annual growth rates
of per capita GDP and consumer expenditure, and 1880-2019 for population growth, unless a
different starting date for a variable is indicated in parentheses. Rates of return are calculated
arithmetically from nominal total returns divided by consumer price indexes. Data on total
nominal returns (including dividends paid on stocks) and consumer price indexes are mostly
from Global Financial Data. See the discussion of an earlier version of these data in Barro and
Ursúa (2008, Table 5). The long-term data on macroeconomic variables are updated versions of
those described in Barro and Ursúa (2008), available at scholar.harvard.edu/barro.

The samples are based on availability of long-term data for rates of return and macroeconomic
variables. Countries with long-term information that could not be used include Belgium and
Finland (missing information on consumer price indexes), Portugal (missing data on stock
returns and consumer price indexes), and Spain (missing data on stock returns, government bond
returns, and consumer price indexes).

For U.K. consols, the average real rate of return for 1870-2015 was 0.035. For U.S. high-grade
corporate bonds, the average real rate of return for 1870-2019 was 0.038. These results are
based on information in Global Financial Data.

*Excludes 1923.
**Based on stock-market index and estimated dividend yield, rather than a total-return index.

Notes:

The disaster probability, p, and the distribution of disaster sizes, d, come from an updated
version of the numbers in Barro and Ursúa (2008). Peak-to-trough contractions of real per capita
GDP of 10% or more were isolated for 185 cases, corresponding to data for 40 countries going
back as far as 1870 and up to 2012. For this sample, the average proportionate disaster size,
E(d), is 0.21 and the disaster probability, p (the chance of entering into a disaster state), is 0.040
per year. The objects E(1-d)-, E(1-d)1-, and E[d((1-d)-] equal 4.0, 2.3, and 1.7, respectively,
based on the histogram for observed disaster sizes and for a coefficient of relative risk aversion,
, of 3.5. This value of  generates an equity premium of 0.061 per year, close to that observed
empirically. The variance of the normal shock, 2, is set at 0.0004 per year to accord with the
observed annual volatility of real GDP growth. The deterministic part of the depreciation rate, ,
equals 0.05 per year, the average BEA number for the depreciation rate from 1948 to 2018 for
fixed assets (including government assets but excluding consumer durables other than residential
housing). The value for A, 0.12 per year, generates realistic levels of real rates of return, 0.062
per year for E(re) and 0.001 per year for rf. The values =0.04 per year and =0.5 determine the
gross saving and investment ratio, , to be 0.090 per year and the expected growth rate, E(g), to
be 0.032 per year (the long-run average growth rate of U.S. real GDP).
