                 THE SOCIAL COSTS OF MONOPOLY AND REGULATION

     When an industry is monopolized, price rises above and output

falls below the competitive level. Those who continue to buy the

product at the higher price suffer a loss, L in Figure 1, but this

loss is exactly offset by the additional revenue that the monopolist

obtains by charging the higher price. Other consumers, who are

deflected by the higher price to substitute goods, suffer a loss,

D, that is not offset by gains to the monopolist. This is the

"deadweight lossH from monopoly, and in conventional analysis the

only social cost of monopoly——L being regarded merely as a transfer

from consumers to owners of the monopoly seller. D, however,

           underestimates the social costs of monopoly. The existence

 of an opportunity to obtain monopoly profits will attract resources

 into efforts to obtain monopolies, and the opportunity costs of those

 resources are social costs of monopoly too.       Theft provides an

 instructive analogy. The transfer of wealth from victim to thief does

 not involve an artificial limitation of output,      but it does not

 follow that the social cost of theft is zero. The existence of the

opportunity to make such transfers draws resources into thieving and

in turn into protection against theft, and the opportunity costs of

the resources consumed are social costs of theft.

     This type of analysis has long been familiar in a few special contexts. For

example, Plant's criticism of the patent system, made a generation

ago, was based on the effect of the patent monopoly in drawing greater

resources into invention than into activities that yield only corn—

petitive returns.       And Telser's theory of resale price maintenance

was in the same vein.     However, although the tendency of monopoly

2.   If, however, a thief took three radios from a hcfne and on the way
out dropped one, which broke, this loss would correspond to the dead-
weight loss of monopoly.

rents to be transformed into costs is clearly no longer a novel
insight, its implications both for the measurement of the aggregate
social   costs of monopoly and for a variety of other important issues

relating to monopoly and public regulation (including tax policy)

continue to be ignored. Studies of the costs of monopoly still focus

exclusively on the deadweight loss (plus alleged consequences of

monopoly that have no firm theoretical basis, such as "X-inefficiency");

analyses of public policy toward monopolies (both private and govern-

mentally induced) continue to ignore the social costs involved in

obtaining monopoly power.

     The present paper is an effort to rectify this neglect. Part II

presents a simple model of the social costs of monopoly, conceived as

the sum of the deadweight loss and the additional loss resulting from

the competition to become a monopolist. Part III uses the model to

estimate the social costs of monopoly in the United States, and the

social   benefits of antitrust enforcement. Part IV explores   the implica-

tions of the   analysis for a variety of issues relating to monopoly
and public regulation, such as public policy toward price discrimination

and the choice between income and excise taxation.


                                   II.

     I make (and later will defend) two simplifying assumptions. The

first is that becoming a monopolist is a competitive activity and hence

that the expected profit from obtaining a monopoly is zero. Firms

seeking monopoly expend resources until the last dollar spent increases

the expected value of having a monopoly by one dollar. The second
                                                                                  4.




assumption is that the costs of becoming a monopolist are constant, so

that the sum of the opportunity costs of becoming a monopolist is equal

to the expected value of the monopoly.                       With these assumptions,

the total social costs of the monopoly depicted in Figure 1 are D +                    L.
     Since D =                  and L =            -

L are given by


           r      2(Qc_AQ)
This ratio can also be expressed in terms of the elasticity of demand

for the product in question at the competitive price (e), and the

percentage increase in price brought about by monopolization (p):

                                                                                   2
           E2(i)   E

     It may    be objected that the assumption that the monopolist's

price increase is determined independently of the elasticity of demand

is inconsistent with the assumption that he is a rational profit—

maximizer. Profit maximization does assume that the monopolist's

price is a function of the elasticity of the demand curve facing him,

but a firm's demand curve may be different from the industry's demand

curve, to which E          in   equation (2) refers. For example, the demand



6.   Another assumption, which does not affect the ana1ysis is that
the monopoly is enjoyed for one period only; otherwise the optimum
.'penditures on obtaining a monopoly could not be compared directly
with L in Figure 1.

only an approximation for nonlinear demand curves. The significance
of this qualification is consider later.

                                                                                            .

curve facing the individual seller in a cartelized industry will

almost certainly be more elastic than the demand curve for the

industry,because the cartel will not be able to eliminate all com-

petition among   its members. As a result, the actual prices charged

by the cartel will be lower than the profit-maximizing level as

determined with reference to the elasticity of the industry demand

curve. It seems quite likely that, due to the imperfections of

cartelization (especially in industries subject to the Sherman Act)

and of cartel-like forms of public regulation, the prices actually

charged in many monopolized industries will be lower than the optimum

monopoly price for the industry.

     From equation (2), it is plain that the ratio of the deadweight

loss of monopoly to the loss that results from the competition to

become a monopolist (what we may call the "additional loss" of monopoly)

is smaller, the less elastic the demand for the product in question

at the competitive price. For example, at c =      1,   a one per cent increase

in price over the competitive level will result in a deadweight loss

equal to about .5 per cent of the additional loss; at c =       2,   this

figure is about orper cent; at E   = --, it   is only about .025 per cent.

     C, the total social costs of monopoly, is equal to

          D+L=pR_PAQ=R(p_.cp2),!!                                       (3)

and is higher, the larger the scale of the industry as measured by its      S
sales revenues at the competitive output, and the less elastic the demand

for the product at that output. At c = 1, a one per cent increase in

price above the competitive level will yield a total social cost of

monopoly equal to .995 per cent of the industry's revenues at the

competitive price and level. At c = 2, the total social cost falls to

.99 per cent of the industry's revenues atthe competitive price and

level, while at c =    the percentage rises to .9975. The costs Qf
monopoly are maximized when demand is totally inelastic at the com-

petitive price.

      These formulas are accurate only for small changes in the price

levels for larger changes, e, which measures elasticity at a point,

can no longer be used. And monopolization might result in large price

increases. Hence the general formulas, (1) and/(3), remain important.       5
For purposes of empirical estimation, it will be helpful to derive

two additional formulas: one for the case where the deadweight loss,

the elasticity of demand, and the monopoly price increase are known

and the elasticity of demand is assumed to be constant, and the other

for the case where the monopoly price increase, the monopoly output,

and the elasticity of demand at the monopoly price are known and the

demand curve is assumed to the linear.

      A question aries whether, since a demand curve of constant

elasticity is nonlinear, the linear approximation of the deadweight

loss used in equations (5) and (6) introduces a source of serious

inaccuracy. It appears not to, at least in the simple case where

c =   1, and therefore

overestimates the deadweight loss, but not seriously.

       We now have two formulas for the ratio of the deadweight to the

additional loss from monopoly-—equations (5) and (ll)——and we ask:

how different are the estimates that they produce, under various assump-

tions as to the monopoly price increase and the elasticity of demand?

The answer is, not very, for price increases of less than 25 per cent,

and even for much larger price increases if the elasticity of demand is

no greater than one. These results are shown in Figure 2.

loss of monopoly, an estimate of the total social cost of monopoly.

Harberger, estimating an average monopoly price increase of about

six per cent and assuming that the elasticity of demand was constant

and equal to -1, found the deadweight loss from monopoly in the manu-

facturing sector to be equal to (at most) .1 per cent of GNP.

Harberger's (implicit) k is thus 1/1.06 or .9434, and from this and

his estimate of c, we calculate from equation (5) that the ratio of

0 to L in Harberger's analysis is .03. Hence if D is .1 per cent of

GNP, L is about 3.3 per cent and C about 3.4 per cent—-about $40

billion today. David Schwartzman used similar methods and found D

equal to about .1 per cent of GNP too.           But he assumed a price

increase of 8.3 per cent and an c =   -1.5.   Plugging these values into

equation (5) yields D/L =   .06.   Hence if D = .1 per cent of GNP, L =

1.7 per cent and C about 1.8 per cent.
     However, neither estimate can be taken seriously because both

Harberger and Schwartzman, in determining the monopoly price increase,

relied on rate-of-return statistics. Above-average rates of return

were used not only to identify the monopolized industries but also to

calculate the monopoly price increase. If the analysis in this paper

return      (assuming, realistically, that the investment which he

makes in obtaining the monopoly is written off over the life of the

monopoly). '11'        This point is distinct from the objections to Harberger's

procedure raised by Goerge Stigler: that monopoly profits are often

capitalized into the valuation of a firm's assets and that some of

the profits may be received as rents by suppliers of the firm's

inputs.

     The proper method of calculating the social costs of monopoly

(deadweight plus additional loss) is to obtain estimates of the mono-

poly price increase, and of the elasticity of demand at the relevant

points along the demand curve, from industry studies. An independent

estimate of the elasticity of demand would of course be unnecessary

if we could assume that, after the price increase, the price

charged was the optimum monopoly price; and where an independent

estimate of E     is   available, it can serve as a check on that assumption.

To illustrate, there have been a number of estimates of the percentage

by which CAB regulation has increased the price of airline travel. The

simple average of these estimates / —

is uncertainty in the market for becoming a monopolist.

17. Thus, if it costs $10 million to obtain a monopoly that will yield
a profit (net of the cost of production and sale) of $1 million a year
for 10 years, we can expect the annual expenses of the company to be
adjusted upward, by depreciation or other accounting techniques, by
$1 million a year throughout the 10-year period.

over competitive levels is assumed to raise the price of air travel

to the optimum monopoly level, then the elasticity of demand at

the monopoly price can be calculated from the formula which equates

marginal cost to marginal revenue,           MC =      + ). Since   MC =

   and    =
              6m'   c =   -2.5   at the monopoly price. An independent

estimate of the long-run elasticity of demand for air travel made by

Houthakker and Taylor is -2.36,          which is virtually identical t.c

our calculation.

     We havE two choices now. We can assume constant elasticity and

solve for OIL using equation (5'), or we can assume a linear demand

curve and solve for Oil., using equation (10'). With the assumption of

constant elasticity, D       2.04 L, and (from equation (6')) it is readily

calculable that the total social cost of the airline monopoly is

approximately equal to 2.48 times the total revenue at the monopoly

price.

     However, the assumption of a linear demand curve seems more plaus-

ible than the assumption of constant elasticity, especially for large

relative price increases, which one expects to find associated with a

rising elasticity of demand as substitutes become increasingly attractive.



20. This was essentially the procedure used by David Kamerschen, in An
Estimation of the Welfare Losses from Monopoly in the American Econciy,
4 W. Econ. J. 221 (1966), to estimate the deadweight loss from monopoly
in manufacturing. He has been criticized, and rightly so, for assuming
that firms in concentrated industries subject to the Sherman Act's
prohibition of collusive pricing are typically able to charge the
profit-maximizing monopoly price.

21. H. S. Houthakker & Lester D. Taylor, Consumer Demand in the United
States, 1929-1970, at 124 (1966). This must be the elasticity of demand
at the regulated price, since only a small part of the airline indus-
try is not subject to CAB regulation.
                                                                       14.



  And if equations (10') and (11') are used, D is one half as great
                                                                    as
  L, and C is equal to 20 per cent of the total revenues of the indus-

  try at the monopoly price. Still, this
                                              indicates a very large social
  loss from the regulation_induced
                                     airline monopoly.

       The foregoing exercise brings out an important general point that

 has been completely ignored in previous studies of the cost of monopoly

 to the economy: much of this cost
                                       probably originates in the regulated
 sector of the economy. The ability of firms to maintain supracompetjtjve

 prices must be greater in industries in
                                              which a regulatory agency limits
 entry and price competition than in the manufacturing sector where

 express collusion is forbidden by the Sherman Act.      Yet all of the
 previous studies of the cost of
                                   monopoly to the economy have been based

 on supposed monopoly pricing in manufacturing alone.

      Table 2 collects estimates of the
                                             regulation—induc price increase,
and the elasticity of demand at the current price, for several industries

for which these data are available.     Two estimates of elasticity are

given; one (ci) is derived from the price-Increase data, on the

tion that the industry is
                          charging the optimum monopoly price,and the
other (c2) is an independent estimate of elasticity. The estimates

of the total social costs of the
                                   regulation in question, which appear
in the last two columnsof the table,
                                               are based on the assumption
that the industry's demand curve is linear in the relevant region, and

are expressed as a percentage of the total revenues of the industry.

Our airline example appears in the last row of the table.

     These estimates are crude, although they have the virtue of being

improvable. They do suggest, however, that the social costs of regula-

tion are probably extremely high, given that about 17 per cent of GNP

comes from industries such as agriculture, transportation, communica-

tions, power, banking, insurance, and medical services that contain

the sorts of controls over competition that might be expected to lead

to supracompetitive prices.    True, a much higher percentage of GNP--

30 per cent——originates in manufacturing and mining, a highly concen-

trated sector of the economy, and the conventional wisdom associates

high concentration with supracompetitive pricing. But only about a

fifth of the output of this sector comes from industries in which four

firms account for 60 per cent or more of sales, and there is little

theoretical basis for believing that the sellers in less concentrated

industries could collude effectively without engaging in behavior pro-

hibited by the Sherman Act. ?_1 Not all violations of the Sherman Act

are detected and punished, of course, but the secret conspiracies

that escape detection are probably not very effective-—even the great

electrical conspiracy, a highly elaborate and long-continued conspiracy


23. This figure may seem an overstatement, since not all of the markets
in the regulated industries are in fact subject to the relevant regula-
tory controls (almost half of the trucking industry, for example, is
exempt from regulation by the ICC). On the other hand, tariffs and
similar restrictions (g,, the oil import quotas) are excluded from
the estimate of the percentage of GNP affected by regulation.

24. Thus, Kessel's study of underwriting costs shows that an increase
beyond eight in the number of bids does not reduce those costs; and
an industry where the four largest firms have less than 60 per cent of
the market is apt to contain at least eight significant competitors.

                                                              raising
 the price level by only 8.8 per cent on average.        It seems highly

 unlikely that the price level of the manufacturing and mining sector

 as a whole is more than about two per cent above the

 Assume that it is two, and that the average elasticity of demand for the

 products of this sector, at current prices, is -1.1607.        Then, from
 equation (10), the total social costs of monopoly in this sector are 1.9

 per cent of the total revenues generated in the sector,
                                                           and while this is
 substantial, it amounts to a total dollar loss
                                                  substantially smaller
 than that generated in the regulated sector.

26. If it  is assumed that only in industries where the four-firm con-
centration ratio exceeds .6 is effective undetectable collusion likely,
and that it allows these industries to
                                        maintain, on average, prices five
per cent above the competitive level, while in the rest of the manufac-
turing and mining sector the average price level is only one per cent
above the competitive level, then average prices for the entire sector
would only be 1.83 per cent above the competitive price level. (Statistics
on the distribution of output among industries in different four-firm
concentration ratio groups are from the 1963 Census of Manufacturers.)

27. This figure is a simple average of the long-run price elasticities
for nine product groups within the manufacturing and mining sector
estimated by Houthakker & Taylor, supra note 21, at 72, 74, 83, 112-14,
116, 128—31.

 28. The simple average of the social—cost estimates presented in Table
 2 is 20.4 per cent of the total revenues of the
                                                 regulated industry.
Assuming that 50 per cent of the output of that sector is produced in
markets that are regulated in a manner similar to the industries in
Table 2 and that the average social cost of regulation in each such
market is 20.4 per cent of total revenue, then it would follow that the
social costs of regulation were equal to 1.7 per cent of GNP, while the
social costs of monopoly in manufacturing and mining would be equal to
only .6 per cent of GNP. These estimates exclude, of course, the admin-
istrative costs of regulation and antitrust enforcement in the two sectors
respectively, and the benefits of monopoly. The benefits are likely to
be greater in the manufacturing and
                                     mining sector, where much concentration
and the resulting monopoly pricing may be due to efficiencies of various

     Another use    to   which the analysis developed here can be put is

estimating the social benefits of the antitrust laws. Table 3, which

is constructed on the same basis as Table 2, presents estimates of the

social    costs of several cartels not subject to the prohibitions of
the American antitrust laws.

      Presumably, collusive price increases of this magnitude, and the

 attendant very substantial social costs, are deterred by the American

 antitrust laws. However, a complete cost-benefit analysis of antitrust

 law would also require estimation of (1) the costs of administering

the antitrust laws and (2) the large social
                                              costs imposed by the many

perverse applications of those laws, which may be an inevitable by-

product of having antitrust laws.

     The conclusions that emerge from our estimation exercises are

necessarily tentative; they are that:

     1. the social costs of public regulation, in
                                                   increasing prices
     in the regulated industries above competitive levels, are
     probably very great--perhaps two per cent of our entire GNP;

     2. the social costs of monopoly in
                                         manufacturing and mining
     are, in contrast, probably much smaller even though a larger
     sector of the economy is affected;

     3. the enforcement of the antitrust laws against cartels has
     probably generated large social-cost savings, but at what
     cost we do not know.


                                    B

     The validity of the approach of this paper, and of the estimates

presented in the preceding subpart, depend, of course, on the soundness

of our basic assumptions that the market for becoming a monopolist is a
                                                                   20.




 competitive one and that marginal costs in that market are constant;

 and it is time we examined those
                                     assumptions critically. The first
 is a standard assumption of economics, and, pending better evidence

 than we have, seems reasonable in the present context. Anyone can

 try to obtain a patent, a certificate of public convenience and

 necessity, a television license, a minimum—wage law, and anyone can

 try to enter a cartelized industry, or if he is a member of such an

 industry try to engross a greater share of the monopoly profits of

 the industry. To be sure, where there are no barriers to entry the

expenditure of resources on becoming a monopolist will lead to an

increase in the output of the market and a consequent reduction in

price. But these situations are properly analyzed as ones where the

expected monopoly profits are small and hence where the social costs

of monopoly are small too.

     As one example of the mechanisms by which the potential transfer

of wealth from    consumers to the owners of a monopolistic firm is

transformed into a social cost, consider
                                           nonprice competition in the

airline industry. Assume that the CAB places a floor under airline

prices that exceeds the marginal cost of
                                           providing air transportation
under competitive conditions. If the regulation is not anticipated, the

situation initially is as depicted in Figure 3, and is unstable. Since

there are several airlines, and nonprice competition is not constrained,

the airlines will expend resources
                                     on such competition (better service,

etc.) until the marginal costs of air transportation rise to the level

(p in Figure 3) where the industry is earning only a normal return.

 (Judging from the profit statements and stock prices of the regulated

airlines, their return is indeed no higher than normal.)     By this

process, the monopoly profit initially generated by the regulatory

price floor--the shaded rectangle-—is transformed into higher costs

The demand curve shifts to the right because the increased

tures on service presumably improve the product from the standpoint

of the consumer. The shift produces some additional consumer surplus

but not enough to offset the higher costs—-otherwise the higher level
of service would have been provided without the spur of monopoly
pricing.
      This discussion suggests an   important (and familiar) point about

expenditures on monopolizing. If for some reason the free market is

not expected to produce the optimum output of a particular good or

service, the creation of a monopoly in that market may, by attracting




29. This does suggest, however, that not all of the social costs of
airline regulation estimated in Part III A, supra, represent pure waste.

 additional resources into the market, result in the correct output

of the good. This is the economic justification of the patent system

and the (nonmonopolistic) explanation for resale price maintenance;

it is not a justification for the regulation of the airline industry.

     Observe that if the regulatory price floor had been anticipated,

the initial cost curve in Figure 3 would be incorrectly drawn. The

airlines would have bid away the anticipated monopoly profits in

jockeying for admission to the regulatory cartel.

     Figure 3 also illustrates the second critical assumption underlying

our analysis, the constancy of the marginal costs of becoming a mono-

polist.      The assumption seems appropriate in most contexts——there

seems little reason to believe that obtaining monopolies involves the

use of resources the long—run supply of which is inelastic. Some

exceptions are discussed in the next part of the paper.

     How is the analysis affected if there is uncertainty in the activity

of becoming a monopolist or if bribery is the method used to obtain the

monopoly? Given uncertainty, the expected monopoly profits of any

firm seeking a monopoly will be smaller than the actual monopoly profits,

and therefore the expenditures of each firm will also be smaller than

the actual monopoly profits. Suppose ten firms are vying for a monopoly

having a present value of $1 million and each of them has an equal

chance of obtaining it.   If risk neutral, each will spend $100,000

(assuming constant costs) on trying to obtain the monopoly. Only one



30. With rising marginal costs, the total social costs of becoming a
monopolist would be less than the private social costs = expected
monopoly profits; the difference would be rents received by suppliers
of resources specialized to the activity of obtaining monopolies.

 will succeed, and his costs will be much smaller than the monopoly

 profits. But the total costs of obtaining the
                                                 monopoly--counting
 losers' expenditures as well as winners'--wil] be the same as under

 certainty——$l million.

      If we assume that the market for monopoly is characterized by a

 high degree of uncertainty--a plausible assumption--we can explain

why the costs of obtaining a monopoly have largely eluded observation.

Most of the costs are incurred in unsuccessful efforts to obtain a

monopoly--the lobbying campaign that fails, the unsuccessful attempt

to obtain a bank charter or form a cartel. This point also suggests

that the use of above-average accounting rates of return to identify

(though not measure) monopoly power may not be entirely unsound after

all. The firm (or industry) that obtains monopoly under conditions

of uncertainty will, like the winner of a lottery, enjoy windfall

profits ex post.

     It might seem that where monopoly is obtained by bribery of

government officials, the additional loss of monopoly with which this

paper is concerned would be eliminated--a bribe is a pure transfer.

But this conclusion would be incorrect.   Bribery merely shifts the

monopoly profits from the monopolist to the officials receiving the

bribe, and draws real resources into the activity of becoming an

offical who is in a position to receive these bribes.

     The analysis of the costs of monopoly presented in this paper has

implications for a number of issues of public policy.

      1.   In a recent paper Comanor and Smiley attempt to show that a

 large part of the inequality in the distribution of wealth in contem-

 porary America is attributable to monopoly.        They use the Harberger
 and other studies discussed in Part III of this paper to determine the

 aggregate wealth transfer from consumers to the owners of monopoly firms,

 and by a series of additional assumptions
                                             concerning the incomes of

 consumers and shareholders, family size, the savings rate, etc., derive

 an estimate of the distributive impact of
                                             monopoly. Many of the assump-
 tions are questionable but even if their correctness were conceded the

 conclusion would be wrong. There is no reason for thinking that mono-

poly has a significant distributive effect. Consumers' wealth is not

transferred to the shareholders of monopoly firms; it is dissipated in

the purchase of inputs into the activity of becoming a monopolist.

     2, Oliver Williamson has argued that the refusal of the courts to

recognize a defense of economies of scale in merger cases under the

Clayton Act is questionable because, under plausible assumptions con-

cerning the elasticity of demand, only a small reduction in the merging

firms' costs is necessary to offset any deadweight loss created by the

price increase that the merger enables the firms to make.        The

nature of the comparison is shown in Figure 4.

        This analysis is incomplete, however. The expected profits of

the merger—-ABEF-—will generate an equivalent amount of costs as

firms   vie, through service competition or whatever, to engross these
profits (alternatively, the merging firms might expend resources equal
to the rectangle in attempting to negotiate the merger, convince the

government to permit them to make it, or contest an antitrust case

brought to prevent or undo the merger). The total social cost of the

merger, at least as a first approximation, is ABEF + BCD and exceeds

the cost savings (GDEF) made possible by the merger. Of course, the

curves could be drawn in such a way that the merger would generate net

cost savings. My point is only that there is no presumption that anti-

competitive mergers generate net savings and this, combined with the

high cost of litigating issues of cost savings, provides some justifica-

tion   for the refusal of the courts to admit a defense of efficiencies
in   a Clayton Act merger case.

       3.    It   is   frequently   argued that the antitrust laws should not

concern     themselves with practices that are merely methods of price
discrimination, since there is no basis for thinking that discrimination

                                                    may reduce it (to
 zero, if discrimination is perfect).         The conclusion may be

 justifiable by reference to the costs of
                                              administering antidiscrjmjna—
 tion rules, but the basis on which it has been defended by its pro-

 ponents is incorrect. Even when price discrimination is perfect, so

 that the deadweight loss of monopoly is zero, the total social costs

 of a discriminating monopoly are greater than those of a single—price

 monopoly.         This is because, under perfect. price

 (see Figure 1).

        4. It is widely believed that the case for antitrust enforcement

 has been gravely weakened by the theory of the second best. The theory

 teaches that the elimination of one monopoly in an economy containing

other   monopolies (or other sources of divergence between price and
marginal cost , such as taxation) may reduce the efficiency of resource
allocation;   hence antitrust enforcement may increase rather than reduce

D. The true economic basis for antitrust
                                              enforcement, however, is not
D but D +    L, and we have seen that under plausible assumptions as to

the elasticity of demand D is only a small fraction of D +
                                                                   L,   at least
for moderate increases in price above the competitive level. The social

costs measured by L, like the social costs of theft, are largely unaffected

by the existence of second—best problems.



33. This is a major theme in Ward S. Bowman, Jr., Patent and Antitrust
Law (1973).

34.  I abstract from the costs of
                                  administering the price-discrimination
scheme; these increase the costs of discriminating
                                                   monopoly relative to
those of a nondiscriminating monopoly.

        This discussion implies that monopolizing would be a socially

 undesirable activity even if D were zero, and this is correct. Criminal

 or socially undesirable activity may in fact be defined as activity

 that does not add to the social wealth, but
                                                 merely transfers it invol-
 untarily. --"    Monopoly, like theft, is unproductive of anything other

 than involuntary wealth transfers, and hence any resources devoted to

 obtaining monopoly are socially wasted.

       5. The analysis in this paper suggests a possible explanation

 for the positive correlation that has been found between concentration

and advertising (I assume, without much conviction, that the studies

finding such a correlation will withstand the assaults of their critics).

It may be easier to collude on price than on the amount of advertising.

Although there is no great trick to establishing an agreed-upon level

of advertising and detecting departures from it, the incentives to violate

any such agreement are strong because the gains from a successful adver-

tising campaign may be difficult to offset imediately and hence offer

promise of a more durable advantage than a price cut would.
                                                                 If so, the
situation is similar to nonprice competition in the airline industry.

Price is fixed by the cartel but the level of advertising is not, or

at least not effectively. As a result, the monopoly profits generated

by   the cartel price are   transformed into additional expenditures on


35. Some pure wealth transfers may, of course, be socially desirable.
But presumably public redistribution is both more efficient and more
equitable than the redistribution brought about by criminal activity.

patent monopolies.

advertising. Therefore we can expect, other things being equal, to

find more advertising in cartelized than in competitive industries.

     6. In discussions of the "social
                                          responsibility" of large corpora-
tions, it is generally assumed that a firm (or a group of firms) having

some monopoly power could decide to incur somewhat higher costs in

order to discharge its social responsibilities, without courting bank-

ruptcy. Thus, glancing back at Figure 1, even if MC rose to P, the

firm would still be covering its costs.    However, if the analysis in

this paper is correct, and the expected profits of monopolizing are

zero, it follows that the entire area L in Figure 1 will represent

fixed costs to the firm, unless the monopoly was obtained under con-

ditions of uncertainty. In the latter case the fixed costs will be

somewhat lower, but in the former case any increase in MC will place

the firm in danger of bankruptcy.

     7. If one views the activity of obtaining monopolies as a competi-

tive industry, the amount and social costs of monopoly are as shown in

Figure 5.

        The number of potential monopolies in the economy is plotted on

 the horizontal axis and the value of each monopoly on the vertical.

 The demand curve has a negative slope,
                                          on the theory that there is
 not an unlimited supply of lucrative monopolies. Our earlier assump-

 tion of constant costs is abandoned, and the
                                                supply (marginal cost)
 curve is shown as having a positive slope.

        The intersection of the demand and supply curves determines the

 output of monopolies (Q). The total revenues of monopoly, VQ (equivalent

 to L in Figure 1), are equal to the total private (although now not the

 total social) costs of the activity of
                                          obtaining monopolies.      It is

 plain from Figure 5 that the social costs of monopoly can be reduced in

any of three ways: by reducing the average value of a monopoly (as

by eliminating regulatory barriers to entry); by increasing the marginal

costs of obtaining a monopoly; and by reducing the elasticity of the

supply of inputs into that activity.

        This analysis provides a framework for analyzing a variety of public

policy issues, such as the recurrent proposal to
                                                    replace the present
method of assigning television licenses (awarded to the applicant who

convinces the FCC in a formal hearing of his
                                                superior ability to serve
the "public interest") by an auction system. This proposal is frequently

supported on distributive grounds--why should the licensee rather than

the public receive the rents due to the limited amount of

spectrum that has been allocated for television? This

 a nondistributive justification for the auction proposaL The auction
 would substitute a transfer payment for a real
                                                cost--the expenditures
 on the hearing process by competing applicants. To be sure, there

 is a danger that the auction mechanism might be subverted by expendi-

 tures designed to rig the bidding. An applicant would be willing to

 expend in real resources up            to the amount of the transfer

 that would be necessary to obtain the license, in order to obtain the

 license without having to make the transfer. However, such expendi-

 tures could be discouraged by
                                 appropriate legal penalties. ---''   The
 objective of punishment would be to increase the expected costs of

 obtaining the license (other than by an honest bid), which includes any

expected punishment costs, to the point where the applicants are induced

to make the costless transfer rather than
                                             to expend real resources on
trying to obtain the license outside of the auction
                                                        process.

activity. However, at least in principle, the private marginal cost
of criminal activity can be raised to arbitrarily high levels far
exceeding the expected value of that activity to the criminal, at
negligible cost, by establishing a schedule of penalties that are so
severe that even though only slight resources are devoted to detection
and punishment of criminals the
                                expected punishment cost faced by the
criminal is so large as to deter him. See Gary S. Becker, Crime and
Punishment: An Economic Approach, 76 J. Pol. Econ. 169 (1968).

 infringement, reduce the level of such expenditures, in much the same

 way as the existence of legal penalties for theft
                                                     reduces the level
 of resources that people devote to
                                      protecting their property from
 thieves.

      An interesting method of reducing the social costs of monopoly is

 used, perhaps unwittingly, by labor unions.    The existence of a monopoly

 wage might be expected to induce the expenditure of more and more

 resources by workers seeking entry to the union, until the expected

 benefits of union membership were reduced to zero. However, unions

 traditionally have rationed membership in a way that greatly reduces

 the marginal benefits of expenditures
                                         on obtaining membership, and hence
 the resources expended in that
                                  pursuit, by conditioning membership on
a status that is difficult or impossible for
                                                the job seeker to buy at

any price--such as being white, or the son of a union member, or an

apprentice for seven years. --"     In the limit, this method of
                                                                 rationing
would reduce the elasticity of the supply of inputs into obtaining

union membership, and hence the social costs of labor monopolies excluding

deadweight loss, to zero. Thus, the costs of labor
                                                      monopolies may
be   lower than the costs of other types of monopoly, even for the

equivalent price increases and scale of activity, because other markets

in monopoly have not used such efficient () methods
                                                    of rationing
monopoly power.



40. The use of these methods by unions
                                        is being increasingly limited
by government regulations designed to eliminate racial discrimination.

is   assumed to be less than that of an excise tax: the cross—

elasticity of demand between work and leisure Is assumed to be lower

than that between a coninodity and its substitutes. Even if this Is

correct, it does not follow that the total social costs of collecting

a given amount of   revenue by means of an income tax are lower than
those of   an excise tax. The amount of the tax transfer-—I in Figure

6--represents   potential gain to the taxpayer, and he will expend real

resources on trying to avoid the tax until, at the margin, cost and

gain are equated. The critical question in comparing the costs of

income and excise taxation, therefore, is the shape and location of

the marginal cost curves for avoiding income tax liability and excise

tax liability, respectively. In the case of a highly progressive

income tax system in which expenses for the production of income are


                                                                          S

ductible, the comparison is likely to be distinctly unfavorable to

income taxation. Imagine that the marginal income tax rate in the

highest bracket is 90 per cent (as it once was in this country).

Then the taxpayer will continue expending resources on tax avoidance

until the expected value of a dollar so expended falls below ten

cents; conceivably, he might spend as much as ten times his tax

liability in order to reduce that liability to zero. How much he

would actually spend would depend on the location and shape of the

supply surve for avoidance, but, as shown in Figure 7, his expendi-

tures could easily exceed his tax liability (the I of Figure 6).
