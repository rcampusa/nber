                    WHY ARE THERE SO FEW BLACK
                            ENTREPRENEURS?


                              ABSTRACT

    Black   entrepreneurship has been unsuccessful in the U.S. The
fraction of employed blacks that work in their own businesses is
about one—third that of whites. Other measures of success such as
net income, number of employees, and form of organization show
large differences between blacks and whites. This paper examines
explanations for these differences, particularly focusing on the
frequently cited economic explanations of liquidity constraints
and consumer discrimination. Liquidity constraints are examined
by estimating logit equations for who is self—employed in a
cross-section and who becomes self-employed in a panel. These
estimates suggest that net worth is not an important determinant
of the racial differences in self-employment. An examination of
small business starting capital indicates that little capital is
needed to start most business and beginning entrepreneurs do not
usually borrow. Examining the industrial distribution of black
and white businesses, I do not find a greater relative
representation of blacks in industries requiring less starting
capital. I also examine if black businesses are relatively more
common in industries where white customers more frequently
patronize black businesses. Little support is found for this
hypothesis. I conclude that cultural differences may explain
black/white differences in self—employment, but this explanation
requires further study.

                                            1. Introduction
        Black entrepreneurship has not been successful in the United States. The 1980 Census
indicated that 13.3 percent of employed white males worked in their own businesses, while 4.3
percent of black males did. Net income for black owned businesses is on average 35 percent of that
of white male businesses. There are also enormous differences between black and white businesses
in mean receipts and the number of employees.
        These differences should be a source of concern for several reasons. First, self.employment
has been frequently proposed as a route Out of poverty and is currently being promoted by many
states and the federal government as a way to leave the welfare and unemployment insurance rolls.
Second, it is often argued that self-employment provides a safety valve for those who are unable to
obtain jobs elsewhere, due to discrimination, high unemployment, or other reasons. Third, small
businesses are often perceived as a source of dynamism and growth in the economy. It is frequently
argued that small businesses create a disproportionate share of new jobs and innovations.' Fourth,
small business owners have an important affect on political decisions in the U.S.2 The lack of black

businesses means greater inequality in political power. Furthermore, the dearth of black businesses
is behind the tensions between groups of blacks and ethnic Store owners in many cities.

       This paper begins by documenting the vast differences between blacks and whites in the
number and earnings of entrepreneurs. The differences in self-employment rates are shown to be
large using several independent data sources. I show that measures of success such as number of
employees and business receipts are also very different for blacks and whites. I then examine
explanations for these differences, focusing on the frequently cited economic explanations of liquidity
constraints and consumer discrimination. Liquidity constraints are examined by estimating logit
equations for who is self-employed in a cross-section and who becomes self-employed in a paneL
These estimates suggest that net worth is not an important determinant of the racial differences in
self-employment. Little capital is needed to start most business and beginning entrepreneurs do not
usually borrow. Additionally, the industrial distribution of black and white businesses does not

indicate a greater relative representation of blacks in industries requiring less starting capital.
Consumer discrimination can also be examined using the industrial distribution of black and white
businesses. I examine if black businesses are relatively more common in industries where white

customers more frequently patronize black businesses. Little support is found for this hypothesis.
I conclude that cultural differences may explain black/white differences in self-employment, but this

explanation requires further study.


                                       2. Liquidity Constraints
        Numerous authors have argued that low black assets and discrimination in lending have been
responsible for low black self-employment rates.3 Blacks on average have very low assets relative
to whites. Blau and Graham (1990) report that studies comparing the two groups find black/white
asset ratios of .08 to .19. Their own unadjusted ratio for households with a primary respondent age
24 to 34 in 1976 or 1978 is .18. These black/white ratios are strikingly low and suggest that the
liquidity constraints hypothesis needs further investigation.
    Several authors have emphasized the role of an individual's assets in the decision to become self-
employed. Examples are Evans and Jovanovic (1989), Evans and Leighton (1989) and Blanchflower
and Oswald (1990). It has also been argued that limited access to credit has prevented minorities




    3Examples are Bates (1985a), Chen and Cole (1988) and Small Business Administration
(1988).

   41n the Survey of Income and Program Participation data, which include detailed questions
about several dozen categories of assets and debts, I find a ratio of .21 for those households with
head age 24 to 34. For all households I find .26, a ratio which tends to rise with age (across
cohorts) at least until age 65.

    5Blanchflower and Oswald (1990), which analyzes British data, is particularly interesting for
two reasons. First, their measure of assets is gifts and inheritances so it is arguably exogenous to
the decision to enter self-employment. Second, they find an effect of assets that is quantitatively
large as well as being statistically significant.
                                                   3
from starting businesses. An example of the small literature on lending discrimination and minority
businesses is Ando (1988).6

     Alternatively, Light (1972), Sowell (1981), and others argue that lending by formal institutions
is not very important in the establishment of small businesses. They argue that people usually do not
borrow to set up a business, and when they do, they mainly borrow from friends and relatives. Sowell
argues that the degree of cohesion within a community will affect the ability to borrow. The lender
needs to know that the borrower is worthy of credit (and maybe also be able to monitor the
borrower'a effort).


                              3. Theories of Consumer Discrimination
       Many people have argued that low black self.employment rates are due to consumer
discrimination, while others have suggested that consumer discrimination might be important, but have

not necessarily endorsed the view that it is a primary cause.7 Consumer discrimination models have
characterized some whites as being only willing to purchase a product from some blacks at a price
lower than they would pay whites. Becker (1971) suggests that this type of consumer discrimination
is likely to be important in retailing and the professions. He also argues that it is likely to be more
important in jobs where there is substantial contact between blacks and whites.
    In his survey, Cain (1986) argues that consumer discrimination is not important in explaining
black/white earnings differences because blacks could easily find employment in jobs where there is
little contact with consumers. This argument seems to be right for discrimination against wage and
salary workers. However, the vast majority of the self.employed are sole proprietors who necessarily
have substantial contact with customers. Thus, consumer discrimination might have a great effect on




    6Ando (1988) finds that black men in her sample have a 12.8 percent lower loan acceptance
rate, and black women have a 15.5 percent lower loan acceptance rate than nonminority men.
However, this evidence is weak because the sample is small and highly unrepresentative. The
data come from a sample which had a cumulative nonresponse rate (through two stages) of 97
percent.
   7See Moore (1983), Chen and Cole (1988), and Borjas and Bronars (1989).
                                                    4
 the self-employed exactly for the reason it may have little effect on wage earners. One might expect

 consumer discrimination to be more important in industries where it is difficult to verify the quality
 of the product or service sold. In these industries it is likely that prejudiced individuals would not
obtain evidence to weaken their prejudices.

     In a recent paper, Boijas and Bronars (1989) argue that the low black self-employment rate is
due to consumer discrimination. They claim that consumer discrimination will lead more able whites

and less able blacks to become self-employed. They argue that positive selection in an earnings
equation for the white self-employed and negative selection for the black self-employed is a test of
this hypotheses. The test is not completely convincing in that it depends on normal error terms and
the exclusion of variables measuring the local labor market conditions from the wage equation. The

test is also a general test of negative selection for blacks, rather than a test of consumer
discrimination per se.

     Coate and Tennyson (1989) make an argument similar to Borjas and Bronars. They claim that
labor market discrimination can push lower ability minorities to find jobs as entrepreneurs. This
lower quality will be recognized by the credit markets which will raise the interest rate charged to
minorities when they borrow to start a business. They argue that in equilibrium, labor market
discrimination can reduce the self-employment rate of minorities. They point Out that their argument
can also hold if consumers recognize the lower quality of minorities entering self-employment and
lower the price they are willing to pay for their products.
    On the other hand, many authors have argued that labor market discrimination will push those
discriminated against into self-employment where an individual's return would depend directly on his

or her ability. This argument is supported by anecdotal evidence about the history of Chinese and
Japanese immigrants to the U.S. in Light (1972).

                                            4.   Data sources
        This paper primarily uses data from two sources: the 1984 Panel of the Survey of Income and
Program Participation (SIPP), and the 1982 Characteristics of Business Owners (CBO). The Survey
of Income and Program Participation is a longitudinal survey conducted by U. S. Bureau of the
Census. In the 1984 Panel, approximately 20.000 households9 (50,000 people of all ages in total)
were interviewed nine times over a three year period.'0 The multi-stage stratified sample was
selected to represent the noninstitutional population. The intervie took place between October
1983 and August 1986. Each interview asked about earnings and other income sources during the
previous four month period. Detailed information was given about the two wage and salary jobs and
two self employment jobs at which an individual worked the most hours during the survey period.
Two supplemental surveys provide detailed information about assets and liabilities. Questions are
asked about 20 types of assets and a dozen types of liabilities. The quality of the asset information
is one of the key reasons for using SIPP."
     The 1982 Characteristics of Business Owners data combines information from the Surveys of
Minority-Owned Business Enterprises (SMOBE) and the Survey of Women-Owned Business (WOB)
with information from a mail survey. SMOBE and WOB are a combination of IRS and Social
Security Administration supplied information and Census Bureau Economic Census data. The IRS
provides the Census Bureau with the name, address and employer identification number of the firm;
social security numbers of the owners, partners or shareholders (up to 10 partners or shareholders
per firm); principal industrial activity code; dollar receipts; and legal form of organization. The IRS
does this for businesses filing forms 1040. Schedule C (sole proprietorships), 1065 (partnerships), or
1 120S (Subchapter S corporations). Using the social security number (SSN) from the IRS. the Social
Security Administration supplies the racial information filled out when the individual originally applied

for a SSN. Prior to 1981, applicants for a SSN would categorize their race as (a) white. (b) black.


    Budget cuts reduced the sample by about 20% halfway through the sample period.
    '°One.fourth of the sample was only interviewed 8 times.

 or (c) other. In 1981 the racial categories were expanded, but the Census Bureau used a mail canvas
 to obtain information on groups other than whites and blacks. The Census Bureau Economic Census

 files then provide the SIC code, geographic code, legal form of organization code, receipts, and
 number of employees and annual payroll for firms with paid employees.
     This SMOBE and WOB data is supplemented by a mail survey Sent to approximately 25,000

 business owners in each of five panels: non-Hispanic white-male, black, women, Hispanic, and other
 minority. The sample was stratified by state, snd 2-digit SIC. About eighty percent of those mailed
 surveys responded)2 The survey was sent out in 1986 but asks questions about 1982. The survey
contains detailed questions about starting capital, sources of funds, the fraction of customers and
employees that are minorities, net income, length of ownership, age, sex, marital status, education,
work experience, and other matters. The data cover all industries except
agricultural production, railroads, and public administration. Businesses with sales less than $500, and
businesses with more than nine partners or shareholders are also excluded)3 The micro data from
the survey are not publicly available. The analysis below uses Special tabulations by 2-digit industry
done under contract by the Census Bureau.


                   5. Statistical Summary of Black and White Self-Employment


SELF-EMPLOYMENT RATES

        Blacks, other minorities and women all tend to have lower self-employment rates than white

males. Table 1 gives self-employment rates from the 1980 Census of Population for several racial and
ethnic groups, for both men and women. The self-employment rate is calculated as the fraction of
all those working who are self-employed. The numbers in this table include agricultural self-
employment.




    '2See Nucci (1989), p. 12.

    13See Nucci (1989).
                                                  7
     The black self-employment rate for males of 4.3 percent is less than ne-third that of whites
which is 13.3 percent. The number for black women is also about one-third the figure for white
women. Those of Spanish origin have self-employment rates about one-half the white rate, while
Asians have self-employment rates similar to those of whites, with Asian women being self-employed

at a higher rate than white women.
     The numbers reported in Table 2, from the Surveys of Minority-Owned Business Enterprises and

the Survey of Women Owned Businesses, suggest an even worse picture for black and Hispanic
entrepreneurship.14 These numbers suggest that blacks are less than one-fourth as likely and
Hispanics are less than one-third as likely to be entrepreneurs as white males. Table 3 presents
analogous self-employment rates from the 1984 Panel of the Survey of Income and Program
Participation.15 The SIPP numbers are sample counts rather than population estimates. I have
excluded those working in agriculture and those not working full-time. An individual is classified as
self-employed if he or she worked a majority of hours in self-employment. Most full-time workers
had only self-employment hours or wage and salary hours and not both, as can be seen by the
relatively small number of side businesses reported in Table 3.


SELF-EMPLOYMENT EARNINGS
    Not only are there proportionately fewer black owned businesses than white ones, but those
blacks who do become self-employed seem to fare worse than white entrepreneurs. This section
describes the earnings of black businesses, while later sections analyze other measures of business
success. Table 4 reports the number and mean net income before taxes of white-male, black and
Hispanic owned businesses for 1-digit SIC industries. These




    t4The numerator of the self-employment rate is slightly different from that in Table 1 because
agricultural production is excluded, and the numbers are a count of businesses so they include
side businesses with receipts over $500. The denominator also excludes those in the armed
forces.

   'These tabulations and all others below from SIPP exclude entirely imputed observations.
                                                    8
  comparisons unfortunately combine differences between blacks and whites and men and wnmen.
  Even allowing for this, they suggest an enormous difference between the profits of black and white
 owned businesses, and less of a difference between hispanic and white owned businesses. Black
 businesses have net income about 35 percent of that of white-male owned businesses, while the
 comparable figure for Hispanics is 66 percent. The ratios differ greatly across industries with
 black/white ratios over 70 percent in construction and transportation and under 30 percent in
 agriculture, manufacturing, and wholesale trade.
      Table 5 provides several summary statistics for white, black, and Hispanic self-employment

 earnings from SIPP. The exact measure of self-employment earnings used is given in the notes to
 the table)6 Comparisons of self-employment earnings with wage and salary earnings are hindered
 because comparisons tend to depend on what measure of central tendency is used. The comparisons
 are different depending on whether one uses mean, mean of log, or median earnings)7 The SIPP
 numbers on log earnings suggest that black and Hispanic earnings are similar or slightly better than

 those of whites in self-employment compared to relative earnings in wage and salary jobs. The
standard errors are large given the small number of minority entrepreneurs, so that few conclusions
can be drawn from the SIPP numbers. An analysis with the larger 1980 Census would be more
definitive.



EARNINGS REGRESSIONS




     isAn economic definition of self-employment earnings would be net income minus the interest
rate times business equity plus the expected change in business equity. I have used the self-
employment draw earnings concept because net income was missing for almost half of the self-
employed. I did several tests for the data being missing at random, all of which failed. I plan to
adjust reported earnings to accord more closely with an economic definition of the return to self-
employment.

    i7This points to the much greater dispersion of self-employment earnings than wage and salary
earnings. In fact, calculating self-employment rates for each of the earnings deciles (self-
employment plus wage and salary earnings) for those working full-time in non-agricultural
industries yields startling results. The self-employment rate for the lowest decile is 23 percent, the
rate is 20 percent in the top decile, and 6 percent in between.
                                                   9
     Table 6 reports several earnings equations for both wage and salary workers and the self-
 employed. The self-employed seem to earn much less than wage earners, with the gap even larger
 after controlling for individual characteristics. The self-employed tend to be older and more educated
 so that regression controlled estimates suggest that self-employment earnings are even lower.
 Compared to their wage earnings, blacks seem to do better in self-employment than whites, but the
difference is not significant. The analogous comparison for Hispanics does suggest higher self-
employment earnings relative to whites and the coefficient is significantly different from zero. Other
interesting coefficients include a significantly higher return to education in self-employment than in

wage and salary jobs,


OTHER MEASURES OF SUCCESS
     Table 7 reports other measures of the success of white, black and Hispanic businesses. The data
indicate that black businesses have much lower receipts, fewer employees, and are less likely to be
incorporated or be partnerships. These numbers accord with the general view that black
entrepreneurship has not been very successful in the U.S.


                           6. SIPP Micro Data and Liquidity Constraints
        This section analyzes data on individuals from the Survey of Income and Program

Participation (SIPP) and asks if differences in individual attributes can explain the black/white
differences in self-employment rates. Many authors have found that self-employed and wage and
salary workers tend to have differing characteristics. For example. the self-employed tend to be older
and more educated. This section examines whether these differences can explain the difference
between the black and white self-employment rates. The section particularly focuses on black/white
differences in net worth as an explanation for the differing self-employment rates.

    Some suggestive evidence comes from the self-employment rates by net worth quartile. The
rates from lowest net worth quartile to highest are 5.2. 7.0, 8.6 and 16.8 percent. The percentage of

wage and salary workers in wave 4 who are self-employed one year later (wave 7) is from lowest to
                                                    10

 highest net worth quartile (wave 4) 1.8, 1.6, 1.7, and 2.2 percent. While the cross-section self-
 employment rates suggest a relationship between net worth and self-employment, it is not clear what
 the causality is. The transition probabilities suggest that the relationship between net worth and
 entering self-employment is less pronounced.

      I begin by examining a cross-section of individuals from Wave 4 of the 1984 Panel of SIPP.'8
 Table 8 reports estimates from several logit equations where the dependent variable is equal to one
 if an individual is self-employed and zero if he or she is a wage and salary worker. The sample for
 the analysis is all those working more than five hours/week; an individual is called self-employed if
 a majority of his or her work hours are in self-employment. A number of demographic variables such
as age and education are included as well as measures of asset holdings. Assets are measured using
two variables, net worth and net worth interacted with a dummy variable for the top net worth
quartile. This specification is suggested by the self-employment rates by net worth quartile reported
earlier. Those numbers indicated that the self-employment rate differs only slightly between the
bottom three quartiles of the asset distribution, but rises dramatically in the top quartile. In most of
the specifications, net worth excluding business equity is used as the assets variable because business
equity is endogenous.
     The estimates of Table 8 indicate that individuals who are more educated, older, married or
previously married, and with young children are more likely to be self-employed. Blacks are estimated

to be have a significantly lower self employment rate, and this coefficient is estimated precisely. The
coefficient can be used to calculate the derivative of the self-employment rate using the distribution

of explanatory variables in the sample. Using the estimates from specification (4), this calculation
implies that the black self-employment rate is 7.36 percentage points lower than the white rate even
after accounting for the other differences between blacks and whites. This estimated difference is




    ttSince several dozen questions are asked about assets, for example. I only exclude
observations that are entirely imputed. If I exclude an observation because one asset item is
imputed, I lose 30.4 percent of the observations used below in the transition logit equations.
However, in this same sample. 97.2 percent of the observations have 3 or fewer imputed asset
items Out of 44 items.
                                                     11

larger than the unadjusted difference in racial self-employment rates. Hispanics also have a

significantly lower self-employment rate than whites. The asset variables are always significant. but
the black indicator variable falls only slightly with the inclusion of assets in the specifications.
Comparing specifications (2) and (3), one can see that the exclusion of business equity from net
worth changes the coefficient on net worth dramatically, but the black indicator variable changes only
slightly. These results suggest that differences in net worth do not explain the black/white self-
employment rate difference.
     Another way to examine the importance of assets and other variables in explaining black/white
self-employment differences is to substitute the explanatory variables for one group in a logit equation
estimated on the other group.'9 For example, one can estimate a logit equation on the white
subsample and then calculate the mean predicted self-employment rate using the distribution of
explanatory variables from the black sample. This calculation can be thought of as an estimate of the
white self-employment rate if whites had the characteristics that blacks have, but their process
determining self-employment did not change. Mathematically, let the probability that individual i of

race j   is   self-employed estimated from a logit model be A(x,.,p1) =                           where
j=b for blacks and w for whites. Then the estimated white self-employment rate if they are given
black characteristics is IA(xbpW)/nb, where       b is the black sample size. This calculation can be
thought of as performing the experiment of giving the black asset distribution as well as other
characteristics of blacks to the white population and calculating the resulting self-employment rate
assuming that the process generating white entrepreneurs does not change. If the resulting statistic
is close to the self-employment rate in the black sample then it suggests that most of the difference
between the black and white self-employment rates is due to differences in the characteristics of the

whites and blacks in the data. If the resulting statistic is close to the white self-employment rate, it
suggests that the process generating black entrepreneurs differs from that generating white

entrepreneurs.


    This type of exercise is described extensively in Cain (1986). Here I have used the
distribution of explanatory variables for a racial group rather than the mean, as the two methods
will differ in a nonlinear model.
                                                       12

          The reverse calculation can also be performed and is equally valid.                   The statistic
                 can be interpreted as the predicted black self-employment rate if blacks are given the
  characteristics that the sample of whites has, but the process generating black entrepreneurs does not

  change. Similarly, if this statistic is close to the white self-employment rate it suggests that most of

  the differences in self-employment rates can be attributed to differences in the characteristics of the
 white and black samples. If the statistic is far from the white rate it suggests that whites and blacks

 have different processes generating entrepreneurs.

         Both sets of statistics for each of the first four specification are reported at the bottom of

 Table 8 along with the raw self-employment rates in the sample for each race. Using specification

 (3), the statistic with black characteristics indicates that about 31 percent of the blackjwhite difference

 can be explained by individual characteristics. However, only 4 percent of the difference is explained

 by net worth, which one can see by comparing speciOcations (1) and (3). The statistic using white

 characteristics indicates that about 53 percent of the difference is due to individual characteristics,

 with about 38 percent of the difference attributable to net worth differences. This
                                                                                           approach yields
 conflicting results, because one method implies that assets explain little, while the other indicates they
explain about 38 percent of the difference between blacks and whites.2'

        The derivative of the self-employment probability with respect to assets that is implied by the

logit estimates is also very small. Using specification (3), the estimates imply that giving $100,000

(almost 1 1/2 times mean net worth excluding business equity) to each person would only raise the

self-employment rate by .69 percentage points.




     ait has been argued that the reverse calculation is more appropriate because policies to
change black characteristics are more plausible than policies to change white characteristics.
However, the choice is analogous to an index number problem so that both statistics are
                                                                                            equally
valid in principle. One or the other calculation may be preferred because it has a smaller
sampling variance.

    21The reason for this discrepancy is clear upon examination of the white only and black only
specifications in columns (5) and (6) of Table 8. The white coefficient on net worth is negative.
while the black coefficient is large and positive. One might want to discount the results using the
black net worth coefficient because the coefficient is not precisely estimated.

TRANSITIONS TO SELF-EMPLOYMENT
        There is a good reason to not base conclusions on the cross-sections described above.      It is

likely that household asset holdings are endogenous. The cross-sectional correlations between self-
employment and assets found above may be an indication that the self-employed are more able to
accumulate assets rather than an indication that assets are crucial in enabling a person to become
self-employed. An approach which eliminates much of this endogeneity is the examination of
transitions into self-employment. Longitudinal analyses have the advantage of using past values of
individuals' characteristics such as assets to explain transitions. We can be more confident that past

values are a cause rather than a consequence of being self-employed. There still may be some
endogeneity of assets if a person saves to enter self-employment.
       The logit equations are estimated over two time periods. Most of the analysis concentrates
on transitions between the end of 1984 and the end of 1985, a one year period The analysis is
repeated for a longer interval between the end of 1984 and the middle of 1986, a 20 month
transition.n The sample consists of those who are wage and salary earners in period t-l, and either
self-employed or wage and salary workers in period t? About 1.9 percent of wage and salary
workers are self-employed one year later. This percentage rises to 2.3 percent if one looks over the

longer 20 month period.
       Tables 9 and 10 report estimates from a number of specifications of the logit transition
equations. The effects of most demographic variables in the transition equations is very similar to
their effects in the cross-sectional analysis. The more educated, older workers, males, and married
people are more likely to enter self-employment. A change from the cross-sectional results is that
young children decrease the transition rate and the effect of being previously married is smaller, but




       am able to match 87.27 percent of the observations in Wave 4 to data in Wave 7.

    A change in the rotation group pattern causes this to be a twenty month transition for
three-quarters of the sample, and a sixteen month transition for the last quarter of the sample.

    'The sample analyzed is restricted to individuals who worked more than five hours per week
in both periods.
                                                      14
  these effects are not pronounced. Again, blacks and Hispanics are estimated to have lower transition
 rates.

           Several different alternatives for the way net worth affects transitions are tried. These
 specifications include net worth entered linearly, net worth with a different slope in the top net worth
 quartile, net worth interacted with age, and net worth split into five asset categories. In none of
 these approaches does net worth explain an appreciable fraction of the difference between the black
 and white transition rates. The coefficient on the black indicator variable changes only slightly when

 the different measures of net worth are included. In specification (3) of Table 9 the coefficient
 implies that the black transition rate is 1.11 percentage points lower than the white rate after
 accounting for net worth and other individual characteristics. This difference is exactly the same as
 the comparison of mean transition rates without accounting for individual characteristics.

          Again, an alternative way of measurtng the importance of net worth and other explanatory
variables is the calculation of the predicted transition rate for blacks when their characteristics are
substituted in the logit equations estimated using the white only sample. The reverse exercise cannot
be performed here with much confidence as the black sample is too small to estimate separate
coefficients precisely. Specification (1) of Table 9 indicates that 36 percent of the difference between
the black and white transition rates can be explained by a small set of demographic variables including

age, education, and marital status. Comparing specifications (1) and (3) one sees that the addition
of net worth only increases the explanatory power of individual characteristics to 39 percent. The
other specifications yield similar results. Again, differences in net worth do not appear to be an
important explanation for the self-employment differences.
          The derivative of the transition rate with respect to net worth that is implied by the logit
estimates is also very small. Using specification (3). the estimates imply that giving $100,000 (almost
1 1i2 times mean net worth excluding business equity) to each person would only raise the transition

rate by .00077.
          Table 10 reports some results on the importance of other variables in the transition rate logit

specifications. Specifications (5) and (6) suggest that those entering self-employment previously had




                                                                                                            4
                                                  15

low earnings but worked long hours. Specification (6) suggests that those that have previously
worked in a small business are more likely to start their own business. Not surprisingly, the
specification also indicates that union members and those who have held the same job for a long time
are unlikely to start a business.


INTERPRETING THE RESUL1'S
        The interpretation of the reduced form transition equations raises several questions. Saving
to enter entrepreneurship might bias the coefficient on net worth upward. Consider a situation
where everyone is identical, except that some people save to enter self.employrnent. Then the net
worth coefficient will be positive in a transition equation, but by assumption everyone has the same
ability to accumulate assets and enter business. If people only borrow to enter self-employment, then
the asset coefficient will be zero, unless assets are used as a criteria for giving a loan. As will be
shown below, a majority of entrepreneurs do not borrow to begin their businessea. Thus the second
argument does not seem to be of great importance.
       Additional evidence that may explain why net worth has little effect on self-employment
transitions comes from data on changes in household asset portfolios when entering self.employment.

The data indicate that most of these businesses have low equity and assets, and individuals do not
usually borrowed money to establish the business. I examine the portfolios of the 241 people who
are wage and salary workers in Wave 4 of the 1984 SIPP panel. and are self-employed one year later.
The 44th percentile of change in business equity upon entering self-employment is zero, the 71st
percentile is $10,000. The 44th percentile of the change in business value is zero, the 70th percentile
is $10000. The 72nd percentile of change in business debt is zero, the 85th percentile is $10,000.


BUSINESS FAILURES



    The variables added in specification (6) are taken from Wave 3 and pertain to the main job
held during the four months previous to Wave 4. 1 have implicitly assumed that individuals held
the same job at that time. Because some observations did not match Wave 3, the sample size is
smaller in specification (6).
                                                     16

          I have concentrated above on the black white differences in transitions to self-employment.

  The SIPP data indicate that blacks are only 43 percent as likely to transit to self-employment as
  whites, while the analogous level of black self-employment is 35 percent of that of whites. This

 suggests that while most of the difference in self-employment rates is due to a lower business
 formation rate, part of the difference is due to a higher black business failure rate. This section
 analyzes the determinants of exit from self-employment using several logit specifications.

         Table 11 reports estimates from a logit model for exit from self-employment. The sample is
 all those individuals who are wage and salary workers in Wave 4, but are self-employed one year later
 in Wave 7. The dependent variable is 0 if an individual is still self-employed eight months
 later in Wave 9, and 1 if the individual is not working or is a wage and salary worker in Wave 9.
 These equations thus provide estimates of the short run failure rate for recently started businesses.
        Specifications (1) and (2) classify an individual as wage and salary or self-employed on the
 basis of where he or she worked the most hours. Specification (3) investigates if the results change

when one includes only those individuals who only have wage and salary hours in Wave 4 and only
self-employment hours in Wave 7. In all of the specifications, most variables enter with the expected
signs, but the sample is too small to estimate the race variables with any precision. The results are
informative, however, on the issue of assets. The net worth coefficient is always small and
insignificant. The implied derivative from specification (1) indicates that giving $100000 in net worth
to each self-employed individual would only lower the failure rate from .307 to .300. Again. it does
not appear that assets play a central roll in the ability to be self-employed.

        The sample size for the business failure logit equations is too small to be informative on racial
differences in failure rates, but the evidence from other studies suggests that the black failure rate




    If one fits a first-order homogeneous Markov chain to the data by using the one year
transition rates for whites and blacks in Table 9, and the self-employment rates from Table 8, one
obtains an implied failure rate for whites of .173 and .232 for blacks.
                                                     17

is similar to that of other groups.V Thus, the evidence indicates that most of the difference in

black/white self-employment rates is due to transitions to self-employment.


           7. CBO Industry Data, Liquidity Constraints and Consumer Discrimination
        In this section, I analyze the liquidity constraints and consumer discrimination hypotheses
using the Characteristics of Business Owners data. The data indicate that most businesses require
only a small amount of capital to open and that their owners rarely borrow. This confirms the lack
of importance of assets in the logit equations and the small changes in portfolios following entry into
self-employment found in Section 6. I also find that blacks are not overrepresented in industries that
require little starting capital or in those industries where whites frequently patronize black businesses.



AMOUNTS AND SOURCES OF CAPITAL
        Table 12 reports the starting capital that was needed by the business owners in the CBO
sample. The exact question is:
What was the total amount of capital YOU needed to start or become an owner of this business?
Capital includes your own assets, money that was given to you, and money you borrowed?


The most striking thing about the numbers in Table 12 is that the amount of capital needed to start

a business tends to be small. 63 percent of nonminority males responding and 78 percent of blacks

responding indicated that they needed less than $5,000 to start their business. Note that this is the

starting capital of a Cross-section of existing firms, not a sample of entering firms. Thus, it will heavily

weight successful firms.




    27Using the Survey of Minority-Owned Enterprises. Stevens (1984) finds that the failure rates
of black, Hispanic and Asian businesses differ only slightly over a five year period. Bates (1989)
examines the largest quarter of the CBO businesses and finds thai black owned firms had a
slightly higher failure rate.

    The respondent chose from nine possible categorical responses such as None, $1-4,999,
S5,000-$9,999. etc.
                                                     18

          One might wonder how one can start a business with such small amounts of capital. However,

 it seems plausible that a small-scale contractor would begin by renting equipment, an insurance

 salesman would not need any capital, and a peddler would need little. One might argue that some

 businesses may need cash over a long period of time. Presumably respondents would account for this

 in their answers. Furthermore, a small businessman can use cash flow to finance further expansions

 and it is unlikely that a business will need a lot of capital later just to operate if it needs little to

 begin. Lastly, if black businesses are hindered by an inability to obtain subsequent capital, then they

 should have a much higher failure rate which is not the case.

         Despite beginning with little capital, these enterprises are worth studying. To be in the

sample, a business had to have at least $500 in receipts. If the CBO includes a large number of

marginal enterprises, then Its universe estimates should be much greater than those from other

sources. A comparison of the CBO number of businesses as reported in Table 2 to the number of

people in Table 1 or 3 that are primarily self-employed indicates that the CBO numbers are only

slightly larger than the Census estimates (which do not include side businesses) and are the same or

smaller than the SIPP estimates including side businesses. Furthermore, if these businesses are

marginal enterprises it is even more surprising that minorities are not overrepresented. Lastly, the

CBO responses on hours worked indicate that most of these businesses required a great deal of their

owners' time. 64 percent of the white-male business owners worked more than 30 hours/week in

their business and 72 percent worked more than 20 hours/week.

        Table 12 reports the percentage of starting capital that was borrowed, and Table 13 reports

the sources of borrowed capital and equity capital. The numbers indicate that generally capital is not

needed or an individual uses his or her savings. Banks are not a key source of funds, and neither are

family members.
                                                   19

SELF-EMPLOYMENT BY 2-DIGIT INDUSTRY

        Table 14 reports the number of black and white-male owned businesses in each 2-digit SIC

industry, as well as the mean value of several characteristics within each industry. The percentage

of firms with less than $5000 in startup capital comes from the "starting capital needed" question

described above. The percentage less than $5000 was chosen rather than the mean because for many

industries at least one of the capital size categories was suppressed due to Census confidentiality

requirements. The percentage of firms needing less than $5,000 to start provides a measure of the

financial hurdle an individual faces when considering opening a business in the industry.

        The columns for percentage of firms with primarily minority customers needs further

explanation. The CBO question asks "During 1982, what percentage of the customers served by your

business were White and NOT of Hispanic origin?" Seven different percentage ranges were given

as possible responses. Again, because many industries had the frequency of at least one possible

response suppressed due to Census confidentiality requirements, the percentage of firms that had at

least 50 percent minority customers was used as the summary statistic.



LIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS

        The liquidity constraints/low assets explanation for low black self-employment rates suggests

that there will be relatively more black businesses in industries where a large percentage of businesses

need less than $5.000 in initial capital. This suggests a positive slope to the relationship between the

ratio of the number of black businesses to the number of white-male businesses and the percentage

of black businesses with startup capital less than $5,000. Figure us a graph of this relationship for

1-digit SIC industries. A positive relationship is not evident in these points. Figure 2 is the



    Missing values limit the sample to a subset of the SIC's in Table 10. All nonmissing values
are shown in the table.
                                                     20
 analogous graph for 2-digit SIC industries. Again, there does not appear to be any relationship. Since

 Figure 2 is dominated by the outlier SIC 41, local and interurban passenger transit. Figure 3

 reproduces the graph excluding SIC 41. Again, there does not appear to be a relationship between

 the relative number of black businesses and the starting capital needed in that industry. Figures 4

and 5 are analogous to Figures 2 and 3. but they use the percentage of white-male owned businesses

that needed less than $5,000 starting capital. Again, there is no apparent positive slope that would

be predicted by the liquidity constraintsilow assets explanation for low black self-employment.

Regression estimates of the relationships in these graphs are in Table 15 and are discussed below.

         A possible deficiency of this analysis is that starting capital may not include funds an individual

needs to support himself or herself while a business is being started. While, the opportunity cost of

time is presumably lower for blacks on average given lower wage and salary earnings, lower savings

might be an impediment not captured by starting capital requirements. A second difficulty is that a

2-digit SIC is an aggregation of many activities. For example, SIC 41, which is mainly taxicabs, has

a moderately high entry cost if one buys a car, but a fairly low one if one leases. In some cities the

cost of legal entry is high because of the expense of a taxicsb medallion, while in others it is
essentially free.

        Additionally, the ability to use capital as collateral for sloan may differ across industries. This

problem is probably not very severe as most small businessmen are not entering specialized industries

where their capital could not be used as collateral.         Lastly, the industry distribution of black

businesses is likely to be influenced by minority set-aside programs. However, the available

information on these programs is insufficient to determine if they have a profound effect on the

number of firms, and how the effect varies across industries.30




   30See Bates (1985b) for a description of preferential treatment programs.
                                                   21

CONSUMER DISCRIMINATION

        This section provides evidence on the plausibility of consumer discrimination as it is typically

formulated. I take consumer discrimination to mean that some whites are only willing to patronize

some black businesses if the price charged       by   the black businesses is less than that of white

businesses. I also assume that this discrimination will be more pronounced in some industries than

in others. This difference could occur because the distaste whites have in shopping at black

businesses may depend on the type of business, because the type of contact will vary. Alternatively,

industries might differ in the ease with which the quality of the product can be verified. In those

industries where the quality is not easily verified, prejudice might be more likely to persist.

        I measure the degree of consumer discrimination in an industry by the percentage of black

businesses that indicate that their customers are at least half minorities. If the black businesses have

mostly minority customers, I assume that whites are unwilling to shop there because of consumer

discrimination. I take this approach because it is difficult to objectively classify industries as to

whether or not there is a high degree of customer contact, whether the customer contact is
objectionable to someone discriminating, and whether it is difficult to verify the quality of the

product. Therefore, I have used the degree to which the business attracts white customers as an

objective measure of consumer discrimination.

        Figures 6 througn 9 plot the blackiwhite-male ratio of the number of businesses against the

percentage of black businesses that indicate that their customers are at least half minorities.

Consumer discrimination implies a negative relationship between these two variables. If black

customers also discriminate against black business owners, or black businesses are able to cater to

black tastes better (clientele effects) then one might not expect to see the hypothesized relationship.

Figure 6 is the 1-digit industry graph, while Figures 7 and 8 display the 2-digit relationship with and

without SIC 41 (tadcabs). None of these graphs show the negative relationship predicted by
  consumer discnmination. For comparison, Figure 9 graphs the black/white-male number of business

  ratio against the percentage of white-male businesses with primarily minority customers.

          One might be concerned that the primarily minority customers variable
                                                                                          strongly reflects
  geographic location. Most of the industries examined are retail or service industries and are local

  businesses. If these black businesses are unable or unwilling to locate near white
                                                                                       neighborhoods then

  it suggests that they feel they will not find white patrons. If they are only able cater to blacks, then

  the consumer discrimination hypothesis implies that their market would be limited and they would

 not prosper.

         Table 15 reports a series of regressions which test the visual impressions of the
                                                                                             figures using
 the 2-digit SIC data. The dependent variable in all cases is the logarithm of the black/white-male

 ratio of the number of businesses. Regressions using two samples are reported because each
                                                                                                   sample
 has its advantages. The first sample is the full sample, and the second excludes SIC's with fewer than

 500 black businesses and fewer thsn 10,000 white businesses. The full sample suffers from some

 measurement error in the right-hand-side variable because it is a group average, with the degree of

 measurement error depending on the number of businesses. The subset of industries excludes the

most mismeasured observations, but introduces some bias because of truncation determined by the

dependent variable. I do not expect that either bias will be pronounced, but as a check I have
reported both sets of estimates.

        The regression estimates in Table 15 do not provide much support for either the
                                                                                                  liquidity
constraints or the consumer discrimination hypothesis. The coefficients on the starting capital

variables do not generally have the expected positive sign, and the minority customer coefficients do

not generally have the expected negative sign. The only coefficient that is of the expected sign and

almost significant is the white starting capital coefficient in Specification (2) for the full sample. For
                                                  23

these equations I also performed heteroskedasticity tests which failed to reject homoskedasticity in

8 of 9 cases by a wide margin.3'

        An additional set of graphs examine if the effect of liquidity constraints and consumer

discrimination is more evident in the ratio of black to white-male net income by industry. Without

the micro data only a 1-digit SIC industry analysis can be presented. Figures 10 through 12 are

graphs analogous to those above, but they display relative net income rather than the relative number

of businesses. These graphs seem to fit the theories somewhat, with the starting capital graphs

showing the expected positive slope if one excludes transportation, and the minority customers graph

showing the expected negative slope.



                                       8. Other Explanations

       Several other explanations for the low rate of black entrepreneurship have been proposed.

Two of these explanations might be called the consumer demands explanation and the culture of

entrepreneurship explanation. Kinzer and Sagarin (1950). Glazer and Moynihan (1970), and Light

(1972) all describe special demands of various ethnic and racial groups that were served by

entrepreneurs from that group. Examples are exotic vegetables that Chinese immigrants sold to each

other, Kosher wine and matzos that Jewish entrepreneurs sold to other Jews, and pasta that Italians

sold to their former countrymen. These special consumer demands provided business opportunities

that were not easily filled by members outside the group. It is argued that blacks had very few special

consumer demands that could not be satisfied by white entrepreneurs.

       There are several difficulties with this consumer demands theory. First, it does not explain

the success with which Chinese and Japanese immigrants seem to have been able to sell to those




    31j regressed the square of the OI..S residuals on a constant and the variance in the dependent
variable obtained using unpublished CBO standard errors and the delta method.
                                                   24

 outside their group fairly soon after their arrival in the U. S.32 Second. businesses catering to

 special consumer demands may provide a captive market, but it is a small one. Today such businesses

 must make up an even smaller percentage than they did in the past. For this explanation to continue

 today it requires a great deal of persistence in group entrepreneurship patterns.

          The second explanation is that blacks have lacked a culture of entrepreneurship. Frazier

 (1957) has talked about a lack of [black] traditions in the field of business enterprise." Glazer and

 Moynihan (1970) have argued that as slaves, blacks did not have a tradition of managing money, and

 that this has hindered attempts at entrepreneurship. Related to this argument is evidence suggesting

 that many people learn about entrepreneurship from friends or relatives. The difficulty with this

explanation is that it can approach a tautology. The explsnation also requires these trends persist

over long periods of time, which may not be plausible given the high rate of small business turnover.

         In a series of books and articles, Light33 has tried to add more substance to the Frazier

argument by describing cultural and class characteristics that aid entrepreneurship. He describes

informal capital markets, usually rotating credit associations, that aided entrepreneurship    among

Chinese, Japanese and Korean immigrants. He also emphasizes ways that the tight knit nature of the

these groups supported entrepreneurship. Business development was aided by ethnic solidarity,

mutual support networks, nepotistic hiring, informal and formal restraints of trade, and language

barriers according to Light. He also argues that recent Korean immigrants came from a business

class.


         There are important weaknesses to this cultural explanation. The capital market argument

does not seem likely to be crucial to small business. As we saw in SIPP and CBO data, large amounts

of capital generally are not need, and new businessman do not regularly borrow. Rotating credit


    32See Light (1972), pp. 15-18.

    33See Light (1972, 1979, 1984), Light and Bonacich (1988).
                                                 25

associations tend to provide very short term loans, usually only lasting several months. Even Light's

own recent data on Los Angeles Koreans indicates that the vast majority of businesses are self-

linanced and do not rely on rotating credit associations. The other aspects of the cultural

explanation merit further study.



                                           9. Conclusions

        The evidence here does not support the liquidity constraints/low assets explanation for the

low black self-employment rate. Black/white differences in net worth can only explain a small part

of the differences in their rates of business formation. Logit equations for who is self-employed in

a cross-section and who becomes self-employed in a panel suggest that net worth is not an important

determinant of the racial differences in self-employment. Little capital is needed to start most

business and beginning entrepreneurs do not usually borrow. Also, the industrial distribution of black

and white businesses does not indicate a greater relative representation of blacks in industries

requiring less starting capital.
        This evidence should not be taken to imply that liquidity constraints are unimportant in the

Nucci (1989). which relies on the 1982 Characteristics of Business Owners.
(3) Total nonagricultural employment is calculated by adding the number of employed
Armed Forces from the 1980 Census to the number of employed non-agriculrursl
civilians from the Handbook of Labor Statistics.
