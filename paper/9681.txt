                                            ABSTRACT

This paper uses state-level data on cirrhosis death rates to examine the impact of state prohibitions,
pre-1920 federal anti-alcohol policies, and constitutional prohibition on cirrhosis. State prohibitions
had a minimal impact on cirrhosis, especially during the pre-1920 period. Pre-1920 federal anti-

alcohol policies may have contributed to the decline in cirrhosis that occurred before 1920, although
other factors were likely substantial influences as well. Constitutional prohibition reduced cirrhosis

by about 10-20 percent.

1. Introduction

    The U.S. experience with national prohibition of alcohol plays a frequent role in discussions

of government policy toward alcohol, drugs and other commodities. Central to this debate is

whether, or to what degree, Prohibition reduced consumption of alcohol. Data on alcohol

consumption are not available for the Prohibition period, however, so numerous authors have

used the cirrhosis death rate to infer the behavior of alcohol consumption.          Focusing on

comparisons of the pre-Prohibition and early Prohibition periods, these authors have suggested

that Prohibition caused as much as a 50% decline in cirrhosis.1

    Existing analyses of Prohibition and cirrhosis are potentially problematic, however. Most

analyses have focused on the univariate behavior of cirrhosis and conducted simple comparisons

of the pre-Prohibition and Prohibition periods. This approach ignores other Prohibition-era

changes in alcohol-control policies, including state prohibitions, wartime prohibition, and

increased alcohol taxation. Likewise, the univariate approach fails to account for the many non-

policy variables that might affect cirrhosis, including social attitudes, income, war, and

demographics.

    This paper evaluates the impact of Prohibition on cirrhosis death rates, and it considers the

possible implications for understanding the effects of prohibitions generally.

    Section 2 re-examines the relation between cirrhosis and alcohol consumption.       Both bio-

medical research and comparisons across countries or time periods suggest alcohol consumption

is an important determinant of cirrhosis. Using cirrhosis to infer Prohibition’s impact on alcohol

consumption, however, assumes that short-term fluctuations in cirrhosis are reasonable proxies




                                                 1
for short-term fluctuations in alcohol consumption. We document that the time-series variation

in alcohol consumption explains much of the time-series variation in cirrhosis, but the relation is

far from perfect. More importantly, various aspects of the relation need to be accounted for if

the behavior of cirrhosis is to suggest conclusions about alcohol consumption.

    Section 3 begins our examination of Prohibition’s impact on cirrhosis. We show that

cirrhosis was lower during Prohibition than in most years before or after, which makes a prima

facie case that Prohibition reduced cirrhosis. Further examination, however, suggests caution in

drawing this conclusion. First, there have been substantial fluctuations in cirrhosis outside the

Prohibition period, which suggests that factors other than Prohibition should be considered

before concluding that Prohibition caused the low level during Prohibition. Second, cirrhosis did

not jump dramatically upon repeal of Prohibition, which fails to suggest an important effect of

Prohibition.   Most importantly, cirrhosis had fallen to its low, Prohibition level by the time

Prohibition began, which means Prohibition did not cause the low level of cirrhosis at the

beginning of Prohibition.

       Section 4 then presents regressions of state-level cirrhosis death rates on measures of

state prohibition, constitutional prohibition, and other variables. These regressions suggest that

state-level prohibition had only a small impact on cirrhosis; instead, one or more aggregate

factors caused a major decline in cirrhosis during the 1917-1919 period. Pre-1920 federal anti-

alcohol policies might have contributed to this decline, but other factors were likely important

influences as well.   Whatever caused the pre-1920 decline, constitutional Prohibition lowered

the cirrhosis death rate by about 10-20%.

2. The Relation between Alcohol Consumption and Cirrhosis

    As noted above, most literature on the relation between Alcohol Prohibition and alcohol

consumption uses cirrhosis death rates as a proxy for alcohol consumption.2 No one doubts that

cirrhosis is a reasonable indicator of alcohol consumption in many contexts: extensive bio-

medical evidence concludes that alcohol consumption causes most cirrhosis (e.g., Berkow (1992,

pp. 890-897)). Whether cirrhosis is a useful proxy in all settings, however, depends on specific

aspects of the relation between consumption and cirrhosis. In this section we examine data on

alcohol consumption and cirrhosis, with particular attention to the aspects of this relation

relevant to the study of Prohibition.

    Figure 1 presents cross-country evidence on the relation between cirrhosis and alcohol

consumption.     The figure plots the average cirrhosis death rate against average alcohol

consumption per capita over roughly the period 1954-1995 for sixteen countries.3 The cirrhosis

death rates are measured as the number of cirrhosis deaths per 100,000 persons; thus, they are




2
  Other proxy series include the drunkenness arrest rate, deaths from alcoholism, admittances to
mental hospitals for alcoholic psychosis, industrial efficiency, the industrial accident rate, and
the automobile accident rate; see, in particular, Warburton (1932). Additional work on the
determinants of alcohol consumption uses cirrhosis as a proxy outside the Prohibition period,
since state-level data on alcohol consumption do not exist. See, for example, Cook (1981) or
Cook and Tauchen (1982).

 The countries are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland,
France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the
United States.



                                                3
crude rather than age-adjusted death rates.4 The alcohol consumption data are measured in pure

liters of alcohol per capita, computed as the alcohol-adjusted sum of beer, wine, and spirits.5

    The data in the figure display a strong, positive correlation between average alcohol

consumption and average cirrhosis death rates; the estimated correlation is 0.75, which is

significant at the 0.001 level.     The correlation is far from perfect, however. For example,

Austria, Italy and Hungary appear to be outliers. More importantly, the fact that the levels of the

two variables are correlated on average is not sufficient to justify using cirrhosis for the time-

series analysis considered below.

    Figures 2a and 2b present the annual time-series data on cirrhosis and consumption that

underlie the averages for the sixteen countries. The data are consistent with a positive effect of

alcohol consumption on cirrhosis, but the evidence is far from overwhelming.             In several

countries the correlation is consistently positive, and this occurs with respect to both increases

and decreases in cirrhosis (e.g., Australia, Belgium, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway,

Sweden, and the U.S.).     In several other countries the correlation is positive, but this mainly

reflects a common upward trend over the sample period (e.g., Austria, Czech Republic,

Denmark, Hungary, U.K., and Ireland). And in many countries, there is substantial variation in

cirrhosis that is not present in alcohol consumption. In some cases this variation has the

  Age-adjusted death rates are not available for most countries. We provide a crude correction
for changes in the age composition of the population in the regression analysis below. Cirrhosis
death rates are from the World Health Organization’s World Health Statistics Annual, various
years.
5
  The consumption data are from Brewers Association of Canada (1997), except that those for
the U.S. are from Miron (1996). Per capita consumption of absolute alcohol is calculated using
the average percentage of alcohol in beer, wine, and spirits in a given country in a given year.
Generally these percentages are 4.5-5% for beer, 10-16% for wine, and 40-45% for spirits.



                                                 4
appearance of random measurement error, but in other cases it suggests that additional factors

are at work (e.g., Netherlands, Sweden, Ireland, France).

       Table 1 confirms these impressions by reporting regressions of the cirrhosis death rate on

alcohol consumption per capita.6 Consumption always enters positively and usually statistically

significantly. Consistent with the figures, however, the coefficients vary substantially in

magnitude and significance. Although contemporaneous consumption is an important

determinant of cirrhosis, other factors matter as well.7

       Table 2 considers a first such factor by adding the lag of alcohol consumption to the

regressions.     The last column shows the sum of the coefficients on current and lagged

consumption. The lagged value of consumption sometimes enters positively and significantly,

but the results are not particularly consistent.       In many cases the second lag enters negatively

rather than positively.     In a number of other cases the second lag enters positively, but the

contemporaneous value becomes negative. And when the lag enters positively, the coefficient

on the second lag is sometimes larger than the coefficient on contemporaneous consumption.

The second to last column does indicate that the sum of the lag coefficients is always positive,

and the range of estimated “impacts” is fairly tight. Regressions using longer lags yield similar

results; the sum of the lag coefficients is always positive, but there is considerable noise in the

individual coefficients on current and lagged consumption. These regressions thus confirm that




6
    We also estimate Tables 1-5 including a time trend, with similar results.
7
  The Durbin-Watson statistics from the OLS regressions indicate the presence of positive
autocorrelation in most cases. Thus, the estimates in these tables report Newey-West (1987)
standard errors.



                                                   5
accounting for lags in the relation between consumption and cirrhosis is important; they do not

provide a parsimonious method of accounting for those lags.

       Table 3 therefore presents regressions of cirrhosis on lagged cirrhosis and contemporaneous

alcohol consumption. This is the correct specification if cirrhosis is a geometric distributed lag

of current and past consumption. As in Table 2, the results are consistent overall. Here,

however, the U.S. is a glaring exception when estimated over the post-WWII sample; the

coefficient on alcohol consumption is negative. Since the U.S. data are the most relevant for our

purposes, this result is troubling. When we restrict the sample to the periods “near” Prohibition,

however, the estimates are better behaved. And we show below that conditioning on the age and

sex structure of the population also eliminates this anomaly.

       A potentially important mediating factor between alcohol consumption and the cirrhosis

death rate is the age structure of the population.       Cirrhosis deaths occur almost exclusively

among persons aged 35 and over, particularly those aged 55-75.8 To eliminate the effects of

changes in the age-composition of the population, time-series analyses often use age-adjusted

death rates (Anderson and Rosenberg 1998). We cannot utilize that approach here because age-

specific cirrhosis death rates by state, which are crucial for our analysis, are not available before

1920. We show below that an alternative approach yields reasonable answers.

       Table 4 repeats the regressions in Table 3 but adding the percentage of the population that is

male and the fraction of the population in each of 11 age categories.9 For ease of comparison, the

8
  In 1998, the total death rate due to chronic liver disease and cirrhosis was 7.2 per 100,000
people. The age-specific rates were as follows: age 25-34, 1.4; age 35-44, 8.2; age 45-54, 20.3;
age 55-64, 25.4; age 65-74, 23.8; age 75-84, 18.6; over 85, 12.6.
9
    For the U.S. we use age variables for each of 7 categories.



                                                   6
last column repeats the coefficient on alcohol consumption from Table 3. The coefficients on

alcohol consumption from the regressions with and without the age variables are similar in most

cases. We reject equality of the Table 3 and Table 4 coefficients on alcohol consumption in the

cases of Australia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and the U.S. pre-1950. In the post-WWII U.S.

sample the puzzling negative coefficient from the regression without age and sex variables

becomes positive. Thus, controlling for the age composition in this way appears reasonable and,

in the case of the U.S., important.10

     A final issue that confronts the use of cirrhosis as a proxy for alcohol consumption is the

possibility that the relation between consumption and cirrhosis is not symmetric. Bio-medical

evidence suggests that cirrhosis results from a long history of drinking, but it also suggests that

the liver can regenerate if drinking stops and that one must be actively drinking to die from

cirrhosis.     The combination of these facts suggests an asymmetry in the effect of alcohol

consumption on cirrhosis: substantial declines in consumption would produce contemporaneous

declines in cirrhosis, but substantial increases in consumption, especially from a low level, might

take years to yield noticeably higher cirrhosis death rates. As shown below, this issue is

important for interpreting the time-series behavior of cirrhosis at the beginning and end of

Prohibition.

     Table 5 addresses this possibility by regressing cirrhosis on lagged cirrhosis, the age and sex

composition variables, and alcohol consumption, separating consumption into two pieces:




10
   For the 1941-1997 period, we have compared standard, age-adjusted cirrhosis death rates to
rates “adjusted” using our procedure and found a high degree of correlation.



                                                 7
multiplied by an increase dummy and multiplied by a decrease dummy.11 For most countries,

the coefficient on consumption when consumption is increasing is similar to the coefficient when

consumption is decreasing. We can reject equality of the coefficients for Canada and Belgium at

the 5% level and Austria and the full sample of the U.S. at the 10% level. This outcome is

perhaps surprising given the bio-medical evidence discussed above, although some sources

suggest that cirrhosis can develop within a short period (Galambos 1979, p. 3). In any case, the

regressions do not suggest a strong degree of asymmetry.

     We draw the following conclusions from this examination of the data on cirrhosis and

alcohol consumption. Time-series fluctuations in consumption exert a positive and significant

effect on cirrhosis, although this relation is far from exact. The relation between consumption

and cirrhosis appears to involve substantial lags, implying a highly persistent cirrhosis death rate.

There is only mild evidence of asymmetry in the effect of alcohol consumption on cirrhosis,

although this is difficult to determine with available data. The age and sex composition of the

population appear to be important determinants of cirrhosis, at least in the U.S. data.




3. The Effect of Prohibition on Cirrhosis

     We now examine the relation between Alcohol Prohibition and cirrhosis. We focus in this

section on basic facts about the cirrhosis death rate and then discuss the potential role of state

prohibitions in explaining these facts. In Section 4 we consider regressions that account for other

determinants of cirrhosis death rates.

11
  Specifically, the increase dummy equals one if current consumption is greater than or equal to
consumption in the previous period and zero otherwise. The decrease dummy equals one if
current consumption is less than last period’s consumption and zero otherwise.



                                                 8
     Basic Facts

     Figure 3 presents the cirrhosis death rate for the United States over the period 1900-1997.

Cirrhosis was low during the fourteen years of Prohibition compared to periods before or after.

The average value over the years 1920-1933 was 7.3, while the average value in the years 1900-

1919 and 1934-1997 was 11.5.12 This simple comparison between the Prohibition and non-

Prohibition years is the basis for the claim that Prohibition reduced cirrhosis. In particular, many

previous analyses have compared cirrhosis between a pre-Prohibition year, such as 1915, and a

Prohibition year, such as 1925, and concluded that Prohibition reduced the cirrhosis death rate by

almost 50%.13

     Further examination, however, suggests this conclusion is premature. To begin, there is

substantial variation in the cirrhosis death rate outside the Prohibition period (as well as

substantial variation in countries without prohibition). This suggests that other factors play a

substantial role in causing fluctuations in cirrhosis death rates.

     In addition, the timing of the increases and decreases in cirrhosis challenges the view that

Prohibition caused the low level of cirrhosis during the 1920s and early 1930s. Figure 4 presents

the same data as Figure 3 but for the years 1900-1940, to facilitate examination of the years

directly before and after Prohibition.    This examination reveals two facts.   Cirrhosis does not

display a dramatic increase after repeal of Prohibition at the end of 1933. And cirrhosis had

12
  The 18th Amendment took effect January, 1920; the 21st Amendment repealing Prohibition
took effect December, 1933.
13
   Edwards et al. (1994) note that “during Prohibition in America, for example, cirrhosis
mortality declined by almost 50% (p. 131).” MacCoun and Reuter (2001) comment that “rates
for cirrhosis of the liver fell by 50 percent early in Prohibition and recovered promptly after
Repeal in 1933 (p. 161).”



                                                  9
almost reached its low 1920 value by 1919, the year before constitutional Prohibition took

effect.14 Moreover, cirrhosis started declining slowly in 1908 and then began decreasing more

quickly around 1916.

     The fact that cirrhosis did not jump upon repeal is inconsistent with an important role for

Prohibition in affecting cirrhosis if increased alcohol consumption has a contemporaneous effect

on cirrhosis. If, on the other hand, it takes years or decades for alcohol consumption to cause

death from cirrhosis, one might expect a substantial lag before any increased consumption

following repeal could cause a noticeable increase in cirrhosis. The results above did not provide

strong evidence that increases in consumption have a smaller impact on cirrhosis than decreases.

Given the uncertainty surrounding the precise relation between consumption and cirrhosis,

however, it is difficult to take a strong stand on this particular piece of evidence. The absence of

a marked jump in cirrhosis after repeal is not suggestive of a major effect, but this is a test with

low power.

     The fact that cirrhosis had declined to essentially its minimum level before constitutional

Prohibition took effect, and that it had been declining for at least a decade, is more problematic

for the view that Prohibition caused the low level of cirrhosis during the 1920s and early 1930s.

Indeed, the general downward trend in cirrhosis stops in the very year Prohibition took effect.

Thus, a critical issue is understanding the pre-1920 decline in cirrhosis.




14
  Thornton (1991) appropriately notes that cirrhosis death rates had begun to decline prior to
Prohibition (p. 105n); however, he suggests this decline is due to state prohibitions, wartime



                                                 10
    State Prohibitions

    One possible explanation for the pre-1920 decline in cirrhosis is state-level prohibitions.

Thirty-two states adopted prohibition laws during the pre-1920 period, and the number of states

with such laws increased noticeably during the 1910s. Table 6 shows the states adopting state-

level prohibition in each year over the 1900-1920 period. The table seems to suggest these

prohibitions caused the decrease in cirrhosis during the 1910s since the number of state

prohibitions increased substantially around the time cirrhosis decreased.

    Several factors, however, cast doubt on the hypothesis that state-level prohibitions caused

the pre-1920 decline in cirrhosis. Although the number of states with prohibition was large,

these states were predominantly rural, low population states.     By 1918, thirty-one states had

adopted a prohibition law, but 52.1% of the population lived in wet states, and the distribution of

states that passed prohibition laws before WWI was not random. Of the twenty-six that had

prohibition laws, “fourteen were west of the Mississippi. Eight were south of the Ohio and

Potomac. Two (Maine and New Hampshire) were in northern, rural New England (Merz 1930,

p. 19).” Only two (Michigan and Indiana) were populated, industrial states.

    The role of state prohibition is also not compelling because the laws in many states were

weak; in particular, they fell far short of bone-dry prohibition (Merz 1930, pp. 20-22). Many

states allowed for the importation of certain quantities of alcohol and/or home manufacture. For

example, Alabama law allowed any citizen to import two quarts of distilled spirits or two gallons

of wine or five gallons of beer every fifteen days. Virginia law allowed importation of one quart

of distilled spirits or three gallons of beer or one gallon of wine every thirty days, except for


prohibitions and increased taxes (p. 103). We show below that taxes and state prohibitions play
little role in this pre-1920 decline.


                                                11
students at a university, college or other school, or minors, or a female not the head of

household. Indiana laws stated that it did not intend to interfere with domestic manufacture of

wine. Michigan, New Hampshire, Iowa, and North Dakota laws did not prohibit importation for

personal use. Mississippi law permitted manufacture of homemade wine.             North Carolina

allowed importation of one quart of spirits or five gallons of beer every fifteen days. West

Virginia permitted manufacture of wine for personal use and importation of one quart of liquor

every thirty days. Tennessee permitted manufacture for personal use. South Carolina allowed

importation of one quart of liquor every thirty days for medicinal purposes.15

     Figures 5 and 6 provide an initial look at the possible effect of state prohibition laws by

showing state-level data on cirrhosis for two groups of states: those that were wet throughout the

pre-1920 period, and those that adopted state prohibition laws at some point during this period.

We present only a subset of the states in each category to avoid cluttering the graph; the

regression analysis in Section 4 considers the complete set of states.

     The figures show that the most dramatic declines in cirrhosis occurred in states that were

wet throughout the pre-1920 period, and these states included several of the most populous states

(e.g., New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey). There is some evidence of declines in states that

adopted prohibition during this period, but the declines appear smaller on average than the

declines in wet states.   These figures do not support the hypothesis that state prohibition laws

lowered cirrhosis death rates.

15
  Isaac (1965) provides a detailed analysis of the prohibition movement in Tennessee up to the
passage of constitutional prohibition. He describes both the legal regime and enforcement as
weak during the first few years of state prohibition, 1909-1913, and he suggests that alcohol
consumption continued without much interruption in the larger cities. He also describes the legal
regime and the degree of enforcement as becoming gradually stricter beginning in 1914, but he
suggests that liquor was still widely available at least in the major cities.


                                                12
     A further suggestive piece of evidence on the effects of state prohibitions comes from a

more detailed examination of the data on alcohol consumption and cirrhosis for the pre-1920

period, shown in Figure 7. The key fact is that cirrhosis declined before alcohol consumption

declined; indeed, alcohol consumption gives no indication of a decline until 1918, well after the

wave of state prohibition adoptions.16 Thus, if one examines alcohol consumption, rather than

cirrhosis, even the aggregate data suggest little effect of the state prohibitions.



4. Regression Analysis

     The data presented above raise questions about the role of state prohibitions in causing the

cirrhosis decline during 1910s, and they suggest caution in crediting constitutional prohibition

for the low level of cirrhosis during the 1920-1933 period. These data, however, do not account

for the range of factors that might influence cirrhosis. In this section we present two methods

for examining the influence of state and national prohibition while controlling for the effects of

other variables.

     Regressions with Unconstrained Year Dummies

     Our first method of analyzing the impact of these policies is to estimate the equation

                               cit = αi + γ pit + ρ cit-1 + βt + εit                  (1)




16
   The official data potentially overstate the actual decline in alcohol consumption because the
federal laws passed during this period plausibly induced underreporting. For example, the higher
tax rates adopted in 1916-1917 might have encouraged home production, and the federal order to
close the breweries and distilleries (see below) might have spawned illicit production.



                                                   13
where cit is the cirrhosis death rate in state i in year t, αi is a fixed effect for state i, pit is a dummy

variable equal to 1 if state i had a state prohibition law in effect in year t and zero otherwise, βt is

a year dummy for year t, and εit is an error term.17

     This specification allows us to estimate the impact of state prohibitions on cirrhosis while

allowing for a general set of aggregate effects. Thus, the year dummies account for any

aggregate changes in tax rates, demographics, social attitudes, or other variables that might

influence cirrhosis, as well as for Prohibition or pre-1920 anti-alcohol policies (see below). This

specification does not account for state-level time-series variation in these variables; in most

cases appropriate data are not available.18         This approach also fails to identify the separate

effects of different aggregate factors, but examination of the year dummies themselves

potentially sheds light on the influence of such variables. 19

     Table 7 reports the results of estimating (1) using state-level data on cirrhosis death rates.20

The panel is not balanced; in ten states cirrhosis data are available beginning in 1900 while in


17
   This regression does not account for the possibility that state prohibition might be endogenous
to cirrhosis death rates. One possibility is that states with low or falling death rates were more
likely to adopt prohibition. In this case, the regression results overstate the effect of state-level
prohibitions. Most prohibition laws were passed in low cirrhosis states.
18
   State-level alcohol taxes are available but awkward to employ because some states used state
provision as a way to raise alcohol prices. We have experimented with different specifications
of state alcohol policy and found that inclusion of this information has virtually no impact on the
results reported here.
19
   In addition to the specifications reported here, we have also estimated regressions that include
an interaction term between state prohibition and federal prohibition. These generally yield a
positive coefficient on the interaction term and a more negative or less positive coefficient on
state prohibitions. The implied impacts of state prohibition are overall extremely similar to those
reported in the text.
20
  The dates of the state prohibition laws are from Wickersham (1931) and Distilled Spirits
Institute, various issues.

other states the first year of data varies. The results are weighted by state population, although

this makes only a small difference to the results.     We consider three different sample periods:

1900-1919, 1900-1950, and 1900-1997.                The shorter samples reduce the impact of

inconsistencies in measurement of cirrhosis, and the earlier data appear better correlated with

alcohol consumption. The longer sample contains more information and is preferable so long as

the equation is correctly specified and the data are measured consistently.

     The results for 1900-1919 show a positive but insignificant effect of state prohibitions on

cirrhosis while the results for 1900-1950 yield a positive and significant effect. The results for

1900-1997 show a negative but insignificant effect of state prohibitions.

     To assess the quantitative importance of these results (especially those for the 1900-1997

sample), we use the estimated equations to simulate the path of cirrhosis in the absence of state

prohibitions and then calculate the percent decrease in cirrhosis caused by state prohibitions.21

These calculations are provided in bottom rows of Table 7. The results using the 1900-1919 and

1900-1950 regressions indicate that state prohibitions raised cirrhosis, consistent with the

positive coefficient on state prohibitions. The results using the 1900-1997 estimates indicate that

state prohibitions reduced cirrhosis by less than 1% during the 1910-1920 and 1920-1933

periods, by about 6% during the 1933-1950 period, and by 2% during the 1950-1997 period.



21
  The simulations are computed as follows. For each state, the actual cirrhosis death rate is used
for the initial year and any years up to the passage of state prohibition. Once a state has adopted
prohibition, the regression coefficients are used to predict the cirrhosis death rate in the absence
of the state prohibition. This predicted cirrhosis death rate is then used as the lagged cirrhosis
death rate for the next year’s prediction. Predicted values are calculated for all years after a state
has passed prohibition, even once the prohibition is repealed. The calculated impact is the
predicted cirrhosis death rate over the given period less the actual cirrhosis death rate, all divided
by the predicted cirrhosis death rate. Thus, the impact for states that did not pass a state
prohibition is zero.



                                                 15
Thus, even if one takes the insignificant coefficient from the 1900-1997 regression at face value,

it indicates state prohibitions played little role in reducing cirrhosis death rates.

       Figures 8a and 8b present the estimated year dummies from the regressions without the

interaction term.22     The estimates are consistent with the hypothesis that, controlling for state

prohibitions and lagged cirrhosis, there are only modest effects of constitutional prohibition. The

estimates do suggest that one or more factors caused a large decline in cirrhosis during the last 2-

3 years before the onset of constitutional prohibition, but conditional on this decline, cirrhosis

proceeded almost as would have been expected in the absence of Prohibition due to its high

degree of autocorrelation.

          Regressions with Controls for Aggregate Effects

          We now consider regressions of the form

                         cit = αi + γ pit + δ zt + θ Pt + ρ cit-1 + β xt + εit

                 (2)

where zt is a dummy variable equal to 1 for the years 1917-1919 and zero otherwise, Pt is a

measure of national prohibition, xt is other aggregate variables, and εit is an error term.   These

regressions exclude year dummies.

          We include the term zt to account for the possible effects of pre-1920 federal anti-alcohol

policies. In February 1917, Congress passed the Reed bone-dry amendment, which forbade

interstate shipment of liquor into states that prohibited manufacture and sale, even if the state

                                                     16
allowed importation. (Merz 1930, p. 20).23 In August 1917, Congress adopted the Food Control

Law, which forbade the manufacture of distilled spirits from any form of foodstuff, and closed

the distilleries (Merz 1930, pp. 26-27, 40-41); in September 1918, it closed the breweries as well

(Merz 1930, p. 41). Also in September 1918, Congress approved wartime prohibition, although

this prohibition did not take effect until July 1, 1919 (Merz 1930, p. 41).             The wartime

prohibition act contained the first general restriction on sale, providing that after June 30, 1919,

no liquor could be sold for beverage purposes except for export (Schmeckebier 1929, pp. 4-5).

       We control for tax rates on alcohol by including the real, statutory tax rate on distilled

spirits or the real, statutory tax rate on non-beverage distilled spirits.24,25 Those caught violating

Prohibition were required to pay taxes on the alcohol produced. Thus, an interaction term

between Prohibition and the tax rate allows for a differing effect of the tax during Prohibition.

Also, distilled spirits produced for non-beverage purposes and taxed at the non-beverage rate

were frequently diverted to beverage spirits. Hu (1950) states that relatively little beverage spirits

tax revenue was collected during Prohibition compared to the quantities diverted from non-


23
  In February 1913, Congress had adopted the Webb-Kenyon Law, which prohibited shipments
of liquor from wet states into dry states if such shipments were in violation of the dry state law.
This did not prohibit all shipments into dry states, since some dry states allowed importation
(Merz 1930, p. 14). The law was widely viewed as ineffective, which was one reason for the
Reed amendment.
24
  We have also measured the tax rate using the implicit tax rate on all alcoholic beverages. This
measure is constructed using data on tax revenues and consumption expenditures. Thus,
adequate measures are not available during Prohibition. Using the implicit tax rate leads to
estimates that suggest that Prohibition increased consumption. Miron (1997) explains the
construction of the tax variables.
25
  Alcoholic substances produced for purposes such as medicine, flavoring extracts, etc. were
considered legal non-beverage spirits and taxed at a lower rate. Hu (1950) provides more detail
on federal taxation of distilled spirits during this period.



                                                 17
beverage or industrial uses. This suggests that the non-beverage tax may better capture the tax

faced by producers during Prohibition. Estimates of the effect of Prohibition are lower in the

non-beverage tax specifications.26,27

          We employ the U.K. cirrhosis death rate as a measure of social attitudes, since the

Temperance movement existed across countries. We control for the level of income using real

GNP per capita. We also include but do not report the age and sex composition variables

discussed above.

          Tables 8 and 9 present results for the 1900-1997 and 1900-1950 periods, respectively.

The left half of each table employs a dummy variable to measure Prohibition while the right half

employs real enforcement expenditure per capita.28,29

          The results are consistent across specifications. The coefficient on lagged cirrhosis

always enters statistically significantly, in the range of 0.87–0.88. Thus, cirrhosis is highly

persistent, even after controlling for these other factors.

          State prohibitions are estimated to have a negative and sometimes statistically significant

effect in the 1900-1997 regressions but a positive and statistically significant effect in the 1900-

1950 regressions.        The estimated impact is slightly greater than in the regressions with


26
  Similar regressions using the real federal tax rate on beer in place of the tax on distilled spirits
produce similar but somewhat smaller estimates of the effect of Prohibition.
27
   We have also estimated the regressions including state tax rates on distilled spirits and an
indicator variable for whether a state is a control state. The estimates are qualitatively and
quantitatively similar.
28
     Including an interaction between state and federal prohibition has little impact on these results.
29
     Miron (1999) discusses the construction of the real enforcement expenditure data.



                                                   18
unconstrained year dummies, presumably because those year dummies account for unmeasured

determinants of cirrhosis that correlate with state prohibitions. Since the year dummy approach

is the more robust method of estimating the state prohibition effects, we regard those as the more

relevant estimates.30 In any case, the implied impacts of state prohibitions are similar to those

shown in Table 7.

        The dummy for 1917-1919 enters significantly in all regressions, with a coefficient in the

range    –0.27 to –1.7. Whether this reflects pre-1920 federal anti-alcohol policies cannot be

determined from these regressions, but there are reasons to doubt these policies had a major

impact. Cirrhosis began declining in 1908, albeit at a slower rate, well before these laws took

effect. The Reed amendment (like the earlier Webb-Kenyon law) was designed to facilitate

enforcement of state prohibitions, but the evidence presented here suggests these had little effect

overall and none in the pre-1920 period. The Food Control Laws did not prevent importation of

alcohol or consumption of existing stocks, and wartime prohibition did not take effect until July

1, 1919. Moreover, Congress made no appropriations for enforcement of any of these laws.

        Attributing the 1917-1919 decline in cirrhosis to pre-1920 anti-alcohol policies is also

problematic because there are other plausible explanations that are not fully accounted for by our

regressions. Until 1920, annual estimates of the age composition of the population were based

on interpolations of decadal census data without annual data on births, deaths or immigration

(Bureau of the Census, 1975). Thus, for the pre-1920 period, our age composition variables

plausibly miss important influences on cirrhosis such as the massive decline in immigration rates


30
   Constraining the coefficient on state prohibition to that obtained in the regression with
unconstrained year dummies has no significant effect on the coefficient on Prohibition or any of
the other variables.



                                                19
during the 1910s. In addition, World War I and the flu epidemic of 1918 produced an enormous

surge in the death rate (Bureau of the Census, 1975, pp. 58-62), so the population at risk of

cirrhosis was likely substantially reduced during the years 1918-1919. Warburton (1932, p. 25)

suggests that alcoholic beverages were stockpiled in anticipation of wartime restrictions. And as

noted above, the decline in cirrhosis appears to precede the decline in alcohol consumption.

Thus, we are skeptical that the pre-1920 decline in cirrhosis is mainly due to anti-alcohol

policies, but we cannot rule out that possibility.

        The coefficients on constitutional prohibition indicate it reduced cirrhosis. To gauge the

magnitude, we simulate the path of cirrhosis in the absence of Prohibition.31 The average

percent decrease in the cirrhosis death rate during Prohibition relative to the simulated rate is in

the bottom row of Tables 8 and 9. The estimated reductions range from –20.8% to 30.9% with an

average reduction across specifications of 12.6%.

     The correct interpretation of the cirrhosis data is thus that various factors led to a dramatic

decline in cirrhosis between roughly 1908 and 1920, especially during the years 1917-1919.

There is no evidence that state prohibitions caused this decline, and it is unclear whether pre-

1920 federal anti-alcohol policies contributed to the decline. Given the persistence of cirrhosis

and the low level it had reached by 1920, however, the continued low level during the 1920-1933

period does not suggest a major effect of constitutional prohibition in causing this low level.

Instead, our estimates suggest constitutional prohibition reduced cirrhosis by 10-20%.


31
  We use actual cirrhosis death rates for the years prior to Prohibition. Then, we estimate the
predicted cirrhosis death rate in the absence of prohibition using the estimated regression
coefficients. The predicted rate is then used as the lagged cirrhosis death rate for the next year’s
prediction. The estimated impact is the simulated cirrhosis death rate less the actual cirrhosis
death rate all divided by the simulated cirrhosis death rate.



                                                     20
5. Discussion

        We conclude by relating our results to the literature on the price-elasticity of the demand

for alcohol.    That literature offers a broad range of elasticity estimates, from virtually zero for

certain population subgroups to well in excess of -1.0 overall.32 If the true elasticity is in the

middle of this range, the small response of cirrhosis to Prohibition is surprising given the

conventional view that alcohol prices rose substantially during Prohibition. The estimates in

Table 4 above indicate an elasticity of cirrhosis with respect to alcohol consumption of 0.4-0.7,

and Thornton (1991) suggests that alcohol prices rose by about 500%. This implies that cirrhosis

should have fallen to almost nothing, rather than declining 10-20% as estimated above.

     One possible reconciliation is that the relevant elasticity is in fact quite low. The proxy for

alcohol consumption considered here is plausibly a better measure of heavy consumption than of

moderate consumption.       Theory does not suggest that heavy or addictive consumption is

necessarily inelastic (Becker and Murphy 1988), but there is evidence from micro data

suggesting that heavy consumption of alcohol is in fact virtually price inelastic (Manning,

Blumberg, and Moulton 1995).

     A second possible reconciliation is that the standard view about alcohol prices is inaccurate.

The conventional wisdom is based on data in Warburton (1932) and Fisher (1928, 1930); re-

examination of these data suggests a more nuanced picture.

32
  See Phelps and Leung (1991) for a detailed review and Chaloupka, Grossman, Becker and
Murphy (1993), Chaloupka and Grossman (1994), Manning, Blumberg, and Moulton (1995),
Moore and Cook (1995), Chaloupka and Wechsler (1996), Chaloupka and Laixuthai (1997),
Grossman, Chaloupka, and Sirtalan (1998), and Williams, Chaloupka, and Wechsler (2002) for
more recent work.



                                                 21
    A first problem with the standard view is that it neglects the behavior of the overall price

level.      Warburton's data compare prices between 1911-1915 and 1926-1930, while Fisher's

compare prices between 1916 and 1928. Both authors examine the behavior of nominal prices,

yet the price level increased by approximately 75 per cent between these two periods (Bureau of

the Census (1975), p. 211). Thus, the raw data presented by Warburton and Fisher overstate the

increase in the relative price of alcohol.

    In addition, Warburton presents a broad range of prices for the Prohibition period, and the

lowest prices reported suggest that, even ignoring inflation, some alcoholic beverage prices fell

relative to the pre-Prohibition period. This does not prove consumers paid less on average for

alcohol, but they faced an incentive to buy at the lowest prices and then stockpile the quantities

purchased. The available data do not allow computation of the average price actually paid, and

the extremely high prices reported in many cases by both Warburton and Fisher allow for the

possibility that the average price in fact rose. But the magnitude of this rise is undoubtedly less

than they asserted, and it is possible prices failed to rise substantially overall. If prices did not

increase very much, there is no puzzle in the failure of consumption to fall substantially.

    This last “explanation” raises the question of why prices would not have risen more

strongly.     One possibility is that because black market suppliers faced low marginal costs of

evading alcohol taxes and cost-increasing regulation, the net effect of prohibition on costs was

modest (Miron 2003).

    A second hypothesis is that Prohibition had little chance of being effective because of the

numerous avenues for evasion (Merz 1930, pp.65-71). Under Prohibition, physicians, druggists

and manufacturers of proprietary medicines could receive licenses to prescribe and dispense




                                                 22
liquor for “medicinal” purposes. The production of beer for the purpose of making near beer

remained legal, as did the production of industrial alcohol.33 Both exceptions to Prohibition

allowed for substantial diversion to consumption. Smuggling across the vast borders of the U.S.

provided another way to circumvent Prohibition.            And perhaps most importantly, home

production and small scale production of alcohol proliferated, thereby straining even the most

vigorous enforcement efforts.

          A third possibility is that Prohibition created a forbidden fruit effect, thereby shifting

preferences for alcohol and partially offsetting the depressing effect on demand of higher prices.

This hypothesis receives anecdotal support in some contexts, and accounts of drinking behavior

during Prohibition are consistent with such an effect (e.g., the term “roaring 20s”). Without more

detailed evidence, however, one cannot interpret the results here as a strong indication of such an

effect.

       Determining which of the above hypotheses is the best interpretation of the factual results in

this paper is not possible without further research.        The implications of any interpretation,

however, are important for policy toward a wide variety of currently prohibited activities.




33
     The method of producing near beer is to make real beer and then remove most of the alcohol.
