1       Introduction
The measurement of productivity has long been an important element of many areas
of both closed and open economy macroeconomics.1 From the time of Solow’s [1957]
contribution, it has been common practice to measure productivity using the “Solow
residual” — value added minus the contributions of capital and labor, where these
contributions are measured as the quantities of capital and labor multiplied by their
shares in value added.
    However, the measurement of productivity has recently received a great deal of
attention from empirical macroeconomists.2 This growing research agenda is largely
driven by the fact that the measurement of factor utilization, an important element in
cyclical ßuctuations, is now thought to be crucial for the measurement of productivity.
Accurate measurement of the utilization of capital is hypothesized to be particularly
important. One of the main results emerging from this literature is that the Solow
residual is, at best, a measure of productivity which is contaminated by measurement
error. More speciÞcally, researchers have found that the properties of the Solow
residual (also called the “productivity residual”) are sensitive to modiÞcations that
employ various proxies for factor utilization. When these corrections are undertaken,
the resulting measure of productivity is much less volatile than the standard Solow
residual; it is also much less highly correlated with output growth and is more likely
to pass exogeneity tests. To date, this literature has focused on data from the United
States.
    The goal this paper is to explore how various utilization corrections alter our views
about the nature of the productivity residuals both within and across countries, and
the ways in which shocks to productivity are transmitted across countries. Using data
for the U.S. and Canada, we investigate the behavior of productivity using three prox-
ies for capital services: the capital stock; energy inputs; and materials inputs. We
document, for each country separately, how the various utilization corrections alter
the characteristics of the productivity residual concerning volatility, the correlation
with output and labor input, and persistence. Next, we explore how correcting for

variable utilization alters the predictions for sectoral interactions within and across
countries. We Þnd that adjusting for cyclical movements in capital utilization al-
ters many of the empirical characteristics of productivity, both within and across
countries.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset
and our approach to measuring the productivity residual. Section 3 presents within-
country results for these adjusted measures of productivity, focusing on volatility,
the correlations with output and labor input, and the transmission of productivity
across industries and countries. We compare the results for the US and Canada, and
discuss how each of these statistics is aﬀected by the utilization corrections. Section
4 studies the cross-country, cross-industry behavior of productivity. We investigate
how altering the measure of capital utilization changes our view of the correlation
of productivity innovations across industries, within and across countries. We also
explore how alternative measures of productivity aﬀect estimates of the parameters
of the stochastic process for productivity across countries. Section 5 concludes.


2     Empirical method and data
This section summarizes our data and our approach to measuring sectoral productiv-
ity.

2.1    Methodology
Several researchers have focused on variations in capital utilization as the primary
margin for adjustment of factor utilization over the business cycle. Since capital
utilization cannot be directly observed, it is necessary to Þnd a reasonable proxy for
this variable. Basu [1996] argues that materials inputs are a good proxy for utilization
of labor and capital. He presents a graph (his Figure 1) which plots gross output
together with labor input, materials inputs, and a labor-capital aggregate. This
Þgure shows that materials and gross output are much more highly correlated than
output and labor, and even more than output and the cost-share weighted aggregate
of labor and capital. Materials are likely a good proxy for capital utilization due to
the simple fact that there is no intensity margin associated with adjusting materials
inputs. As a result, there are no unmeasured service ßows from materials inputs. If
the elasticity of substitution between materials and capital is low, then materials can

                                           3
be a good proxy for the ßow of services from capital.
    Another popular proxy for capital utilization is energy input. The idea here is
that running machines longer and keeping factories and stores open longer involves
increased use of energy inputs such as electricity to keep the lights on and the machines
running, and coal and gas for heating and air conditioning. Energy has been used
as a proxy for capital utilization by Costello [1993] and, more recently, by Burnside,
Eichenbaum, and Rebelo [1995].3

2.2     Data
The data used in this paper consists of inputs and outputs for 19 manufacturing
industries from the United States and Canada. Our dataset contains annual data
spanning the period 1961-1991. We focus on the following industries: Food, Tobacco,
Textiles, Apparel, Lumber, Furniture & Fixtures, Paper Products, Printing & Pub-
lishing, Chemicals, Petroleum & Coal, Rubber & Plastics, Leather, Stone-Clay &
Glass, Primary Metals, Fabricated Metals, Industrial Machinery, Electrical Machin-
ery, Transportation Equipment, and Miscellaneous manufacturing. The data for the
U.S. are from the NBER Productivity Database and Citibase, while the Canadian
data are drawn from the Canadian Input-Output Tables and the KLEMS database.4
    Output is measured using value added. Labor input is measured as total hours
worked by production workers, and capital is the real stock of capital at a point in time
during the year. The prior literature has suggested that appropriate measurement
of capital services is critical to the measurement of the productivity residual. The
capital stock is the measure most commonly used, but this measure does not allow for
variations in the capital utilization rate. We explore two popular proxies for capital
services: materials inputs and energy usage.5 Materials and energy are measured
by the real value of spending on each, with materials containing both energy and
non-energy materials expenditures. For the purpose of constructing factor shares,
we used sectoral measures of total labor compensation.6
   3
     Shapiro [1993,1996] has provided substantial evidence that the workweek of capital is a good
measure of capital services. Unfortunately, there is no data available for Canada on the workweek
of capital.
   4
     We thank Steve Lange for providing the Canadian data. For more information on the data, see
the appendix.
   5
     Because we lack comparable data on the workweek of capital for Canada, we unfortunately
cannot explore this third popular proxy for capital services.
   6
     We note that energy is a very small component of materials purchases and is highly correlated

2.3     Construction of productivity residuals
This section outlines our approach to measuring productivity based on a common
economic theory of production. Following Solow [1957] and others, we begin with a
production function, G(.), which expresses gross output (Yit ) as a function of labor
input (Nit ), capital services (Sit ),materials inputs (Mit ),and the level of productivity
(Ait ) :
                                Yit = Gi (Ait , Nit , Sit , Mit ) .                     (1)
We assume that the technology governing the production of gross output combines
materials inputs and value added (V Ait ):

                                  Yit = Gi (V Ait , Mit ),                             (2)

where value added generated by industry i in period t is a constant-returns-to scale
function, which is at least locally Cobb-Douglas:
                                                  αN    αK
                                  V Ait = Ait Nit it Sitit                             (3)

Taking logs of (3) yields the solution for the productivity residual:

                               ait = vait − αN         K
                                             it nit − αit sit                          (4)
where lowercase letters represent the natural logarithm of their uppercase counterpart,
and the shares αN         K
                 it and αit refer to labor and capital shares in value added. Labor’s
share in each industry is measured as the nominal compensation of employees divided
by nominal value added, and then averaged over the sample period. Capital’s share
is then computed as a residual:

                                      αK         N
                                       it = 1 − αit .


   We examined two Þltered versions of the logarithm of the productivity residual, ait .
First, we study the growth rate of the productivity residual, employing a simple Þrst-
diﬀerence Þlter, as is commonly done in the productivity literature. Additionally, we
examined the cyclical component of the productivity residual using the BP12 (6, 32)
approximate band-pass Þlter described in Baxter and King [1999]. We found that
the results were similar for the two Þlters, and we report only the results for the
Þrst-diﬀerence Þlter.
with non-energy materials.

3     Within-country results
In this section, we compute sectoral productivity residuals using the various proxies
for capital services, and we evaluate the sensitivity of the productivity residuals to
alternative assumptions regarding the appropriate utilization proxy.

3.1    Descriptive statistics
Table 1 contains the average growth rate of value added, labor and capital inputs, the
average product of labor, and three measures of total factor productivity based on our
three proxies for capital services. The results are separated into two manufacturing
categories: durables and nondurables. Canadian output growth is stronger for both
manufacturing groups, with the overall average exceeding the U.S. (2.86 compared to
2.23). U.S. labor input essentially does not grow for durables, and actually has mod-
erately negative growth for nondurables industries. The durables result is driven by
the extraordinarily large negative growth in Primary Metals, while the nondurables
results are driven by huge declines in labor input for the Tobacco and Leather in-
dustries. We see moderate growth in labor input for Canada, with slight negative
growth overall for nondurables. This is the same as the U.S. case, where the results
are dominated by a large decline in labor input for both the Tobacco and Leather
industries. Over the sample period, there is strong growth in Þxed capital for both
countries. Growth in the average product of labor has been slightly stronger in the
U.S., and is stronger for nondurables industries in both countries.
    The growth rate of total factor productivity depends upon the particular utiliza-
tion proxy, and this dependence varies across the two countries. For instance, in
the United States, productivity measured using the capital proxy (Solow residual)
exhibits the slowest growth for durables, nondurables and overall manufacturing.
Overall, we see the largest growth in productivity when capital services is proxied
by materials inputs, where U.S. manufacturing productivity grew on average at an
average annual rate of 1.61%. This compares with 1.15% for the capital proxy and
1.41% for the energy proxy. The three proxies reveal a diﬀerent pattern for Canadian
productivity. In the Canadian data, we Þnd that the materials proxy results in a lower
growth rate of productivity for durables and a higher growth rate for nondurables,
with the overall eﬀect being an identical average growth rate of productivity across
industries when compared to the capital proxy. The main diﬀerence for Canada is


                                          6
that the energy proxy results in a much lower productivity growth rate for both
durables and nondurables: the average growth of productivity across manufacturing
industries is 0.66% — barely half that implied by the capital or materials proxies.
    Finally, we examine the correlation of output and factor inputs for each industry
in the two countries. Table 2 contains these correlations for both countries. Like Basu
[1996], we Þnd that materials displays the largest correlation with output. However,
while we Þnd that the correlation of output and materials is greater than the corre-
lation of output and capital input as well as output and energy input, we Þnd that it
is roughly equal to that of output and labor input and output and a share-weighted
combination of capital and labor input.

3.2     Standard deviation of productivity by industry
In this section, we examine the various measures of productivity in terms of their
volatility — measured by the standard deviation of the growth rate and cyclical com-
ponent of each series. A common criticism of the Solow residual is that it is simply too
volatile to be an accurate representation of the state of aggregate productivity, and
that it implies unrealistic predictions regarding the probability of technical regress.
Table 3 contains volatility statistics for each measure of productivity for both the
U.S. and Canada.
    Canadian productivity is more volatile than that of the U.S. for both durables
and nondurables. While the diﬀerence is smaller for the materials proxy, this pattern
holds across all three proxies for capital services. For durable goods industries, U.S.
productivity averages only about 62% as volatile as Canadian productivity. For the
nondurable goods industries, the diﬀerence across countries is less pronounced, with
U.S. productivity averaging 95% as volatile as that of Canada. Across all manufactur-
ing, productivity in the U.S. is only 79% as volatile as in Canada. A second pattern
seen in the data is that productivity in nondurable goods industries is more volatile
than for durables.7 Generally, this holds for both countries. However, the exception
to the rule is the productivity series measured using the energy proxy for Canada,
where on average it is slightly more volatile for durable goods. Similar patterns exist
for both the cyclical component and the growth rate of productivity.
    Several industries stand out in terms of volatility. For example, while Furniture
   7
    This is partially due to the extremely high volatility of productivity in the Petroleum & Coal
sector. For both countries, this industry exhibits roughly double the volatility of any other sector.


                                                 7
and Fixtures productivity displays below-average volatility for the U.S., it displays
above-average volatility for Canada. As a result, productivity in this industry is over
twice as volatile in Canada than in the U.S.. Similar results are found in Transporta-
tion, Electrical Equipment and Miscellaneous Manufacturing. For the nondurables
sectors, we see this same pattern for Tobacco, Apparel, Paper, and Rubber and Plas-
tic, where the productivity residuals in Canada are much more volatile than those
in the U.S.. In general, we see that the diﬀerence (i.e., Canadian relative to U.S.)
is greatest for the productivity series measured using materials as the capital ser-
vices proxy. The opposite is true for Petroleum & Coal and Leather industries: for
Petroleum, each capital services proxy yields approximately the same results, while
for Leather the materials proxy delivers the smallest diﬀerence between the U.S. and
Canada.
    The materials and energy proxies reduce the volatility in both countries and in
both manufacturing groups; this diﬀerence is more pronounced in the durable sectors
and is generally strongest for the U.S. In general, the materials proxy produces the
least volatile measure of productivity: these measures are roughly 2/3 as volatile as
the Solow residual (capital proxy) for durables, and 85% as volatile for nondurables,
with total manufacturing falling in between these two Þgures. These results are
consistent with the idea that materials inputs provide a superior measure of capital
services relative to the capital stock. If true capital services are more highly correlated
with output ßuctuations than the stock of capital, then the capital stock does not
provide an accurate estimate of the volatility of the ßow of capital services. Any
variation in capital services which is not captured by the relatively small variations
in the stock of capital is attributed to variations in productivity — thus, overstating the
true volatility of total factor productivity. Petroleum seems to be a special case where
none of the three proxies provide a suﬃcient measure of capital services. For both
the growth rate and especially the cyclical component, the volatility of productivity
for Petroleum & Coal essentially matches the volatility of output in the industry.
The very small variations in labor input and measured capital services relative to
output in this industry result in a productivity measure which is essentially identical
to output. Additionally, a good portion of the sample period is dominated by erratic
movements in value added for this industry, which are the result of the oil price shocks
during the 1970’s. However, the point being that none of our three proxies appears
to do a reasonable job of representing the ßow of capital services.


                                            8
    Table 4 presents a measure of relative volatility — the standard deviation of pro-
ductivity relative to that of output. This table shows that the Canadian residuals
are not only more volatile than US residuals in absolute terms, but are also more
volatile relative to own-country output. In the United States, the relative volatility
of productivity ranges from 49% (for materials) to 69% (for capital proxy), while the
corresponding Canadian range is 72−82%, again with materials representing the low-
est and capital the greatest. A second clear pattern that emerges is that productivity
for nondurables is more volatile relative to output than for the durables sector; this
is especially true for the United States, although the same trend holds for Canada.

3.3    Correlation with output by industry
Table 5 shows the correlation of output and the productivity residual in each sector.
In general, we Þnd that output and the three measures of productivity are highly
correlated. Canadian productivity residuals are more highly correlated with output
than those in the United States. For both countries, the materials and energy proxies
reduce the correlation of productivity and output. This is more pronounced for the
United States, with the largest change occurring for the durable goods sectors. Over-
all, the materials proxy results in the lowest correlation with output. Otherwise, there
are similar patterns across non-durables and durables, and there are no signiÞcant
diﬀerences for the growth rate and cyclical component.

3.4    Correlation with labor input by industry
Because labor input and capital services are complements in production, increases in
labor input and capital services should coincide. For example, during an economic
boom, increases in hours worked cause subsequent increases in the marginal product
of capital services, resulting in increased capital accumulation and/or greater uti-
lization of the capital stock. A measure of productivity which does not account for
cyclical movements in the utilization of capital will cause labor input to be artiÞcially
correlated with productivity.
    Table 6 contains the correlation of labor input, measured by hours worked, and
the three measures of the productivity residual. Generally, we Þnd the productivity-
labor input correlations to be lower than those between productivity and output. The
largest correlations are found for the capital proxy, and these correlations are greater


                                           9
for the durables sectors for both the cyclical component and the growth rate. For both
countries, the productivity-labor input correlations are reduced when the materials
and energy proxies are employed. In fact, the materials proxy nearly reduces the
correlation to zero. For productivity growth rates, there is still a large diﬀerence in
this correlation across the durables and nondurables sectors.


4     Cross-country, cross-industry behavior of pro-
      ductivity
This section studies the cross-country, cross-industry behavior of productivity. We
want to learn how altering the measure of capital utilization changes our view of the
correlation of productivity innovations across industries, within and across countries.
We also explore how alternative measures of productivity aﬀect estimates of the
parameters of the stochastic process for productivity across countries.

4.1    Correlation across industries and across countries
Our main results are summarized in Table 7. This table displays the cross-country
correlation of productivity within an industry and the correlation of productivity
across industries within a country. Panel 1 of the table focuses on intra-industry,
cross-country correlations; these correlations are also displayed in Figures 1-A and 1-
B. These correlations give an idea of how correlated productivity is across countries
when focusing on a single industry. For example, the correlation of productivity
growth is 0.35 between the US and Canadian Lumber & Wood industries when the
capital stock is used as the measure of capital services. This correlation falls to 0.17
when materials are used as the proxy for capital services, and is 0.27 when energy
is used. Taken as a group, the durables sectors display higher intra-industry, cross-
country correlations than do the nondurables sectors. This is true for each of the
proxies for capital services. For example, when materials are used as the capital
proxy the average intra-industry, cross-country correlation for durables is 0.26, but is
only 0.17 for nondurables. When energy is used, the correlation is 0.38 for durables,
but 0.26 for nondurables. For most individual industries, the capital proxy yields
the highest intra-industry, cross-country correlation, while the materials proxy yields
the lowest correlation.


                                          10
    It is diﬃcult to know what to make of these intra-industry, cross-country cor-
relations without some kind of benchmark. The lower part of Table 7 shows the
average correlation between industries within the US and within Canada. The typi-
cal correlation across US industries is 0.38 with the capital stock proxy; the Canadian
correlation is 0.30. These within-country correlations drop to the 0.24-0.29 range
with the materials and energy proxies. Thus we conclude that intra-industry, cross-
country correlations are of similar magnitude to the typical cross-industry correlation
within a country.
    Panel 4 of Table 7 displays the average correlation between industries across coun-
tries. This correlation is computed as the average of all correlations formed by using
one industry in the US and another industry in Canada. This should be thought of
as a ‘typical’ cross-country correlation, where the industry is not necessarily the same
across countries. Here, we Þnd that the correlation is lower than the intra-industry,
cross-country correlations reported in Panel 1. That is: cross-country correlations
are higher when the industry in question is the same in both countries. This is true
regardless of the proxy for capital services. We also observe that the average correla-
tion across countries is lower than the average within a country; again, this is true for
all measures of capital services. These results suggest that there are country-speciÞc
components to productivity as well as industry-speciÞc components to productivity,
and that this Þnding is robust to the particular measure of labor services.

4.2    Statistical models of productivity
Two-country real business cycle models typically specify a bivariate process for pro-
ductivity of the following form:
                         "         #       "          #"           #       "         #
                             at                ρ ν∗        at−1                εt
                                       =                               +                 ,   (5)
                             a∗t               ν ρ∗        a∗t−1               ε∗t

where at represents the logarithm of productivity in the home country, a∗t is the
same for the foreign country, and corr(εt , ε∗t ) > 0. The diagonal terms (ρ, ρ∗ ) indicate
the degree of persistence in productivity, and the oﬀ-diagonal terms (ν, ν ∗ ) represent
cross-country, intertemporal spillover of productivity innovations. Previous research
has revealed these parameters to be very diﬃcult to estimate with precision. The
estimates of Backus, Kehoe and Kydland [1992] suggest that innovations to produc-
tivity are temporary and that there are large, positive spillovers between countries.


                                                      11
However, they use output and labor input to construct their measures of productivity,
which ignores important movements associated with capital services. Using a dataset
on aggregate output for several countries, together with measures of labor and capital
services, Reynolds [1993] Þnds that if spillovers exist, they are not symmetric across
countries. Baxter and Crucini [1995] use the Backus, et al. data and methodology,
and Þnd that it is not possible to reject the existence of a unit root in productivity.
More speciÞcally, they cannot reject the hypothesis that productivity is well described
by an independent random walk in each country. The imprecision of these parameter
estimates is troubling, given that they play such an important role in open-economy
business cycle models.
    We estimate versions of (5) for three aggregated measures of productivity: non-
durables, durables and total manufacturing. We compare the estimates for each
productivity measure using our three proxies for capital services. The results are
presented in Table 8. The estimated persistence parameters for each utilization proxy
exceed 0.95 for most cases; given the size of the standard errors, statistical tests
would not reject a hypothesis of a unit root. At the aggregate level, the materials
and energy proxies produce a more persistent productivity series. For the durable
goods industries, this eﬀect is less evident for the materials proxy and more apparent
for the energy proxy.
    We Þnd little evidence in favor of intertemporal cross-country spillovers of pro-
ductivity. Estimates of (5) indicate that there are few cases where even one of the
spillover parameters is statistically signiÞcant. Additionally, the few spillover para-
meters that are marginally statistically signiÞcant are negative, which is implausible,
as it implies that technical progress in one country leads, over time, to technical
regress in the other.
    Two alternative methods of exploring the spillover question are to examine lead-
lag relationships of productivity across countries and to test for Granger causality. If
productivity correlations within an industry leads in one country, then there is some
evidence in favor of spillover. Similarly, Granger causality of productivity across
countries would suggest intertemporal cross-country spillover. We examined both of
these and still found no evidence to support the spillover hypothesis.

5    Conclusion
This paper studies the impact of variations in factor utilization on the measurement
of productivity and its statistical properties, both within and across countries. Using
sectoral data for the United States and Canada, we examined the properties of the
productivity residual based on three proxies for capital services: the capital stock;
materials inputs, and energy usage. In both countries, we found that accounting for
variable capital utilization alters many of the empirical characteristics of productivity
residuals.
    After accounting for variations in capital utilization, productivity appears much
less volatile, and displays much lower correlations with output and labor input. While
these results initially seem troublesome for real business cycle models, recent research
indicates that this is not necessarily the case. King and Rebelo [1998] and Baxter and
Farr [2001] show that productivity shocks need not be extremely volatile to mimic
the patterns of business cycles. Both papers develop models that generate realistic
business cycles when driven by a productivity series which is roughly 60% as volatile as
output and displays very low probability of technical regress. Additionally, the model
of Baxter and Farr [2001] indicates that variable capital utilization actually improves
the ability of an open economy real business cycle model to replicate common cyclical
patterns without an extremely volatile productivity process and without unreasonably
large correlations of productivity with output, labor input, or across countries.
    We found that accounting for variations in factor utilization rates reduces the cor-
relation of productivity across countries within a given sector. More importantly, we
found that the correlation of these intra-industry, cross-country productivity shocks
exceeds the average cross-country correlation (where the average is taken over all
possible industry pairs). This suggests that there are important industry-speciÞc
components to productivity that can be detected even in short time series using an-
nual data, and which are robust to various proxies for capital services. Further, we
found that the average correlation across industries within a particular country was
similar for the US and Canada, and exceeded the average cross-country correlation.
    We found that estimates of a bivariate process for productivity are not aﬀected
signiÞcantly by alternative proxies for capital services. Productivity is highly per-
sistent in each country and may contain a unit root. Our results oﬀer no support for
the existence of signiÞcant intertemporal cross-country spillover of productivity inno-


                                           13
vations. Unfortunately, accounting for variable capital utilization does not lead to
greater precision in the parameter estimates. Thus, signiÞcant uncertainty remains
concerning the true stochastic process for productivity.

6    Appendix
This appendix discusses the data used for the empirical analysis. Our data comes
from four main sources — two for each country. The data for the United States
comes from the NBER Productivity Database (also known as the ASM Database)
and Citibase. Output, which we measure as using value added, is found in both
real and nominal dollars. Labor input is measured by the total hours worked by
production workers, also found in the ASM. To compute labor’s share, we used a
measure of total compensation from Citibase. Using this series, which is in current
dollars, and the measure of nominal value added from the ASM, we computed a
measure of labor’s share. Capital’s share is then computed as a residual. Energy and
materials inputs are measured by the real value of spending on each, where materials
spending includes purchases of energy materials as well as other materials. The results
are not much diﬀerent if we only use the non-energy component of materials inputs.
For Canada, the data come from the Canadian Input-Output Tables and the KLEMS
Database. Each measure is similar to that of the United States, with the exception of
labor’s share, which is measured using a compensation series for production workers.
However, the resulting share statistics are quite similar.

Notes. Estimates correspond to equation (3.5), with the first column containing the estimates from
the equation for the Canadian productivity residual and the second column containing the estimates
from the equation for the U.S. productivity residual. Standard errors in parentheses. Statistics under
the Capital, Materials, and Energy headings represent results for total factor productivity constructed
using the capital stock, materials inputs, and energy inputs, respectively.
