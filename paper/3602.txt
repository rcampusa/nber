            INTERTEMPORAL LABOR SUPPLY: AN ASSESSMENT

                              ABSTRACT


     The lifecycle labor supply model has been proposed as an
explanation for various dimensions of labor supply, including

movements over the business cycle, changes with age, and within—
person variation over time.   According to the model, all of these
elements are tied together by a combination of intertemporal

substitution effects and wealth effects.     This paper offers an
assessment of the model's ability to explain the main components
of labor supply, focusing on microeconomic evidence for men.

                         Intertemporal Labor Supply: An Assessuent

     The systematic study of intertemporal labor supply began only two
                1
decades ago.          In a remarkably short time the lifecycle model of individual

hours choice has moved to the forefront of both micra— and macro-

econometric         research.      This paper begins with    a look at the original

questions     that    first lead to interest in the lifecycle approach. I then

present   a selective review of the evidence on various dimensions of
intertemporal        labor      supply.   I limit my discussion to microeconomecric

studies of male labor supply. making no attempt at an exhaustive survey of
                                                2
even this branch of the literature.                 Rather, my goal is tQ offer an

assessment of the success and/or failure of the lifecycle model in

providing a useful framework for understanding the major components of

individual     labor     supply

     I conclude that the lifecycle labor supply literature sheds very little

light on the questions that first generated interest in a lifecycle

approach: what determines the shape of the lifecycle hours profile? how

does labor supply respond to aggregate wage changes? what is the source of

idiosyncratic changes in year—to—year labor supply? Part of the reason for

th[s stems     from a tendency in the literature to concentrate on one aspect
of   intertemporal hours variation ——           the response to wage growth along a

known lifecycle trajectory                and to ignore another, namely, the response

to wage innovations that lead to revised expectations about future wage


     Lucas and Rapping (1970) seem to be the first authors to use an
explicit intertemporal model to describe short and long run labor supply
phenomena. although Mincer (1962) dlscinguished becween the effects of
short run unemployment and long run wage increases in explaining the
behavior of female labor supply.

rates. More seriously perhaps. much of the effort devoted to studying

lifecycle 1.abor supply has taken         the position   that   average hourly earnings
during the year is a "sufficient statistic" for hours choices within the

year.     There is considerable evidence against this narrow reading of the

lifecycle     model.




L The Ouestlons

    A series of substantive questions motivated the original interest in

lifecycle labor supply.     Lucas and Rapping (1970). following an original

suggestion of Friedman (1976, pp.206-207),        posited       a lifecycle framework as

a way to reconcile an elastic short—run labor supply curve with an

inelastic or even backward—bending long—run labor supply curve.               Lucas and

Rapping's idea was to model cyclical hours variation as a response to a

temporary wage change.      Subsequently, much debate in the macroeconomics

literature has focused on the size of this Intertemporal wage elasticity.

        A second motivation for studying lifecycle labor supply arose from

interest in human capital theory, and the recognition that the pattern of

lifecycle hours is influenced by the pattern of lifecycle wage rates.               This

goal     is clearly articulated by Heclcman (1976, page S12), who notes that a
model with endogenous labor supply can potentially reconcile differences in
the lifecycle profiles of earnings and        hourly   wage rates.
        A related question is whether wage    growth over the lifecycle can

explain the parallel profiles of consumption and earnings.              The simplest
permanent income model predicts      no systematic relation between earnings and



         3Lucas and Rapping (1970. footnote 11) also noted in passing that
their     model had '. ..lifecyele   as   well as business—cycle implications."
                                           3


consumption.       The finding that individuals with steeper lifecycle profiles

of earnings have steeper lifecycle profiles of consumption has therefore

bee" used as evidence of credit constraints or other impediments to an

optimal lifecycle allocation (Thurow (1969), Chez in Cbez end Becker

(1975). Carrol and Summers (1989)). AsflCkjjafl (1974) pointed out,

however, a model with endogenous labor supply can explain the parallel age

profiles of consumption and earnings, if leisure and consumption are
               4
complements.

    Other questions have also emerged: what (if anything) can we conclude

about the interpretation of measured unemployment (Ashenfelter and Ham

(1979))? how does a lifecycle perspective affect the interpretation of the

responses measured in the Negative Income Tax experiments? how doer a"

inteigeneiational transfer system (such as Social Security) affect the

hours of young and old workers? Finally, and perhaps fundamentally, how

can we explain the enormous year—co—year variation in individual—specific

labor supply that appears in virtually every available panel data set?

    The power of the lifecycle framework. and the extent of economists'

faith in the model, are illustrated by considering a         simple   decomposition

of individual labor supply into aggregate time effects, systematic age

effects, permanent person—specific effects, and         person—and—year    specific

effects. The lifecycle labor supply model has bee" proposed as a"

explanation for all four components!       Lucas and Rapping     (1970)   proposed

that a lifecycle model could explain aggregate year—to—year m oveulents in

labor supply (the "time effects" in a          components—of—variance model)




     4This same idea can potentially explain the "excess" covariation of
income and consumption growth in aggregate data.
                                                    4


Heckman     (1974, 1976), Chez and Becker (1975), and others proposed that the
lifecycle model could explain sys tematic age effects in hours of work, and
also differences across people in their amount of market woik over the
lifecycle (i.e.         the   person—specific constants),           Finally, models used by
liaCurdy    (1981),     Altonj i   (1986)   and   others     link     person—and—year—specific

changes in hours to the corresponding changes in                     wages.




IL The     Basic tiodel

      A   prototypical lifecycle labor supply model begins with a                        time—

reparable utility function defined over consumption (cj)                           and    houlB of work

Here, fl—(l+p)          measures subjective time discounting and                    is a sequence
of    "taste shifters" that capture heterogeneity across individuals and                          over
time.      jç models with uncertainty, preferences are assumed to be additive

objective function is simply the expectation of (1). conditional o" current

information.

      The second element of the model is the intertemporal budget constraint.

which describes the change in the value of assets (Aj) between periods:

Here,     Pt is   the   puce of consumption goods in t,                   is the real interest

rate in period t (assumed to be known). and                         is the real wage of

individual I      for     hours     wouked in period t.

Equations        (3a)     and     (3b) can be solved for consumption and hours in terms of
        and      the    current marginal utility of wealth.              It is conventional to

refer       to   the implied         solution for hours as the "intercemporal labor supply

function",             With     a" appropriate transformation       of    the taste shift variable
       write      the log—linear approximation6 of this function as:

to wages j t, holding constant the marginal utility of wealth.                           Following

the literature. I shall refer to 'i                     as the intertemporal substitution

elasticity. This elasticity is necessarily positive, and is strictly

greeter than the (lUcks Ian) compensated labor supply elasticity associated

with the same preferences. if leisure is a normal good.                          The parameter 6

between the real interest          rate    and the rate of time preference p.                 In this

case, apart from taste changes and a geometric trend. the lifecycle profile

of labor supply is completely determined by the profile of wages.

       The implications of cthe lifecycle model under uncertainty are most

easily seen by combining equation (3c) with equation (4) to describe the

change in hours between periods t—l and t:


(5)       flog hit — Aa1 +            Alog      w1       &.(r1 p) + S        + 6


where          • log                  log Aj        is   the one—period—ahead forecast error

distribution of                is constant.       Thus, the change in labor supply consists
of a      component    due to changes in tastes                    a   component due     to

variation in wages, a component due to the difference between the real

interest rate and the rate of time preference, and a component due to any

updating in the logarithm of the marginal utility of income.

      The simple form of equation (5) has considerable appeal. and variants
of if are used in many recent microeconometñc studies of labor supply. In
a stochastic environment, however, it is important co          keep   in mind that the
response of individual hours to a change in wages has two parts.             The first

of these is               as in the perfect foresight model.    The second is the

change in labor supply generated by the change in the marginal utility of

wealth.       The realization of w1 provides new    information that generates an

update      in the distribution of future wages and brings about a revision in
the forecast of Aj. Unfortunately, there are no closed—form expressions
for Alt in an uncertain environment          Thus, the component of the change in
labor supply attributable to wealth       effects is usually treated as a

"nuisance", and is        eliminated by an instrumental variables procedure.      This
is not to say that the wealth effects associated with observed wage changes
are   small.     Indeed, my reading of the evidence suggests they are
potentially       significant.   However, the difficulty of deriving a formal or

even approximate expression for           has lead most researchers to

concentrate      on the intertemporal substitution effect.

III. Enwirical Implications and Evidence

a. The Lifecvde Profile of Hours

    The first snd most dirert implication of the lifecycle mod.l concerns

the shape of the lifecycle hours profile. As pointed out earlier, with

perfect foresight and constant real interest rates. the model implies that

the lifecycle profile of hours consists of a taste component, a trend, and

a component that is strictly proportional to wages.         The presence of

uncertainty adds other components with mean zero over a large sample of

lifecycles.    To see this, re—write the lifecycle labor supply function as:


(4.3) log       -         +    log W. + 6 ( log A10 +( P I               +


                —   EQ   log       + q (log W- EQ log


                               S         r -
                                               r1   + it-j )
where EQ denotes expectations at the beginning of the lifecycle, and r is

the expected real interest rate in period 0 (assumed to be constant)

Hours at age t differ from hours planned at the beginning of the lifecycle

by a term representing the forecast error in wages, plus another

representing the cumulative forecast errors in interest rates and the

marginal utility of income. Over a large sample of lifecycles (spanning
different periods of calendar time), the estimated age profile of lifecycle
                                                                     9
hours   therefore converges to the mean of the planned profiles.

    The typical shapes of the lifecycle profiles of wages and hours for

male    workers are illustrated in Figures 1 and    2.   The underlying data for

     9Obviously, it may not be possible to recover an unbiased estimate of
the planned lifecycle profile of hours from a sample of individuals in the
same cohort, since these individuals share the same aggregate—level shocks
in each year of their life.
                                                  9

these figures are tsken from the 1977—1989 Match Current Population Surveys

(CI'S) ,     and   pertain to annual hours and average hourly earnings (annual

earnings divided by annual hours) for calendar years 1976-88.                  Figure 1

shows annual averages of log wages for 6 single—year age cohorts.                Each

distinct line in the figure tracks the wage profile of a single cohort over

the    13 year sample period.          Figure 2 shows the corresponding profiles of

average annual hours.

       The data in Figure 1 suggest char successive cohorts face similar

expected wage profiles: real wages rise quickly between the ages of 20 and

30. and then grow         more slowly to a      peak around age 50. Nevertheless, there

are obvious year effects in average hourly earnings. and important cohort
effects, During the 1980's, later cohorts tended to earn lower real wage
rates than earlier ones.              This negative wage growth provides a" interesting
opportunity        to test   Lewis'   (1956)   influential interpretation of the trend
toward lower hours of work during the first half of the 20th century.

Levis (1956, p.         197) argued that the decline reflected a" income effect,

driven by higher average wages for successive cohorts of workers.                If this

interpretation is correct, one             should detect a"   increase in hours for the

mast   recent cohorts.

       10
        The samples for each year consist of men age l67O excluding those
who  are classified as self employed and those with allocated wage and
salary   earnings. Individuals who report positive wage and salary earnings.
positive weeks of work, and positive usual hours per week for the previous
year are counted as working.   Individuals who were working and who report
average hourly earnings less than $1.00 or greater than $75 (in 1983
dollars) are deleted from the sample. The sample sizes in each year range
from 36,000 to 42.000.
        11
       Average real wage rates declined sharply between 1979 and 1981.   For
the youngest cohort in Figure 1, this effect appears as a slowdown in the
rate of growth of wages. For older cohorts, real wages actually declined.
                                             10


       The lifecycle profiles of hours in Figure 2 have a rather different

shape than rhe profile of wages.         Per—capita hours of work reach their peak

in the early 30s. are roughly constant co age 40, fall slightly to age 50,

and then decline sharply. The pattern of hours among chose who actually

work is similar. reaching a peak of about 2100 hours at: age 30, remaining

arable to age 50, falling to 1900 hours at age 60, and then declining

sharply. The growth in hours at the beginning of the lifecycle coincides

with a gradual withdrawal from school.            Thirty percent of all 20 year oHs

in the March CPS (1977-89) report their main activity in the previous veek

as "in school".      This fraction falls to 11 percent by age 23 and to 2
                      12
percent by age 30.           Much of the decline in per—capita hours at the other

end of the lifecycle reflects withdrawal from the labor force. By age 62,

only 50 percent of men are still working any hours. Lifecycle patterns in

enrollment and employment probabilities are illustrated in Figure 3,           which

graphs the average probabilities by age for men in the 13 year OPS
           13
sample.
     The   hours profiles in Figure 2 indicate strong year effects, with all
cohorts showing a downturn in hours in 1982.   In contrast to the profiles
of wages. however, the hours profiles of the younger cohorts are not
systematically different from those of the older cohorts. Thus, there is
no     evidence for the inter—cohort income effects underlying Lewis'

explanation for the earlier decline in per—capita hours.



        12The CPS does not ask "weeks in school" during the previous year, or
give    any breakdown   of   hours per week into work and school time.
        13The   employment and enrollment rates in Figure 3 are not adjusted     for
any cohort effects.      'However, adjusted races are very similar.
                                               11

      Ho" well does the lifecycle model explain the lifecycle profile of

hours? Between the ages of 20 and 30 "ages grow by 40-45 percent, per

capita    annual hours grow by 55 percent, the employment rate grows by 10
points,    and hours conditional on working         grow by 45 percent.      Between   the

ages   of 30   and   50, "ages rise another 10-15      percent.    conditional hours are
constant. and the probability of working falls              5   points.   Finally, between
the ages of 50 and 60, "ages fall 5 percent, conditional hours fall 5—10

percent, and the employment rate falls by over 20 points.                 Clearly,   the

degrees of "curvature" in the lifecycles profiles of "ages and hours are

different.       Of course this does not refute the lifecycle model, because

tastes may vary systematically with age. and it is also possible that the

intertecnporal substitution elasticity varies with the number of hours
          14
worked.
       A stronger test is provided by the data in Figures 4 and 5, which

represent "age and conditional hours profiles for men in 3 education

classes: 0—0 years of schooling, exactly 12 years of schooling, and 16 or

more years of schooling.15 Between the ages of 30 and O the "age profiles

of these three groups differ dramatically. Wages of college graduates grow

some 40 percent, "ages of highschool graduates grow about 20 percent. and

wages of individuals with minimal schooling grow only 10 percent. However,


     14The "age profiles are also potentially biased estimates of the "age
profiles for the "hole population, since we only observe "ages for workers.
One way to evaluate the size of this bias is to assume that "ages for those
not working would be at some lower bound (say. the minimum "age) and then
to  re—calculate the average "age. This procedure suggests that rhe bias in
the "age profiles up to age 50 is trivial.
      15
         These profiles are estimated age coefficients from regressions of
average log wages and average log hours on age effects, year effects, and a
set    of broad (10-year      interval)   cohort effects.

for all three groups. hours (conditionsl on working)                  are constant between

age 30 end 50.        In fact, the hours profiles of the different education

groups are very similar.               To explain these data with     a    simple lifecycle

model requires a fairly elaborate set of taste parameters. 16 A simpler

interpretation is that the shape of the wage profile bears no causal

relation to the shape of the hours profile.

      It also is interesting to compare the three education classes in terms

of their average lifetime hours and average lifetime wages. For

simplicity, assume that individuals with 0—8 years of schooling begin work

at age 16,   vhile    highschool graduates begin work at 18 and college
                                        17
graduates begin work at 22.                   Then average hours worked per year between

the ages of 16 and 69 for the three education groups are es follows:



             Years         Education         Hours/lear      Hours/Year. if working

                     0 — 8                      1265                1756

                      12                        1537               1809


                     16÷                        1638               1833




Given the wage differentials between the 3                  groups. these data suggest that

higher lifetime wages are associated with higher lifetime hours. This



     160ne could also appeal to models with endogenous human capital
accumulation. Evidence presented by Holtz-Eakin, Newey and Rosen (1988)
however, indicates that legged hours have no influence on future wages.
This seems to rule out simple capital accumulation models.
      17
       These assumptions clearly understate the total labor supply of the
more—educated  workers.  First, many students work part—time or part of the
year.   Second, actual time spent in school is arguably closer to work than
leisure.

positive association calls into question the conventional view that long-

run     labor    supply is negatively associated with wages.

L_Econonrz-Wide Fluctuations

        Much    of the initial interest in lifecycle labor supply facussed on its

potential value in explaining cyclical changes in employment and/or hours.

Sincecyclical variation in real wages is limited, en equilibrium model
with a stable aggregate labor supply function requires a relatively high
elasticity       of labor supply to generate large swings in              employment   or hours.

In    principle, a lifecycle framework can reconcile              relatively elastic labor

supply        responses over   the business—cycle with inelastic          (or even negatively
sloped)        'long run!! Labor supply,    Recall that the intercemporal

substitution elasticity (i in equation (4))                 is necessarily larger than the

elasticity of hours holding constant either utility or wealth.                     Thus the

intertemporal substitution effect of a given change in wages q                            is

certainly positive and         is   potentially large

        To see the implications of the lifecycle model at the aggregate level,

consider forming the average change in labor supply between periods t—l and

t for a sample of individuals.             Equation   (5)    implies that

       Finegan (1962) examined data on wages and weekly hours in different
occupation and industry classes, and found a generally negative relation
between them. On the other hand, Finegan's results indicate a positive
association by level of education.   However, he dismisses this evidence.
asserting that wage differentials by education class include prernia for
training costs that should be netted out.   I have attempted an analysis
similar to Finegan's using data an 483 3-digit occupations for men inthe
March 1988 C?S. These data show a strong positive association between
average hours and average wages in different occupations. even controlling
for education and other demographic factors.

where tlog ht represents the average change in log hours in the sample,. M

represents the average change in the taste variable, A1ogW represents the

average change in log wages. and              represents the mean Of the forecast

errors in log Ai In principle it is possible to estimate (Sa) on

aggregate—level         data.   Something like this is actually carried out in Lucas
and Rapping (1970) .   Altonji (1982). and Nankiw, Rotemberg and Summers
(1985)      Here I vish to discuss the implications of (5e) for the "time
effects" that emerge in ulicroeconometric studies of labor supply. This
idea    was suggested     by Ashenfelter (1984)           and is pursued by Angrist (1989.
1990)

       Ashenfelter (1984)       observed that aggregate changes in labor supply for

a fixed cohort take a particularly simple form if (1)                  there   are no

aggregate components of taste variation. (ii) the real interest rate equals

the rate of rime preference, and            (iii)        individuals have perfect foresight.

In this case equation (Sa) reduces to


         flog h — Alog V.

Apart from sampling error. the mean change in hours is strictly

proportional to the mean change in wages. This specification can be freed

up by assuming that the taste components of individual labor supply follow

a     systematic lifecycle trend.        For example, suppose that

             —
                 a1 + b            + c/2Age.
where       is a permanent person—specific component of tastes, Agejdenotes

the age of individual i in period t, and b and c are comon population

parameters. Then equation (5a) implies


(6)      Alog h    —b      c/2 +   c't + ip alog w
                                            15


Since (by assumption) the only aggregate components of labor supply are

taste and wage variation, equation (6)       should fit the mea" changes f hours

end wages exactly. apart from sampling error in the estimated means.

Therefore,    as the number   of individuals jn the panel increases, the
                                                 19
associated    with   (6) should tend to unity.

   Ebtimates of this equation are presented in Angrist (1989) using the

means of wages and hours for a panel of males in the Panel Study of Income

Dynamics (PSID).20 Corresponding estimates based on cohort—level data from

consecutive CPS samples are presented in Angrlst (1990) .         In   analyzing the

CPS samples, Angrist (1990) divides the available data into two subsamples

—— 1963—74 and 1975-87 ——      and follows me" age 25—50 in 1964 in     the   first

subsample, and me" age 25-50      in   1976 in the second.   Angrist's estimates qf

the Iritertemporal substitution elasticity (with their estimated standard

errors in parentheses) are as follows:




     19These implications ai unchanged if one adds a person— and time-
specific component of taste variation to the model.

      20Actually, Angrist estimates the aggregated labor supply function in
level form.

Angrist      also reports a specification test based on the                      of the fitted

models. The specifications that include either linear or quadracic taste

components yield Cest statistics below conventional significance levels in

the PSID sample. In the CPS sample, all of the test statistics are above

their ,5 percent critical values, although it must be recognized that the

sample      sizes are   ltrge —— 7,000 to 10,000 per year.                  Interestingly, none of

the   CPS    results is substantively different when             the     an.alysis is repeated on

samples of men with a fixed age distribution in each year.

      These results suggest that there is a systematic positive relation

between mean wages and mean hours,              particularly in the more recent sample

period.      The relationship is       illustrated         in Figure 6, which plot two

measures of average annual labor supply together with                       a   measure of mean log

wages for men age 20-50 in 1976.            Wages and hours for these men (and for

other cohorts) rose between 1976 and 1978, fell In the early 1980's. and

then recovered. The timing of the post—1980 upturn differs between wages

(which grew between 1981 and 1982) and hours (which continued to fall until

1982). The covariation of wages and hours is also weak in the last 4 years

of the data. Nevertheless, wage and hours changes from 1976 to 1988                      are
very highly correlated

      Should we conclude that Iritertemporal labor supply does a good job of

explaining the time effects that emerge in an microeconometricz model? My -

belief     is that such a conclusion is premature. The reason is that the

assumption of perfect foresight regarding the aggregate changes that

occurred in the late 1970's and early 1980's is surely false.                      In the 3

decades before 1976, average real wages in the U.S. economy grew fairly
                                              21
steadily     at 2—3 percent per year.              After 1975. real wage growth
essentially       stopped.    This sharp downward adjustment in trend, coupled with
the actual       losses   in real   wages    in the early 1980s,   suggests    that natty
individuals suffered unexpected reductions in their lifetime wealth

According to the Lifecycle model, these changes should have affected hours

decisions,       and therefore should be modelled in the aggregate labor supply

equation.

      The difficulty is that very little is known about the evolution of the

marginal utility of income or the size of the wealth elasticity 6. One

approach is to write down a" intuitively plausible or econometrically

convenient model for Aj. For example. Lucas and Rapping                       (1970)   specified

a labor supply function of the form

                                                         *              *

        21Between 1947 and 1976, for example, real          average hourly earnings of
"on—supervisory workers rose            at   a" average annual rate of 2.38 percent.
                                                   18

This     is equivalent to replacing 6 log                  with -   +   0)   log Wft      in   the

labor     supply function (4)22        As   Altonji     and   Ashenfelter (1980) pointed
out,     the labor supply effects of aggregate wage changes                  ir   this   model

depend critically on the degree of persistence in innovations to the real
wage. F'  fact, it is difficult to reject the hypothesis that the aggregate
real     wage rate   is a random walk with drift.             If workers assume that the
"year effects" in individual wages have the same property. then the labor
supply     effect of a change in the aggregate component of wages depends only
on the "long run" elasticity 8.         23
                                              If    this is negative (as Lewis             (1956) and

many     subsequent authors have assumed) and if individuals expect aggregate-
level changes in       real wages to persisc        indefinitely     (as is perhaps true             for

changes in economy—wide real wage rates) then the predicted correlation
between the year effects in hours and wages from a panel of individual data
is negative I
       The only evidence in the microeconometric literature pertaining to the-
sign     of the "long run" labor supply elasticity (i.e., theelasticity of
hours with respect to a parallel shift in wage profiles) is from MaCurdy
(1981,     1985).     Macurdy (1985)   suggests a less restrictive specification
for the marginal utility          of incomethan Lucas—Rapping:



     220ne can derive a" intertemporal labor supply function that is
approximately equivalent to the Lucas-Rapping function (with 6—0) using the
within—period        preference   function
             U(c,h) — c       a
However, this   is only valid in the         absence       of uncertainty.
         23To see this, decompose log w             into    a permanent person effect. a
year effect v,         and   a person and yr specific effect. and suppose
                      Then (7) implies log          —

This specification implies that the elasticity of mean hours with respect

to a permanent change in "ages is q +                     where      is the mean of the

coefficients     over the remaining lifecycle and

varies    with the share of current assets in lifetime wealth.                 MaCurdy    (1985)

presents    estimates for 7 centering on - .0?            for individuals at the start of

their      lifecycle.       This is an upper bound on the absolute magnitude of the

wealth effect of a permanent innovation in wages for older workers, since

these individuals have a larger share of lifetime wealth in assets.

MaCurdyts estimates, then, suggest that the wealth effect of a permanent

change in wages is            small. and     that a permanent 10 percent increase in wages

is associated with a roughly 1 percent increase in hours. 24

    In my opinion, much more work needs to be done on measuring the wealth

effects of expected future wages before we                can conclude that the lifecycle
model provides      an adequate description of the year—to—year changes in

average    labor supply observed in a panel.              One useful exercise that has not
yet been carried out is               to   combine information on mean levels of
consumption and hours for a panel such as the PSID. The assumption of
perfect foresight implies that changes in mean                    consumption are described by

an equation of the form



                        s   estimates      of the tntertemporal substitution elasticity

consuaption,        and e (which is approximately equal to       q -    6)     measures the

degree      of     complernentarily or substitutability between leisure and

consumption, holding constant the marginal utility of wealth. At a

minimum,       the goodness—of—fit of this equation provides a" indication of the
magnitude of aggregate changes in the marginal utility of wealth.


.JndtviduaL-$pectfic Comp_ertts of Wa2e and Hours Variation
    In addition Co its implications for the age and time effects in

microeconometric       studies of labor supply, the lifecycle model offers a

potential        explanation for individual and period—specific hours variation
Specifically. suppose that Lndividual log wages are determined by a"
equation of the form:

(8)

where
          W1
                 is a person—specific   constant,     is   an aggregate effect, and
is a person and time—specific effect. Then equation               (5)        implies

The     person—specific component of hours variatLon in period t consists of
person-specific taste variation, a             person—specific    intertemporal
substitution effect               and the difference between the person—specific
forecast error in log             end the average forecast error over the entire
sample.

        The person—specific component of year—to—year changes in labor supply
is large.         For example, Altonji. and Paxson (1985) estimate that the cross-
sectional standard deviation of the change in log annual hours between
                                                 21

consecutive years is 0.35 for me" age 18               to    60 in the Panel Study of Income

Dynamics     (PSID).     Using data constructed from survey information gathered
every 4    months   in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),                   I

estimate    that the standard deviation of the change in log annual hours for

men age 22—59 who worked in 1984 end 1985 is 0.54 (Card(1990)).                       some of

this variation is clearly attributable to                   measurement   error.   Evidence

reported by Duncan and Hill             (1985) suggests that the signal—to—noise ratio

in the measured change in lag annual hours in the PSID is 1.22. 25 Applying

this correction factor. the estimated standard deviation of true hours

changes for continuously employed me" in the PSID is 0.26, and eve" larger
                                   26
for me in the SIPP panel.

      Nevertheless, virtually "one of this variation is explained by the

person—specific        intertemporal    substitution        effect. Alconj i (1986, Tables
1,2) reports    measures of K2 for         labor supply equations like (9) that
instrument the         individual—specific component of wage variation and treat

the     other two components (person—specific changes in taste and person-
specific updating in the marginal utility of                    income)   as residuals. The

proportions of explained variance are essentially 0.



        25This estimate is      based on a sample of individuals working for a
single  employer over two        years. and is surely an upper bound on the
signal/noise  ratio.
        261 suspect that a retrospective survey on annual hours in the
previous year probably         understates the true variation in average hours per
week.     since many      individuals with substantial within—year variation it
hours  per week are likely to report a simple "umber like "40 hours per
week". This is especially problematic In the CPS survey, because
interviewers are instructed to gather modal (rather than average) hours per
week from such individuals. However. I have bee" unable to ascertain if
the more frequent interview schedule in the SIPP accounts for the higher
variation in annual hours changes.

      One reason   for this low    proportion of explained variance is the very

small     magnitude of the estimated intertemporal substitution elastLcittes
that typically emerge from microeconometric studies. 27             MaCurdy's (1981)

estimates    from the PSID range from 0.10 to 0.45. Altonjl's (1986)

estimates, also based on PSID data, range from 0 to 0.5, with the more

precise estimates clustered near the bottom of this interval. A similar

range of estimates emerges from other studies of the PSi!)              including   Ham

(1986), and      from the detailed study of cohort—level data from the British

Family     Expenditure Survey by Browning. Deaton, and Irish (1985). Taken
together, the literature suggests that the elasticity            of Intertemporal
substitution    is surely no higher than 0.5, and probably no higher than

0.20.     Given such small elasticities, the component of individual hours

changes attributable to intertemporal substitution effects is tiny.

        This leads to the question of whether there is              explanation for

individual—specific     hours   variation.      One source of systematic hours

variation that is described by the labor supply model, but ignored in most

studies, is idiosyncratic variation in the marginal utility of wealth.

Some of this is potentially explainable by observed wage changes,

particularly if person-specific wage innovations are highly persistent. To
collect some evidence on the persistence of idiosyncratic wage shocks. I

fit a very simple version of the components—of—variance model             (8) Co data

on log wages for men in the PSID. Specifically. the model assumes that the

measured log wage of individual J.      in period C is given by:

the  control group of the Denver Income Maintenance Experiment. MaCurdy

In this model the person-• and period—specific wage shock consists of two

components:       a first—order serially correlated component with a                           time—varying
variance             and     a serially uncorrelated component                           One

interpretation      of the latter is as a white noise survey measurement error.

However1       this is indistinguishable        a "purely transitory" wage

component.        I have fit this model (using minimum distance techniques) to
the covariance matrix of individual wage                       data for 1374 men who worked in

each year between 1969 and 1979. 28 For convenience in estimation I have

used the wage data for 1971—78 only.

       The covariances of the wage data are presented in Table 1                            together
with their estimated standard errors and the average autocovariances at

each lag. The autocorrelations decline from 0.78 (et lag 1) Co 0.59 (at

lag 7). There is some             evidence of nonstationarity in the data, with the
variances       and covariances rising in the last years of the panel. The

sample       excludes 105 individuals who               otherwise     meet the data requirements
but     who are eliminated              by    virtue of reporting     an    hourly wage less    than
$0.75 or greater than $100 (in 1967$)                    in    one or more years.        When these

wage data, f(fi) is          the vector of fitted moments, and V                  is   the estimated
variance       matrix of the second moments.

individuals       are included, the variances and covariances are 25 percent

larger    but the autocorrelations are very similar.
        This   very simple model fits the wage data surprisingly well. The

overall goodness—of—fit statistic is 35.31, which has a probability value

of 8 percent.        The parameter estimates and their implications are
                              29
sumarized in Table 2.                  One half of the cross—sectional variance in wages

is attributed to permanent person—effects. Another 15 percent is

attributable to the pure white noise component.                      This variance share is

actually much lower than the share of measurement error reported in the

PSID validation study (Bound et.al. (1989), Table 2),                     suggesting     that all of

        can easily be attributed co measurement error.                    The   remaining     component

of variance is highly persistent: the estimated AR(1) coefficient a is

0.89.


        To see the implications of this persistence. consider the effect of a

unix innovation in the person—specific wage component on the simple

discounted average of expected future wages


               (1-fl)    S fl      E

In the first case. suppose that                       is all measurement error. so that a

unit    innovation in    wages     is   purely an      innovation    in Uft.     Then,      assuming

fl—.9 (i.e., a discount race of 11.1 percent), the effect on the discounted

average of expected future wages is (1                              -
                                                                        afi) — 0.494. On the ocher
hand, suppose that there is no measurement error in wages. The" a unit

innovation in the wage shock implies a 0.69 innovation in                                and a 0.31



         29There are    a total    o1212
                                         parameters in the model, including the 8

future log wages rises by 0.34.

       The results of this exercise suggest that a typical person—specific

wage innovation results in a significant revision to lifetime wealth. Of

course, it is possible that individuals have better information with which

to forecast future wages than is available to an outside data analyst. In

this     case. wage innovations in the                 statistical model (La) do not

necessarily          represent        new     information.       Clearly, we need much further
evidence before we              can    use the lifecycle model to model the wealth effects
of person—specific wage shocks.
       One possible approach is to combine consumption and hours information
to obtain direct estimates of                          and then to consider projections of the
forecast errors in log A, on wages and other information. 31 To see how
this might work. write the log—linear version of the Intertemporal
consumption function implied by the first—order conditions (3a) and (3b)
as:
        log Cft e log        • f log
 (For simplicity I will ignore any coportents of taste variation, although
these can be handled) - This consumption function can be combined with the
labor supply function (4) to give:

(11)          log hj —              • &e/f)   log       +    6/f log cit.



         30This uses       the linear projection E(ala+b) — (a÷b).var(a)/var(a+b).
         31This approach follows up on MaCurdy' (1983) method for estimating
the  parameters of the lifecycle model.    t{aCurdy's procedure is used by
Blurtdell (1990).
                                               26


This equation is the within—period optimality condition implied by setting

the marginal rate of substitution between goods and leisure equal to the
        32
wage.        An instrumental variables procedure can be applied to (11) to

estimate the coefficients (q       be/f) and         6/f.   Similarly,   the   intertemporal
labor supply elasticity       can be estimated by conventional means, for

example by applying instrumental variables to (8). Then, using the

(approximate.) restriction that    e   —

estimates of the coefficients e and f.              (Alternatively, one    can estimate

the     coefficient e in the intertemporal consumption function directly                  see

Altonji (1986) for example).      Finally, these can be used to form an
estimate of log Aft from the observed consumption and wage data for each
person.
        Given estimates of log Aj it should be possible to estimate the

relation     between the marginal utility of income end observable information.
such as current assets and current and lagged wages.                One could then test a
specific modal for log          such as the one implied by the Lucas—Rapping
labor supply function, or the one implied by perfect foresight.                 It would

also     be useful to estimate components—of—variance models for the change in
the marginal utility of income. A recent paper by Altug and Miller (1990)
shows that the assumption of complete contingent markets imposes a simple

factor structure on A1: .\         —
                                           i A,       If this is correct, the

idiosyncratic component of the estimated change in log                    should be

orthogonal     to individual—specific information,          controlling for a

      32Notice that if one maintains the assumption e—0 (i.e. that wages
have no effect on consumption, holding cons tanC A), then one can obtain
estimates of the intertem.cn]. substitution elasticity from cross—sectional
data I This procedure is used by Altonji (1986). and seems to give
estimates of i7 about the same size as those obtained by estimating (8)

 homogeneous time effect. Altug and Miller's results suggest that this set

of restrictions may be acceptable.

         A major limitation to this line of research is the absence of panel

 data     sets with information o"       consumption    expenditures.
                                                            The leading panel
 data source, the PS ID, only contains information on food expenditures.
 Some progress may be possible using the cohort level data in the British

 Family    Expenditure Survey,    although the labor supply information contained
 in this survey is limited to weekly hours.


 d. Other Sources of Variation in Individual Labor_Ssj
        Although careful U    odelling   of   wealth   effects    may go    some way toward

 improving our understanding of the determinants of individual labor supply,
 I am not optimistic that a conventional lifecycle model can ever explain
 more    than a   tiny fraction of the year—to—year variation in the data.                       One

 may be tempted to attribute the unexplained changes to                    tastes   or

 measurement error. There is a graving body of evidence, however, which

 suggests that idiosyncratic changes in labor supply are systematically

 related to conditions on the demand side of the labor market.                       There are

 two complementary explanations for this link.                   On one hand, individuals may

 be unable to sell all their offered labor supply. On the other, some form

 of fixed costs may enter into either the supply or demand sides of the

 labor market.

        Ashenfelrer and Ham   (1979)     and Ham (1986) present models of

 thtertemporal      labor supply which assume that reported unemployment contains

          33For example, Altonji's (1986)       use of observed food consumption as a
 control for the marginal utility of income results itt only a small           increase
 in the explanatory power of his fitted labor supply equations
                                                   28

information on hours constraints faced by workers.                    Specifically,      these

authors assume that desired hours of work are described by an equation such

as    (4).   In the presence of labor market disequilibrium, actual                    hours sold

nay    be lower.     Following      Ashenfelter    (1978) suppose that a fraction B            of
reported weeks of unemployment represent weeks in which an individual was
unable to sell his or her labor.                This leads to a      specification    of the
lifecycle labor supply function that includes measured unemployment (or its
first difference) on the right—hand—side, with a coefficient of 8.
Estimates of this coefficient reported in Ashenfelter and Ham                        (1979) and

"am    (1986) are positive and          significant. Furthermore,        the inclusion of

measured     unemployment       leads   to a significant increase in the explanatory
power of the labor supply equation.
      The interpretation of such an augmented labor supply function is an
issue of considerable dispute.              Heckman and MaCurdy (1989) .        following Lucas
and Rapping (1970), argue that measured unemployment is simply another
component     of leisure.         Because of the hours       constraint, the sum of leisure

and unemployment is .necessarjly             negatively    correlated with hours of work.

According     to Heclcman and MaCurdy then. individuals with               longer hours of

unemployment    are    simply those who are consuming more leisure.

      Evidence presented by Ham (1986) sheds some interesting light on the

interpretation of reported unemployment, and also on the underlying

question of whet       causes individual hours of work          to    vary from year to year.

To see the nature of this evidence, consider the following                      (simplified)


tntarternporal       labor supply function:

(12)         Alog   hj —    q   Alog      + I        + 6
                                                  29


where Di is a vector of demand conditions in an individual's local labor

market,      industry, and/or occupation.         There is no mechanical connection

between      the measurement of hit and the measurement of D. If                the labor

supply model is correctly specified, hovever the"                P—O,   since market—level
information should be irrelevant to                      hours decisions, controlling
                                                  individual

for     individual—specific     wages.    Although he does not report direct
estimates of 1 in his 1986 paper, Ham's results using ADj as instrumental
variables     for    individual unemployment indicate that 1 is         far   different from

zero. A"       earlier unpublished version of the paper (Ham (1984)) presents
direct tests for the exclusion of industry, occupation, and local
unemployment rates from a"            individual labor supply equatipn. The tesr
statistics are highly significant, indicating a" explicit role far demand-
side variables in the determination of individual labor supply. When                    Ham

uses    the demand—side variables to instrument reported unemployment in the
labor supply equation, he continues to find               evidence of a negative and

significant effect of unemployment on hours of work. This is evidence

against a strict labor supply model, and in favor of a model in which

reported unemployment conveys information about the demand conditions

facing a" individual worker.

       One   need not appeal to Keynesian—style           labor market constraints to

rationalize         Ham's findings,    however.   An alternative explanation is that.
labor supply decisions are made at a higher frequency rime unit than the
year (for example the week), and            that there are significant fixed costs on

either       the worker's    side or    the employer's side    of the labor market. A
model along the latter lines is presented in Rosen (1986) and Card
                                                   30

(199O34 In           this model, effective labor input from a pool of N workers is

t4g(h). where g      is    an S—shaped function of hours worked per person. The

optimal     employment policy of a firm          with this    technology consists of a two-

part rule: if     product demand is           sufficiently low,   lay    off    a fraction   of the

labor     force and employ the remainder at some minimum threshold level of
hours.      If product demand is sufficiently high, employ all available
workers    at hours above the threshold.

     The implications of this firm—level behavior for individual labor

supply data are two—fold.             First. some component of annual hours variation

will occur at a fixed hourly wage rate.                 In particular.         individuals working

at   firms with      relatively low product demand will,          vary   their number of weeks

worked. but in each week of employment they will supply the same number of

hours, and (presumably) earn the same weekly wage.                      For these individuals.

hours of work will vary directly with measures of the firm's product

demand.      Second, weekly hours will be observed to              fluctuate      above a

(parson—specific)         minimum     threshold.    Evidence presented in Card (1990)

indicates    that the latter prediction is surprisingly close to the truth.
In a sample of 2800 men observed working for the same employer over a                         two

year period, reported hours per week in each of 8 interviews were observed
to fall below 35          hours   par week in only 11 percent of cases.
        A simple fixed cost model of this kind suggests that employer demand

conditions should affect weeks of employment per year.                         Predictions on the

connection    between employer demand and hours              per week depend on the          assumed


          class of models with similar properties are analyzed in a macro
context by Hansen (1985) and Rogerson (1988). In these papers, labor supply
within tha week is assumed to be either 0 or 1.

form    of   employment contract. K paper (Card (1990)) presents a                case in
which. conditional on working, hours per week lie on a conventional supply

schedule.      I" this case, controlling for the wage, employer demand should

have no effect on hours per week.            Some simple evidence on this prediction

is presented in Table 3, which         shows the results of estimating the

augmented     labor supply function (12) a" three measures of labor supply:
hours per week, weeks per quarter. and total quarterly hours.
       The data sunnarized in Table 3 pertain to me" in the 1984 SIP? paneL.
The     sample is restricted to individuals who are observed working for at
most one employer over the 9       quarters         of the available sample period.
Demand—side conditions are measured by the logarithm of employment in the
individual's     one-digit industry.        Thus,    LDft refers to      the percentage
change in employmentin an individual's industry in the most recent
quarter. The equations are estimated by instrumental variables, using as
an instrument     for wages the change in wages observed for the same person 4

quartets in      the past or 4   quarters in the future.         There is    a   small but

highly significant seasonal correlation in individual wage                  changes   that

gives this instrumental variable its power.

       The estimates   suggest that uieasures of          employment demand are

significantly    correlated with both hours per week and weeks               per quarter.

I" comparison, the estimated iritertemporal               substitution    elasticities are

small     and relatively imprecise.          One could easily conclude from this

evidence that changes in labor supply are directly connected to                   ew.ployet

                                                   32


demand conditions, and that wages play little or no role in the short—run

labor—leisure        decision.

        The   relatively weak connection between hours per week and wages
illustrated in columns 1 and 4 of Table 3 may seem puzzling, give" that the
Fair Labor Standards Act mandates overtime payments for individuals in many
occupations who work over 40 hours per week.                  Some additional evidence o"
the relation between weekly hours and wages is provided by data in the May
1985 CPS.       This survey gathered information on usual hours per week, actual
hours worked in the previous week,              and     whether or not    the individual

received      any   overtime     payments.    The responses    suggest that there is

substantial variation in actual weekly hours around "usual" weekly hours:
13    percent of me" indicate that they worked              lass than their          usual hours.

while another 19 percent indicate that they worked more.                             Individuals        itt


the letter group report 10 extra hours per week on average, bringing their

weekly total to 51 hours. However, only 47 percenc of these men report

receiving any additional overtime               compensation. For the majority, weekly
                                                                                38
hours are higher       then usuaL but weekly earnings are              fixed.
      Table   4 provides more      detailed    information on a very narrov subset                 of

individuals           those who usually work 35-40           hours   per week and who report
41 or more hours        in the survey week.             Sixty-two    percent    of all workers
normally work        35—40 hours per week. Of these, 13.5 percent worked 41                        or

who     ate   not   self—employed. Variation in weekly. hosrs among the excluded
group    is even larsen
      38Unfortunately, the survey does not ask about reduced compensation
for individuals who worked less than usual hours.
               s" effort to obtain a          reasonably    large sample, this table
includes both ma" and women.

more hours in the survey week, and are sumarized in the Table. The

fraction receiving overtime compensation among this group is 59 percent.

Interestingly, however, extra hours worked are actually slightly higher for

the group with no overtime      pay.

     These data suggest that even within the week, * simple labor supply

model is inadequate for a large fraction of the population.                    Kany

individuals appear to be       worktng   extra     hours for no extra pay. "he" this
behavior is added to the phenomenon of weekly                layoffs,    it becomes clear how
a   simple model of labor supply can        easily    fail to explain movements in
annual   hours.
     Further wotic    is   obviously needed to       isolate    the systematic components
of individual labor supply, and to describe the links between employer
demand and employee hours choices.          While such work falls outside the
"arrow realm of a conventional lifecycle            model.     it seems to me that further
understanding of individual hours outcomes will                require    a broader
perspective than the standard model can             provide.     As it stands. the
lifecycle model provides essentially no insight into the year—to—year
variation in individual hours.


IV.ConcIusions
    I"   principle, the lifecycle labor supply model offers a" explanation for
the four main aspects of individual hours choices: mea" hours over the
lifecycle; the age profile of hours; aggregate movements in hours; and
individual—specific variation in hours around the lifecycle profile. All
of these components are tied together by a combination of interteliq3otal
substitution      effects and wealth     effect.     itt this paper I have tried to
                                            34

gauge the success of lifecycle model in explaining the various dimensions

of male labor supply.     My assessment is hardly positive: the only real

success for the model has come as a description of aggregate patterns in

wages and hours during the post—1970 period.           Even here, my suspicion is

that a careful consideration of wealth effects will undermine the success

of the model.

    Much of the inicroeconometric research over the past two decades has

concentrated    on the magnitude of the intertemporal substitution effect, and
in particular on U      odelling   the intertemporal substitution effect of
individual—specific    wage   variation.   As Pencavel noted in his 1986 survey,
the available evidence suggests that this effect is of second—order
importance. My view is that a similar conclusion holds with respect to the
intertempora]. substitution effect in the age profile of hours. With
respect to the permanent component of hours, there is          much ambiguity in the

literature. A      fairly wide—spread belief among labor economists is that a
permanent increase in wages leads to       a     reduction in hours. Using modern
panel data     it is surprisingly hard to verify this hypothesis, and      in fact
the preponderance of    the evidence suggests to me a positive association

between     long—run wages and average hours.
   Two major     avenues for further work are suggested.       one involves a
detailed effort to estimate the wealth effects in intertemporal labor
supply.  Existing methods can be used to estimate the marginal utility of
wealth, and test its properties. Progress in this direction will depend on
the quality of      available data linking individual consumption and hours

choices.    A second involves a re—evaluation of        the premise that average

hourly     earnings are a "sufficient statistic" for current labor market
                                          35

opportunities.    A variety of models suggests that individual hours are

influenced     directly by   employer—specific demand conditions. Limited

empirical   evidence confirms this suspicion.    If true, our basic notions of

labor supply, and in particular our notions about the degree of
substitutability between current and future leisure. may be incomplete.

        quarters (1983—W to 1985—I) in 1983 SIPP panel. All equations
        are estimated in first—difference form, and include 9 unrestricted
        quarterly dumies as well as potential experience. Log wage is
        instrumented by the change in log wages of the same person 4
        quarters in the past (or 4 quarters in the future. for observations
         from the first 3 quarters of the sample) . The standard deviations
        of the dependent variables are: log hours per week —— 0.142; log
        weeks per quarter —— 0.147; log quarterly hours —— 0.234.
