                                         ABSTRACT

Evidence of patient and physician turnover in accountable care organizations (ACOs) has raised
concerns that ACOs may be earning shared-savings bonuses by selecting for lower-risk patients
or providers with lower-risk panels. We conducted three sets of analyses to examine risk selection
in the Medicare Shared Savings Program. First, we estimated overall MSSP savings through
2015 using a difference-in-differences approach and methods that eliminated selection bias from
ACO program exit or changes in the practices or physicians included in ACO contracts. We then
checked for residual risk selection at the patient level. Second, we re-estimated savings with
methods that address undetected risk selection but could introduce bias from other sources. These
included patient fixed effects, baseline assignment, and area-level MSSP exposure to hold patient
populations constant. Third, we tested for changes in provider composition or provider billing
that may have contributed to bonuses, even if they were eliminated as sources of bias in the
evaluation analyses. We find that MSSP participation was associated with modest and increasing
annual gross savings in the 2012-2013 entry cohorts of ACOs that reached $139-302/patient by
2015. Savings in the 2014 entry cohort were small and not statistically significant. Robustness
checks revealed no evidence of residual risk selection. Alternative methods to address risk
selection produced consistent results but were less robust than our primary analysis, suggesting
the introduction of bias from within-patient changes in time-varying characteristics. We find no
evidence of ACO manipulation of provider composition or billing to inflate savings. We further
demonstrate that exit of high-risk patients or physicians with high-risk patients from ACOs is
misleading without considering a counterfactual among non-ACO practices. We conclude that
participation in the original MSSP program was associated with modest savings and not with
favorable risk selection. These findings suggest an opportunity to build on early progress.
Understanding the effect of new incentives and opportunities for risk selection in the revamped
MSSP will be important for guiding future program reforms.

INTRODUCTION

       In the voluntary Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP), participating accountable

care organizations (ACOs) have incentives to reduce total Medicare spending for their attributed

patient populations. Specifically, an ACO is eligible for a shared-savings bonus if total per-

beneficiary Medicare spending is sufficiently below its spending target, or benchmark, and if its

performance on a set of quality measures meets minimum standards. In Track 1 of the MSSP—

the track in which almost all ACOs (99%) participated in for the first 4 years of the program1—

the shared-savings bonus was 50% of the difference between an ACO’s spending and its

benchmark, less a small percentage for submaximal quality scores. The benchmark in a given

performance year was based on an ACO’s average historical spending before MSSP entry for

analogously attributed patients, updated to the performance year based on average national

Medicare spending growth.

       Existing evidence indicates that participation in the MSSP produced modest reductions in

Medicare spending for ACO patients,2-6 even after accounting for bonus payments. However,

churn in the patients attributed to ACOs and in the providers included in ACO contracts has

raised concerns that some of the savings might be an artifact of risk selection—i.e., the result of

ACOs encouraging high-cost patients to switch to a non-ACO provider or excluding clinicians

with high-cost patients from ACO contracts. ACOs do have some incentives to engage in

favorable risk selection, but the incentives were limited by several features of the MSSP’s

original design. Moreover, risk selection can be assessed and addressed by evaluation methods.

Thus, evidence of risk selection does not imply that estimates of savings are biased; if there is

favorable risk selection, net savings can still be determined by estimating gross savings using

methods that address risk selection and subtracting the bonus payments (which include any
                                                                                                    4


unearned gains from risk selection).7 Below, we describe program features that shape incentives

for risk selection in the MSSP before turning to the empirical contributions of this paper.

Incentives for Risk Selection in the MSSP

TIN Level

       The MSSP defines ACOs as collections of taxpayer identification numbers (TINs)

identifying practices and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Certification

Numbers (CCNs) identifying certain safety-net facilities (to simplify, we refer to both TINs and

CCNs as TINs). An ACO’s yearly attributed population includes all patients who receive more

qualifying services from that ACO’s TINs than any other ACO or non-ACO TIN. The attribution

process assigns patients based on care received from primary care physicians (PCPs; defined by

four specialties: internal medicine, family medicine, general practice, or geriatric medicine) as

long as patients receive at least one qualifying service from a PCP. Since 88% of patients with a

qualifying service have at least one visit with a PCP, attribution is largely based on the PCPs

from which patients receive care. Patients without a qualifying service with a PCP are assigned

based on receipt of the same services from non-PCP clinicians. Each year, ACOs in the MSSP

can change the TINs in its contract but, unlike ACOs in the Pioneer model, cannot select among

clinicians within TINs (i.e., all clinicians billing under an included TIN are in the contract).

       Until 2017, the MSSP accounted for changes in TIN inclusion each year by adjusting

benchmarks to reflect the baseline spending of the revised set of TINs. Thus, ACOs did not have

clear incentives to favor lower-spending TINs because the reduced spending would be offset by

reduced benchmarks. Excluding higher-spending TINs might improve performance on

utilization-based quality measures such as readmission rates, thereby increasing their shared-

savings rate (the percentage of savings they could keep if they qualified for a bonus), but this
                                                                                                   5


would not artificially inflate the gross savings. Because the variance of medical spending is

greater when spending is higher, an ACO with downside risk for spending in excess of

benchmarks (i.e., in a two-sided contract) might avoid TINs with higher spending to minimize

the probability of a large loss from random fluctuations in spending. Through 2015, however,

almost all ACOs did not assume downside risk, and those that did had less risk for losses than

savings.

       Consequently, TIN-level selection incentives were minimal in the original MSSP and

may actually have favored higher-spending TINs for two reasons. First, greater variability in

spending at higher levels may present opportunities in one-sided contracts for larger bonuses

(due to random fluctuations). Second, ACOs with higher spending might generate savings more

easily, because the costs of lowering wasteful spending are likely lower when there is more

wasteful spending to cut (i.e., more fat to trim). Indeed, ACOs with higher baseline spending

have reduced spending more than other ACOs, on average.4

       In 2017, the MSSP began to blend ACO benchmarks with average regional spending

after 3 years of participation. The implementation of this regional blending will be accelerated

by the recent overhaul of the MSSP, “Pathways for Success,” which also requires ACOs to

assume more downside risk sooner after MSSP entry.8 These changes create new incentives for

ACOs in the MSSP to select TINs with spending below their regional average,9 but these

incentives were not in place during the period examined by MSSP evaluations to date.

Clinician Level

       Given a set of TINs and the attendant benchmark, an MSSP ACO has incentives to

exclude clinicians with spending in excess of that predicted by the Hierarchical Condition

Categories (HCC) model used to adjust for case mix.10 To selectively exclude such physicians
                                                                                                       6


and their patients, an ACO would have to identify them and arrange for them to bill under a

different TIN that is not included in the ACO’s contract (because patient attribution is

determined by the billing TINs, not clinicians). An ACO also could terminate clinicians’

employment or move them to a different practice, though these behaviors seem implausible and

might provoke legal action. The ability to alter the attributed patient population by changing the

TIN under which clinicians bill does create some opportunities for risk selection, and there is

some anecdotal evidence of ACOs exploiting this mechanism.11 In particular, one strategy

relates to the inclusion of encounters in post-acute or long-term nursing facilities among the

qualifying services used by CMS to assign patients to ACOs. Consider an internist or geriatrician

who sees patients in the office and rounds on patients in a skilled nursing facility (SNF), billing

both types of services under the same TIN. After entry into the MSSP, the physician’s

organization could arrange for the SNF encounters to be billed under a separate excluded TIN,

thereby causing patients who become acutely ill and receive more post-acute facility care than

outpatient primary care to be assigned away from the ACO to the excluded TIN in a performance

year but not in the baseline period used to calculate a benchmark. The resulting spending

reduction would not be corrected by a benchmark reduction since the ACO did not change its

constituent TINs.

       To the extent that clinician-level selection results in lower risk-adjusted spending by

favoring clinicians with patients who are lower risk, it should manifest as a change in case mix in

the attributed population, assuming that unobservable patient factors not included in the risk

adjustment are correlated with the observable factors that are included. It is possible that ACOs

could select clinicians based on their efficiency (care patterns), independent of patient risk. This

may not manifest as a change in case mix and therefore may not be testable. It is unlikely,
                                                                                                    7


however, that ACOs possess the data and analytic capabilities to isolate physicians’ efficiency

from the case mix of their patients.

        Selecting clinicians based on their efficiency has ambiguous normative implications.

While selecting clinicians based on their patients’ risk may be seen as wasteful gaming, selecting

clinicians based on their efficiency could foster competition among PCPs to be more efficient as

ACO programs expand and exert pressure on PCPs to participate. The associated spending

reductions might offset any bonus payments to ACOs engaging in such selection.

Patient Level

        To mitigate ACO incentives to increase savings artificially through risk selection or up-

coding, the MSSP uses an HCC-base risk adjustment model and only applies downward

adjustments to benchmarks (if risk scores decrease). Thus, ACOs have incentives to avoid

patients with spending in excess of what the HCC model predicts and to attract patients with

below-predicted spending. Unlike Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, however, ACOs have no

control over benefit or network design and therefore have fewer means to select favorable risks.

In the absence of the provider-level selection strategies described above, an ACO would

somehow have to induce high-cost patients in its attributed population to leave the ACO, for

example by dropping them from the practice, successfully referring them to a different PCP, or

otherwise limiting their access to the ACO (e.g., by capping appointments for high-risk patients).

        In addition to supply-side selection efforts by ACOs, high-risk patients may exhibit

stronger or weaker demand for care in ACOs. Many ACOs target high-risk patients for enhanced

care management, and prior research has found that ACO efforts have been associated with

improved overall care ratings among high-risk patients.12 Thus, the tailored care ACOs offer may

attract, rather than repel, high-risk patients.
                                                                                                    8


       Attracting low-risk patients may be more feasible than denying care to high-risk patients.

For example, ACOs could reach out to healthy patients without qualifying services and schedule

visits for them (e.g., annual wellness visits), thereby increasing the number of attributed patients

with below-predicted spending. The proportion of Medicare beneficiaries without a qualifying

service is low (8.5%), however, and they include a subgroup of very high-risk patients (e.g.,

those enrolled in hospice). Imperfect targeting of such efforts would also contribute to higher

spending from the additional office visits for patients whose attribution is not altered.

Empirical Contributions of this Paper

       In this paper, we use evaluation methods to estimate savings in the MSSP that address

selection bias, gauge the potential for residual selection, and test for risk selection that may have

contributed to shared-savings bonuses but not to bias in our evaluation. First, we report new

estimates of overall savings through 2015 from a difference-in-differences analysis that

addresses bias from provider-level selection using an intention-to-treat approach.5 Specifically,

we hold ACOs’ providers constant over time. These estimates reflect the combined results of

earlier work that compared savings between physician-group and hospital-based ACOs. As in

those stratified analyses,5 we find no evidence of patient risk selection and estimate overall gross

savings in excess of bonus payments.

       Second, we implement alternative approaches to eliminate residual risk selection that

may have gone undetected by tests of observable patient characteristics in our evaluation

(summarized in Table 1). These include use of patient fixed effects in difference-in-differences

models, an intention-to-treat analysis holding patients’ baseline assignments to providers (prior

to the start of MSSP incentives) constant, and an area-level analysis defining MSSP exposure

based on program penetration in patients’ hospital referral region (HRR). We provide empirical
                                                                                                    9


evidence that these approaches—while ensuring no bias from selection of patients with fixed

characteristics predictive of lower spending—introduce other sources of bias. Nevertheless, these

approaches produce results that are generally consistent with our main findings. We also

consider an alternative patient attribution approach (using data on referring PCPs) to address

potential selection bias from ACO efforts to use annual wellness visits to boost attribution of

healthy patients who might otherwise be unattributed. This approach increases savings estimates.

       Third, we test for risk selection that may have been successfully eliminated in our

evaluation but would have contributed to bonus payments (Table 2). We do so by allowing the

provider composition of ACOs to change over time, as it did, and repeating our evaluation

analysis. We also analyze patterns of patient and physician exit from ACOs over 3 performance

years. We find that ACOs did not systematically favor providers with lower-risk patients or

lower spending as they changed their provider composition. We also demonstrate that analyses

of patient or physician exit can be misleading without considering the counterfactual—churn in

the absence of MSSP incentives. Finally, we test for ACO manipulation of the TINs used by

physicians for billing to achieve a lower-cost attributed population during the performance

period. We find no evidence of this behavior.

DATA AND METHODS

Evaluation of the MSSP through 2015

       Using Medicare claims for 20% random annual samples of fee-for-service Medicare

beneficiaries from 2009-2015, we conducted a difference-in-differences analysis comparing

beneficiaries attributed to providers that entered the MSSP in 2012, 2013, or 2014 with local

beneficiaries attributed to non-participating providers (control group), before and after program

entry by participating providers. In each year, we attributed beneficiaries to the ACO or non-
                                                                                                   10


ACO TIN that accounted for the plurality of allowed charges for their office visits with PCPs

(Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] codes 99201-15, 99241-45, G0402, and G0438-39 in

Carrier claims and corresponding codes in Outpatient claims for specific safety net settings).13 In

the pre-entry period, attribution to an ACO meant attribution to a group of providers who would

subsequently enter the MSSP. We limited the qualifying services used for assignment to office

visits with PCPs to achieve comparability between the ACO and control group. Use of all

qualifying services in the CMS assignment rules, which include evaluation and management

services from outpatient specialists and physicians in nursing facilities, introduces systematic

differences between ACO-attributed patients and the control group.5 This occurs because many

ACOs do not provide specialty care or post-acute or long-term care in nursing facilities.4,14,15

Consequently, beneficiaries using nursing facility care or only specialty care would be

disproportionately assigned to the control group. When comparison groups in a difference-in-

differences analysis systematically differ, a stronger common shocks assumption is required; in

this context, drivers of spending growth other than the MSSP would more likely affect the

attributed populations of ACOs and non-ACO providers differently if the populations differ.

       Our modifications to beneficiary assignment also minimized bias from gaming strategies

that involve changes in the TINs used for billing (described above). For example, a patient that

requires more post-acute care than primary care would be assigned by the CMS algorithm to the

TIN billing for the post-acute care but would remain assigned to the ACO or non-ACO TIN

providing the primary care in our analysis.

       As expected from the dominant role of primary care in the CMS attribution algorithm,

our assignments and CMS assignments overlapped substantially. For example, 89% of

beneficiaries we attributed in 2013 to ACOs entering the MSSP in 2012-2013 were found in the
                                                                                                     11


2013 MSSP Beneficiary-level attribution file;16 of those, the assigned ACO matched in over 99%

of cases. Of beneficiaries in the 2013 MSSP Beneficiary-level attribution file, we attributed 84%

to ACOs; of those, the assigned ACO matched in 96% of cases.

       After assigning beneficiaries to providers, we fit the following linear regression model:

       Yitkh = β0 + β1ACOitk + β2HRR_Yearith + β3ACOcohort_Postitk + β4Covariatesit +ɛitkh

       where Y is the annual Medicare spending for beneficiary i in year t attributed to ACO k or

a non-ACO TIN and residing in HRR h; ACO is a vector of indicators for each ACO with the

non-ACO control group as the omitted reference group; HRR_Year is a vector of indicators for

each HRR-year combination; ACOcohort_Post is a vector of indicators of attribution to a

specific entry cohort of ACOs (2012, 2013, or 2014 cohort) in a specific post-entry year;

Covariates is a vector of the patient characteristics listed in Table 4; and β1-β4 are vectors of

coefficients corresponding to each term. The ACO fixed effects adjust for pre-entry differences

between ACOs and the control group and for any changes in the distribution of ACO-attributed

beneficiaries across ACOs. The HRR-year fixed effects adjust for geographic differences

between ACOs and the control group and for regional changes in spending for the control group.

Thus, the estimated effect of MSSP participation (β3) is the difference between spending for

ACO-attributed patients in a post-entry year and spending that would be expected for ACO

patients if the change from the pre-entry period to that year was equal to the change observed for

patients in the same HRR served by non-ACO providers (the differential change in spending for

ACO patients, or gross savings). We used a robust variance estimator, specifying clusters as

ACOs (for ACO-attributed beneficiaries) or HRRs (for the control group). Specifying HRRs as

the clusters for all beneficiaries yielded similar results. Additional details of the methods have

been published elsewhere,5 including exclusion of patients attributed to Pioneer ACOs.
                                                                                                 12


       To eliminate bias from selective dropout of ACOs by 2015, our analysis followed an

intention-to-treat approach in which we retained all ACOs through 2015 regardless of

participation status. To eliminate bias arising from compositional changes in the TINs or

physicians composing ACOs, we held constant from 2009-2015 the definition of ACOs as

collections of TINs or physician National Provider Identifiers (NPIs), in the latter case modifying

attribution to assign patients to a group of ACO NPIs or a non-ACO NPI. We conducted

additional analyses to assess potential violations of the identifying assumption of our difference-

in-differences analysis (that the ACO-control group difference would have remained constant in

the absence of MSSP participation). We estimated differential changes in patient characteristics

and compared savings estimates with and without adjustment for fixed and time-varying patient

covariates. For time-varying covariates potentially affected by the MSSP (e.g., HCC scores via

upcoding), we checked the sensitivity of results to adjusting for values derived from data several

years prior to a given study year, as opposed to the year prior. In addition to regression

adjustments, we also implemented a propensity score weighting technique to balance covariates

between ACOs and the control group in each year.5,17

       We estimated differences in pre-entry trends between ACOs and the control group and

conducted falsification tests treating pre-entry years as hypothetical entry years. We also

conducted falsification tests treating both non-ACO TINs that were large enough after the start of

the MSSP to participate (an expected 5000+ assigned beneficiaries in the full Medicare

population) and the 2015 MSSP entrants (which we did not analyze in the main analyses) as

hypothetical entrants in various years. In addition to testing whether large provider organizations

or groups that eventually joined the MSSP had slower spending growth when not participating,

these falsification tests also explored whether our intention-to-treat approach, which categorized
                                                                                                    13


TINs by their ACO status at the outset of MSSP entry and held the treatment group of TINs

constant, could produce differential reductions in spending in the absence of the MSSP.

Approaches to Assess and Address Residual Risk Selection

1. Patient Fixed Effects

Conceptual considerations

       One approach to ensure that differential changes in population composition do not

contribute to savings estimated by difference-in-differences analysis is to use patient fixed

effects in the model to control for all characteristics of patients that are fixed. Replacing ACO

fixed effects with patient fixed effects in the model above produces a difference-in-difference

estimate based on within-patient changes. Specifically, for a given performance year, the

estimate becomes the mean within-patient difference between spending for a patient attributed to

an ACO in the performance year and spending in years when the patient is not attributed to an

ACO in a performance year, minus the concurrent within-patient spending difference for patients

not attributed to an ACO in the performance year.

       There are two major drawbacks to this approach. First, basing the estimation on within-

patient changes converts the analysis from one of annual cross-sectional samples, each

representative of the fee-for-service Medicare population, to a longitudinal cohort of patients

who were alive, enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare, and eligible for attribution in both the pre-

and post-entry periods. As illustrated in Figure 1, the spending trends over the study period for

these two samples differ dramatically. Adjusted annual Medicare spending of the serial cross-

sectional samples analyzed in our main evaluation approach increased by $374/patient (4.2%)

from 2009-2015, demonstrating that, despite substantial turnover in the sample over time,

spending growth reflected modest secular trends. In contrast, adjusted spending increased by
                                                                                                   14


$1740/patient (26.4%) for a longitudinal cohort of continuously enrolled and attributable patients

that would serve as the basis for estimation of savings in a model with patient fixed effects. The

spending increase is most rapid at the end of the study period. This reflects the fact that patients

must remain alive from the pre-period to 2015 to contribute to estimation of 2015 savings in a

model with patient fixed effects, but they may then die or enter a long-term care facility, for

example, and no longer be alive or attributable on the basis of outpatient primary care in 2016.

Thus, the cohort becomes more acutely ill (in ways not accounted for by the adjustments) as they

near the end of the cohort inclusion period, unlike patients in consistently defined annual cross-

sectional samples. Figure 1 demonstrates how the rapid increase in spending occurs near the end

of the inclusion period, no matter when that inclusion period ends.

       Thus, an analysis with patient fixed effects requires the strong assumption that within-

patient spending changes would be the same for ACO and non-ACO patients in the absence of

the MSSP. This implies both similar health declines and similar treatment of patients with

declining health by ACO and non-ACO providers, yet the rapid acceleration in spending for the

longitudinal cohorts in Figure 1 is likely to vary across different patient populations and

providers. In contrast, an analysis of serial cross-sectional samples allows patients to die or

experience health declines consistently across time. The analysis can therefore net out

differences in health care needs or treatment patterns between severely ill ACO and non-ACO

patients (because severely ill patients are consistently present in the pre- and post-period).

       Second, because patient attribution to ACOs is time-varying, the difference-in-difference

estimator in a model with patient fixed effects reflects not only pre- to post-period changes in

spending associated with a patient’s provider entering the MSSP but also changes in spending

associated with changes in patient attribution from a non-ACO to ACO provider, or vice-versa,
                                                                                                    15


during the post-period. If patients are assigned to ACOs vs. non-ACO providers based on their

time-varying health care needs, the estimates from a model with patient fixed effects would be

biased because differences in spending caused by endogenous assignment to ACO or non-ACO

providers would not be differenced out, as they would be in a model without patient fixed

effects. This second source of bias may interact with the first (e.g., if sorting based on time-

varying needs is prominent among patients experiencing severe health declines).

       To ameliorate the bias due to shifts in attribution between ACO and non-ACO providers

in the post-period, ACO attribution in the post-period could be treated as an absorbing state

(turned on indefinitely after the first post-period year of ACO attribution). However, this would

not remove bias from endogenous sorting into ACOs in an initial post-period year and would

tend to bias estimates away from savings because attribution of high-risk patients is less stable

(as described below); thus, treating ACO attribution as an absorbing state would selectively

retain high-risk patients in the ACO group selectively in the post-period.

       Recognizing these conceptual concerns, results from a model with patient fixed effects

must be interpreted with caution. Although patient fixed effects eliminate bias from differential

compositional changes in the fixed characteristics of patients exposed to the MSSP, their

deployment can exacerbate bias from differential changes in time-varying characteristics within

patients, effectively reversing the bias corrections achieved by a difference-in-difference

comparison of serial cross-sectional samples that are stably different (at the population level) in

their fixed and time-varying characteristics.

Empirical Analysis

       To understand the impact of using patient fixed effects, first we limited our study sample

to a longitudinal cohort of continuously attributable patients that supports estimation of a
                                                                                                   16


difference-in-difference from within-patient changes and re-estimated our main difference-in-

difference model. The resulting estimate might differ from our main estimates for several

reasons, including the concerns described above and the much lower mean spending for this

cohort (Figure 1). Second, we substituted patient fixed effects for the ACO fixed effects in the

model to isolate the incremental effect of holding the patient constant. Third, to gauge selection

bias introduced by this approach, we compared estimates with and without adjustment for

patients’ time-varying characteristics.

       We did not estimate a model with PCP fixed effects because we hold the PCPs in each

ACO constant in our main approach to eliminate bias from changes in ACO PCP composition.

Using physician fixed effects instead could introduce bias if ACOs shift high-risk patients to

more cost-effective clinicians, for example, and we do not wish to remove the effects of such

strategic shifting from our evaluation of savings.

2. Holding Baseline Assignments Fixed

Conceptual Considerations

       Another approach to eliminating bias from risk selection is to hold patients’ attribution to

providers at baseline constant. This type of intention-to-treat approach was implemented by the

Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, for example.18 In addition to removing the

contribution of differential changes in patient attribution from the difference-in-differences

estimate (by disallowing changes in attribution), this approach also does not require utilization of

qualifying services to categorize patients into ACO and non-ACO groups after the initial year.

This latter advantage may address bias from differential changes in the attributed patient

population caused by provision of qualifying services (such as annual wellness visits). More

generally, ACO effects on primary care use and patient attribution are endogenous, though in
                                                                                                     17


prior work, we found no evidence of differential changes in ACO provision of PCP office visits

that would substantiate this concern.5

       Like the use of patient fixed effects, however, use of baseline patient assignments can

introduce other sources of bias. If ACO and non-ACO providers differ in their reimbursement

rates or practice patterns in the absence of MSSP exposure, or if patient attribution to ACO vs.

non-ACO providers (in the absence of MSSP exposure) is influenced by their time-varying

health needs, we should expect spending differences between groups of patients defined by their

baseline assignments to change over time, even if the MSSP has no effect on spending. In the

framework of an instrumental variable analysis, the exclusion restriction is unlikely to hold when

using baseline assignment as an instrument for MSSP exposure in the post period. That is,

baseline assignment to ACO vs non-ACO providers likely predicts changes in spending that are

not solely reflective of greater exposure to the MSSP.

       The bias arises because a constraint is applied asymmetrically in time. It is therefore

similar to the problem noted above of requiring a cohort to be alive and continuously enrolled for

some period and also to the problem of regression to the mean when matching on time-varying

variables.19,20 For example, outpatient Medicare spending for patients of independent physician

groups is likely to be lower than for other patients, on average, because they are likely to receive

less outpatient care at more generously reimbursed hospital-owned facilities. Consequently,

spending for patients initially attributed to independent primary care groups is likely to increase

over time relative to a local control group served by a mix of PCPs in independent and hospital-

based practices. As patients switch practices, the proportion of patients attributed to hospital-

based practices can only increase among those initially attributed to independent groups, whereas

switching would be bidirectional in the control group, leading to a smaller net shift to hospital-
                                                                                                    18


based practices. Thus, an evaluation holding baseline assignments constant would tend to

underestimate savings by independent physician group ACOs, all else equal. More generally, use

of baseline assignments could bias overall MSSP savings estimates if the mix of independent and

hospital-based practices participating in the MSSP differs from the surrounding delivery system.

       Similarly, practice patterns might differ systematically between ACOs and non-ACO

providers. The substantial patient churn in provider patient populations21-23 could therefore

introduce bias in an evaluation using time-invariant baseline assignments to define comparison

groups that would not be present in an evaluation using time-varying assignments.

       In addition, changes in health care needs may cause changes in attribution of patients to

ACO or non-ACO providers, whether because of true change in providers or the attribution

algorithm. If patients are disproportionately assigned to ACOs when they become ill and to non-

ACO providers when they are healthy, or vice-versa, one would expect differences in spending

between patients initially assigned to ACOs and non-ACO providers to converge as their health

status reverts to the population mean. Use of the CMS attribution algorithm could exacerbate this

source of bias. Its inclusion of services in post-acute facilities would cause acutely ill patients to

be disproportionately assigned away from ACOs at baseline,24 inducing a subsequent differential

increase in spending for patients assigned to ACOs at baseline as the control group’s acute care

needs subside and the ACO group’s needs emerge.

       We do not attempt to assess or address these sources of potential bias introduced by using

baseline assignments. Rather, we note that the bias is difficult to predict and could be substantial,

interpret savings estimates produced by this approach with caution, and conduct falsification

tests to determine whether this approach might estimate an erroneous differential change in

spending in the absence of MSSP participation.
                                                                                                     19


Empirical Analysis

        First, we assigned patients to ACOs or non-ACO TINs in 2009 based on office visits with

PCPs. We then fit the model above, limiting the sample to beneficiaries with a 2009 assignment,

replacing the time-varying indicators for the ACO or cohort to which a patient is assigned with

time-invariant 2009 assignments. We dropped the 2009 data from our analysis to minimize bias

from regression to the mean that would arise because we require a qualifying service in 2009 but

not after that.

        Assuming absence of the biases described above, the differential change in spending for

patients assigned to ACOs at baseline estimated by this reduced form model is interpretable as

attributable to the MSSP. Because only 66.6% of patients assigned to an ACO in 2009 were

assigned to an ACO in 2015 (among those eligible for assignment in both years), we inflate the

differential change estimate to recover the MSSP effect as if all patients assigned at baseline to

ACOs and none assigned to non-ACO providers were exposed to the MSSP in the performance

years. To do so, we estimated the difference in the probability of being assigned to an ACO in a

performance year between patients assigned to ACOs and non-ACO providers at baseline,

among those with an assignment in 2009 and the performance year. We use the inverse of this

difference, which averaged roughly 2 for performance year 2015, as the inflation factor. We use

this approximation in lieu of a formal two-state estimation procedure to avoid limiting the

analysis to a cohort of continuously attributable patients, which would negate one of the

advantages of holding the baseline assignment constant and require a stronger common shocks

assumption (as described above). In falsification tests, we applied the same estimation procedure

in hypothetical entry years to large non-ACO TINs and ACOs that entered the MSSP in 2015.

3. Area-level Analysis
                                                                                                   20


Conceptual Considerations

       Another approach to eliminate bias from strategic selection of lower-risk patients by

ACOs is to compare spending changes between areas with higher vs lower exposure to the

MSSP. Basing exposure on an area-level measure of MSSP penetration (an ecologic instrument)

rather than patient-level attribution to an ACO ensures that systematic re-sorting of lower-risk

patients to ACOs after program entry would not contribute to savings estimates, assuming that

the mechanisms for risk selection do not change patients’ location of residence. This approach

also captures spillover effects of ACO efforts to lower spending on patients served by, but not

attributed to, ACOs, as well as any spillover effects on practice patterns of other providers.

       This strategy, too, is not without its disadvantages. First, the counterfactual (spending in

the absence of MSSP participation) is no longer based on local trends in spending for an

unexposed group but rather based on average national spending growth in HRRs with no (or

less) MSSP participation. Greater MSSP participation in low-growth regions (selection relative

to benchmarks based on national spending growth) would therefore contribute to savings in an

area-level analysis but not in our main analysis. As described below, we take an intention-to-treat

approach to remove bias from selective ACO continuation or expansion in areas determined by

ACOs to be low-growth ex post (e.g., based on their bonuses), but this does not remove bias

from selective entry based on ex ante knowledge of spending growth. Because spending growth

is challenging to predict—e.g., regional growth in one period does not predict growth in the

next25,26—we would not expect bias from selective entry but cannot exclude this possibility.

       Second, because few HRRs had no MSSP penetration, and no HRRs had 100%

penetration, an area-level analysis requires strong parametric assumptions about the relationship

between MSSP penetration and spending growth and extrapolation to estimate an effect of 100%
                                                                                                    21


vs. 0% participation that is analogous to effects estimated by our main evaluation approach.

Third, like any area-level analysis, inferences about lower-level units are subject to ecological

fallacy. For example, ACOs that most effectively reduce spending could be in low-penetration

areas. Fourth, differences in fixed or time-varying characteristics of the Medicare fee-for-service

population between areas may be less stable than differences between providers within areas, on

average. For example, growing MSSP penetration may be correlated with faster or slower

growth in regional Medicare Advantage enrollment, potentially causing differential changes in

the study population that would be minimized in a within-area analysis. Finally, and perhaps

most importantly, an area-level analysis does not hold constant market-level changes in

unobserved determinants of spending growth, and spending growth is known to vary widely

across regions.

Empirical Analysis

       For each performance year, we calculated MSSP penetration in each HRR as the

proportion of attribution-eligible beneficiaries attributed to an ACO in a given program year,

using our main method of attribution and an intention-to-treat approach that holds constant ACO

definitions as the sets of TINs included at the outset of program participation and retains exiting

ACOs as continuing in the program. MSSP penetration in 2014, for example, is the proportion of

beneficiaries in an HRR attributed in 2014 to an ACO in the 2012, 2013, or 2014 entry cohorts.

We then fit the following model for Medicare spending (Y) for beneficiary i in year t and HRR h:

   Yith = β0 + β1HRRith + β2Yearit + β3ACOPenetrationith×ProgramYrit + β4Covariatesit + ɛith

where HRR and Year are vectors of HRR and year fixed effects, respectively, and

ACOPenetration×ProgramYr is an interaction between ACO penetration and indicators of each

program year from 2012-2015, allowing the effect of ACO penetration to differ in each program
                                                                                                    22


year as more ACOs enter and continuing ACOs gain experience (the interaction creates four

variables equal to the MSSP penetration in HRR h in program year t when Year is program year

t, and zero otherwise). To gauge whether this area-level approach was more or less immune to

bias from changes in population characteristics than our main within-area approach, we

compared the differential changes in patient characteristics estimated in our main approach with

analogous differential changes associated with 100% increases in area-level MSSP participation.

4. Attribution Based on Referring PCPs

Conceptual Considerations

       While attributing patients based on PCP office visits only minimizes some forms of bias,

it leaves an average of 23% of beneficiaries unassigned in each year. To reduce this and to

address potential selection bias from ACO efforts to boost attribution of low-cost patients

without altering patients’ actual PCP, we modified the attribution procedure to use information

about the referring PCP for other services. Thus, in a year in which a patient sees a specialist or

has an imaging procedure or laboratory test but does not have an office visit with a PCP, we can

attribute the patient to the PCP listed as the referring physician for those other services. This

approach should reduce bias from a differential increase in the assigned share of low-risk ACO

patients after MSSP entry, whether because of strategic annual wellness visits or other ACO

efforts to enhance primary care access (though we did not find evidence of this in prior work).5

Empirical Analysis

       Specifically, we used Medicare Carrier claims to determine the most common NPI with a

PCP specialty appearing in the referring NPI field of a beneficiary’s claims. For a given year, we

then attributed the beneficiary to an ACO if that NPI was listed in the ACO’s participant list in

the first year of MSSP participation. We implemented these alternate assignments if the patient
                                                                                                    23


had no office visits with a PCP and re-estimated savings using our main evaluation approach.

Doing so increased the proportion of beneficiaries with an assignment in a given year from 77%

to 87%, on average. Among beneficiaries for whom assignments could be made using either

approach, 88.8% were assigned to the same ACO or to the control group in both cases, indicating

that the most common referring PCP is usually the PCP providing the most office visits.

Assessing Risk Selection Potentially Contributing to Bonuses but Removed in Evaluation

1. Reconfiguration of ACOs to Favor Lower-cost Primary Care Providers

       To assess the extent to which ACOs reconfigured their provider composition over

performance years to favor primary care practices or PCPs with lower per-patient spending, we

modified our difference-in-difference analysis to allow the sets of TINs or PCPs (NPIs)

constituting each ACO to change over the performance years per the annual MSSP Provider-

level ACO participation files.27 The changes in ACO PCPs reflected both changes in TINs and

changes in the PCPs billing under the included TINs. Because the CMS participation files are

available only for ACOs participating in the MSSP, we limited this analysis to ACOs

participating through 2015 to eliminate effects of ACO dropout.

       We then compared savings estimates when holding the set of TINs or NPIs constant, as in

our main approach, with estimates when allowing them to change. Greater savings produced by

the compositional changes would be a necessary but not sufficient condition for concluding that

ACOs favored providers with lower spending as they evolved. Such a finding would not be

sufficient because it might be expected from attenuation bias in our intention-to-treat analysis,

which treated TINs or PCPs no longer exposed to ACO incentives as still part of an ACO. In

addition, ACOs may have successfully identified providers who were more responsive to MSSP

incentives, as opposed to providers with lower baseline spending.
                                                                                                   24


       Moreover, greater spending reductions produced by changes in ACO TIN inclusion

would be negated by benchmark adjustments in the MSSP’s calculation of shared savings, as

noted above. Thus, compositional changes favoring lower-cost providers would only contribute

to bonus payments if the changes in PCP composition of ACOs produced greater spending

reductions than the changes in TIN composition of ACOs.

2. Gaming of CMS Attribution Algorithm via Manipulation of TINs Used for Billing

       As noted above, our modifications to the attribution rules would act to minimize bias

from ACO manipulation of the TINs used for billing to shift the attributed population toward

lower-cost patients. To assess the potential for this selection strategy, among others, we assessed

the effect of patient covariate adjustment on savings estimates when employing the original CMS

attribution algorithm, which included additional qualifying services (CPT codes 99304-99310,

99315-99316, 99318, 99324-99328, 99334-99337, 99339-99340, 99341-99345, 99347-99350)

and an additional step to attribute beneficiaries with no services from PCPs on the basis of

services from non-PCPs (specialists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants).13 Specifically,

we implemented the CMS algorithm to attribute beneficiaries to providers and repeated our

evaluation analyses, holding constant the sets of TINs composing ACOs over the study period.

We compared gross savings estimates with vs. without adjustment for observable patient

characteristics. Substantial attenuation of savings estimates by patient covariate adjustment in

analyses using the CMS attribution algorithm but not in our main approach (using only office

visits with PCPs for attribution) would suggest risk selection that was removed in our evaluation

but may have contributed to bonus payments. This assumes that risk selection is based on

observables or that unobservable factors used to select are correlated with the observables.

       Employing the CMS attribution algorithm, we also compared savings estimates from
                                                                                                        25


evaluation analyses holding constant the composition of ACOs as fixed sets of TINs vs. fixed

sets of clinician NPIs (the NPIs billing primarily under TINs included in ACOs in their first year

of participation). If ACOs strategically changed the TINs used for billing by member clinicians

to cause selective attribution of lower-cost patients (e.g., by shifting billing for nursing facility

services to excluded TINs), then savings estimates should be attenuated by holding ACOs

constant as sets of NPIs. For example, if ACOs shifted billing for nursing facility services, but

not office visits by the same clinician, to an excluded TIN, or if ACOs shifted billing by

clinicians with high-cost patients to a excluded TIN, the billing changes would increase savings

when ACOs are defined as sets of TINs but not when they are defined as sets of NPIs. In the

latter case, patients would remain assigned to an ACO even if their assigned clinician changed

the TIN used to bill for all or some of their services.

3. Patient and Physician Exit from ACOs

        We also examined whether higher-risk patients or PCPs with higher-risk patients were

more likely to exit from ACOs. We categorized beneficiaries attributed to ACOs in 2013 or 2014

(year t) into deciles based on their concurrent HCC score (i.e., using diagnoses year t). We then

compared the proportion who were no longer attributed to the same ACO in the subsequent year

(t+1) across deciles. We used the MSSP Beneficiary-level attribution files to determine actual

beneficiary assignments in years t and t+1 and limited the sample to beneficiaries who were

attributed to ACOs that remained in the MSSP in 2015, so that patient exit could be interpreted

as the patient, the patient’s physician, or the physician’s practice leaving an ACO, rather than an

ACO leaving the MSSP. We additionally limited the sample to beneficiaries continuously

eligible for attribution from 2013-2015 so that exit did not reflect lack of a qualifying service.

        In an alternate analysis, we used our attribution approach (based on office visits with
                                                                                                     26


PCPs) and held ACO composition of TINs constant (using ACO composition upon MSSP entry)

so that patient exit could be interpreted as the patient or the patient’s PCP leaving a set of ACO

TINs (the more relevant quantity since ACO benchmarks adjust for TIN inclusion). In each

version, we calculated the difference in HCC scores between leavers and stayers and fit a model

of HCC scores as a function of ACO fixed effects and an indicator of leaving to estimate the

mean within-ACO difference in HCC scores between leavers and stayers, thereby controlling for

any relationship between organizational case mix and patient churn.

       Prior research demonstrates that attribution in the MSSP is less stable over time for

higher-risk patients because attribution is based on utilization.18,23,24 Higher-risk patients use

more qualifying services provided by more TINs (Appendix Table 1) and have a higher risk of

health declines that may prompt a change in provider. Hence, they should be more likely to have

changes in attribution due to changes in health care needs that cause them to favor different

established providers in different years or switch to new providers. Differential exit from ACOs

of high-risk patients is therefore not necessarily the consequence of risk selection. Moreover, it

may not lead to a differential change in the average risk of ACO-attributed patients relative to

non-ACO patients, because the risk of continuously assigned patients changes over time and new

patients enter the ACO-assigned population.

       To characterize the relationship between assignment churn and patient risk in the absence

of MSSP incentives, we conducted a falsification test in which we applied the above analyses of

patient exit to large non-participating TINs (those meeting the MSSP eligibility criterion of

5000+ beneficiaries). For consistency with the analysis of exit determined from the MSSP

Beneficiary-level attribution file, we used the CMS attribution algorithm. This comparison

remained inconsistent, however, because changes in TIN inclusion contributed to patient exit
                                                                                                 27


from ACOs and we could not simulate such compositional changes among non-ACO providers.

To achieve a more consistent comparison, we employed our attribution approach in an alternate

version that held ACO or non-ACO composition constant over time.

       We conducted an analogous analysis at the PCP level to characterize the relationship

between the average health risk of a PCP’s patients and the probability of PCP exit from the

ACO. Specifically, we modified our attribution method to attribute beneficiaries to a PCP NPI,

rather than to an ACO or non-ACO TIN, based on qualifying office visits. We focused on PCPs

actively billing for visits from 2012-2015 so that exit from an ACO or non-ACO TIN by 2015

would reflect a switch to a different practice or different TIN for billing purposes, as opposed to

exit from the workforce. We also limited the analysis to PCPs with at least 20 attributed patients

per year (accounting for 85.7% of patient-years) to reduce sampling error in estimation of PCPs’

average patient risk and to avoid giving undue weight to exiting PCPs with very few patients.

       Using 2012-2013 data, we estimated the average HCC risk score of each PCP’s attributed

patients by fitting a linear regression model of patients’ HCC scores as a function of PCP fixed

effects and an indicator for year. We categorized PCPs into deciles based on their patients’ mean

HCC score. We determined the primary TIN under which PCPs billed in 2013 from the Medicare

Data on Provider Practice and Specialty file.28 Among PCPs billing under TINs included by the

2012 or 2013 entry cohorts of ACOs upon program entry (per the MSSP Provider-level RIF), we

then determined the proportion of PCPs in each decile who were no longer billing under any of

those TINs in 2015. Similarly, among PCPs billing under large non-ACO TINs in 2012 or 2013,

we determined the proportion in each decile no longer billing under any of those TINs by 2015.

       Because ACOs and large non-ACO TINs differ, our falsification analyses could not

reliably establish a counterfactual (the extent to which higher-risk patients, or PCPs with higher-
                                                                                                    28


risk patients, would exit ACOs in the absence of MSSP incentives). Nevertheless, a relationship

between patient risk and patient or PCP exit that is similar for ACOs and non-ACO TINs would

reject an interpretation of a strong relationship for ACOs as prima facie evidence of strategic risk

selection—including manipulation of TINs used for billing—in response to MSSP incentives.

RESULTS

Main Evaluation of the MSSP through 2015

       Table 3 summarizes the overall results of our main evaluation approach. In the pre-entry

period, ACO spending levels and trends did not differ from those for local controls. Estimates of

annual gross savings grew over performance years to $302/patient by 2015 in the 2012 entry

cohort and $139/patient in the 2013 cohort. Overall gross savings did not grow in the 2014

cohort over two performance years and were not significant in 2015. Aggregating these gross

savings across all ACO-attributed patients from 2013-2015, multiplying by 5 to correct for the

20% sampling, and subtracting bonus payments yielded a total program-wide estimate of net

savings to Medicare from 2013-2015 of $358 million.5

       Differential changes from the pre-entry period to 2015 in ACO-attributed patients’

sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, relative to local control patients attributed to non-

ACO providers, were consistently minimal (Table 4). These findings included minimal

differential changes in patients’ history of hip fracture or acute myocardial infarction, conditions

that have been used as exogenous markers of health risk (though could be affected by efforts to

improve quality).29 Not only were all differential changes in observable patient characteristics

small, there is no suggestion in the Table 4 estimates of consistently greater imbalance in entry

cohorts with greater savings or of growing imbalance within cohorts as savings grew.

       Estimates were nearly identical for the 2012 and 2013 cohorts with and without
                                                                                                  29


adjustment for patient covariates and with and without propensity-score weighting (Figure 2).

Holding ACO definitions constant as sets of PCPs instead of TINs increased gross savings

slightly in the 2012 cohort and appreciably in the 2013 cohort. Thus, we can reject changes in the

PCPs billing under ACO TINs as contributing to the main estimates of savings. Falsification

tests of pre-entry years for ACOs and hypothetical entry years for 439 large non-ACO TINs

revealed no evidence of differential reductions in spending in the absence of MSSP participation

(Appendix Figure 1 and Appendix Table 2).

Approaches to Assess and Address Residual Risk Selection

Patient Fixed Effects

       After limiting the study population to a longitudinal cohort of continuously enrolled

beneficiaries who were attributable to an ACO or non-ACO provider in at least one pre-MSSP

year and in 2015, gross savings estimates were attenuated and less precise (Table 5), as expected

from the substantially lower spending for this cohort (Figure 1) and its smaller size (35% of

beneficiaries and 55% of beneficiary-year observations in the full study population). Within this

cohort, replacing ACO fixed effects with patient fixed effects increased savings by $1/patient in

the 2012 entry cohort, decreased savings by $33/patient in the 2013 cohort, and increased

savings by $52/patient in the 2014 cohort (Table 5), providing no consistent evidence that

turnover in ACO-attributed populations differentially favored patients with fixed characteristics

predictive of lower spending. In models with patient fixed effects, estimates of gross savings

adjusted for time-varying patient factors were consistently greater (larger savings) than

unadjusted estimates (Table 5), suggesting that restricting to a cohort of continuously attributable

patients and implementing patient fixed effects introduced differential changes in time-varying

characteristics that biased savings toward zero and were not present in our main analysis.
                                                                                                  30


Holding Baseline Assignments Fixed

       Estimates of gross savings from analyses holding patients’ baseline assignments fixed

across the study period were generally similar to estimates from our main approach (Figure 3).

Falsification tests applying the same approach to large non-ACO TINs or the 2015 entry cohort

of MSSP ACOs as hypothetical entrants in 2013 yielded significant differential spending

increases in hypothetical performance years, despite pre-period spending differences from the

control group that were similar to those for ACOs (Appendix Table 3). While the results of these

falsification tests suggest that we may have underestimated savings in our main intention-to-treat

approach (e.g., from attenuation bias due to retaining ACOs and ACO TINs no longer

participating), they suggest more generally that an approach using baseline assignments may

introduce substantial and bias in unknown direction.

Area-level Analysis

       Adjusted gross savings associated with a 100% increase in MSSP penetration in the area-

level analysis were larger than gross savings estimated in our main approach and grew from

$299/patient in 2013 to $463/patient in 2015. While the larger savings may be indicative of

spillovers, we also found that populations in HRRs with greater growth in MSSP participation

became differentially lower risk relative to HRRs with lower growth in participation (Table 6).

Unlike in our main analysis, adjusted gross savings in 2015 ($463/patient) was substantially

smaller than unadjusted gross savings ($788/patient) because of the growing imbalance in patient

characteristics described in Table 6.

Attribution Based on Referring PCPs

       Attribution based on the dominant referring PCP when beneficiaries had no PCP office

visits to support attribution increased gross savings estimates by $50-112/patient (Appendix
                                                                                                   31


Table 4). In previous work, we also found that modifying attribution to include office visits with

nurse practitioners and physician assistants (who conduct annual wellness visits in many

practices) did not substantively changes estimates.5

Assessing Risk Selection Potentially Contributing to Bonuses but Removed in Evaluation

Reconfiguration of ACOs to Favor Lower-cost Primary Care Providers

       Allowing the TINs composing ACOs to change after the first performance year did not

appreciably affect adjusted gross savings in the 2012 entry cohort, decreased savings in the 2013

entry cohort, and increased savings in the 2014 cohort (Table 7). The changes in adjusted savings

due to compositional changes in the 2013 and 2014 cohorts were at least partly mediated by

shifts to providers with sicker (2013 cohort) or healthier (2014 cohort) patients, as opposed to

providers with different levels of efficiency, based on comparisons of adjusted and unadjusted

estimates when allowing ACO TIN composition to change (Table 7),

       Compared with changes produced by allowing the composition of TINs to change,

allowing ACOs’ composition of PCPs to change caused lesser changes in adjusted savings

(Table 7), suggesting no systematic selection of lower-cost PCPs within ACO TINs. These

findings provide no consistent evidence of favorable risk selection mediated by changes in ACO

provider inclusion to increase bonuses, but they do support our main intention-to-treat approach

to eliminate bias from changes in ACO provider composition.

Gaming of CMS Attribution Algorithm via Manipulation of TINs Used for Billing

       In analyses employing the CMS attribution algorithm and holding ACO TIN composition

constant over performance years, adjustment for patient covariates had modest and inconsistent

effects, providing no consistent evidence of patient-level risk selection within ACO TINs via

gaming of the attribution algorithm. Adjusted gross savings in 2015 was 94% of unadjusted
                                                                                                     32


gross savings in the 2012 cohort, 133% of unadjusted gross savings in the 2013 cohort, and 74%

of the (smaller) unadjusted gross savings in the 2014 cohort (Appendix Table 5).

       Use of the CMS attribution algorithm caused trends in the pre-entry period to differ

between ACOs and the control group in a direction that would exaggerate savings estimates if

the trend difference continued over performance years. The trend difference was due to the

inclusion of visits in nursing facilities, which were largely dropped from the attribution algorithm

in a 2017 rule change,30 and not due to the inclusion of outpatient visits with specialists, which

increased differences in pre-period levels but not trends (Appendix Table 6). These findings

support our a priori decision to base attribution only on PCP office visits in our main approach

and suggest that savings estimated with use of the CMS attribution algorithm may be biased.

       In analyses using the CMS attribution algorithm, adjusted gross savings were

substantively similar when treating ACOs as fixed groups of initially participating TINs or as

fixed groups of clinicians billing under those TINs in the ACOs’ first year of participation

(Appendix Table 5). Savings were somewhat smaller when defining ACOs as fixed groups of

clinicians, but so were differences in pre-period trends (data not shown), suggesting that

redefining ACOs as groups of clinicians attenuated estimates by correcting for bias related to

pre-existing trends as opposed to bias from gaming related to changes in the TINs used for

billing. (The latter should have manifested as larger and more consistent effects of adjustment for

patient characteristics on savings estimates in Appendix Table 5). Taken together, the results of

these analyses do not provide clear evidence of ACOs shifting the billing of some clinicians to

excluded or included TINs in order to attain a lower-risk attributed patient population.

Patient and Physician Exit from ACOs

       Among patients attributed to an ACO in 2013 or 2014 per the CMS Beneficiary-level
                                                                                                     33


attribution file, the proportion no longer attributed to the same ACO in the subsequent year per

the attribution file was higher among patients with higher HCC scores, for example 22.4% in the

highest decile of HCC scores vs. 15.3% in second to lowest decile (Figure 4A). As has been

previously described,23 the exit rate was also higher among patients in the lowest decile of risk

scores, consistent with their low use of qualifying services providing a less reliable basis for

assessing a patient’s regular source of care. We observed a nearly identical pattern when using

the CMS attribution algorithm to assign patients to large non-ACO TINs, with exit rates rising

from 15.2% among patients in the second lowest decile of HCC scores to 22.3% in the highest

decile (Figure 4A). These results are consistent with the lack of differential changes detected in

our analysis of measurable patient characteristics (Table 4), which quantify the net effect of non-

random patient exit and entry and suggest churn is similar in both ACO and non-ACO groups.

       Results were similar when attribution was based on office visits with PCPs; patient exit

rates were higher for patients with higher HCC scores in both ACOs and large non-ACO TINs

(Figure 4A). Within ACOs, the mean difference in HCC scores between patients exiting and

staying was nearly identical for ACOs (0.095; P<0.001) and large non-ACO TINs (0.096;

P<0.001). Thus, in the absence of MSSP incentives, higher-risk patients had less stable

assignments over time, as might be expected because they receive more services from more

physicians in PCP specialties (Appendix Table 1). When attribution was based on office visits

with PCPs only, exit rates were substantially lower (Figure 4A), as expected by the exclusion of

other qualifying services in the CMS attribution algorithm (e.g., post-acute visits) that directly

reflect changes in patients’ health care needs and thus introduce instability in attribution.24

       In analogous analyses at the PCP level, PCPs with higher-risk patients also had higher

rates of exit from both ACO TINs and large non-ACO TINs by 2015 (Figure 4B). The mean
                                                                                                    34


difference in PCPs’ mean patient HCC score between exiting and staying PCPs was 0.029

(P=0.009) for ACOs and 0.026 (P=0.005) for non-ACO TINs. These differences were reduced to

0.019 (P=0.09) and 0.018 (P=0.05), respectively, after adjustment for ACO or TIN fixed effects

to estimate within-ACO or within-TIN differences, suggesting that physician turnover is higher

in organizations serving higher risk patients. We could not explain the residual differences in

patient risk between exiting and staying PCPs. One possibility is that physicians who have been

at a practice longer may be more likely to switch practices and also may have sicker patients due

to aging of their patient panel. Regardless of the explanation, our analysis demonstrates that PCP

turnover is greater for PCPs with higher-risk patients in the absence of MSSP incentives. Thus,

greater exit from ACOs by physicians with higher-risk patients should not be interpreted as

evidence of risk selection by ACOs.31

DISCUSSION

       Through 2015, we estimate that the MSSP lowered Medicare spending modestly for

ACO patients. We implemented several measures to minimize selection bias and found no

evidence that residual risk selection drove the estimated savings. The larger savings and greater

growth in savings reported for physician group ACOs were similarly found to be robust in

previous work.5 In addition, we detected no evidence of risk selection that may have contributed

to ACO bonuses but was eliminated by our evaluation approach. Specifically, we did not find

evidence that ACOs consistently manipulated their composition of providers to favor practices or

physicians with lower-risk patients (or more efficient practice patterns). The lack of detectable

risk selection is consistent with ACOs’ limited incentives to favor practices (TINs) with low

spending under the benchmarking rules during the first phase of the MSSP (through 2016) and a

limited ability to select specific physicians or patients within practices for inclusion or exclusion.
                                                                                                   35


       As the basis for benchmarks increasingly transitions to ACOs’ regional spending average,

as opposed to their own historical spending, ACOs have new incentives to favor practices with

spending below the regional average. Identifying practices with lower predicted spending levels

is easier than identifying those with slower predicted spending growth, because spending levels

are strongly correlated over time, whereas growth rates are not.25,26 Wide variation in risk-

adjusted spending levels between providers within regions32,33 suggests opportunities for ACOs

in the revamped MSSP, Pathways for Success, to earn bonuses by selectively including or

excluding practices. Such practice-level selection may be easier than physician- or patient-level

selection because it requires only a change in ACO participant lists and because spending can be

more reliably profiled at the practice level than at the physician or patient levels.

       In the short run under Pathways, selective inclusion of low-spending practices by ACOs

(or selective participation of low-spending ACOs) will be costly to the Medicare program,

effectively increasing subsidies to providers that have lower-risk patients or are already more

efficient.9 In the long run, selectively attracting more efficient practices could conceivably

enhance social welfare if demand for efficiency in the MSSP applies sufficient pressure on other

providers to become more efficient, and thus attractive to ACOs, as the program expands. Such a

scenario, however, would require the fee-for-service alternative to be less attractive to inefficient

providers than the MSSP and better risk adjustment to mitigate transfers from practices serving

sicker patients to those serving healthier patients. As new incentives under Pathways play out,

evaluations that judge ACO spending against valid counterfactuals, rather than benchmarks, will

continue to be important to quantify savings from changes in care delivery. Unbiased estimates,

however, may be challenging to produce as new payment models proliferate and expand.

       Our analyses also have implications for the application of quasi-experimental research
                                                                                                    36


methods. First, our findings exemplify the importance of establishing a plausible counterfactual

when attempting to draw causal conclusions. Our estimates of savings are greater than those

generated by comparisons with ACO benchmarks, which systematically underestimated ACO

savings in the first phase of the program.34 In addition, our tests of risk selection reveal that

analysis of patient or physician exit from ACOs can be misleading without considering exit

under a counterfactual scenario in which providers do not face MSSP incentives.31 When

comparing against churn among non-ACO providers, we found no evidence of risk selection at

the clinician or patient level; turnover is higher for higher-risk patients and their clinicians,

regardless of MSSP incentives.

        Second, our analyses illustrate common tradeoffs between approaches to address

different sources of bias; strategies that ensure elimination of one source of bias can exacerbate

bias from other sources. In particular, our findings demonstrate that analytic steps to eliminate

bias from changes in fixed characteristics of patients due to changes in ACO population

composition can exacerbate bias from within-patient changes in time-varying characteristics.

While we found no suggestion of residual selection in robustness checks of our main approach—

which allowed patient turnover within ACOs—the same checks suggested introduction of bias

by use of patient fixed effects, baseline assignments, or area-level comparisons to hold patients

constant. The estimates produced by these approaches were generally consistent with those from

our main approach but less robust in sensitivity or falsification analyses. Thus, an

overemphasized conceptual concern about one source of potential bias (in this case, selection on

unobserved fixed traits of patients) can lead to a suboptimal approach, if not erroneous

conclusions. Our findings suggest that assessing assumptions with observable information can

help guide choice of an approach. Since identifying assumptions in quasi-experimental studies
                                                                                                37


cannot be tested directly (counterfactuals cannot be observed) one must ultimately rely on tests

of observable quantities to gauge the extent of residual bias. By that standard, we have most

confidence in the estimates produced by our primary approach and would advise caution in

interpreting estimates produced by the alternative approaches.

Limitations

       Because providers were not randomized to the MSSP, our analysis was subject to forms

of selection bias other than risk selection conditional on participation. One concern is that

providers selected into the MSSP based on anticipated changes in spending growth. Spending

trends in the pre-entry period, however, were nearly identical for ACOs and local control groups,

on average, suggesting that ACOs did not select into the MSSP based on established trajectories.

Although we could not rule out selective entry as contributing to gross savings estimates, we do

not find it plausible that ACOs could accurately predict their future risk-adjusted spending

growth relative to their region. We further note that ACOs had incentives to enter if their

anticipated spending growth was slower than national spending growth (the basis for updating

benchmarks), not local spending growth (the basis for counterfactuals in our evaluation). Thus,

even if ACOs managed to selectively enter in a way that resulted in bonus payments, that would

not necessarily bias our estimates of gross savings, and the unearned bonuses would be

accounted for in our calculation of net savings. However, because regional spending growth in

one period is not predictive of regional spending growth in the next, and because regional

spending levels are not correlated with regional spending growth, ACOs’ basis for predicting

their region’s growth relative to the nation is limited.

       Clearly, ACOs were likely to have greater capacity to respond to MSSP incentives than

non-participating providers. But in the absence of selection on future changes in spending
                                                                                                   38


growth, non-equivalence between ACO and non-ACO providers would compromise only the

external validity (generalizability), not the internal validity, of our findings. As long as the

differential reductions in spending we estimated were due to provider responses to new

incentives, they would be valid estimates of the causal effects of MSSP participation on

participants. We would not expect ACOs to slow fee-for-service spending, counter to their

financial self-interest, in the absence of an incentive to do so.

       Another concern is that other time-varying determinants of spending growth affected

ACOs and non-ACO providers differently because they are different. However, spending levels

were similar for ACOs and non-ACO providers, and differential changes in spending for ACO

patients in pre-entry years and for patients of large non-ACO providers were small. Thus,

violations of the common shocks assumption would have had to coincide with the staggered

entry of ACOs into the MSSP and grow with longer participation.5

       Nevertheless, in the absence of randomization to the MSSP, we cannot entirely exclude

the possibility of selection bias contributing to our estimates of gross savings. The source of bias,

however, would have to evade detection by the many robustness checks we conducted. We also

cannot reject the possibility of some gaming behavior undetected by our many tests. The costs of

such gaming, however, would be reflected in bonus payments. Thus, our estimates of net savings

would still be valid as long as our approach generated unbiased estimates of gross savings.

Conclusion

       Through its first 3 full years of operation, we found that participation in the MSSP was

associated with modest savings and not with favorable risk selection. These findings suggest an

opportunity to build on early progress. Understanding the effect of stronger selection incentives

on savings in the revamped MSSP will be important to guide future program reforms.

  Chronic conditions from the Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse (CCW) included 27 conditions: acute myocardial infarction, Alzheimer's
disease, Alzheimer's disease and related disorders or senile dementia, anemia, asthma, atrial fibrillation, benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic
kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, diabetes, heart failure, hip or pelvic fracture, hyperlipidemia, hypertension,
hypothyroidism, ischemic heart disease, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, stroke or transient ischemic attack, breast cancer,
colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, cataracts, and glaucoma. Analytic models included indicators for all 27
conditions and indicators for the presence of multiple conditions ranging from 2 to 9 or more conditions. Counts of conditions included all
conditions except cataracts and glaucoma.
e
  For analyses of CCW condition indicators and Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCC) scores derived from earlier claims, we limited the
sample to a subgroup of beneficiaries who were also continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare 3 years prior to the study year. The
purpose of this was to assess the extent to which any differential changes may have been due to differential changes in coding practices in
response to MSSP incentives.
f
 HCC risk scores are derived from demographic and diagnostic data in Medicare enrollment and claims files, with higher scores indicating higher
predicted spending in the subsequent year. For each beneficiary in each study year, we assessed the HCC score based on enrollment and claims
data in the prior year, two years prior, and three years prior, in each case requiring continuous enrollment in fee-for-service Medicare in the study
year and the year of claims used to calculate HCC scores.

  Sample limited to beneficiaries continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare from 2009-2015 who were attributable to an ACO or non-ACO
TIN in 2015 and at least one year from 2009-2011 (and thus could contribute to estimation of a differential change in a model with patient fixed
effects). We further excluded decedents, long-term nursing home residents, and beneficiaries enrolled in hospice so that the large increase in
spending in 2015 displayed in Figure 1 would not be even larger (i.e., to limit potential bias from allowing these health declines in at the end of the
study period but not earlier).

a
 For each entry cohort of ACOs, we estimated all possible differential changes in pre-entry spending
generated by treating each pre-entry year as a hypothetical entry year. For the 2013 entry cohort, for
example, this allowed procedure generated 3 hypothetical effects of 1 year of participation (differential
changes from 2009 to 2010, from 2009-2010 to 2011, and from 2009-2011 to 2012), 2 hypothetical year 2
effects (differential changes from 2009 to 2011 and from 2009-2010 to 2012) and 1 hypothetical year 3
effect (differential change from 2009 to 2012). Plotted are all the possible hypothetical effects across the
2012-2014 entry cohorts. The estimates were distributed evenly around zero, with a slight skew toward
positive differential changes rather than negative differential changes. Moreover, hypothetical year 2
effects were not systematically more negative than hypothetical year 1 effects, and hypothetical year 3
effects were not systematically more negative they hypothetical year 1 or 2 effects.
