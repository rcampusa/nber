                                            ABSTRACT



          We construct a rational expectations model in which aggregate growth alternates between

a low growth and a high growth state. When all agents expect growth to be slow, the returns on

investment are low, and little investment takes place. This slows growth and confirms the prediction

that the returns on investment will be low. But if agents expect fast growth, investment is high,

returns    are high, and growth     is rapid,   This expectational   indeterminacy    is induced    by

complementarit    y between different types of capital goods. In a growth cycle there are stochastic

shifts between high and low growth states and agents take full account of these transitions. The rules

that agents need to form rational expectations in this equilibrium are simple. The equilibrium with

growth cycles is stable under the dynamics implied by a correspondingly     simple learning rule.

1        Introduction
One of the oldest conjectures              in economics        holds that self-fulfilling        shifts
in optimism       or confidence    can destabilize          aggregate    economic    activity.     Ag-
gregate investment,        which is notoriously          volatile,      has long been suspected
of being susceptible       to these fluctuations.           1 In this paper,    we construct        an
explicit model that exhibits this kind of exp~tational  indeterminacy in in-
vestment. In a rational expect at ions equilibrium, chang= in expectations
cause the economy to cycle back and forth between periods with high lev-
els of inv=tment and rapid GDP growth and periods with low levels of
invat ment and slow GDP growth.
       In the last twenty years, economists            have developed        a number of models
wit h multiple perfect foresight equilibria and expectat ional indeterminacy.
In a perfect foresight solution, expectations   can determine which equilib-
rium is realizd       at time O, but agents form expectations                 on the assumption
that there is no uncertainty              about     which    equilibrium     will be selected        in
future periods.       In solutions    with expectational             indeterminacy     agents also
take account of the fact that shifts in expectations will continue to influ-
ence the behavior of the economy at all future date. Despite the long-
standing      interest in the role of expectations              and their apparent       relevance
for macroeconomic         fluctuations,     these models have not found a central place
in macroeconomic         theory.
   Part of the difficulty may derive from the different goals of pure and
applied theorists. Pure theorists have explored a variety of simple, artificial
models that have helped to clarify how multiple equilibria and expectational
indeterminacy  can arise in a dynamic economy.      However, some of these
models have implications          that strike macroeconomists              as wildly implausible.
For example,       in monetary     models,        a constant    money supply in a stationary
economy can lead to infinitely many equilibria with explosive pric= (Brock,
1975), Other results have turned out to be fragile. For example, introducing
a durable asset like land into an overlapping                  generations    model can kill any

equilibria    with endogenous       fluctuations, 2 Macroeconomists            understandably
question     the empirical   relevance of all such models.
       Our goal in this paper is to make a case for a mechanism                that can gener-
ate expectat ional indeterminacy in r~l economies, This mechanism is based
on micro-foundations    that are familiar and plausible. It fits the traditional
conjecture     about inv~tment        behavior,    It does not rely on controversial           =-
sumptions      that make the model suspect on a ptiori                thmretical     grounds      or
that distract     from our basic m=sage            about   invmt ment,       This means that
in contrast     to some of the older models with expectational                 indeterminacy,
we eschew the use of overlapping generations and assume that agents are
infinitely lived. We also specify the model entirely in real terms, so there is
no fiat money.       We assume that markets are complete,                  so agents can trade
securities with payoffs that are contingent            on the state of the economy.            We
do not assume that there are search related externalities                    in the labor mar-
ket. In a departure from many of the recent models of multiple equilibria,
we do not allow any production relationship to exhibit short-run incr=sing
ret urns to scale, or equivalently,       to exhibit falling short-run          marginal   costs
of production.3
    We also go beyond        the mere demonstration             that a rational expectations
equilibrium with growth cycles exists. We show that this equilibrium     is
locally stable under a natural learning rule. As a result, arguments about
stability    under learning that were used to dismiss some of the implausible
monetary      equilibria   cannot     be used to rule out the behavior              we identify.
Mormver,      our equilibrium       concept   makes only mod~t          information     process-
ing demands       on our agents.       They do not need to formulate               expectations
about complicated  dynamic paths for any variables in the economy. In the
high and low growth statea, different GDP growth rates and market interest
rates will be observed.      To make correct forecasts,           agents need to know only
thee      numbers,    Under the learning process,          they start with estimates           for
them and update        the intimates      as they observe the realized             values in the
high or low growth states.
    The switches between            fast and slow growth           statm    are signaled   by a
random policy variable. As we explain later, we think of this variable as
an indicator of monetary policy, which can be restrictive or expansive. 4

Because we do not introduce             fiat money into our economy,                   monetary         policy
merely acts as a signal.            For our purposes,              it is sufficient     to think of the
policy variable as a traffic signal installed on the top of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York that switches between red and green, Agents learn
the transition probabilities between red and green directly by watching the
signal or equivalently        by observing           the behavior       of the economy          over time.
    We do not treat monetary                 policy this way because we think that mone-
tary non-neutralities       are irrelevant or trivial.             On the contrary, we intend our
model as a justification        for the claim that monetary                   disturbances      with small
direct effects can nevertheless have large macroeconomic  consequence.     Be-
cause it is simpler, we go to the limit and assume that the direct effects are
vanishingly small, Bringing small direct effects back into the model would
make the case for the importance of monetary policy even stronger.
   The crucial assumption    in the model specifi= how dfierent types                                        of
capital goods interact in produdion.     We assume that they are comple-
ments. Their interact ions are analogous to those between dump trucks and
front-end    loaders or between          personal          computers,         laser printers,        and digi-
tal communication          networks.         Having        more of one type of good rais~                  the
marginal productivity    of the others, The ultimate r=ult from the model is
exact ly what an intuition based on the notion of strategic complementarily
would suggest,5 If the quant it i= of capital goods that are complements with
your good are going up, this raisin the marginal productivity                             of your good.
Hence, at constant         pric~,    the quantity           demanded          goes up. Therefore,          you
produce     more, just like everyone else, If you are already in business, you ex-
pand output        faster than you would otherwise                  have done. If you are not yet
in busines, now is the time to enter, In our equilibrium, this self-reinforcing
process is strong enough to be self-sustaining.
    This intuition captures the essence of the argument, but the details are
not simple.     By itself, complementarily                   between      different    type      of inv=t-
ment goods      is not enough         to generate            growth     cycles,      An argument          first
outlined by Cass and Shell (1983) shows that the kind of expectational    in-
determinacy exhibited by our model cannot arise if the model satisfies all of
the assumptions required to prove that equilibria are Pareto optimal,    We
make only one depart ure from the standard                            assumptions.        We int reduce

FOMC     announcements     into “expansionary”            and “restrictive”    monetary   policy regimes.

a nonconvexity.       Specifically,    we assume that a firm must incur a fixed re-
search and development         cost before it can produce          a new type of investment
good. Producers of investment goods have patent rights over the designs
that result. They charge the simple monopoly price for their goods. Physi-
cal units of the invetment goods are produced under conditions of constant
returns to scale. This is characterized by falling average cost but constant
marginal cost.    Each monopolist    also faces a constant elasticity demand
curve, so prices are a constant         markup over cost. The resulting equilibrium
is characterized     by a familiar form of monopolistic            competition     with a large
number of small firm. Again, in cent rast to other models, we do not allow
for any strategic interactions between firm. The elasticity of demand faced
by any monopolist        do=   not change over time.         The demand          curve faced by
each monopolist       has no kinka. All these other elements and more could be
added to the model,        but they are not central to the story that we tell.
    Our immediate goal is to show that by themselves, our two basic assump-
tions - complementarily   of investment goods and endogenous innovation
motivated      by monopoly      power - are sufficient to generate robust,              endoge-
nous fluct uat ions in aggregate          investment,     To make our point           as simply
and as convincingly        as possible,     we abstract    from many issues that would
be important in a complete model of business cycle fluctuations and macro-
economic policy.  For example, a more realistic specification   would allow
for many different kinds of capital goods, some of which are substitutes                     for
ach   other (mini-computers           and desktop computers)         and some of which are
complements        with each other (computers       and laser printers).         Alwyn Young
(1993)   us=    this kind of model        in his demonstration        that multiple     perfect
foresight endogenous   growth rates are possible. 6 We use a specification
that allows only for complements because it simplifies the formal analysis
when we undertake the difficult task of constructing                a rational expectations
model with endogenous           switching    between      growth    rat=.   (We return to a
discussion     of complementarily         and substitution     in the concluding        section
since this issue is central to any attempt to gauge the aggregate importance
of complementarities.   ) We also assume that the supply of labor is fixed and
that the labor market always clars.             Finally, as we have already noted, we
do not allow for any real effects awociated             with monetary       policy.

   6Strictly sp caking, this is true in Young’s model if one reinterprets the utility function
for each type of good in his model as being a part of the technoloW,         w that a what he
calls the utility from each good is a kind of produced output.



                                                4
    These      last two assumptions           make our model        simpler    and our r~ults
even stronger,         If we allowed    for more complicated        labor market dynamics
or for nominal         non-neutralities,      the set of possible      fluctuations    would   be
even richer. Our simple model is more useful for our theoretical purposes,
but it is clearly too r~trictive for policy analysis, A trivial implication of
the model as it stands is t hat welfare is always higher when monetary                     policy
is expansive.      We recognize        that a complete      treatment     of monetary      policy
would take account           of its effects    on inflation,     We also understand          that
unemployment           is a real feature of the labor market that a more complete
model would have to address.
   Because of the simplifying assumptions                 that we make, we do not believe
that our model is one that can be taken directly                 to the data. In this sense,
our ambition       is more modat        than that of authors who have tried to justify
the empirical plausibility of key parameters or to calibrate models with
various forms of indeterminacy.   Our sense is that the main task now is
to make a convincing case for the plausibility of an underlying mechanism
that is capable        of generating    expect at ional indeterminacy.         Calibrat ion and
empirical     t=ting     will come later.7
    At present, the main competitor              with the mechanism           based on comple-
mentarily that we emphasize is short-run increasing returns to scale. Al-
though there are macro~onomic   estimates which suggest that this kind of
incr-ing       return might be present, these estimates             are controversial.s      As a
result, macroeconomic         evidence is likely to play a decisive role in establishing
or refuting the plausibility of any proposed mechanism.    We suspect that
the macroeconomic    evidence concerning complementarities  will ultimately
prove to be more compelling than evidence about short-run, increasing re-
turns to scale and falling short-run marginal cost. This is why we emphasize
complementarities.          In the concluding        section,   we describe     how the model
needs to be extended before qu=tions                 about plausible    parameter     values can
realist ically be addr~sed,
   Despite our best efforts, the complete model is still fairly complicated.
We develop it in stages. We start in Section 2 by d=cribing the underlying
perfect-for=     ight, balanced-growt      h model.      Under the assumption         t hat t here
is no uncertainty,       we show that from any initial condition,              this “model poss-

mat    hree possible balanced        growth paths. Two of the thrm perfect foresight
growth rates are stable under learning,                We look in a neighborhood         of these
for our high and low growth stat=                 in the extension     with random     switches.
      Then,   in Section   3, we describe          the extension      that brings    uncertainty
into the model and converts it from a model with multiple perfect foresight
equilibria into a fully specified model with expectational indeterminacy. We
introduce a policy variable that is a two-state Markov process.                        One state
signals expansion. The other signals contract ion. In equilibrium,                     all agents
understand      that all other agents rely on this signal to predict                 whether the
economy is currently in a high or low growth state. We calculate the equi-
librium, letting agents take account of the random switches between future
growth      rates that will now be present.              The previous     analysis    of distinct
perfect   foresight   equilibria     thereby      becom=     a special    case of the analysis
of a single stochastic      rational     expectations       equilibrium    that alternat=     be-
tween high and low growth               states. Finally, we verify that this rational
expectations     equilibrium       is stable under learning. Specifically, we prove an
existence     result demonstrating        that a locally stable equilibrium           must exist.
We also compute        an explicit      example        and use the learning algorithm        as a
numerical     procedure    to calculate     the equilibrium         growth and interest rates.

2.1       Modeling         Strategy
Because the equilibria         of interest to us are not Pareto optimal,              we cannot
calculate them by solving an optimization                problem.     Because we do not want
to restrict attention to the behavior of the wonomy in the neighborhood   of
a steady state, we cannot simplify the system of equations that determine a
dynamic equilibrium by linearizing around a st=dy state. We will therefore
be forced to find distinct,      explicit solutions to an infinite system of equations
in an infinite number of unknowns.             To keep things manageable,           we will make
use of a few key simplifying assumptions that let us reduce this infinite
dimensional problem to an equivalent finite dimensional problem.
      The two most important           simplifying      assumptions     are that there is a sin-
gle state variable and that the preferences and technology                  are homogeneous.
As we will show, this means that the economy                  looks the same at every date.



                                                   6
The only difference is that all opportunities                 are scaled up by the stock of the
single state variable,          In effect, this reduces the problem            of calculating       an
infinite path for dated consumption                 goods and dated stocks of capital to the
simpler, finite dimensional problem                 of calculating the constant proportional
amount       by which consumption               and the state variable      grow in each period.
If we had more than one state variable, we would have to be concerned                            with

    The homogeneity           that we need is an inherent feature of any model that
generates balanced growth — that is, in which all quantities grow at con-
stant exponential rates, We will build our model using pieces that are fa-
miliar from exist ing models of balanced growth.
    Our preference structure is standard, We assume. that there is a repre-
sentative     consumer     who maximizm             the discounted     expression    for utility,


                                       ~p’+’u(ct+i)
                                       i=cl


When we introduce            uncertainty        later in the paper, the consumer           will max-
imize expected       utility.     We also use the standard             isoelastic   expression      for
the utility derived        from consumption              in each period:    U(c)    = ~.         This
specification     gives us the homogeneity               we need on the preference      side of the
model.   A consumer          who is faced with a constant            interest rate r, will choose
to have consumption           grow at the constant            rate gc given by

                                       Ct+l
                                 gc.   —           = [p(l +rt)]’/u     .                            (1)
                                           c,

We will characterize         our infinite dimensional          equilibria   in terms of two equa-
tions in two endogenous           variables:       the interest rate and the rate of growth.
This expr~sion        giv-      us one of the two relationships.              The second      corn=
from an arbitrage condition from the technology side of the model. Because
our technology is complicated, we proceed in steps, illustrating the relation-
ships between r and g that emerge in simpler models and working up to the
relationship      for our full model.

2.2       Linear      Production
The simpl=t        production     structure      is one in which output           is linear in the
stock of capital and in which there is a one-for-one                    trade-off   between    new
capital and consumption:


                                           Y~          =   BKt                                   (2)
                                 Kt+l – Kt             =   Y~–ct.                               (3)

This is an example       of what is now called an “AK”                or linear growth model.
(We use the symbol         “B” instead of “A” to avoid confusion                     with a later
use of A.) The correct          interpretation     of this accumulation          equation   is that
consumption goods and capital goods are produced in different sectors that
use the same production technology, In this case, the production possibility
frontier between      additions     to the capital         stock and units of consumption
goods is linear. The model can therefore be treated as if it has a single pro-
ductive sector. By a suitable choice of units, the trade-off                     between    capital
and consumption   goods can be taken to be one-for-one.
    The behavior of this trivial model can be characterized by a graph that
plots the quilibrium  interest rate as a function of the equilibrium growth
rate as in Figure 1. The upward sloping curve in this plot comes from equa-
tion (1) and is labeled the preference                 curve.    The horizontal     line, which is
labeled   “one sector technology”         is determined           by arbitrage    on the produc-
tion side of the model. Arbitrage              implies the equality r = B. The inter-
section determines the equilibrium              inter~t rate and growth rate. Because
of the homogeneity       of the model, the implied values for r and g determine
everything    about the equilibrium           start ing from any initial stock of capital
K..
   A second “technology”   curve, which is downward sloping, characterizes
the no-arbitrage condition when the production    functions for producing
consumption     and capital       goods are different.           Suppose   that the production
possibility   frontier between       additions     to the stock of capital and consump-
tion is nonlinear.     The traditional        way to specify this would be to assume a
functional    form for production        in each sector and derive the expression               for
the production pmsibility frontier, Instead, we take a short-cut by assum-
ing a simple functional form for the production   possibility frontier itself,

   Figure 1: Perfect    foresight equilibria    under two different technology=



can be produced.   Suppose that output of consumption              goods   is related to
increases in the capital stock aa follows:



                              “=K-K’x(K’+~:K’)                                        (4)


In the exprewion,      x(.)   can be any increasing,      convex   cost function   with
x(O) = 0. Note that this kind of specification          impo-      the homogeneity     of
degree one in the state variable K that we need on the production            side of the
model.   Note also that this reduces to equation        (3) in the case where x is the
identity function. With this specification, the price of capital goods in units
of consumption    goods will be the derivative of consumption      with r=pmt
to the stock of capital tomorrow,      which we can write as X’(gK),       where
gK = K*+I– Kt One unit of consumption can now be inv=tecf to yield r units
          Kk
of additional consumption    goods in each period.    Alternatively,   it can be
used to purchase X’(gK)–       1units of capital,   which will yield a flow of ~ units
of consumption goods in each period.         Thus, a no-arbitrage     condition on the
technolo~   side of the model impos=         the equality r = &.          Because x(. )
is convex,   this expr=sion     yields the downward       sloping curve labeled      “two

      Two featurm of this kind of model make this simple diagrammatic                            char-
acterization     of equilibria     possible   for both of t h~e models.           First, the accu-
mulation equation for capital, (3) or (4), implies that if capital, output, and
consumption  grow at constant multiplicative      rates, this rate must be the
same for all three variables.         The equilibrium        can therefore be characterized
using a common           growth rate g = gc = gK. Second,               because     of the homo-
geneity of the specifications for preference and the technology,                        the curv=
in the figure do not depend on the level of the state variable K.                       These two
features will carry over to elaborations of this basic structure                        that allow
for fixed costs of invention and complementarily    between types                        of capital
goods.


2.3        Many         Capital     Goods
To bring invention into the analysis, we start with the model of growth
taken from Romer (1987), This model allows for the introduction  of new
types of capital        goods,    but its equilibrium       behavior    closely    r-embles        the
behavior of the one-sector model described above. Output of consumption
goods is a function of labor (assumed in fixed supply) and the quantities of
a large number of specialized           capital   goods:


                                   F(L, z(.)) =    LAz(z)~dz.                                      (5)

In this expression,        the running        index z indexes     different     types   of capital
goods. The expression Z(Z) denotes the number of units of capital of type i
that are in use. The upper limit A indicates the range of capital goods that
have already        been dmigned       and can therefore         be produced.        Although       it
would be more natural to let the index z and the upper bound A be integer
valued and to replace the integral by a sum, we use the continuous version
specified here to avoid the distractions associated with integer constraints.
      In addition    to the production         of final output,    there are two other pro-
ductive    activities     — inventing     new typ=         of capital   goods     and producing
physical    machines      of each of the many existing types of capital                 goods.     By
analogy with the one s~tor model d=cribed above, we can assume that the
same production technology described by the functional F(. ) can be used in
all productive      activities:    making consumption          goods, d=igns        for new typ~


                                                  10
of machinea,       and physical       machin=      themselves.         With the same production
technology,    the tradeoff        between the dflerent              types of output is linear. We
can therefore denote total output (which is the same as the maximum feasi-
ble output of consumption goods) as Yt = F(L, z(.)). Assume that it takes
one unit of forgone consumption                to make each additional               unit of any type
of machine         and that it takes a units of forgone                  consumption       to produce
a daign     for an entirely        new type of machine.                Then total output           is split
according     to
                          Yt = Ct + a(At+l – At) + Kt+l – Kt,

where Kt is defined as the total stock of machin=                         measured      in units of the
cost of production        for these machines:

                                                     A,
                                        Kt =              xt(i)di.
                                                /o

    The market structure           in t his model is monopolistically               competitive.      Any
firm that dmigns         a new machine          gets a patent on the design.               It produces
machines and charges the simple monopoly price for these machines.       In
equilibrium, the intermt rate r adjusts so that the pr=ent discounted value
of the rmulting monopoly profits is just equal to the cost a of inventing a
new type of machine. The zero profit condition in this equilibrium implies
that at every date, the ratio of At to Kt is constant                       so we can work with a
single aggregate       state variable Zt = aAt + Kt that summarizes                           the effects
of all previous       investment      decisions.     The accumulation              equation    can then
be written as

                                      Yt = Ct      +Zt+l– Zt.
    It turns out that the reduced form expression                       for output    Y as a function
of accumulation        to date Z is linear in Z. As a r=ult,                the intertemporal         zero
profit condition      is satisfied at a unique value of the inter=t                  rate r. This value
of r is independent        of the state variable            Zt,      (See Romer,     1987, for details
concerning the claims made about this model. ) As a result, the analysis of
growth is exactly as depicted in the single sector version of the technology
in Figure     1, The production          technology         determin=       a unique interat         rate.
The preference        specification    then yields the rate of growth for the economy.

2.4       Capital       Goods       that      are Complements
As the introduction           makes clear,    our main interest            lies in capital     goods
that are complements with each other. To see how we can bring this into
the model, note that equation (5) uses a constant-elast icit y-of-substitution
aggregator to summarize the effect on output of all the different typ~ of
capital     goods.   If we reduce the model to the special                  case with only two
discrete capital     goods,    the production          function   takes the form


                              F(L, Zl,zz)     =   L1-~(x; + z;).

As it stands, this make production additively separable in goods 1 and
2, To make them complements or substitutes, one need only introduce an
additional     exponent    on the capital aggregate:




If we impose the restriction        ~~ = a, then we prmerve homogeneity                   of degree
1. For values of @ greater than 1, the two capital goods ~i will be comple-
ments; an increase in the quantity of one raises the marginal product of
the other. Generalizing this idea, we can write the many-good, continuous-
index version of this expression           aa follows:




      In the additively       separable     model      outlined   above,     it took   a constant
amount of forgone consumption   to produce each deign for a new type of
capital good. In an extension that makes the capital goods complements,
this specification      for the technology          for producing     d~igns      would      lead to
explosive     growth.   Later designs would be more valuable                  bmause      there are
more complements          around that raise the value of a new capital                 good.    The
incentives for discovering       new goods would then grow rapidly over time.                   One
simple way to offset this increased incentive is to assume that there is also
a higher cost for designing goods with a higher index, Specifically, we will
assume that it tak= it units of forgone output to produce a design for good
i. In equilibrium, the increasd   incentives for discovering new goods that



                                                  12
come from complementarily                will just offset the increased costs of discovery
if the following      parameter        restriction     holds:

                                             ~=d-l
                                                                                                        (6)
                                                      l–a”
If this restriction    do=       not hold, the model will exhibit rata                 of growth that
are locally incrming   or decreasing over time. The model would be eco-
nomically sensible (provided some force keeps growth rates from becoming
too large), but it would no longer be pmsible                      to solve for a single, constant
growth rate as we did in Figure 1 for the linear production                                  model.    The
values for r and g would be changing over time.
     Our ‘strategy is therefore to impose this r=triction                     (6) and look for equi-
libria in the subspace consisting of paths exhibiting                         constant exponential
growth.     Bmause      our functional        form is a special case of all possible                  func-
tional    forms and bwause             our solution        space   is a subspace           of all possible
dynamic     paths,     any forms of behavior               that are possible         in our restricted
model will a jortzori be possible in a 1=s restrictive analysis.
   In the extended model with complements,        we can still write the accu-
mulation    equation      for the single state variable as

                                        Yt = Ct +      Zt+l– Zt.
The only difference        arises in the slightly more complicated                    relationship      be-
tween the stock of total capital Z and the other state variabl=.                               At date t,
the expr=sion        for total capital       Z is

                                 A,                   At                      At
                   Zt =
                          J  o
                                      Zt(z)dz+
                                                 /0
                                                           i<da= Kt +
                                                                         /0
                                                                                   i<di.                (7)


The first term, Kt, represents cumulative total investment in machina. (So
far, we have been ignoring the possibility that machin= depreciate. We will
introduce    this complication           later, ) The second term dmcribes                    cumulative
tot al investment      in the production          or discovery       of new d=igns.
    The analysis of the perfect foresight,                   monopolistically       competitive       equi-
librium for this model proceeds exactly as it did in the model where the
capital goods have additively separable effects on production. (Details are
given in the appendk.)   The fundamental arbitrage result is derivd    from
the intertemporal       zero profit condition              on investments       in new deigns.         The

key result that emerg~              from this analysis is that the no-arbitrageor                   zero
profit relationship         implied by the technology                 yields an upward sloping locus
of (r, g) pairs asillustrated           in Figure2.         Inthiscase,      thegrowth     rate grefers
to the common         growth rate for Yt, Ct, and Zt. Because deigns
                                                                  are getting
more costly, g,4 is smaller than g. In fact, one can show that g = gA~+1 Be_
cause the preference relationship is also upward sloping, these curves may
intersect more than once.              For appropriate           parameter     valu=,    they intersect
twice, as illustrated         in Figure 2. This means that the model                      has two dis-
tinct perfect     for=ight        equilibria.      For any given initial value of Zt, there is
one perfect      for~ight        equilibrium      in which the values for Yt, Ct, and Z~ all
grow at the high rate determined                    by the upper intersection.           There is also
a second perfect foresight equilibrium in which they grow at the low rate
determined by the lower intersection of the two curvm.
    The intuition        behind      the upward slope of the technolo~                    locus is fun-
damental to all of the r=ults that follow. Because of the complementarily
between goods, a firm that invents a new type of good today will face a de-
mand for its good that increasm with the quantities and varieti= of other
goods that are introduced              tomorrow.          Suppose that we start from an inter-

=t rate and a growth rate that yields zero intertemporal                  profits.    Consider
an increase in the rate of growth of the economy,                If Kt and At grow more
rapidly,    the present discounted        value of its stream of future profits         gener-
ated by a new invention would be higher if the interest rate remained the
same. Competition   for resources by potential new entrants will therefore
drive up the intermt until the present discounted               value of the future profits
is driven back down to the cost of inventing a new good.


2.5        Stability      under Learning
It is tempting    to use the relatively simple model characterized            in Figure 2 as
the basis for a model of macroeconomic               fluct uat ions. At any date, there is
nothing that forces the economy to stay with one equilibrium or the other.
One could imagine, therefore, that chang= in expectations could cause the
economy      to switch between the high and low growth stat=,
      This intuition     is partly    right, but there are two difficulties          that must
be faced before this argument            can be made precise,         First, this model is a
model of multiple perfect foreight equilibria. The rate of growth at each
of the two equilibria is calculated on the assumption that the economy will
stay forever at that equilibrium.           Once we allow for the pmsibility          that the
aggregate     economy      can switch     bet ween equilibria,       then we must also let
agents take account        of this possibility      when they form their expectations,
We will deal explicitly with this issue in the next section, where we formally
introduce a solution concept that allows for expectat ional indeterminacy,
    The second issue suggested by the analysis in Figure 2 concerns stability.
Whenever we see two equilibria in an economic model, we have come to
expect that one of them will be stable and that the other will be unstable.
The goal in this section is to identify the precise sense in which one can
speak of an equilibrium point as being stable or unstable.   Then                      we will
modify the model so that it has three perfect formight quilibria,                      two on
the ends that are stable and one in the middle that is unstable.
    We emphasize that it does not make sense to think of three equilibria
as being     stable    or unstable     in the usual sense,       In the usual model,       the
quantit i= evolve along explicit trajectories.  Which trajectory the economy
follows is determined by the initial conditions. From a given initial position,
the equilibrium       dynamics       take the economy     away from some steady state
points     and toward     others.     In this setting,   stability   is used to distinguish



                                               15
between resting points that will be reached from a large class of initial
values for the state variables and rating points that can be reached only
from a measure zero set of initial values for the state variabl~,
    This kind of analysis does not apply to our model.                  It has only one state
variable and the dynamic        equations     that determine       the growth rate do not
depend on the level of this state variable.            As a result, the initial conditions
do not pin down a starting         point in the (r, g) space illustrated         in Figure 2.
For any initial value of the state variable Z, the economy can select either of
the perfect foresight paths characterized by the intersections in the figure,
    We can, however, inquire into the stability properties of the equilibria by
going outside of the perfect foresight model and asking what the dynamics
would be if agents had to learn about the equilibrium values of variabl= by
observing     the behavior   oft he economy        itself. If plausible   learning dynamics
lead the agents away from some perfect foresight equilibria and toward other
equilibria, we can use this difference to distinguish between more and less
plausible perfect foresight equilibria,       That is, we can use stability          under the
learning dynamics      as a selection criterion when there are multiple equilibria,
   In modeling      learning, we r=trict      attention     to a simple scheme in which
households     base thek actions on an expected            interest rate. Given their be-
liefs about interest rates, consumers decide how much to save. Firms observe
the current savings behavior oft he consumers and project this behavior into
the indefinite    future.    Given their beliefs about current and future savings
behavior,     firms will compete     for resources       in financial     markets.   This de-
termin~     a realized interest rate that is consistent          with no-arbitrage      on the
product ion side of the market.        After consumers         observe the realized rates,
they adjust their exp~tations         about    future inter~t       rates.   For example,     if
the inter=t      rate that consumers     expected       was lower that the interest rate
that is realized, they will revise their for-asts of inter=t rat= upward.
    Out of equilibrium,    both firms and consumers make mistak~.       Con-
sumers use the wrong interest rate for their projections of current and future
int crest rat=. Firms project the current savings behavior of consumers into
the future, but consumers will modify their savings behavior as they update
their estimate of the interest rate. If one of the perfect foresight equilibria              is
stable, this process will converge to the equilibrium if it starts from nearby
values for ~ and g. As it does, these mistakes become smaller. In the limit,
at the equilibrium valu= for the inter=t rate and the growth rate, these
rules lead to correct forecasts by both firms and consumers. Interest rates


                                              16
and growth rat=        are constant      and no revisions     are necessary.
      To conduct     the learning     analysis    it is necessary     to extend    the model
to a temporary        quilibrium      framework       that captures     th=e    assumptions.
Fortunately,     this analysis can be carried out using the same curves that
characterize    the equilibrium in (r, g) space. Given an expected intermt rate
r’,   households    choose their saving to generate the rate of growth of wealt h
and consumption        implied by equation        (1), the equation that determines           the
preference     curve in Figure 2. Firms take this growth rate of consumption
and the implied, and equal, growth rate of total capital Z as given and
project it into the future, At this expected growth rate for the economy,
there is a unique realized inter=t rate t hat is consistent with no-arbitrage on
the technology       side of the market.     This is the value of r that is determined
by inserting the given growth rate into the technology                  curve in the figure.
If we take the composition         of these two operations,      we have a mapping           that
takes expected interest rat es into realized interest rat=.              Let us denote this
mapping as follows:

                                                                                              (8)

By construction,       the interest rates corresponding          to perfect     foresight    bal-
ancd growth paths are fixed points of T.
   To generate an explicit dynamics for the interest rate, we use an adaptive
learning scheme,
                                   T;+l = r: +dt(rt— T:),                                     (9)

where bt = ~. The sequence            {tit} is known as the gain sequence.           It deter-
mines the extent of the adjustment of expectations to forecast errors.                          A
decreasing squence  {bt} impli= that consumers become less responsive                          to
forecast errors as more data accumulates.              For example,     with 6 = 1 and ap-
propriate initial values, equation (9) impli= t hat r:+ 1 is equal to the average
of past valua of rt, This kind of learning rule is particularly appropriate in
an extension       of this model which allows for small stochastic             shocks, but we
do not introduce       three shocks explicitly        into the analysis    here.    Together,
equation     (9) and the mapping         rt = T(rf)     define a dynamic        system      which
can be analyzed        in the vicinity    of a fixed point.     (For a general discussion
of these kinds of learning algorithms, see the review paper by Evans and
Honkapohja,   1995a. For a discussion of learning around stmdy states, see
Evans and Honkapohja, 1995b.) If we linearize this system around a steady


                                                 17
state, we can show that the fixed point is locally stable if T’(r)                 < 1. (If the
parameter      6t were equal to one so that the sequence                of valua     for r’   was
determined      simply by iterates of T, we would have to impose the additional
condition T’(r) > – 1. However, 6t goes to zero, so we do not have to worry
about instability y caused by overshooting in the adjustment process. )
      As experience     suggests, the two equilibria       in Figure 2 have different sta-
bility properties. The function T is the compmition     of the two functions
graphed in the figure, At points where they intersect, the size of T’ relative
to 1 is determined        by the relative slope        of the two curvm.        A simple geo-
metrical argument shows that it is the lower equilibrium that is stable under
lmrning. In Figure 2, r~ denotes an expected interest rate that is below the
inter~t    rate in the low-growth       perfect for=ight       equilibrium    and rfi denote
an expected      interest rate that is also below the interest rate in the high-
growth equilibrium.          As the figure shows,       when the mapping           T is applied
to r;, it lads to a value T(r~ ) that is above r~, so adjustment moves the
expected inter=t rate in the right direction. In contrast, when applied T is
applied to rfi, it l=ds to a value that is below rfi, so the learning dynamics
drives the economy away from the high growth equilibrium.g
      If one accepts,    as we do, the notion that any perfect foresight equilibrium
that is unstable under simple learning rules is unlikely to be realized                         in
practice, one is forced to conclude that the kind of multiplicity exhibited                     in
Figures 2 is unlikely to have any practical              relevance.     To have a candidate
for a model with multiple stable perfect forezight equilibria,                  we will need a
model that generatm          more intersections       of the two curves in this figure.


2.6       Multiple        Stable Perfect              Foresight        Equilibria
Careful     readers     will no doubt     have guessed        where the argument         is now
headed.     We showed in the analysis of Figure               1 that a two-sector     structure
that generat=         a standard,    nonlinear    trade-off    between     the production       of
     gNote that there are alternative   ways of formulating     the temporary   equilibrium   and
mrresponding    learning rules. For example, firms could instead have expected growth rate
g;   with the actual growth rate and interest rate in a tempor~          equilibrium determined
by inferring r from the arbitrage condition for ks from the technolog   side of the
model, tafcing g~ a given. Next, we could let mmumers select the rate of growth of
mnsumption      and wealth from off of the preference curve.       A   learning scheme g:     ~ for
fires   could then be b-cd    on the forecast erro= gz, t – gj, ~. It can be easily verfie~   that
a steady state is stable under (9) if and only if it is stable under this alternative scheme.



                                                 18
investment goods and consumption     goods tends to make the technology
curve slope down in (r, g) space. We have just shown that complementarily
between dflerent      types of capital goods tends to make the technology                          curve
slope up. If we combine t h=e two elements in the same model, we should
be able to make the curve have increasing and decreasing segments, so it
can intersect the preference        curve arbitrarily         often.
   Specifically,     we adopt      the spectication       for the production                possibility
frontier between consumption          and inv=tment           that we used previously.             Thus,
the accumulation       quation     for Z now takes the form

                                                Zt+l     ––

                                                                                                      (lo)

expression,we have also included a term Dt that takes account                                   of any
depreciation   of the physical       capital    stock.   As in the previous                model    with
complements, the total stock of Z is related to the stock of designs                                  and

                                                function for producing ma-
chines and inventions is the same so that there is a linear production possi-
bility frontier between these two types of goods.               However, equation             (10) tells
us that this common production              function is different from the production
function for making consumption             goods. Of course, we could also allow for
a nonlinear    production     possibility      frontier between          designs and machines.
For example,       one might want to capture the notion that invention                         and de-
sign work should be more labor intensive and less capital intensive than the
p~oduction of machines. However, pr~erving the linar frontier between A
and K gives us a major simplification in the structure of the model: this is
the crucial assumption that reduca the state variables Kt and At to a single
state variable Zt. Finally, we assume that physical machines depreciate at
the exponent ial rate d but that design blueprints                     to not depreciate,          so Dt
can be exprased       as Dt = dKt. In all other respmts,                    the model is the same
as the previous model with complement arit ies.
    Figure 3 illustrates one type of simple equilibrium                          that we have gen-
erated using this combined          structure,       The downward                sloping   portions    of

the twhnology      curve represent       points where the curvature           in the produc-
tion possibility   frontier between       consumption         goods and invest ment goods
is high so its effects overwhelm        the effects of complementarily,         The upward
sloping portions   of the technology       curve represent regions where the produc-
tion possibility frontier is relatively flat, so the effects of complementarily
dominate.    As the analysis in the last section suggests, the middle equilib-
rium will be unstable under learning.                  The low and high growth equilibria
will be stable under learning.
    Table    1 reports       values oft he growth rate and the interest rate in the
high and low growth equilibria in the basic parameterization                   of the model.
(Numerical valu= for the parameters are given in Appendix                      Al.) By con-
struct ion, the interest rates in these two equilibria              were arbitrarily   set at
4% and 5~o respectively.          The corresponding          growth rates for Z, C, and Y
are 0.2~o per year and 4. 9~o per year. The table also reports the values for
p=, the price of the inv=tment goods relative to consumption goods. In the
high growth state, where a larger fraction of GDP is devoted to investment,
inv~tment   goods are more expensive to produce on the margin, so their

high growth state,      a higher level of investment           can be sustained   because
of the positive    reinforcing     effects that result from the complementarities
between the different types of investment            goods.

    There are a few technical       details that we have to address to convince       the
reader that we have not violated            any of the basic rules in the construction
of equilibrium    models.      We mention t heee briefly here and leave the details
for the appendix, First, there is another parameter restriction t hat we must
impose to insure that the maximum feasible growth rate in this economy
does not yield infinite discounted utility. We impose this r=triction  in our
specification of the production pmsibility frontier between investment goods
and consumption       goods.     It implies that there is a maximum       feasible rate of
growth for Z. Beyond this rate, the marginal cost of additional investment
becomes infinite. Figure 4 illustrates the nature of the implied production
possibility   frontier between      Zt+l    and Ct for a given level of Zt.       The two
regions of sharp curvature corr=pond    to the two downward sloping regions
of the technology curve in figure 3. This picture also mak= it clear that we
are not relying on the any assumptions about short-run increasing returns
in the production of new investment goods. Some models generate multiple
growth rat= by assuming that because of these kinds of short run increasing
returns, investment     goods are cheaper when a larger fraction of total output
is devoted to investment. We generate multiple growth rates despite the fact
that investment goods are more expensive when investment is higher and
growth is more rapid. We reiterate that the only nonconvexity in the model
is the fixed cost associated with invention. All of the work that is done by
increasing returns in other models is done here by complementarily.
    We have also chosen our parameters so that the rate of growth of Z and
(and hence also A) are positive in both of our perfect for=ight equilibria.
Thus, without changing the calculated values in our equilibrium, we could

consumption    goods    or that dwigns       could be converted          into machin=     and
vice versa.   Likewise,     non-negativity        of consumption        has to be checkd,
Given our parameter       values, this constraint      is satisfied.



3     Growth           Cycles with Expectational                               Indeter-
      minacy

3.1       Equilibrium        fluctuations
So far, we have construct        a model with two stable perfect foresight equi-
libria. These are building       blocks in our complete model of fluctuations
between    high and low growth states,            but by themselv=        they do not con-
st it ute a model of this phenomenon.         The figures in Table 1 illustrate         why.
Suppose that the economy       were to change from the high growth state to the



                                             22
low growth state.       The price p= on each piece of capital            would fall from 2.5
to 1.1. In the calculation         of the perfect     foresight equilibrium,        we assumed
that this shift could never take place, so consumers                 make their savings de-
cisions wit bout taking any account of the possibility y of this large capital
loss on their asset holdin~.  When consumers make their decisions about
how much to consume            and save, we must allow them to take account                 of the
switch=    between      high and low growth states that will actually                 take place
in equilibrium.
   Formally,      we can do this by introducing           a random      variable that has no
 effect on preferenc~ or the opportunities that consumers and firms face.
‘This random variable St matters only because agents use it to forwast the
behavior     of the economy.       This kind of “extrinsic       uncertainty”      is susceptible
to various      interpretations.     For a discussion,         see for example      the chapter
on “Market       Psychology”       in Azariadis     (1993).     As we suggest      in the intro-
duction, we prefer to think of this random variable as something that is
under the control of policy makers. In a more complete model, we would
let this variable have two effects:        a small direct effect on the fundamentals
in the economy        and a larger indirect       effect that acts through         its effects on
expectations.      The small direct effects would explain why agents first began
to pay att ent ion to the value of this variable.  Nevertheless, to keep our
analysis simple and to highlight the expectational effects that it can induce,
we assume that the direct eff=ts are negligible.
   To keep this part of the model as simple as possible,                        we assume that
St switch=      randomly    between two states with fixed transition               probability ies.
These transition probabilities will be exogenous parameters in our analysis.
In the “high” state firms and households (corrwtly)    anticipate higher in-
vestment     and more rapid growth during the coming                  period.    However, they
also take full account      of the probability       of a switch to the low growth state
in future periods.       Formally,     we let St take values from {1,2}             and assume
that it follows a two-state        Markov chain with transition          probabilities    IIij for
Z,~ = 1, 2. Thee transition probabilities are exogenously given parameters,
    Formally, all of the traditional elements in the specification of our model
— the preferences and the technology — remain the same after we introduce
s. All that changes is that in our calculation                of an equilibrium,     we look for
solutions to the equations         generated by the model in a larger solution space.
In the calculation of perfect foresight equilibria, we did not let consumers
or firms make decisions that are cent ingent on s. Now we do. We already


                                              23
know that there are equilibria          in which consumers           choose not to make their
choic=      contingent     on s (or equivalently,         make the same choic~             for the
two different valu~          of s.) These are the perfect foresight equilibria          we have
already calculated. If we find that there are other equilibria in which output
and prices vary with the realization of s, we will say that the equilibrium
exhibits     expectational      indeterminacy.        This, we think, is a more sugg~tive
description     of the behavior        in qu=tion       than the conventional         label of a
“sunspot      equilibrium.”
    The timing          of the realization     of s and of decisions         is as follows.     In
period t – 1, total potential output is realized. Consumers make decisions
about how much to consume and how much to invest. Given the net-of-
depreciation     stocks of machines          (1 – d) Kt- 1 and the stock of designs At_ 1,
their d~isions       about     how much to invest will determine               the total    stock
of capital     Zt that will be carried over into period               t.   At the beginning      of
period t, the value of St is realized, Firms then make their decisions about
production contingent on the observed value ofs, In particular, they decide
how to split the new investment between additions to K and increas= in
A. When s signals fast growth, firms will allocate more of their investment
to increase  in A because a design is more valuable when the economy is
growing rapidly. Given these decisions by firms, total output will be realized
at the end of period t. Consumers observe the state St and decide how much
to consume       and how much to save,             In the high growth and high interest
rate state, they will save more and consume                  less.    (This posit ive r~ponse
of savings to increwes         in the inter~t      rate follows from our assumption           that
the parameter o in the utility function is 1=s than one.) Thus, Z will tend
to increase by a larger factor during high growth states.    Undepreciated
capital and the saving decision of households then determine the quantity
of capital    Zt+l   which is carried into t + 1 and must once again be divided
between      increasa     in K and A.
    This is the minimal extension of our perfect foraight                  framework in which
we can consider the possibility of expectational  indeterminacy — the possi-
bility that the behavior of the economy is determined partly by expectations
that are not fully determined            by the fundamentals           of the economy.        This
extension     nevertheless      introduces     a substantial    degree of additional          com-
plexity    into the model,        In particular,      the variable    Sf introduces    a second
state variable into the analysis, so it is no longer possible to solve for a single
growth rate and interest rate that characterize the equilibria. For any given


                                                 24
value of the state variable Z, there will be two different choices,                          indexed      by
s, that firms will make regarding             additional           investment          in K and A.       For
any given level of total output,            consumers         will make two different               choices,
indexed by s, about how much to consume and save. They will be guided
by two different interest rat- that can also be indexed by s. As long as
the transition    probabilities       are positive,        decisions       in one state will depend
on the growth and interat             rates that will obtain              in the other state, so the
state-specific growth rates and interest rates are simultaneously determined.
The structure of the model still permits us to reduce the system for the full,
infinite dimensional dynamic equilibrium to system with a finite number of
quations    and unknowns, but it is not a system that can be reduced in any
meaningful      way to a two-equation,              two-variable           graphical     analysis    of the
kind that was pmsible        for the perfect             foresight       equilibria.     (The equations
for this system are given in the appendix.)
    One straightforward way to study the behavior                           of a system of equations
is to look for numerical solutions. We pr=ent one such solution that us=
the same parameter values and functional forms that we used in calculating
the two stable perfect formight equilibria in Section 2. The only difference
here is that we allow for a 5~0 probability that between any two periods,
the economy switches from the high growth to the low growth state or vice
versa. Table 2 and 3 provide the description of such a growth cycle that
we calculated     numerically.

   In this equilibrium with expwtational  indeterminacy, K and A always
grow between periods t and t + 1, regardless of the valuea taken on by st
and St+l. This means that we do not have to consider the issues that would
arise if firms wanted        to disinvest.         In the two states,       the consumption-
income ratio C/Y vari= as one would expect given our assumption that
savings responds posit ively to increases in returns. on the firm side, invet-
ment behavior       would be dominated             by firm perceptions     about the state of
aggregate    demand     and the rate of growth in the near term.                 Investment    by
any individual      firm would go up when interest rates are higher and growth
is more rapid.      Finally, note the relatively            small amount of variation       in the
price of capital     goods p’    compared          to the markedly       different   values that
it takes on in the two different perfect for=ight equilibria.  This reflects
the weight given by forward looking agents to the pmsibility of a transition
between high and low growth states. It also reflects the changes in their
behavior    that foresight    induc=.


3.2       Existence        and       Stability            of Growth         Cycles      under
          Learning
It is no accident     that the growth cycle that we calculated                numerically     gen-
erates growth and inter=t            ratea that are close to the values that arise in
the two perfect for=ight equilibria we constructed in Section 2. As we have
already noted, the perfect foresight equilibria can be thought of as solu-
tions to the model in which agents do not make their decisions                       contingent
on the value of s, It is also possible              to interpret    them as solutions       where
decisions    do depend on the realization               of s but where the transition     proba-
biliti~    between the two states are zero. In this limiting caae, the decisions


                                                   26
that firms and consumers             make in the two states can be uncoupld.                     The
problems      they face reduce to the problems               considered         in the perfect   fore-
sight analysis.        Bmause    the system      of equations         depends     smoothly   on the
transition probabilities, the implicit function theorem tells us that for tran-
sition probabilities   near zero, the behavior of the economy in the high or
low growth state will be close to the behavior                  of the economy         in the corre-
sponding      perfect   foresight    equilibrium.        Quantities     and prices will be close
to the perfect     for=ight     values,    Moreover,       as we will show, if the individual
perfect    foresight    equilibria   are stable under learning,            then the full equilib-
rium with expectational          indeterminacy    that switches between                 states that
are near these equilibria        will also be stable under lmrning.
    It is easiest to establish        both the existence         r~ult      and the convergence
result at the same time. To do so, we must first describe                        what the learning
dynamic      is in our full equilibrium      with expectational           indeterminacy.     For the
case of perfect foresight, we formulated a model of lmrning based on a single
variable, the expected interest rate. We must now extend this approach to
the full model in which variablea can depend                  on St.
    The equations        that determine       the full equilibrium         can be interpreted      as
a mapping that takes a pair of expected                   interest rates (r;, ~~) to a pair of
r-lized interest rates (rl, r2):

                                                                                                 (12)

(The equations themselves are presented in the appendix.)     The equilib-
rium with expectational  indeterminacy  is a fixed point of this mapping
with values rl # r2. Recall from the previous discussion of learning what
the interpretation       of this mapping        is. If households         make savings decisions
on the assumption         that the interest rates r;, and T; will prevail in the two
states and if producers expect consumers to persist with savings behavior
that this induces, then the production side of the market will clear at the
inter=t    rates rl and ~2 in the two different states. That is, rl and r2 will be
consistent    with zero expected        profit for an entrant into the invention of new
goods.    In the hypothetical        dynamic     determined      by the learning process, the
time t realized inter~t         rate rt would be given by

                         ~t = Ti(TY,t,    rj,t)ifst=i,        fori=l,2,                          (13)

where ~i denot=         the i’th component          of the mapping         ~.


                                                 27
    We adopt the following simple state contingent              adaptive learning scheme,
In state s, agents will compare        the inter=t       rate they expected     to obtain   in
this state with the interest rate that actually             obtains.   They    will then ad-
just their expectation of inter~t rates in this state in the direction of the
rmlized int crest rate. As before, the amount of the adjustment depends on
the amount     of data that they have already collected:




In this expr~sion, iVi (t)repr=ents the number of times the variable St has
taken value z up until time t. Equations (13) and (14) define a dynamic
system in the two variables        T;, T;   that is driven by the exogenous       stochastic
variable st.
    An equilibrium        growth   cycle,    i.e., a rational   expectations    equilibrium
with expwtational         indeterminacy,     is a fixed point    (TI, Tz)   of (12) in which
rl # Tz, When          we want to be explicit,         we can express these equilibrium
interest rates as functions of the underlying transition probabilities, rl (H)
and rz (II). Let I denote the two-by-two identity matrix.     It corresponds
to a degenerate transition probability matrix with no changes in the initial
state.   With this notation,       we can describe       conditions    under which a non-
degenerate    growth cycle exists and ,which has the property               that for nearby
initial conditions,     the sequenca       of state dependent    interest ratm generated
by the learning dynamics        converge to the stat~dependent          interest rates that
obtain   in equilibrium.

Proposition     1 Suppose that the model outlind in section 2 has two dis-
tinct, perfect foresight, balancd growth equilibria. Let the mapping T be
as defind in that section, so that the interest rates corresponding to these
quilibtia satisfy TL = T(?’L) and rH = T(rH) and assume, without loss
of generality, that rL < rH. Suppose that these two values both satisfy the
perfect foresight stability criterion, T’(rL ) <1 and T’(rH ) <1. Then there
etists a neighborhood of the identity matrix I with the property that for any
transition probability matrix 11 in thti neighborhood, there is an equilibm”um
growth cycle (rl (~), r2(~)) nmr (rL, rH) which ti locally stable under the
learning dynamics (13) and (lJ).

    The proof of the Proposition,           together    with a precise statement      of the
phrase “locally       stable under learning”,       is given in the Appendix,


                                               28
     Finally,    we note that we have verified directly                that the numerical        ex-
ample presented            in the last section      is locally   stable in the natural sense.
If one starts with guesses about                the inter~t      rates and growth         rates that
will obtain in the growth cycle and iterates using the learning dynamic, the
resulting values for the interest rates and the growth rates converge to the
equilibrium values for the growth cycle. In fact, we used a version of this
method       to calculate     the growth cycle itself.



4       Discussion               of Related              Literature
Models with multiple equilibria are potentially of interest for understanding
both macroeconomic   fluctuations and economic development.         In the de-
velopment       process,     we observe substantial        diversity   of growth rata        among
countri=      at similar levels of income.          We also observe that the direct foreign
investment that flows from advanced countria     to poor countries tends to
be highly concentrated in a small number of rapidly growing countries. The
model    that we have developed             has an obvious        application    in this setting,
one that is already suggested             by Alwyn Young’s          (1993)   model with multi-
ple growth rat=. Different countries find themselv= in dfierent equilibria.
Countries in t he high growth, high inv~tment equilibrium attract high lev-
els of foreign investment.             The crucial     policy    steps are those that initiate
the transition      from the low growth to the high growth equilibrium.                       These
issu=    d=erve     a separate treatment          and we do not pursue them here. 10
     As indicated        in the introduction,     there are many strands in the literature
on aggregate models with some form of indeterminacy        or multiplicity of
equilibria. We now review how the model of this paper fits into this extensive
literature.
     One strand (surveyed             in Gu=nerie      and Woodford      1992) focuses on the
possibility of endogenous fluctuations in dynamic economies such as over-
lapping generations models. Another strand has str=sed complementariti=
in the decision making of different agents that arise from externalities or
imperfect competition. These complementarit ies can lead to multiple equi-

libria, sometimes        even to a continuum        of quilibria,    Recent surveys include
Matsuyama        (1995)    and Silvestre     (1993),      Many of these models           do not,
however, explicitly       construct    rational expectations        models with endogenous
fluctuations arising from expectational  indeterminacy.  A new strand, dis-
cussed below, emphasizes the possibility of multiple equilibria in models of
growth.
    our model      is not closely      related to models       derived   from Brock        (1975)
that hinge on the special properti~            of fiat money; nor to models that follow
Calvo (1978) or Cass and Shell (1983) and allow for overlapping                   generations
of agents; nor to models in the tradition of Diamond (1982) that depend
on search externalities in the labor market; nor to models such as Wood-
ford (1991)     that depend      on special     aspects    of imperf=t      competition.          As
macroeconomists,          we are not convinced         that the mechankms        identified       in
th=e   papers are plausible       mechanisms        for generating    expectat ional indeter-
minacy in real economies.    However, as economic theorists, we have been
able to take advantage of the insights that have developed in the exploration
of these models,         To cite just one example,         our analysis of stability          under
learning    builds on results developed         by Hewitt       and McAfee      (1992)        in the
context of a model with search externalities in the labor market,
    In the early literature, our model is most clmely related to two papers.
One, by Andrei       Shleifer    (1986),    examin~       a model    in which innovation           is
motivated     by monopoly       profit.    The second paper, by John Bryant               (1983),
allows for a strong from of complementarily                between a large number of in-
termediate     inputs in production.        Our model can be thought of as an explicit
dynamic      extension    that incorporat~       elements      from both of th~e         models.
More recent work on complementarities   and imperfect competition has been
formulated either using models with unique equilibria with large multipliers,
e.g. Chatterjee    and Cooper         (1993), or models with expectational         indetermi-
nacy, e.g. Chatterjee, Cooper, and Ravikumar (1993). The formal methods
used in these papers are different, but the substantive economic assumptions
are qualitatively the same. We have chosen the latter approach because it
locates the explanation for economic fluctuations squarely on expectations.
    The unexpected discovery that growth models sometimes exhibit various
forms of indeterminacy or multiplicity of equilibria lent new impetus to
work on thee issuw, 11 Like these papers, our model has itS Origins in a

model of long-run        growth,   but there is a fundamental             difference.    Many of
the other approaches           based on models       of growth       generate the underlying
multiplicity y of equilibria     by demonstrating        the existence         of a continuum      of
perfect foresight equilibria. Typically, this is done by linearizing a model
around a single steady state that can be approached along an infinite number
of paths.     In contrast,   our underlying     growth model has strong nonlinearities
result ing in a finite number of distinct            balanced    growth paths with perfect
foresight.
    Models with a continuum             of equilibria   approaching      a single steady state
can offer a novel strategy for justifying the st ickin- of pric= and the power
of monetary policy, If there exists a continuum of equilibrium prices and
quantities,    a natural focal equilibrium        at any point in time is one that mak=
pric= today equal to prices yesterday. (See Farmer 1991, and Beaudry and
Devereux 1993 for models of this type.) However, a potential difficulty with
solutions in the neighborhood  of an indeterminate steady state is that they
may not to be robust under learning. For example, in the simpl=t model
in this genre (the overlapping generations model with money) Lucas (1986)
found that adaptive          learning schemes selected the determinate                rather than
the indeterminate        steady stat e. Evans and Honkapohja                  (1994) confirm    this
lack of robustness for a somewhat more general class of models.
    Another type of indeterminacy in growth models, described in t he survey
by Benhabib    and Gali (1995), r~ults from the prmence of a finite number
of distinct steady states. 12 For some initial value of the state variablm in
these models, there may be a finite number of discrete equilibrium paths,
each of which leads to a distinct             steady state,        In contrast     to our model,
these models       have steady stat=       in levels of per capita income that grow at

(1994), Charnley (1993), Farmer and Guo (1994), Gali (1994),          and Xie (1994).    For general
discussions see Kehoe, Levine and ~mer    (1992), Benhabib            and Rustichini    (1994), and
Benhabib    and Gali (1995).    The emnomic     assumptions     required for local indeterminacy
are in zome cases possibly extreme.   For example, Benhabib and Farmer (1994) and
Fzrmer and Guo (1994) require increasing mzrginal returm to labor. (See S&mitt-Groh6
1995 for a discussion of the assumptions required in vzrious modelz. ) In other cases the
fit with the data is ponr in dimensions we regard as crucizl. For example Gali (1994)
obtains expectational    indeterminaq     only when the procyclicality    of the inv=tment     share
k weak.

the same steady state growth rate or which do not grow at all.
    Our approach        is similar in the sense that we start from an underlying
model with a finite number of distinct              equilibria    rather than a continuum
of equilibria. However, in our case, three distinct equilibria have different
growth rates rather than different steady state levels. Starting from any
initial condition,     faat growth     and slow growth           are possible.      Like Start z
(1994),     we adopt   this approach      because     of empirical     work showing       that a
two-state    model with a high growth and a low growth state givea a reason-
ably good description of the variation              in US economic growth (Hamilton,
1989), Drugeon and Wigniolle (1996)                 have also developed a model of en-
dogenous     growth with Markovian        fluctuations     in growth rates, but they, like
Startz, rely on the assumption          of positive    technological     externalities       which
we have worked hard to avoid.
    To sum up this discussion, at a formal level our model exhibits                    multiple
distinct balanced growth paths,     We show that simple l=rning                        rul= in
this setting can lead to solutions exhibiting expectational indeterminacy,
with economic growth switching stochastically between high and low rates.
The crucial     economic   assumptions        in our growth model are those we regard
aa the most plausible:       fixed cats       in R&D    and complementarities            between
capital goods. These elements yield a model of economic fluct uat ions driven
by self-fufilling shifts in investment expectations, and taking the form we
regard as most plausible:          the strength     of business      confidence     depends     on
short and medium term forecasts of the rate at which future sales and profits
are expected to expand.



5     Conclusions
The fundamental        challenge    for macro=      onomists     is to identify    mechanisms
that can amplify       small shocks to produce         large, coordinated        aggregate    fluc-
tuations.     Some kind of amplification        is necessary,      for if the shocks were as
large as the fluctuations themselvm, they would be obvious for all to see.
The difficulty that economists have had in identifying and agreeing on these
shocks suggests that they are not large and obvious.
    The real businms cycle literature focuses on shocks to the technology.
Existing models generally do not have large multipliers, and no one has been
able to provide      any dir=t     evidence   for technology      shocks with the required



                                               32
amplitude       and persistence,           The absence        of candidate       shocks      is particu-
larly clear in the context            of the Great Depression             of the 1930s.       So far as
we know,       no real businms          cycle theorist       has proposed        that events during
this decade repr~ent Pareto optimal adjustments to exogenous technology
shocks, The alternative new Keyn~ian   position (once known as the Mon-
etarist position)        holds that nominal         prices do not adjust, so that monetary
dist urbanc~         are translated       into real dist urbancm,  13 Ever since Friedman

and Schwartz          published      A Monetary Htitory of the Unitd States (1963),
the evidence         implicating     monetary     disturbance=         during the 1930s has been
the foundation          for a widespread         belief     in the power      of monetary        policy.
Even so, the depression            pos=     a challenge for the sticky-price             interpretation
of economic      fluctuations       that is almost as serious as the one it posm for real
business cycle theorists.           None of the existing explanations              for the stickiness
of prica      seem capable         of explaining      the extraordinary          persistence      of the
downturn experienced during that decade.
   For us, expectational indeterminacy   offers a means to provide                                a pre-
cise, macroeconomic           foundation       for the amplification         of shocks and a way
to explain the persistence            of low growth stat~,            To keep the discussion        spe-
cific, we tr-t        the shocks that initiate the switches              between boom         and bust
as monetary shocks, but nothing in our treatment depends on this inter-
pretat ion, one could equally well assume that the underlying shocks are
shocks to the technology             or external     shocks that impinge           from the rest of
the world.       The key point          is that a model based on expectational                  indeter-
minacy      is consistent     with a variety of interpretations             about the underlying
sources of shocks.
    our formulation          has made several carefully              chosen simplifying        assump-
tions.     In general, a rational expectations              ~uilibrium      in a dynamic       model is
a fixed point in an infinite dimensional                  space,    The equilibrium       we calculate
specifi=     pric=     and quantiti=        for every date t and for every history of real-
izations of the random             policy variable from date O up to date t. Because of
the special structure that we impose on our model, this very difficult infinite
dimensional fixed point problem can be rduced to a relatively tractable sys-
tem with a small number of equations and unknowns, This simplification   is
pmsible because the underlying growth model does not have any transition
dynamics.      In a perfect for=ight          equilibrium,         the dynamic    behavior     at every

date, can be summarized               by a single number, the rate of growth of output.
This number is independent                of the history leading up to this date.               Several
different     perfect     for=ight     equilibria    can be summarized            by a growth        rate
that is specific to each. This very special propetiy arises because a combi-
nation of simplifying msumpt ions. The first is that there is only one state
variable     in the model,       the stock of total capital           Z,     Different    value     of Z
change the effective size of the economy,                  but because the technology           is scale
independent, choices at every date are merely scaled up versions of choic=
at every other date, The second assumption is that output grows linearly
with Z. The third is that utility takes the usual, constant                        elasticity     form,
    Any departure from these assumptions will make it impossible to reduce
the characterization of an equilibrium to a finite set of equations and un-
knowns.       This means that any exploration                  of the theoretical        issues raised
here is very tightly         constrained      by tmhnical       feasibility,    and constrained        in
ways that have important substantive implications.   One of the most im-
portant restrict ions comes on the preference side of the model.  For an
investment      boom      to be self-sustaining,          higher rates of return on investment
must induce a larger quantity               of invmtment.       To achieve this with constant
elasticity preferences u(C) = *     cl–”, we must choose a value of a E (O, 1).
We know from other kinds of evidence that this entire family of preferenc=
cannot simultaneously    give a good description of the intertemporal elastic-
ity substitution        and attitudes      toward risk and that even within this family
a value of a in this range may not be particularly                         plausible.    There are a
variety of plausible         extensions     of the preference       side of the model that can
lead to the requird           r=ult    - that inv~tment         increasm       as a fraction      of out-
put during a boom.            However,       it will be a challenge         to craft a model that
incorporates      t h-e     extensions     and still is tractable.
    The other obvious compromise with tractability in the model comes in a
specification that forces all investment goods to be complements with each
other.      A more realistic         specification    would     allow for clusters       of goods      to
be complements with each other and t hat lets different clusters act as sub-
st itutes. Typewriters, carbon paper, and correction fluid are complements.
So are laser printers,         personal     computers,       and word processors,          These two
clusters of goods         are substitutes      for each other.       In this kind of world,           we
suspect     that the forces we derive from the presence                      of complement        arities
would be even stronger than they are in the current model. What comple-
mentarily does in the model is influence the timing of investment decisions.


                                                     34
The preferred      time to introduce         a good      is when its complementary        goods
are being      introduced.      The intent ive to group these investment               decisions
will be even stronger          if the expected         lifetime of a given cluster     of goods
is likely to be cut short by the introduction of some cluster of substitutes
that will soon replace them. In this direction as well, we believe that there
are natural extensions          of our model,     but they may not lead to the kind of
simple analysis      of expectational       indeterminacy       that we have been able to
conduct.
       Given   the compromises          that are forced      upon   us by our dmire       to be
rigorous and explicit in our analysis, it is not a simple or straightforward
matter to gauge the empirical plausibility of the process we describe. The
correct    place to start, it seems to us, is with the basic pr=umptions                    that
drive everything else. The first is that aggregate investment can increase
sharply in response to perceptions of increased opportunist y. The second
is that the time to invest is precisely when others are investing.  More
structures raise the ret urns to inv=t ment in equipment and furnishings.
Better computer       hardware raises the ret urn on investment             in new computer
software and vice versa.          The time to buy may be precisely            when everyone
else is buying and questions           about standards       have at least temporarily     been
resolvd.
    Evaluating      the evidence        on thee    kinds of interaction     effects and their
influence on the timing of investment decisions may be fairly complicated.
In particular, it may require more disaggregation that is typical for most
typ-      of investment      goods.    The timing issues that a manufacturer            faca   in
upgrading      the hardware and software that run computer                controlled   machine
tools may be at least as complicated as the timing decisions that someone
operating a desktop computer faces in deciding whether to upgrade an op-
erating system,      but nothing        in the aggregate      equipment   invatment      figura
is likely to signal the importance           of this kind of effect.
       The kind of theoretical        exercise undertaken      here do=   not prove anything
about the quantitative importance of complementarily   or market power. All
it can do is demonstrate that it is possible that these effects lead to self-
fulfilling expectational booms and busts. once this is established, we maybe
encouraged to look at the data from a slightly different persp~tive.    When
we do, we may find that there is some basis for this old conjecture                         that
changm in exp=tations            are the major sources of fluctuations           in aggregate
inv=t ment spending.

Since this holds for each intermediate good j we have, by symmetry, that
the provision of intermediate goods is at the same level for all types j and we
denote its common value at time t by zt (j) = zt. It follows that aggregate
output at time t isgiven by

    The mark-up pricing rule impli= that the quantity of each type of in-
termediate good is a function of At, p’ and r. By substitution      it follows
that profits (at the end of period t) for each type of intermediate good are
given by


 mt = Rt~t–(rt+d)p;~t         = (l–~)RtiZt           = QAt=       ((Tt + d)p;)”’(=-l)     , (19)

where ~ = @l/(l–a)(l        – y)~*L.
    To produce    a particular      type of intermediate          good j, a firm must first
incur the cost of inventing         and dwigning       this good.      Recall that the cost
of a new invention       for good      j    is j~ units of investment         goods     Z where
$>0.    Because the firms are monopolistic competitors, at each time t the
quantity of designs is determined by a zero profit condition which states
that the fixed cost of the last design created                 at time t must be just equal
to the present discounted        value of the str=m             of monopoly    rents it offers.
In a perfect foresight equilibrium with balanced growth, the interest rate
is constant and the rquired      zero profit condition for the marginal good
invented at time t (which will have an index j = At) is given by




This expression    for discounted          profits reflects our assumption      that the cost
of inventing a good is incurred at the start of period t but the first profit
is not realized until the end of the period, and hence is discountd  back to
the beginning of the period by a factor (1 + r)- 1, Under the assumption
of balanced    growth,     the rate of growth         of designs At+l /At = gA will be
constant,   Substituting     (19) into this sum giv=

Because we assume that ~ = ~,                  we can cancel A: and sum the series to
obtain the zero profit condition

                     92 = 1 +T – Q(p’)’l/(l-a)             (r+    d)-~1(1-~).                      (20)

    Gras investment is equal to the net increase in Z minus a correction
for the depreciation of physical capital goods, Let q repr=ent the fraction
of Z that is allocated       to physical      capital    goods,    We will derive an expres-
sion for q in what follows.          Production         of general purpose           capital   Z takes
place in a competitive       sector, so that the price of capital               goods in terms of
consumption     is


                         p“=–==x,(~

(Recall   that the function      x(.)    specifid       in (10) giv~       the tradeoff        between
consumption     and Z),
     At any date t,the following           relationship      must hold between             Z, Z, and
A:
                                              At                     Aj+t
                       Zt = ztAt +                 i~di = xtAt + —                                 (21)
                                         /o                      1+~”
Along a balanced      growth path, the output-capital              ratio Y/Z,        the growth rate
of capital,   the inter~t     rate and p’ are constant,             Using (18) to substitute
for xt, one obtains     an expression         for Zt in terms of At:


              Z~ = A:+t


Note that we have defined a function p(R) as a shorthand expr~ion         for
the term in bracm in this equation, Since qt = Atrt/Zt, it follows from (21)
and (22) that
                                                          1
                               q(Rt)=      1- (~+        &;p(Rt)

Thus we can express the price of general purpme                     capital     as

                            p’ =X’      (gZ – 1 +dq(R(r,pz)))          .                          (23)




                                                   38
   Finally, from the above exprmsion                    (22) for Zz it follows that gz = g~+(.
Substituting     in the expression         (20) for gA and using ~ = ~                    we have


                                                           (T+d)
                                                                     –./(1–.)       &     .               (24)
                 9Z =       1 +T –   Q(p’)-l/(1-a)
                        [                                                       1

Together, equations (23) and (24) give an implicit definition of the locus
of pairs (g, r) that are consistent with the zero profit condition.  In the
special case where x is the identity, p’ is a constant that can be taken to
be equal to 1 and equation (24) alone determines                      this locus.        These loci are
the “technology”  curv~ in Figures 2 and 3.
   To complete       the analysis of the perfect for=ight                equilibrium,           it remains
to verify that consumption           and the stock of Z grow at the same rate. Note
first that if we substitute          (18) into (17), this generates                 an expression          for
Yt in terms of At. Using the expression for Z in terms of A from equation
(22), it follows that the ratio of output to total capital is constant along a
balanced growth path:



                                                                                                          (25)



    Next, we solve for the optimal                   pattern   of consumption           by the method
of undetermined  coefficients. We guess that consumption      takes the form
Ct = OZt and solve for 8, Using the first order condition for the consumer’s
maximization      problem,     it follows that


                                       gz =            +7)]+
                                                     [@(l  .                                              (26)

Finally, we note that we can use equation                      (10) to conclude         that

      O(T,pz)= A(R(r,pz))            – x{~(l          + r)] ’/” – 1 + dq(R(r, pz))}.                      (27)

Provided     one can show that gz                < 1 + r, the transversality                  condition     at
infinity for the consumer’s maximization problem will also be satisfied. This
impli= that the conjectured solution for consumption satisfies the sufficient
conditions     for opt imality.



                                                      39
   It remains   for us to specify      the parameters      we used in the calculation
of our numerical    example    and the precise form we selected for the function
x. In the calculation     of the two stable perfect foresight equilibria,          we used
the following parameter values:         a = 0.4,0     = .015, ~ = 4, d = 0.15, @ =
.962, u = 0.21, L = 0.356244889.
   A continuous,      piecewise     linear form ~ underlying       the x function       was
constructed   as follows:     2(O) = O, x’(y)     = PO for Y < VI, X’(V)           = P1 for
V1 < Y < Y2, and X’(Y) = P2 for Y > V2                  The smoothed       function    sets
x(~)=~(y)fory<ul–~l,yl               +~l<y<gz–fiz,andy>uz                              +
82. In the interval (yl – 61, yl + 61] x(y) is the quadratic             which satisfies
X(Y1 – ~1) = ~(Yl – 61), x’(Y1 – 61) = 1’ (Y1 – Al) Similarly, in the interval
(YZ -82, YZ + 62]x(y) is another quadratic satisfying X(Y2 - 62) = 1(Y2 -
62), x’(Y2 – 62) = X’(Y2 – 62).For the numerical example we selected the
values p. = 0.555406, p1 = 1.46523, p2 = 5.06686, yl = 0.0199733, yz =
0.0535351, f51= .001,62 = .0005.
   Finally, we must verify that discounted utility is finite along all feasible
growth paths and that the transversality condition at infinity is satisfied
for the consumer.     To =tablish     both of these results, it is sufficient to show
that the maximum        feasible rate of growth satisfi=    g~j~ < ~      TO do this, we
impose an additional     constraint   on the function x which limits the maximum
feasible rate of growth of Z. Specifically, we assume that x’(y) goes to
infinity for valu= of y above a threshold y~=. In our numerical example,
the high growth rate for Z satisfies the inequality g= < ~ = ~g~ u, so we
know that we can pick a value of y~=         that is strictly larger than the value of
y that obtains in the high growth state. It follows that the imposition              of this
upper bound will not change the value of the perfect foresight equilibria
that we have calculated without imposing this bound, so we are free to
impose   it after the fact without     redoing our numerical       calculations.


A.2      Characterizing             the equilibria          with     expectational
         indeterminacy
Once we introduce       the random     variable   s, both households     and firms face
uncertainty   about the state of the world in the subsequent          period.      We must
therefore introduce     state contingent   prices for output.   Let q(s~, St+l) denote
the price at the end of time t of one unit of output available at the beginning
of period t + 1, contingent on the realimtion of St+l. Thus q(st, St+l) pric=


                                           40
only the uncertainty       associated      with the realization          of St+l,   Formally,        we
~sume    that no clock time claps=           during this interval,        The pricing of goods
over time is associated         with a state contingent             interest   rate r(st)      which
denot~ the sure net l-period interest rate on consumption good loans over
the interval extending from the beginning of period t to the end of period
t, Thus the q’s price only the uncertainty                 and r’s prices only the time lag.
Since one unit of output        in state st at the end of period t necessarily                 is one
unit of output     in either state 1 or 2 at the beginning                 of period     t + 1, we
have the b~ic     arbitrage     formulas

                            q(i,l)     +q(i,2)    = 1 for 2 = 1,2.                               (28)

   We need to restate all of the equations                   for the consumer        and firms in
terms   that    allow for the uncertainty              associated   with s.     We begin        with
the arbitrage    relationship        for firms.    The problem         for the producer        of the
final good  continues to be a static, one period problem, so we can write
Rt(~) = *         J“ust as we did before. This producer considers only the
rental cost Rt of the specialized capital goods that it uses. In contrast,
the firms that produce,         own, and rent out these specialized                 capital    goods
now must worry about capital gains or lmses on their goods that may be
induced by changes in the price of general purpose capital, p’. When the
economy switches to a slow growth equilibrium, the rate of inv=tment falls.
This makes the cost of new capital goods fall, which maka the value of all
existing capital goods fall, We can-price the uncertainty facing the producer
of a specialized type of capital using q(si, St+l) and the price p’. End-of-
period profits    for the firm supplying               the specialized    intermediate        capital
good j are

        [R,(j) (st)zt(j)    + (1 - d)pz(l)zt(j)]q(st,           1) +

        [Rt(~)(st)~t(~)     + (1 - ~)Pz(2)~t(j)19(st,           2) - (1 + ~(st))pz(st)z,(j).

Maximizing      profits then leads to the equation

   R(st) = ~-’     [(1+    r(st))pz(st)     – (1 – d) (pz(l)q(st,        1) +pz(2)q(st,       2))]

for St = 1,2.    As before,     Rt (j) = Rt and Zt (j) = Xt turn out not to depend
                                                  Eyti,
on j and (18) becomes         zt(s~) = LAt

    It is convenient         to introduce          the notation

                   Pz(~t) = Pz(l)9(st,             1) +pz(2)q(st,        2) for st = 1,2                    (29)

for the “expected”           price of capital.          End-of-period        profits are given by


~t = LA; ‘[,.(~)++(%)+

This lads        us to define the profit function                  as


                     m(st, At) = A~~I’(R(st),                    @z(st), r(st), Pz(st)),

Note that the equation                 for the rent al rate can be rewritten

         R(st)    = y-l[(l        + r(st))pz(st)        – (1 – d)@z(st)]          for st = 1,2.             (30)

    The decisions          to introduce           designs are also dynamic               and made under
uncertainty.   It is most convenient to approach the problem in terms of
asset pricing. Let P(st, At ) denote the price of one unit of designs in period
t contingent on the state st and the aggregate quantity of designs At. After
they have been introduced,                 all designs are equivalent,             so we can use a single
price for all of them.            Since each unit of daign              capital yields current profits
m(st, At), we have the arbitrage                   (or zero profit)       condition


                   ‘(s”1)
P(st, At) = I + ~(st) (T(S,, At)+P(l,                       At+l))+     ~qf:(:)      (m(st,At)+P(2,         At+,)).


At every date, the price of a unit of design capital is determined                                by t he cost
of producing the last d=ign,

                                          P(st, At) = Afpz(st).

Writing      g,4 (st, s~+l) = At+ I(st+l)/At (st) for the rate of growth of design
capital and combining             the above equations                  we obtain the equations:

     ~=(z)      =      (I+ ~(i))-l[r(R(i),pz(i),~(i),p”(i))]+                                                   (31)

    We look for a solution in which O and gz are functions of the current
state z of st. The ratio of total investment to inv=t ment in designs is given
by
                         ‘(1 + ~)(Zt/A:+c)(st)                = (1 + ~)p(~(st))>
where p is defined             by equation          (22).     From the preceding              equation      the 4
possible     growth rates ~             = gA (st, St+l) are related to capital growth by

     Turning        to the household,           there are now Euler equations                       for the two
state contingent          assets which          pay one unit of consumption                     at t + 1 in a
specified     state.    For expected        state cent ingent interest rates r’ (st+l ) these
first-order    equations        are

Here II(st, st+l) is the transition probability from state st to s~+l. We will
also use the notation IIij = H(i, j), i, j = 1, 2. The optimal solution for the
household      allows its consumption                to capital ratio to depend on the state St:

                                         (et/zt)(st) = /3(s,).
Combining        th=e     last two equations            yields

                                                            o(j)             a

     Additional        restrictions    on the values of O(Z) come from the product                         trans-
formation function (10) which holds state by state.                                 Thus we have a state-
contingent version of equation (27):

                O(i) = J(R(z)) – X[gz(i) – 1 + dq(R(i))]                            for z = 1,2.                (34)


                                                        43
Finally,    we also have the state contingent                    version of the capital price equa-
tion (23)
                    j’(i)      = X’(gz(i)          – 1 + dq(R(i)))         for i = 1,2,                  (35)

and the rational expatiations                condition

                                      ~(i) = T’(2) for 2 = 1,2.                                          (36)

      The equations         (28), (29), (30), (31), (32), (33), (34), (35) and (36) form a
system of 22 nonlinear quations                     in the 22 unknowns r(i), T’(z), R(i), q(i, j),
O(Z),P’(z), p’(z), gA (i, j), and gz (z).          Th=e characterize an equilibrium with

    ‘.,3   Existence           and        Stability            of Growth             Cycles
For notational     convenience            write ~i = ~(i) and ~~ = r’(i)                  for i = 1,2.    We
now sketch the proof             of the proposition             given in the text and show that
generically     there exist growth cycle                for probabilities           in a neighborhood      of
the identity matrix when there are distinct perfect foresight balanced                              growth
paths. Let r~, TH denote the inter~    rat- for two distinct balanced                               growth
paths.     By assumption         TL   #   TH. Define a new function

            W((T1, T2),
                     (1111,H22))               ,~zz))– (TI,T2),
                              = T((T1, T2), (~11
where we have made the dependence                            of the map ~(. ) on the probabilities
Hll, H22 explicit.           If we introduce           vmtor      notation        ~ =   (T1, T2) and H =
(Hll, H22), we can write the key condition                       of the implicit        function   theorem
s     the requirement        that the matrix DrW,                evaluatd          at that pair of steady
stat=, is nonsingular.
    By inspecting equations               (28), (29), (30), (31), (32), (33), (34), (35) and
(36)1 it is seen that for the first component                     of W we have

                 wl((Tl,T2),(l,n22))= T(rl) –~1                           for   vT1, T2, ~22,            (37)

where T(r)       is given       by equation           (8).      To show this we first note               that
Hll = 1 implia    q(l, 1) = 1. Substituting   q(l, 1) = 1 into the relevant
members of equations (33) yields the preference curve (26). Second, insert-
ing q(l, 1) =     1 and q(l, 2) = O into (29),                    (30),     and (31), and taking         into


                                                       44
account      (32), we obtain the technolo~               curve (24). Finally, it is easily smn
that (35), (29), and (30) yield (23).               A similar argument             can also be made
that W2((r1, r2), (Hll,         1)) = T(~2) – r2 when H22 = 1.
       From the above one can compute

                                                     T’(TL) – 1                0
                 D, W((TL, TH), (1, 1)) =
                                                 (          o          T’(~H)       – 1 )
                                                                                                      (38)


at (rL, TH). Thus, growth cycle exist in a neighborhood                              of (rL, TH) pro-
vided T’(~L) # 1 and T’(~H) # 1.
       Next, we consider        the stability    of an equilibrium           under adaptive      learn-
ing.     Evans     and Honkapohja          (1994)    show that the dynamics                 defined    by
(14) are locally       stable    - i.e.   the trajectory=         starting    from any point          in a
neighborhood  of the equilibrium converge almost surely to the equilibrium
- whenever a condition known as E-stability is satisfied. 14 For Estability
it is required that the eigenvalu= of D. ~, evaluated at quilibrium  growth
cycle, have real parts less than one. By continuity of eigenvalues and (38),
this condition       is met in a neighborhood            of (TL, r~) provided        T’(TL ) <1       and
T’(rH)     <1.    This prove       Proposition      1.
