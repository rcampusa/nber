Inter-Asset Differences in Effective Estste Tax Burdens
James Poterba and Scott Weisbenner
NBER Working Paper No. 9456
January 2003
JEL No. H2

                                             ABSTRACT




        This paper explores the effect of discretion in estate valuation techniques on the effective
estate tax burden on different asset classes. For some assets, such as liquid securities, there is

relatively little discretion in valuation. For other assets, such as partial interests in closely-held
businesses, family limited partnerships, and real assets or collectibles that are traded in thin markets,
estate valuations may be more difficult to establish. Estate tax filers may therefore be able to select

valuations that reduce the reported value of the estate assets, and therefore the effective estate tax
burden. In 1998, estates that invoked the doctrine of "minority discounts" in valuing non-controlling
interests in limited partnerships claimed an average discount of 36 percent for these assets, relative
to their estimated market value. More than half of all limited partnership assets reported on estate

tax returns were valued using this doctrine. This suggests that for a given statutory estate tax rate,
the effective estate tax burden may be greater on assets that are easily valued than on difficult-to-
value assets. A comparison of the mix of assets reported on estate tax returns, and the mix the estate

tax returns would be predicted to hold, given data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, is
consistent with lower relative valuations for difficult-to-value assets.

        Research on the income tax has long recognized differences in the tax treatment of capital income

from different assets, and considered the efficiency and distributional effects of such differences.

Research on the estate tax, in contrast, has typically viewed the tax as applying at an equal effective rate

to all types of assets. While special estate tax provisions for family businesses and for farms, reduce the

effective estate tax burden for these asset classes, the statutory estate tax rate is the same for all other

assets. In practice, however, different assets within an estate may be subject to different effective estate

tax burdens. Such differences are potentially important when assessing the investment and portfolio

allocation effects that are associated with the estate tax.

        Difficult-to-value assets, such as physical assets that are traded in thin markets and partial

interests in businesses whose market value may be reduced by the presence of corporate control concerns,

in many cases face effective estate tax rates that are lower than the statutory rate. The estate tax may

therefore provide incentives for households to accumulate wealth in these forms. Estate tax reduction, in

turn, will have a smaller impact on investment in these assets than on investment in other asset classes.

        In this brief paper, we explain how discretionary valuation and minority discounts can reduce the

effective estate tax rates on some asset classes. We then present some evidence on the potential

significance of these factors by comparing the composition of assets that are reported on estate tax returns

with the composition of assets held by “potential decedents” in a household survey, the Survey of

Consumer Finances. Our empirical findings suggest that real estate and business assets account for a

larger share of household net worth for survey respondents than for decedents. This is consistent with a

lower effective estate tax burden on these assets than on more liquid assets, such as stocks and bonds.

I. Valuation Problems: Appraisal Shopping and Minority Discounts

        The estate tax is levied on the reported value of the decedent’s estate. In some situations, for

example when the decedent’s assets consist only of financial assets with readily-available market values,

the computation of this value is straightforward. When the assets in the estate are difficult to value,

however, the individuals filing the estate tax return may have some discretion in the values that they



                                                                                                               1
report. Consider the problem of valuing a unique piece of art, or a residence that has specialized

attributes such as an appealing location. Different appraisers might value the estate asset differently, and

in such a situation, the estate tax filers will attempt to choose a low but defensible valuation. David

Geltner (1998) estimates that the standard deviation for estimates of appraisals of a given commercial real

estate properties is between five and ten percent. Barry Johnson, Jacob Mikow, and Martha Britton Eller

(2001) provide examples of much wider differences in the valuation of assets reported on estate tax

returns and offered by government witnesses in legal cases. Third party reviewers may have incentives to

select a low valuation, since to do otherwise might expose them to potential suits from the beneficiaries of

the estate. The IRS can challenge an estate valuation – but the burden of proof in showing that the estate

chose an unreasonable valuation is high, discouraging challenge in all but the most flagrant cases. To the

extent that estate tax returns are prepared using “low-end” valuations of difficult to value assets, the

effective estate tax burden on these assets is reduced.

        The difficulties associated with valuation are compounded when the assets in question are

minority shares in closely-held businesses. Consider an enterprise that generates $1 million each year, in

perpetuity, net of business taxes, and assume that the risk-adjusted discount rate that applies to this

business’ cash flows is ten percent per year. Standard valuation methods would value this business at $10

million. However, if a decedent owned only one third of the business, what is the value of this claim?

The simplest answer – $3.33 million – does not capture the fact that a one-third owner of the business

may not be able to prevent majority owners from reducing the value of the enterprise in order to recognize

private gains. This very real concern with the governance of closely-held businesses has given rise to the

“minority discount” doctrine in estate valuation. A key question in this regard, however, is how large a

discount to apply to the assets. Experts disagree on the potential costs of expropriation associated with

minority ownership, and estate tax filers can argue for reduced valuation.

        During the 1990s, the use of minority discounts became more common, and the extent of

discounting also increased. Richard Schmalbeck (2001) explains that the federal tax court held that even

in situations in which the totality of a closely held business was included in the estate, but was distributed


                                                                                                             2
to different family members so that each received a minority stake, it became acceptable to apply a

minority discount to the total value of the business. The court accepted the argument that the value of the

entire entity should be reduced by the lower valuation that was associated with each of the beneficiaries.

Because minority discounts can be applied to family limited partnerships, there has been a growing

tendency to create such ownership structures and to hold a variety of assets within such structures.

Family limited partnerships can even be used to hold liquid securities, which are easily valued, and in

some cases to claim a minority discount even for these assets. State-of-the-art estate planning has come

to rely increasingly on the creation of family limited partnerships.

        The extent to which different types of assets can be valued net of a minority discount creates

potential inter-asset differences in effective estate tax rates. In 1998, 3755 taxable estate tax returns

claimed minority discounts. Table 1 shows the number of returns claiming these discounts on various

types of assets, and the average percentage discount on these assets. The average discount was 25.3

percent. For some asset classes, however, notably ownership interests in limited partnerships and shares

in closely-held businesses, the discount was larger. It was more than one third for limited partnerships.

The fraction of estate tax returns claiming minority discounts also varies substantially across different

asset categories.

        Table 2 presents information on the fraction of estate tax returns with various types of assets that

claim a minority discount. It also shows the fraction of assets in each category that are valued using

minority discounts. Nearly two thirds of the closely-held stock reported on estate tax returns, and more

than half of the assets in limited partnerships, claim such discounts. By comparison, less than three

percent of the publicly traded stock is affected by minority discounts. It is possible that some marketable

financial assets, such as publicly traded stock, are held in limited partnerships. Such assets would

effectively receive a minority discount. Existing data do not enable us to identify the assets inside limited

partnerships.

        The data in Tables 1 and 2 can be combined to assess the impact of minority discounts on estate

tax liability. We view the estate tax liability for a given decedent as TAX = τ(Σ iλi*Vi) where τ( ) is the


                                                                                                               3
statutory estate tax function, λi denotes the ratio of the taxable value and the actual value of assets in

category i, and Vi denotes the market value of assets in category i. The results in the foregoing tables

suggest that roughly 19 percent of limited partnership assets (.363*.528), 20 percent of closely-held

business assets (.298*.656), and 16 percent of farm assets (.20*.79), avoid estate taxation because they

are excluded from the estate tax base via minority discounting. For most other asset classes, the

percentage of total asset value escaping taxation because of minority discounting is less than one percent.

Thus for several asset classes λi is near .80, while for many others it is close to 1.0.

        Table 3 presents information on the use of minority discounts by estates of different sizes. For

each asset type, the table distinguishes assets held in estates with a gross value of more than $2.5 million

from assets held in estates that were smaller than this threshold. The results indicate that minority

discounts are used more frequently by larger estates. For example, 50 percent of the closely-held stock in

gross estates valued at less than $2.5 million received a minority discount, compared with 67 percent of

such stock in estates valued at more than $2.5 million.

II. Disaggregate Evidence of Differential Valuation for Different Asset Classes

        It is difficult to gauge the substantive importance of various estate tax minimization strategies.

There is no historical information, for example, on the use of minority discounts. Moreover, as George

Cooper (1979) emphasized, there are many ways for potential decedents to reduce their estate tax

liability, and changes in the use of one strategy may simply reflect inter-strategy substitution rather than

changes in overall estate tax avoidance.

        To provide some evidence on inter-asset differences in effective estate tax rates, which might be

due to the use of minority discounts, we compare the composition of assets reported on estate tax returns

with the composition of assets in the portfolios of individuals who are similar to the decedents. If a given

asset category is accounts for a smaller share of estate tax wealth than of wealth for wealthy individuals

who might die in near future, we interpret this as evidence of reduced valuation on estate tax returns.




                                                                                                               4
        We follow a procedure developed by Edward Wolff (1996), Poterba (2000), and Poterba and

Weisbenner (2001). We compare estate tax data with data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF).

The SCF is a stratified random sample of households in the United States. It is conducted every three

years, with the most recent publicly-available surveys in 1998, 1995, 1992, and 1989. The survey

includes both a random sample of households, as well as a sample of high-income households, drawn

from areas with a high concentration of high-income tax returns. A sampling weight is assigned to each

household in the survey. The survey can be used to generate population aggregates by summing the

product of household attributes and sampling weights. For example, if Wh is the total net worth reported

by household h, and wh is the sampling weight for household h, we can estimate total household net worth

as Σh wh*Wh.

        In married couples, the first spouse to die can take advantage of the unlimited marital bequest, but

need not do so. This makes it more difficult to assess the prospective estate tax liability of married

couples than of single individuals. To study differences between the portfolio composition of SCF

households and that of decedents, we restrict our analysis to single persons in the SCF. We define qh as

the probability of death during a one-year period, computed using the respondent’s age and the Annuitant

Mortality Table. We then compute the expected value of the total estate-taxable wealth (EW) for the

coming year as EW = Σ qh*wh*IW>600K,h*Wh. The indicator variable IW>600K,h is equal to unity when the

respondent’s net worth is greater than $600,000 ($625,000 in 1998). It indicates that the respondent’s

death would trigger an estate tax filing.

        The expected estate-taxable wealth generated by this algorithm underestimates the amount of

wealth actually reported on estate tax returns. In 1998, EW for single person households in the SCF was

$66.5 billion. The gross estates for tax purposes of single decedents in 1998, on whose behalf estate tax

returns were filed, totaled $103.9 billion, making EW only 64 percent as large. The underestimates in

other years range from 8 percent in 1995 to 31 percent in 1992.




                                                                                                            5
        There are several potential explanations for this understatement. One is that the SCF excludes the

very wealthiest households, a group roughly corresponding to the Forbes 400. The wealth of this group

plays a non-trivial and highly volatile part in generating estate tax revenues. By excluding this group, the

SCF should yield an underestimate of estate tax revenue. A second possibility is that our mortality rates

are too low. We use annuitant mortality rates, which are lower than those for the general population, and

which generally offer a reasonable guide to the mortality rates for the high-net worth population. It is

possible, however, that they understate the actual mortality experience for single high-net worth

individuals. Mortality rates at older ages are higher for single individuals than for those who are married.

        Table 4 presents compares the composition of assets in estate tax filings with those in the SCF. If

Wh,j denotes household h’s wealth holdings in asset category j, our estimate of the share of taxable estates

from the SCF that will be accounted for by asset category j is:

(1)              Asset Share j = (Σ qh*wh*IW>600K,h*Wh,j)/(Σ qh*wh*IW>600K,h*Wh).

The first panel presents our results for all estates, while the lower sub-panels focus on subsets of estates.

        For all taxable estates, we find that in 1998, 37.3 percent of total estate value is accounted for by

common stock. By comparison, 5.7 percent is accounted for by assets in closely-held businesses. Our

expected asset shares based on the SCF data, however, are 28.1 percent for stocks and 14.0 percent for

business equity. Cash, like stock, is more important in the estate tax filings than in the SCF. It accounts

for 36.9 percent of the value of estates, compared with an expected value of 30.2 percent in the SCF.

Both owner occupied housing and other real estate assets, like closely held businesses, account for a

smaller share of the assets on estate tax filings than the SCF-based expectation would suggest.

        The broad patterns that we find are stable across years, although the disparities between the estate

tax filings and the SCF-based estimates appear to have diminished over time. In 1989, for example, the

share of stocks in estate tax wealth was 2.8 times the expected share in the SCF. This share ratio declined

to 1.3 by 1998. The actual and the predicted shares of stock in estate values trend up over the 1989-1998

period, reflecting the rise in equity values during this period. The share of real estate assets, both owner-

occupied homes and other real estate, declines over this period.


                                                                                                                6
        The entries in the two lower panels of Table 4 show that the relationships that we observe for all

estates are more pronounced for the largest estates. The middle panel presents tabulations for estates

valued at between $1 and $5 million, while the lower panel shows estates valued at more than $20

million. There are substantial differences between these two groups, both in the estate tax return asset

mix and in the differences between this and the estimated asset mix from the SCF.

        The share of assets accounted for by businesses is much higher for very large estates than for

more modest ones. While businesses account for 3.2 percent of the assets in estates valued at between $1

and $5 million, they account for 17.6 percent of the assets in estates of $20 million and more. The

difference between the value in estate tax filings, and the value in our SCF-based estimates, is also larger

for the largest estates. In 1998, the share of business assets in estate tax filings was roughly one third of

the SCF-based estimate for the largest estates, while it was one half for the estates valued at between $1

and $5 million. Estates worth more than $20 million also show a higher share of stock than smaller

estates, and a much lower share of owner-occupied housing. The relationship between the SCF-based

asset shares, and the estate tax return shares, varies more from year to year for the largest estates than for

smaller ones, presumably due to the small number of large estates in each year. The difference between

the SCF-based asset share for businesses, and the estate tax share for these assets, is larger in the late

1990s than a decade earlier, possibly because of the increased use of minority discounts.

III. Interpretation

        Our results from the SCF – estate tax filing comparisons are consistent with what we would

predict if minority discounts and other strategies for reduced valuation were used more frequently for

non-marketable assets than for more liquid components of wealth. Our findings could, however, also be

due to other factors. One implicit assumption in our analysis is that decedents do not transform their

portfolios in the months or years before they die, as they might if they fell into poor health and expected

that they would die sometime soon. Such transactions could explain differences between the observed

composition of estates and the composition of the portfolios of those who were still alive. It is also

possible that tax distortions related to the realization-based taxation of capital gains contribute to


                                                                                                                 7
differences between the portfolios we see in estate tax filings, and other portfolios. If taxpayers who

expect to die before too long do not trade assets with large embedded capital gains, this could lead to

differences between the portfolios of decedents and the portfolios of those who remain alive.

        The results suggest that eliminating the estate tax may have a larger impact on the incentive to

invest in marketable assets that are easy to value than on the investment incentives for more specialized

assets or closely-held businesses. Further work should consider the inter-asset distortions that may be

associated with the estate tax. In particular, we are not aware of any research on the efficiency costs of

changes in the ownership structure of assets, such as the creation of family limited partnerships or related

entities. If such entities create governance conflicts, then it is possible that estate tax avoidance through

this channel replaces explicit estate tax payments with other implicit costs borne by estate beneficiaries.
