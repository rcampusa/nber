                                         ABSTRACT

Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), despite its known limitations, continues as the primary
method used for health technology assessment (HTA) both officially (UK, Australia and Canada)
and less formally elsewhere. Standard CEA models compare incremental cost increases to
incremental average gains in health, commonly expressed in Quality-Adjusted Life Years
(QALYs). Our research generalizes earlier CEA models in several ways. First, we introduce risk
aversion in Quality of Life (QoL), which affects willingness to pay (WTP) for health care,
leading to WTP thresholds that rise with illness severity. Ignoring risk aversion in QoL over-
values treatments for minor illnesses and under-values treatments for highly severe illnesses,
perhaps by an order of magnitude. We call our generalized WTP threshold the Risk-Aversion
and Severity-Adjusted WTP (RASA-WTP). Unlike traditional CEA analyses, which discriminate
against persons with disabilities, our analysis implies that the marginal value of improving QoL
rises for disabled individuals. Our model can also value the uncertain benefits of medical
interventions by employing well-established analytic methods from finance. We develop a
certainty-equivalent quality of life measure that we call the Risk-Adjusted QALY (RA-QALY),
which accounts for consumer preferences over risky health outcomes. Finally, we show that
traditional QALYs no longer serve as a single index of health, when consumers are risk-averse.
To address this problem, we derive a generalized single-index of health outcomes—the
Generalized Risk-Adjusted QALY (GRA-QALY). The GRA-QALY reinstates the equivalence
between health gains from quality of life and gains from life extension, even in the presence of
risk-aversion and treatment outcome uncertainty. Earlier models of CEA that abstract from risk-
aversion nest as special cases of our more general model. We discuss new data necessary to
implement our model and standard analytic methods by which the necessary parameters can be
obtained.

       Abstract (287 words)
       Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), despite its known limitations, continues as the
primary method used for health technology assessment (HTA) both officially (UK, Australia and
Canada) and less formally elsewhere. Standard CEA models compare incremental cost increases
to incremental average gains in health, commonly expressed in Quality-Adjusted Life Years
(QALYs). Our research generalizes earlier CEA models in several ways. First, we introduce risk
aversion in Quality of Life (QoL), which affects willingness to pay (WTP) for health care,
leading to WTP thresholds that rise with illness severity. Ignoring risk aversion in QoL over-
values treatments for minor illnesses and under-values treatments for highly severe illnesses,
perhaps by an order of magnitude. We call our generalized WTP threshold the Risk-Aversion
and Severity-Adjusted WTP (RASA-WTP). Unlike traditional CEA analyses, which
discriminate against persons with disabilities, our analysis implies that the marginal value of
improving QoL rises for disabled individuals. Our model can also value the uncertain benefits of
medical interventions by employing well-established analytic methods from finance. We
develop a certainty-equivalent quality of life measure that we call the Risk-Adjusted QALY
(RA-QALY), which accounts for consumer preferences over risky health outcomes. Finally, we
show that traditional QALYs no longer serve as a single index of health, when consumers are
risk-averse. To address this problem, we derive a generalized single-index of health outcomes—
the Generalized Risk-Adjusted QALY (GRA-QALY). The GRA-QALY reinstates the
equivalence between health gains from quality of life and gains from life extension, even in the
presence of risk-aversion and treatment outcome uncertainty. Earlier models of CEA that
abstract from risk-aversion nest as special cases of our more general model. We discuss new data
necessary to implement our model and standard analytic methods by which the necessary
parameters can be obtained.
1. INTRODUCTION
        For decades, economists have studied how consumers trade off mortality risk and money
(Murphy and Topel, 2006; Rosen, 1988). These analyses guide policymakers in addressing
incomplete markets for life-extension investments, e.g., by determining optimal investments in
safer transportation infrastructure or optimal environmental standards. In the healthcare context,
economic theories of mortality risk-reduction help determine how much third-party payers and
social planners should spend on extending life. However, they do not determine how to allocate
resources among competing interventions. The related theory of cost-effectiveness, of roughly
the same vintage as the theory of mortality risk-reduction, addresses these gaps (Weinstein and
Stason, 1977).
        Cost-effectiveness has long been used in Britain, Canada, and Australia to determine
coverage and reimbursement of new medical technologies by health insurers and to evaluate
medical technologies in the US and elsewhere. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review
(ICER), a US nonprofit organization, routinely conducts and releases cost-effectiveness studies
for use by American healthcare payers and providers.1 Nearly 60% of US payers have consulted
cost-effectiveness analyses in their price negotiations or reimbursement decisions (Lising et al.,
2016). In 2018, a large Pharmacy Benefit Manager (CVS Caremark) proposed a health plan that
limits payment for prescription drugs to a maximum of $100,000 per estimated Quality Adjusted
Life Year (QALY) gained.2 Growing reliance on and interest in cost-effectiveness analysis
raises the importance of assuring that CEA methods are robust.
        Innovations in our Model. Standard CEA models assume that consumers are risk-
neutral in health (Garber and Phelps, 1997), which simplifies analyses but risks misrepresenting
true consumer preferences. We introduce risk aversion in Quality of Life (QoL), a generalization
with significant implications for the conduct of CEA. First, this approach shows that a uniform
CEA Willingness to Pay (WTP) threshold should be replaced by thresholds that grow as disease
severity increases. Risk-averse consumers derive greater value from health improvements when
they face bleaker health prospects. Therefore, ignoring risk aversion over-values treatments for
minor illnesses and under-values treatments for highly serious ones. Our empirical calibrations

suggest that mild illness treatment might be over-valued by a factor of two or three, while severe
illness treatment could be under-valued by up to an order of magnitude. Importantly, this
approach also helps mitigate the discrimination against disabled persons that is embedded in
current CEA methods. The Affordable Care Act forbids use of CEA methods in Medicare and
PCORI that so discriminate.
       Second, we incorporate random health endowments in future periods, thereby allowing
both ex ante perspectives for formulating health insurance coverage decisions and ex post
analyses for patients with realized medical disorders to select specific therapies.
       Third, our approach expands the valuation of medical care to account for the variability
in treatment outcomes, just as the world of finance has understood the importance of variability
for nearly three quarters of a century. We connect measures of uncertainty in treatment
outcomes to standard parameters measuring risk attitudes to quantify the importance of
uncertainty.
       Fourth, introducing risk aversion in QoL breaks the traditional equivalence between
health gains in life years (LY) and QoL, central to current models. Without that equivalence,
researchers can no longer conclude that “a QALY is a QALY.” To rebuild a tractable framework
for decision making, we develop a generalized single index of value (the Generalized Risk-
Adjusted Quality Adjusted Life Year, or GRA-QALY) that restores the equivalence between
health gains in LY and QoL.
       Uncertainty is increasingly salient with the rise of personalized and targeted therapies and
the value of “companion diagnostics” that help predict when a given technology will or will not
assist any specific patient. Technologies (including diagnostic tests) that reduce variances of
health outcomes generate value to risk-averse consumers, even if average outcomes remain fixed
(Lakdawalla et al., 2017). Further, technologies that increase variance may still have incremental
value to risk-averse consumers if they sufficiently increase the positive skewness in distributions
of variable health outcomes (Eeckhoudt et al., 1995)— e.g., the “value of hope” exhibited by
cancer patients (Lakdawalla et al., 2012).
       A recent economic task force report called for methods to monetize the values of risk
reduction and of hope, and the influence of illness severity in value assessment (Garrison et al.,
2020; Lakdawalla et al., 2018). Our approach provides direct solutions to all three of these
issues using standard expected-utility maximization methods.


       2
       The Relevance of Uncertainty. A wide variety of diseases exhibit variable treatment
responses (Alatorre et al., 2011), including highly prevalent diseases like depression (Carter et
al., 2012), rheumatoid arthritis (Goetz et al., 2011), diabetes (Cantrell et al., 2010), and cancer
(Yu and Cui, 2018). While continued progress in diagnostics might eventually improve the
ability to forecast which patients will respond to particular treatments, there remains a
considerable amount of variability in treatment response that is unknown before treatments
begin. Until accurate forecasting of treatment success is ubiquitous, value assessment methods
should incorporate practical strategies for quantifying effects of uncertainty.
       Multi-dimensional Value. Health outcomes may have multiple dimensions of value.
For example, the widely used European Quality of Life (EQ-5) measure has five dimensions.
The Health Utility Index 3 (HUI3) captures 8 dimensions: vision, hearing, speech, ambulation,
dexterity, emotion, cognition, and pain (Maxwell et al., 2016). Judging from the frequency of
Direct to Consumer advertisements on TV and elsewhere, one might readily add dimensions
such as “physical appearance” and “sexual function.” Whatever the total number of elements,
our model presumes a scalar measure of QoL, which could (for example) use multi-criteria
decision analysis (MCDA) methods to combine vectors of quality measures into scalars, along
with associated variances, skewness, and other higher-order moments from the distributions of
these combined measures.
       Limitations. Our approach assesses the effects of risk aversion in QoL and uncertainty
in treatment outcomes for a representative utility-maximizing consumer. Since our work
generalizes traditional CEA, it (like traditional CEA) cannot resolve issues arising in some public
policy decisions that involve inter-personal comparisons (equity and fairness) (Asaria et al.,
2015), nor can it address issues such as externalities arising from scientific spillovers, contagious
disease spread or herd immunity against infectious diseases. Nevertheless, we believe that a full
understanding of the effect of risk aversion in QoL and uncertainty in the benefits of medical
interventions can improve decision-making at all levels, just as traditional CEA has informed
numerous private and public policy decisions.

2. THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT
    2.1. Reviewing the Foundations of Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
        We begin with the familiar theoretical framework for cost-effectiveness analysis of
Garber and Phelps (1997), hereafter GP. Consider a representative consumer choosing
consumption and medical spending over two periods.3 Define 𝑌 as exogenous income that
arrives each period. Define 𝑀𝑖 as composite medical spending in period 𝑖, and 𝐶𝑖 ≡ 𝑌 − 𝑀𝑖 as
non-medical consumption in period 𝑖. Define 𝐻𝑖 ∈ [0,1] as QoL in period 𝑖. Period i utility is
given by 𝑈(𝐶𝑖 )𝐻𝑖 , and the probability of survival to period 1 is 𝑝1. Expected utility is
𝑈(𝐶0 )𝐻0 + 𝑝1 𝑈(𝐶1 )𝐻1. Note the key assumption that utility is linear in QoL.
        In GP, the optimal cost-effectiveness threshold is given by:4
                                                      𝑈(𝐶 )    1
                                                𝐾 ≡ 𝑈 ′ (𝐶1 ) [𝐻 ]                                          (1)
                                                          0    0


        𝐾 reflects the value of future QoL gains paid for today, measured as consumption
willingly foregone in exchange for one unit of QoL. GP sets baseline QoL to unity, in the sense
that 𝐻0 ≡ 1. Cost-effectiveness is measured from the perspective of a consumer with “perfect”
or “excellent” baseline health. We start by following this convention and generalize it later (in
Section 3.3.2) to allow for the possibility that 𝐻0 < 1. As things stand, 𝐾 is the WTP for one
QALY.
        𝐻1 reflects the health status of patients when they need treatment. We assume that 𝐻1
incorporates the effects of the illness in question and, possibly, other unrelated disabilities or
illnesses. For example, physically disabled patients with diabetes would have lower values of 𝐻1
than patients with identical diabetes status but no physical disabilities.
        If individuals choose medical spending optimally, then 𝐾 represents the cost-
effectiveness ratio that leads to the first-best allocation of medical consumption. If instead the
individual faces an arbitrarily fixed budget – e.g., fixed by a government payer – then the
resulting 𝐾 produces suboptimal allocations, but they are second-best optimal conditional on the
chosen budgetary level (Phelps, 2019b).



        3
         GP use three-periods, but in our setting, the final period adds no insight.
        4
         GP omit 𝐻0 in their formulation because they set 𝐻0 = 1. They also use 𝑈(𝑌) instead of 𝑈(𝐶1 ) in the
numerator. When 𝑈(𝑌) = ln⁡(𝑌), 𝐾 differs proportionately from our definition by the budget share of medical care.

        4
       For technologies that add Δ𝑝1 in survival probability and Δ𝐻1 in QoL, QALY gains are
defined as Δ𝑄𝐴𝐿𝑌 ≡ Δ𝑝1 𝐻1 + 𝑝1 Δ𝐻1. GP prove the legitimacy of guiding decisions by
comparing costs per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) to 𝐾. In addition, their framework
implies that the value of a technology equals the value of QALYs gained through it. This is a
non-trivial result, because health has two dimensions—QoL and LY – and they distill its value
into one dimension, namely the QALY improvement.
       The QALY as a single index of health improvement rests crucially on the assumption that
marginal utility equals average utility in both QoL and LY. Elaborating, consider a
representative consumer’s willingness to increase annual health insurance premiums by the
expected cost of a new medical technology. The marginal utility of QoL⁡is 𝑈(𝐶1 ), and WTP for
                                                                             𝑈(𝐶 )
this QoL gain in terms of baseline consumption (𝐶0 ) units is 𝐾 = 𝑈 ′ (𝐶1 ). Therefore, the period
                                                                                0

zero WTP for an expected QoL gain of 𝑝1 Δ𝐻1 is 𝐾𝑝1 Δ𝐻1 . Since 𝑝1 Δ𝐻1 is the QALY gain
associated with Δ𝐻1 additional QoL units, it follows that 𝐾 yields the value per QALY gained
via QoL improvement. At the same time, the period zero WTP for a marginal gain in survival
                       𝑈(𝐶1 )𝐻1
probability, Δ𝑝1, is              Δ𝑝1   = 𝐾Δ𝑝1 𝐻1 . Since Δ𝑝1 𝐻1 is the QALY gain associated with this
                        𝑈 ′ (𝐶0 )

gain in LY, it follows that 𝐾 measures value per QALY gained regardless of whether it is gained
via life-extension or QoL improvement.
       This implication holds because, under utility that is linear in QoL, the marginal rate of
                                                                  𝑈(𝐶1 )𝐻1
substitution between QoL and survival gains happens to be                    = 𝐻1 . To appreciate the
                                                                   𝑈(𝐶1 )

importance of this condition, recall that the QALY gain is defined as 𝑝1 Δ𝐻 + Δ𝑝1 𝐻1. The two
terms in this QALY formula compactly express the value of a two-dimensional gain in health in
the common units of QoL improvement. The first term is literally the expected gain in QoL
units. The second is the gain in survival multiplied by the marginal rate of substitution; this
product equals the expected QoL units the consumer will give up in return for Δ𝑝1 more survival
probability.
       This result produces strong decision-analytic implications. Consider a technology that
increases survival probability by Δ𝑝1, QoL by Δ𝐻1, and incremental costs by Δ𝐶0 . Based on the
arguments above, the net value of such a technology is 𝐾Δ𝑝1 𝐻1 + 𝐾𝑝1 Δ𝐻1 − Δ𝐶0. It improves
consumer welfare if and only if:



       5
                                              Δ𝐶0
                                                          ≤𝐾                                   (2)
                                         Δ𝑝1 𝐻1 +𝑝1 Δ𝐻1


         This proves—in the risk-neutral world of GP—that the cost per QALY gained, regardless
of how the QALY was gained, represents a sufficient index of welfare when compared to the
threshold 𝐾.
         This “QALY is a QALY” conclusion serves as a fundamental result in CEA
methodology. However, it rests somewhat precariously on the assumption that expected utility is
linear—not concave—in QoL, or equivalently that consumers are risk-neutral in QoL. While
linearity of expected utility in QoL provides strong and helpful implications, it also places the
cost-effectiveness literature out of step with the foundational literature on health production and
health human capital within health economics (Ehrlich and Chuma, 1990; Galama and Kapteyn,
2011; Grossman, 1972; Muurinen, 1982). In this respect, the cost-effectiveness literature on
valuing health investment is incompatible with the economics literature that explains those health
investment decisions. Other well-known studies assuming concavity in health-related QoL
include Arrow’s (1976) work on health insurance benefit design, Cutler et al’s (1998) study of
medical care price indices, and Hall and Jones (2007) on the macroeconomic determinants of
medical spending. From an empirical standpoint, linearity of utility in QoL is also hard to
reconcile with survey-based studies finding preferences for treating more severe diseases,
holding cost-effectiveness fixed (Green and Gerard, 2009; Linley and Hughes, 2013; Nord et al.,
1995).




         6
                Figure 1: Indifference curves for constant and diminishing marginal utility of QoL.




       Figure 1 illustrates the challenges that linear QoL utility poses to intuition. In Figure 1a,
utility is concave in QoL, while in Figure 1b, it is linear. Starting in Figure 1a, from point A on
indifference curve 𝑈1 , a fixed health gain of Δ𝑄𝑜𝐿⁡puts the consumer on indifference curve 𝑈2 .
The vertical distance 𝑊𝑇𝑃1 — the compensating variation—returns the consumer to 𝑈1 and
measures (in LY) the value of this QoL gain. The same exercise conducted at point B (starting at
a lower QoL) gives 𝑊𝑇𝑃2 . Because of diminishing marginal utility of QoL, 𝑊𝑇𝑃2 > 𝑊𝑇𝑃1 for
the same Δ𝑄𝑜𝐿.
       In contrast, Figure 1b illustrates preferences when utility is linear in both LY and QoL, as
GP assume. In this case, LY and QoL are perfect substitutes (hence the conclusion that “a
QALY is a QALY”), and thus indifference curves are straight lines. Thus, WTP for
improvement in QoL is the same for all values of QoL.
       The familiar curvature in Figure 1a reflects the preference for variety that
microeconomists typically assume. Equating apples and oranges, consumers endowed with 10
oranges and 1 apple are more eager to trade an orange for an apple, than when endowed with a
balanced bundle of fruit.
       The preference for variety in health bundles is similarly intuitive. Imagine Consumer A,
with nearly perfect QoL, but with only 6 months left to live. Consumer B has 5 years to live, but
at QoL level 0.1. The linear indifference curves of GP imply that these two consumers have
identical willingness to trade away longevity in exchange for QoL. However, introspection


       7
suggests that Consumer B—blessed with significantly greater longevity but hampered by very
low QoL—will have much greater interest in making such a trade. The survey-based evidence
cited earlier suggests that most real-world respondents agree, in the sense that health
improvements are viewed as more valuable for the severely ill (Green and Gerard, 2009; Linley
and Hughes, 2013; Nord et al., 1995).
         In light of our discussion about concavity in QoL, readers might wonder why we still
maintain that expected utility is linear in survival probabilities. Our reasoning corresponds to
that of the QoL case: The vast majority of the theoretical literature in health economics, and
indeed economics more generally, assumes that expected utility is additively separable across
periods of time and thus linear in survival probability. This applies to the health human capital
literature spawned by Grossman (1972), the CEA analysis of GP (Garber and Phelps, 1997),
theoretical cost-effectiveness papers by Meltzer (Meltzer, 1997; Meltzer and Smith, 2011), and
the value of statistical life literature following Rosen (1981, 1988).
         Formal justification for additive time-separability in economics generally traces back to
Koopmans (1972), who shows how additive time separability follows from two relatively
intuitive axioms.5 While the intellectual history is useful and interesting, it is not our goal to
mount a renewed defense of additively separable utility over time. We merely follow the bulk of
the economics literature in this respect.6 In any event, our key observations about the fragility of
QALYs would carry through even if utility were concave in survival, as long as the concavity in
QoL differed meaningfully from concavity for survival.
         Concavity of utility in QoL undermines the traditional equivalence between survival
gains and QoL gains, and it simultaneously undermines the rationale for use of the QALY as a
single index of health improvements. We will propose a solution and use it to build a framework
that properly values health gains when individuals are risk averse in QoL, and when treatment
benefits are uncertain.




         5
            Bleichrodt et al. (2008) provide intuitive explanations for the two Koopmans axioms: 1) the marginal rate
of substitution between today and tomorrow is unaffected by consumption levels on the day after tomorrow and
beyond; and 2) if consumers prefer the consumption sequence 𝑥 to the sequence 𝑦, they will harbor the same
preferences if those sequences started tomorrow and we hold their consumption level today fixed.
          6
            For analysis departing from this tradition, see Córdoba and Ripoll (2016).

         8
    2.2. Incorporating Risk-Aversion and Uncertainty
         GP abstracted from health risk in three ways. We relax all three of these restrictions and
explore their implications for value assessment.
         First, we first define utility as 𝑉(𝐶, 𝐻) = 𝑈(𝐶)𝑊(𝐻) and we allow 𝑊 to exhibit
concavity and thus risk-aversion. While we could use an even more general form of utility,
additional interaction terms between 𝐶 and 𝐻 bring little insight into our central issue and further
complicate presentation of our model.
         Second, to introduce uncertainty over untreated health state, we assume that consumers
are either sick (with probability 𝜙) or well (with probability (1 − 𝜙)) in period 1, with
corresponding QoL levels of 𝐻1𝑠 and 𝐻1𝑤 , respectively. This allows consideration of value from
an ex ante perspective, as when considering health insurance benefit structure. One can return to
the deterministic valuation framework of traditional CEA modeling simply by setting 𝜙 = 1, and
a fully deterministic framework by setting 𝑝1 = 1.
         Third, we introduce uncertainty in outcomes of medical treatments and consider the
expected utility of QoL, 𝐸[𝑊(𝐻)]. This is analogous to introducing uncertainty in financial
transactions, a common practice in economic evaluations involving risky assets or income
streams. We assume non-medical consumption is equal across the healthy and sick states in
period 1, to avoid randomness in 𝑈(𝐶1 ).7
         As we will show, introduction of risk aversion in QoL has two distinct effects on Health
Technology Assessment (HTA). First, it affects the WTP for health gains, both by introducing
diminishing marginal utility in health and by highlighting that marginal values of health gains
rise with illness severity and/or permanent disability. Second, it provides a way to incorporate
variability in treatment outcomes that has been ignored in standard HTA practices.
         Valuation of risk-reduction in economics and finance began with Markowitz (1952), Pratt
(1964) and Arrow (1965). These early studies led to the now-classic “mean-variance” tradeoff in


         7
            In other words, we assume consumers can purchase insurance against healthcare expenditures, but cannot
purchase pure health indemnity insurance that enables transfer of consumption across health states. Such insurance
would require perfect identification of health states to avoid fraudulent claims against the insurer, a technology that
does not currently exist except in the imaginings of Star Trek “tricorders.” Therefore, it sacrifices little salience, but
conserves notation, if we eliminate markets for pure consumption insurance. Some firms do offer modest quantities
of “critical illness insurance,” which provides income transfers for a set of precisely defined diagnoses, including
cancers, accidents, and heart attacks, but this set omits major portions of the potential illness spectrum. Indeed, the
fact that consumers still seek to prevent illness provides prima facie evidence that financial markets are not
completely insuring them against illness risk (Lakdawalla et al., 2017).

financial economics, extended by Kimball (1990) to include higher-order risk attitudes. From
this background, we develop a framework that incorporates mean, variance, skewness, and (if
desired) kurtosis into the valuation of stochastic health improvements. While we focus on cost-
effectiveness analysis in healthcare, these methods could potentially apply to other human capital
investments, e.g., vehicle safety and environmental quality.
         Define 𝑝1𝑇 and 𝑝1𝑁𝑇 as the probability of survival with and without treatment. Since
expected utility is additively separable over time, it is also linear in survival. As a result, there is
no need to consider the distribution of survival improvements; average improvements are
sufficient.8 Therefore, expected utility with treatment (T) is:

         𝐸[𝑉(𝐶, 𝐻) 𝑇 ] = ⁡𝑈(𝐶0 )𝑊(𝐻0 ) + 𝑝1T 𝑈(𝐶1 ){𝜙𝐸[𝑊(𝐻1𝑠 + 𝐵)] + (1 − 𝜙)𝑊(𝐻1𝑤 )} (3)

         Similarly, expected utility with no treatment (NT) is:

             𝐸[𝑉(𝐶, 𝐻)𝑁𝑇 ] = ⁡𝑈(𝐶0 )𝑊(𝐻0 ) + 𝑝1NT 𝑈(𝐶1 ){𝜙𝐸[𝑊(𝐻1𝑠 )] + (1 − 𝜙)𝑊(𝐻1𝑤 )}                             (4)

         The difference between these two measures gives the expected incremental value of
treatment 𝑇. As previously noted, traditional ex post evaluation perspectives coincide with the
special case of ⁡𝜙 = 1.
         Before proceeding to value assessment, it helps to define and discuss consumer risk
preferences, which play substantial roles in valuation of risky technologies. Define the
                                                                   𝑊 ′′ (𝜇 )
coefficient of relative risk-aversion in QoL as 𝑟𝐻∗ ≡ − 𝑊 ′ (𝜇 𝐻) 𝜇𝐻 . To the best of our knowledge,
                                                                         𝐻

there are no extant empirical estimates of relative risk-aversion over QoL, a gap in the literature
that could fruitfully be addressed.9 Lacking direct estimates of health-related risk preferences,
we suggest the interim approach of assuming that relative risk parameters are similar for both
QoL and consumption, and conducting sensitivity analyses around this baseline.
                                                                                                     𝑊 ′′′ (𝜇 )
         Following Kimball (1990), we also define “relative prudence” as 𝜋𝐻∗ ≡ − 𝑊 ′′ (𝜇 𝐻) 𝜇𝐻 .
                                                                                                           𝐻

Consumers with greater prudence are more likely to invest additional resources in QoL today in



         8
            We leave to future research the questions of whether and how health technology assessment ought to
depart from the conventional assumption of additively time-separable utility and the implied risk-neutrality over
survival.
          9
            Córdoba and Ripoll (2016) estimate a lifetime expected utility model that separates intertemporal
substitution (the inverse of the coefficient of relative risk-aversion) and a “mortality aversion,” which differs from
risk aversion over QoL, as our model requires.

anticipation of future QoL risks (e.g., more vaccines), or changes in lifestyle that affect health
risks (e.g., smoking cessation). Box A further discusses these higher-order risk terms.
                                                [BOX A GOES HERE]
        Consistent with much of the applied literature in public economics, we treat 𝑟𝐻∗ ⁡and⁡𝜋𝐻∗ as
roughly constant empirically (Chetty, 2006; Noussair et al., 2013). The evidence supports this
assumption directly in the case of risk-aversion over consumption, but future research must
quantify relative risk preferences over QoL empirically. Our task is to explain how to value
medical technology for consumers who are risk averse in QoL.
        2.2.1. Quality of Life (QoL) Gains
        We begin by focusing on the QoL gains produced by the technology, 𝑇. Therefore,
assume that 𝑝1𝑇 = 𝑝1𝑁𝑇 = 𝑝1 for the moment, and compute the difference in utility between (3)
and (4). To monetize this utility difference, we normalize by the marginal utility of baseline
period consumption, 𝑈 ′ (𝐶0 ) ∗ 𝑊(𝐻0 ).
        Suppose that 𝐻1𝑠 is a random variable measuring the untreated QoL level of a sick patient
in period 1. Next, consider a treatment that produces a random QoL benefit (𝐵) for patients in
the sick state. 𝐻1𝑠 and 𝐵 have means 𝜇𝐻 and 𝜇𝐵 , variances 𝜎𝐻2 and 𝜎𝐵2 , and Pearson skewness
                     𝐸(𝐻−𝜇𝐻 )3               𝐸(𝐵−𝜇𝐵 )3                      2
coefficients 𝛾𝐻 ≡         3       and 𝛾𝐵 ≡       3       . Finally, define 𝜎𝐻+𝐵 and 𝛾𝑆+𝐵 as variance and
                         𝜎𝐻                     𝜎𝐵

skewness coefficients of 𝐻 + 𝐵, the QoL in the treated state. For easy reference, Box B
summarizes the relevant parameter definitions.
                                                     Box B about here.
        We now have:
                          𝑈(𝐶 ) 𝑝1 𝜙𝐸[𝑊(𝐻1𝑠 +𝐵)−𝑊(𝐻1𝑠 )]                     [𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑⁡𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦⁡𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛⁡𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚⁡𝑇]

        Using Taylor series methods10 to expand 𝐸[𝑊(𝐻1𝑠 + 𝐵)] and 𝐸[𝑊(𝐻1𝑠 )] around 𝜇𝐻 and
taking their difference gives:11

          Note that the term outside the curly braces in Equation (7) has 𝑊 ′ (𝜇𝐻 ) in the numerator
and⁡𝑊(𝐻0 ) in the denominator—evaluated at different levels of QoL. We return to this issue in
Section 3.1.1.
                                                              2
          Equation (7) contains two new expressions: Δ𝜎 2 ≡ (𝜎𝐻+𝐵⁡ − 𝜎𝐻2 ) and Δ(𝛾𝜎 3 ) ≡
       3
(𝛾𝐻+𝐵 𝜎𝐻+𝐵 − 𝛾𝐻 𝜎𝐻3 ). These expressions (respectively) reflect the difference in variances
between treated and control populations, and the difference in the comparable values of
Pearson’s skewness (𝛾) times 𝜎 3 in treated and control populations.13 As we discuss later, these
parameters are readily estimated in standard Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) and in
comparable non-randomized comparisons of treatments and control therapies (either “no
treatment” or “standard of care” as appropriate).
          Several things become apparent from this formulation. First, when treatment effects (𝜇𝐵 )
are large, the stochastic terms become relatively less important in overall incremental valuation
of medical interventions. Conversely, as average treatment gains become smaller, the stochastic
terms rise in importance. Over time, we expect stochastic terms to become steadily more
important, since the general progress of research will typically have already found any easy and
large gains in average treatment efficacy (Jones, 2009). Low-hanging fruit is usually picked




          12
             Appendix 7.2 discusses convergence properties of these Taylor Series estimates. In general, convergence
should be relatively rapid for 𝜇𝐻 > .2⁡to⁡.3. Even for most people with fatal disease diagnoses and only a few
months to live, 𝜇𝐻 will generally exceed these levels.

          12
first. In parallel, from equation (7), given our standard assumption that relative risk parameters
are approximately constant, we can see that the stochastic terms grow in importance as 𝜇𝐻 falls.14
           Our framework incorporates two kinds of generalizations: 1) Diminishing marginal
utility to QoL gains; and 2) stochastic gains in health. We next explore the independent effects
of these phenomena on the value of QoL improvement.
           The Consequences of Diminishing Marginal Utility of W

           To focus on the implications of diminishing marginal utility alone, assume for the
moment that QoL levels and improvements are entirely non-stochastic. Conditional on survival,
the individual becomes sick with probability 𝜙 = 1. Treatment benefits are also known, so that
𝜎 = 0. Equation (7) then implies that the value of non-stochastic QoL improvements is 𝑉(𝐵) ≈
     𝑊 ′ (𝜇𝐻 )
𝐾              𝑝 𝜇 ,   not simply 𝐾𝑝1 𝜇𝐵 . The difference is due entirely to concavity in 𝑊, since it
     𝑊(𝐻0 ) 1 𝐵

persists even when health is deterministic.
           To explore the difference further, define two terms, first the elasticity of 𝑊 with respect
                𝑊 ′ (𝐻0 )𝐻0                    𝑊 ′ (𝐻0 )                                      𝑊 ′ (𝜇𝐻 )
to H, 𝜔𝐻 ≡                  ,⁡which   equals               when 𝐻0 = 1. Next, define 𝑅 ≡                ,   the “severity
                 𝑊(𝐻0 )                        𝑊(𝐻0 )                                         𝑊 ′ (𝐻0 )

ratio,” reflecting how severity of illness alters the marginal utility of QoL relative to baseline
health 𝐻0 . Given these definitions, 𝑉(𝐵) = 𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅𝑝1 𝜇𝐵 . In GP, the marginal value per unit of
expected QoL improvement equals 𝐾. With concavity in 𝑊(𝐻), this generalizes to 𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅.
Thus—as a result of introducing risk aversion over QoL—the WTP threshold 𝐾 of GP is
adjusted by two multiplicative factors, 𝜔𝐻 and 𝑅. Diminishing marginal utility of 𝐻 implies 0 <
𝜔𝐻 < 1 and 𝑅 > 1, where 𝑅 grows for more severe illnesses. In GP, on the other hand, both
𝜔𝐻 ⁡and⁡𝑅⁡equal 1.0 as a result of utility’s linearity in QoL. In subsequent sections, we calibrate
𝜔𝐻 and 𝑅, and we discuss their operational significance for HTA.
           Our WTP threshold can be expressed as:

                                                                𝑈(𝐶 ) 𝑊 ′ (𝜇𝐻 )
                                                  𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅 = 𝑈 ′ (𝐶0 )                                                  (8)
                                                                   0 𝑊(𝐻0 )




           14
              Alternatively, if we were to assume that absolute (instead of relative) risk parameters were constant, this
1                                  1
     effect would vanish, but the    effect remains. While we currently have no evidence on how risk parameters in
𝜇𝐻                                𝜇𝐵
health behave over different levels of H, the vast bulk of data regarding consumption (C) suggest that constant
relative risk parameters are much closer to reality than constant absolute risk parameters. For example, for CRRA,
𝜋 ∗ = 𝑟 ∗ + 1, whereas with CARA, 𝜋 ∗ = 𝑟 ∗ . Estimates generally show that 𝜋 ∗ ≈ 𝑟𝐻∗ + 1, suggesting that CRRA
approximately applies (Noussair et al., 2013).

           13
       For more severe illnesses, as 𝜇𝐻 falls, 𝑊 ′ (𝜇𝐻 ) rises, and thus 𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅 rises. Therefore,
WTP for QoL improvements is higher for patients with disabilities and/or more severe illnesses.
This finding resolves a long-standing question in CEA, posed most recently by the ISPOR Task
Force on economic evaluation of medical technologies (Lakdawalla et al., 2018): “Does
untreated health status affect the value of health gains?” By introducing risk aversion over QoL,
we demonstrate that the answer is unequivocally “yes.” 𝑅 and hence 𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅 rise as untreated
QoL worsens. Later, we will show that 𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅 functions as the cost-effectiveness threshold,
analogous to the role of 𝐾 in GP. Therefore, 𝑅 also captures the effect of illness severity on the
proper cost-effectiveness threshold.
       The Consequences of Uncertain Treatment Outcomes

       To address how stochastic QoL modifies values of QoL improvements, we turn to the
portion of equation (7) in curly braces and define:

                             1     1     1            1       1    2
                 𝜖 ≡ {1 + [𝜇 ][− 2 𝑟𝐻∗ (⁡𝜇 ) 𝛥𝜎 2 + 6 𝜋𝐻∗ 𝑟𝐻∗ (⁡𝜇 ) 𝛥(𝛾𝜎 3 ) + ⋯ ]}           (9)
                             𝐵            𝐻                    𝐻


       In Equation (7), expected QoL gains are 𝑝1 𝜙𝜇𝐵 . Therefore:

                                   𝐸(𝑉(𝐵)) = [𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅][𝑝1 𝜙𝜇𝐵 𝜖]                               (10)

       We describe [𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅] as the Risk-Aversion and Severity Adjusted Willingness to Pay
(RASA-WTP), and [𝑝1 𝜙𝜇𝐵 𝜖] as the Risk-Adjusted QALY (RA-QALY). The former affects the
value per unit of health gain, and the latter represents the “certainty-equivalent” amount of QoL
gained from a medical treatment. Thus

                                 𝐸(𝑉(𝐵)) = RASA-WTP ∗ RA-QALY                                (11)

This generalizes the traditional value measure, which states that 𝐸(𝑉(𝐵)) = 𝐾 ∗ 𝑄𝐴𝐿𝑌.
       Note that 𝜇𝐵 𝜖 yields the “certainty-equivalent” gain in QoL associated with the medical
technology. That is, a technology that produces 𝜇𝐵 𝜖 units of QoL with certainty is equal in value
to the technology producing the stochastic gain, 𝐵, with average gain, 𝜇𝐵 . The term, 𝜖, measures
the certainty-equivalent QoL units the consumer requires in exchange for each additional unit of
average QoL gain. For this reason, we call 𝜖 the “certainty-equivalence ratio.”
       Among its other functions, 𝜖 quantifies the importance of stochastic terms in value
assessment. With entirely deterministic QoL, 𝜖 = 1. Analogously, when 𝜖 ≈ 1, the stochastic


       14
terms are easily ignored, and average QoL gains are largely sufficient metrics of benefit. As 𝜖
departs from unity, in either direction, the stochastic terms become relatively more important.
       Variance and skewness have opposing effects on 𝜖. Increases in variance reduce
                                                                                       2
expected utility, and vice-versa. If a treatment increases the variance of QoL (i.e., 𝜎𝐻+𝐵 > 𝜎𝐻2 ),
any given average gain in QoL will be worth less. For sufficiently small 𝜇𝐵 ⁡ and increase in
variance, 𝜖 might even become negative, so that positive average gains in QoL could in fact be
costly, when considering expansions in variance. In contrast, treatments that reduce variance
augment the value of the average QoL improvement. The latter gives an example of “insurance
value” from medical technology by reducing the uncertainty surrounding health outcomes
(Lakdawalla et al., 2017).
                                                                         3
       Conversely, increases in positive skewness add value. If 𝛾1(𝐻+𝐵) 𝜎𝐻+𝐵 > 𝛾1𝐻 𝜎𝐻3 , this
increase in positive skewness augments average values of QoL improvements. This effect has
not previously been formalized in the literature, but it seems related to empirical findings that
patients value therapies providing modest chances of a very large health improvement. Prior
research has referred to this as the “value of hope” associated with, for instance,
immunotherapies treating metastatic cancer (Lakdawalla et al., 2012). Risk-averse consumers
dislike variance in treatment outcomes. However, to the extent variance exists in competing
treatments, consumers will prefer those with variance that has greater positive skewness. Table 1
summarizes various combinations of changes in variance and skewness and their effects on
medical technologies’ value.
                                       [INSERT TABLE 1 HERE]
       When 𝜖 < 1, gains in average QALYs are less valuable than corresponding gains in
certain QALYs. This will be true if the technology increases the variance of QoL. In contrast, if
𝜖 > 1, consumers would rather take one unit of average QoL gain instead of a sure one-unit gain
in QoL. This could occur for technologies with lower variance and/or highly positively skewed
treatment benefits.
       2.2.2. Longevity Gains
       Next, we generalize our analysis to consider technologies that produce both random QoL
benefits 𝐵, and average survival increases of 𝜇𝑝 . Building upon equation (5), the technology’s
expected value is given by:

         The first part of the health-related numerator component (involving 𝜇𝑝 ) describes gains in
expected utility from increased survival, and the second part restates the gains arising from
improved QoL, holding survival constant. Section 2.2.1 characterized the second part of this
                                       𝑝1 𝜙𝐸[𝑊(𝐻1𝑠 +𝐵)−𝑊(𝐻1𝑠 )]
expression by proving that 𝐾                                        = [𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅][𝑝1 𝜙𝜇𝐵 𝜖]. We now characterize
                                               𝑊(𝐻0 )

the first part of this expression, which corresponds to the contributions of survival gains,
    𝜇𝑝 [𝜙𝐸(𝑊(𝐻1𝑠 +𝐵))+(1−𝜙)𝑊(𝐻1𝑤 )]
𝐾                                         .
                    𝑊(𝐻0 )

         To relate this to our earlier analyses of GP, define 𝛿, the marginal rate of substitution
between survival and QoL, (with dimension of H).15

                                                   [𝜙𝐸(𝑊(𝐻1𝑠 +𝐵))+(1−𝜙)𝑊(𝐻1𝑤 )]
                                              𝛿≡                                                       (13)
                                                               𝑊 ′ (𝜇𝐻 )


         Here, the numerator describes the marginal expected utility from gains in survival (Δ𝑝1 )
and the denominator describes the marginal utility of gains in QoL.16 Recall that this marginal
rate of substitution equals 𝐻1 when 𝑊 is linear, a result that undergirds the equivalence of
survival and QoL gains in traditional CEA, per GP.
         This definition of 𝛿, coupled with our earlier analysis of QoL improvements, allows
rewriting (12) as:

                                        𝐸𝑉(𝜇𝑝 , 𝐵) = 𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅{𝜇𝑝 𝛿 + 𝑝1 𝜙𝜇𝐵 𝜖}                            (14)

         Recall that 𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅 measures the value of gains in QoL, either through survival
improvement or quality-adjusted life improvement. Define the term in curly braces as
“generalized risk-adjusted-quality-adjusted life-year” (GRA-QALY):

                                       𝐺𝑅𝐴-𝑄𝐴𝐿𝑌(𝜇𝑝 , 𝐵) = {𝜇𝑝 𝛿 + 𝑝1 𝜙𝜇𝐵 𝜖}                            (15)

         The GRA-QALY can be used in place of the QALY in decision analysis and value
assessment. To see why, observe that increases in the GRA-QALY are always worth 𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅 on
the margin, regardless of whether generated by survival gains, QoL gains, or some combination


         15
               A later section discusses methods to estimate 𝛿.
         16
              This is the “ex post” rate of trade, just as in GP, so 𝑝1 = 1..

         16
of the two. It functions as a “single index of value,” just like the QALY in GP’s framework.
The GRA-QALY generalizes the RA-QALY further by incorporating longevity-extending
benefits. In addition, it transforms the average QoL gain, 𝑝1 𝜙𝜇𝐵 , into the certainty-equivalent
gain in QoL, 𝑝1 𝜙𝜇𝐵 𝜖.
       2.2.3. Implications for Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

       We now turn to cost-effectiveness analysis for medical technologies with uncertain
benefits. Building upon equation (2), the technology is welfare-improving if

                                  𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅{𝜇𝑝 𝛿 + 𝑝1 𝜙𝜇𝐵 𝜖} ≥ Δ𝐶0                                   (16)

       or
                                             Δ𝐶0
                                                       ≤ 𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅                                   (17)
                                       𝜇𝑝 𝛿+𝑝1 𝜙𝜇𝐵 𝜖


The left-hand side of (17) is the ratio of incremental medical spending to units of certainty-
equivalent QoL improvement. The right-hand side of (17) is the Risk-Aversion and Severity
Adjusted WTP (RASA-WTP).
       This generalizes the standard incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), by accounting
for stochastic changes in QoL, diminishing returns to QoL improvement, and the severity-of-
illness adjustment 𝑅. It also permits application of traditional ICER-based decision analyses as
carried out in current CEA studies. Once the new parameters 𝛿, 𝜖, 𝜔𝐻 , and 𝑅 are estimated (see
Section 3), these cost-effectiveness ratios are straightforward to obtain for a given technology.
       Note that, if important, differences in variability of treatment cost (Δ𝐶0 ) could readily be
introduced at this point with similar Taylor Series estimates using financial risk measures such as
relative risk aversion and relative prudence. Since cost-effectiveness analysis typically assumes
risk-averse consumers are insured against healthcare spending, and since third-party payers are
typically thought of as risk-neutral, risk-aversion over costs is likely to be a more specialized
matter than over QoL. Therefore, we leave this analysis to future research and focus on the
particular issues of risk aversion in QoL.
       Our framework nests the traditional GP decision rule as a special case. By assuming
linearity in the utility of QoL, traditional cost-effectiveness analysis imposes functional form
restrictions that imply 𝛿 = 𝐻1 and 𝜔𝐻 = 𝑅 = 1. By abstracting from the effects of uncertainty,



       17
traditional analyses also presume that⁡𝜖 = 1. For these parameter values, Equation (17)
                                                         Δ𝐶
collapses down to the GP decision rule, where Δ𝑄𝐴𝐿𝑌 ≤ 𝐾.

        Our analysis also shares with GP the applicability either to welfare-maximizing social
planners or budget-constrained payers seeking second-best allocations conditional on fixed
budgets. The risk-aversion and severity adjusted threshold, 𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅, depends on the chosen levels
of consumption. Budget-constrained payers will have smaller 𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅 thresholds than
unconstrained welfare-maximizing decision makers (Phelps, 2019a). However, within such
budget-constrained environments, better resource allocation occurs using our model by
incorporating both severity of illness and uncertain treatment outcomes rather than by ignoring
these fundamental issues brought about by risk aversion in QoL.


3. CALIBRATION AND ESTIMATION
        Incorporating risk-aversion and uncertain treatment benefits requires additional
parameters. We now turn to calibrating several of these parameters and providing guidance for
the estimation of others. We begin by discussing the calibration of the cost-effectiveness
threshold, 𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅. We then discuss calibration of 𝛿, the marginal rate of substitution between
survival and QoL, and finally, the certainty-equivalence ratio, 𝜖.
    3.1. Calibrating 𝑲𝝎𝑯 𝑹
        Some existing estimates for the value of QoL improvements may remain viable as
estimates of 𝐾𝜔𝐻 . Suppose we have empirically valid17 reduced-form estimates for the value of
a quality-adjusted life-year.18 By nature, reduced-form estimates do not specify underlying
utility functions, but instead yield atheoretical estimates of willingness to pay. Assuming such
estimates come from a population of people with diminishing marginal utility in QoL, then
𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅 more naturally describes these estimated parameters, presumably at average values of
𝑅.19 In contrast, studies that take structural approaches estimating only the component where




         17
            As Phelps (2019a) has emphasized, care must be taken in assessing and interpreting estimated values of a
QALY from VSL studies.

            See Hirth et al. (2000) for a review of the literature.
         19
            We are aware of no analyses that directly measure severity of illness effects (𝑅) when estimating WTP in
such studies.

Regardless, more can be said about the calibration of 𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅 from a theoretical perspective.
             3.1.1. Calibrating 𝑹
                                                      𝑊 ′ (𝜇𝐻 )
             We begin by calibrating 𝑅 ≡                        ,   the disease severity ratio. The full Taylor Series
                                                      𝑊 ′ (𝐻0 )

expansion for 𝑊 ′ (𝜇𝐻 ) has a convenient structure. First, define the average health loss ℓ∗ ≡
𝐻0 − 𝜇𝐻 ⁡.⁡⁡We can expand 𝑊 ′ (𝜇𝐻 ) around 𝐻0 :20
                                                                             1
             𝑊 ′ (𝜇𝐻 ) = {𝑊 ′ (𝐻0 ) + 𝑊 ′′ (𝐻0 )(𝜇𝐻 − 𝐻0 ) + 2 𝑊 ′′′ (𝐻0 )(𝜇𝐻 − ⁡ 𝐻0 )2 +
1                                                                                1            1
    𝑊′′′′((𝐻0 )(𝜇𝐻 − 𝐻0 )3 + ⋯ . } = 𝑊 ′ (𝐻0 ) {1 + 𝑟𝐻∗ ℓ∗ + 2 𝑟𝐻∗ 𝜋𝐻∗ ℓ∗ 2 + 6 𝑟𝐻∗ 𝜋𝐻∗ 𝜏𝐻∗ ℓ∗ 3 + ⋯ . } (18)
6

             Thus,

                                  𝑊 ′ (𝜇𝐻 )                          1               1
                            𝑅=                = ⁡ {1 + 𝑟𝐻∗ ℓ∗ + 2 𝑟𝐻∗ 𝜋𝐻∗ ℓ∗ 2 + 6 𝑟𝐻∗ 𝜋𝐻∗ 𝜏𝐻∗ ℓ∗ 3 + ⋯ . }         (19)
                                  𝑊 ′ (𝐻0 )


             This expansion simplifies further for any CRRA utility function, wherein 𝜋𝐻∗ = 𝑟𝐻∗ +
1, 𝜏𝐻∗ = 𝑟𝐻∗ + 2, …. (see Appendix 7.3). Thus, with CRRA utility, the disease severity ratio, R,
becomes simply a function of the CRRA parameter, 𝑟𝐻∗ . Since it is common in applied
economics to calibrate utility functions using the CRRA assumption, this approach provides a
well-established strategy for calibrating 𝑅.
             When 𝑟𝐻∗ = 1, Equation (19) further collapses to the familiar value of a perpetuity, since
the products of the relative risk parameters in the numerator of each term involving 𝑟𝐻∗ just
                                                                                                      ℓ∗       1
cancel the factorial terms in the denominator, leaving a value of 𝑅 = 1 + (1−ℓ∗) = (1−ℓ∗). Thus,

for a small health loss, ℓ∗ = .1, we obtain the severity ratio 𝑅 = 1.11. For the moderate health
                   1
loss, ℓ∗ = 2, we see 𝑅 = 2. For a very large health loss, ℓ∗ = 0.9, we obtain 𝑅 = 10.

             Evaluating 𝑅 becomes slightly more complex when 𝑟𝐻∗ ≠ 1.⁡⁡Using Equation (19), which
applies to all utility functions (not just CRRA), Table 2 shows values of 𝑅 across a range of
values for ℓ∗ and 𝑟𝐻∗ .21 QoL loss, ℓ∗ , runs from 0 to 0.9. Relative risk-aversion varies from zero




             20
                  The signs in each term are all positive because of alternating powers of ℓ̅ = −(𝜇𝐻 − 𝐻0 ).
             21
                  For non-CRRA utility functions, the values of 𝑟𝐻∗ are assumed to obtain locally.

             19
(to incorporate the GP case) to 1.5, which lies beyond consensus estimates of consumption risk-
aversion, 𝑟𝐶∗ (Chetty, 2006; Phelps, 2019a).
         Two general results emerge. First, the multiplier 𝑅 rises with 𝑟𝐻∗ . In the extreme case of
𝑟𝐻∗ = 0, the total multiplier is 1, and 𝑊 ′ (𝜇𝐻 ) = 𝑊′(𝐻0 ), the (nested) result from GP. Second, 𝑅
rises with ℓ∗ , increasingly so as ℓ∗ rises.
                                             [INSERT TABLE 2 HERE]
         To provide readers with context, Table 3 reports example diseases across various values
of ℓ∗ . Examples with ℓ∗ at or below 0.1 include peptic ulcer disease and benign prostatic
hyperplasia. At the other end of the spectrum, with ℓ∗ greater than 0.7, examples include
Alzheimer’s disease and metastatic colorectal cancer.22
                                             [INSERT TABLE 3 HERE]
         For average values of 𝑟𝐻∗ near 𝐻0 , it can also be shown that when utility is DRRA
(IRRA), 𝑅 will be larger (smaller) than shown in Table 2.23 For 𝑟𝐻∗ in the vicinity of 1, 𝑅 is
roughly unity for very mild diseases with 𝐻1𝑠 ≈ 1, roughly equal to 2.0 for diseases with 𝐻1𝑠 ≈
0.5, just over 3.0 for 𝐻1𝑠 ≈ 0.3, and over 4.5 for 𝐻1𝑠 ≈ 0.2.
         Finally, we note that this discussion does not preclude the possibility of estimating 𝑅 in
                                                            𝑊 ′ (𝜇𝐻 )

improvements in the sick state, in terms of foregone QoL in the baseline healthy state. The
question is how many units of sick state QoL would be required in order to compensate a
consumer for one unit of lost QoL in the healthy baseline.

         We now turn to the other part of the cost-effectiveness threshold expression, 𝐾𝜔𝐻 ≡

[𝑈 ′ (𝐶1 )][ 𝑊(𝐻 0) ]. Define 𝐺 ≡ 𝑈(𝐶1 ) as the relative growth in period consumption utility and 𝜔𝐶 ≡

          23
             Suppose utility is DRRA. Appendix 7.3 shows that 𝜋 ∗ > ⁡ 𝑟 ∗ + 1 so the product 𝜋 ∗ 𝑟 ∗ is larger than
when utility is CRRA and similarly for all successive higher levels of risk parameters. Thus, the Taylor series sum
is larger with DRRA than with CRRA. The reverse holds when utility is IRRA. The spreadsheet that created Table
2 demonstrates this phenomenon when the gap between 𝑟 ∗ 𝑎𝑛𝑑⁡𝜋 ∗ (and successive higher order terms) is allowed to
differ from 1.0.

         20
term 𝜔𝐶 is analogous to 𝜔𝐻 , the elasticity of W(H) with respect to QoL. Some algebraic
manipulation reveals that:
                                                                     𝜔
                                                        𝐾𝜔𝐻 = 𝐶0 ( 𝜔𝐻) 𝐺                                                                (20)
                                                                         𝐶


         In most applications, analysts presume little or no change over time in consumption,
                                            𝜔
implying 𝐺 ≈ 1 and 𝐾𝜔𝐻 ≈ 𝐶0 (_𝜔𝐻 ). Thus, 𝐾𝜔𝐻 is proportional to⁡𝐶0 where the factor of
                                                𝐶

                                            𝜔
proportionality is approximately ( 𝜔𝐻).
                                                𝐶

         While utility elasticities like 𝜔𝐻 and 𝜔𝐶 are not commonly estimated in the literature,24
we can characterize them for the salient case in which 𝑈(𝐶) and 𝑊(𝐻) are Hyperbolic Absolute
Risk-Aversion (HARA) utility functions. HARA functions include constant, increasing, and
decreasing relative risk-aversion cases, along with many commonly used functions – exponential
utility, power utility, linear utility, quadratic utility, and logarithmic utility, and are commonly
used in the finance literature studying risk aversion (Merton, 1971).
                                                                             𝑎𝐶
         To pursue this point further, note that for 𝑧 ≡ 1−𝛾 + 𝑏 > 0, HARA utility is:

Relative risk-aversion over consumption is defined as 𝑟𝐶∗ =                                , and the elasticity with respect to

the ratios involving the respective 𝛾 values. Further, if 𝑈(𝐶) and 𝑊(𝐻) exhibit identical
(similar) relative risk preference parameters, 𝑟 ∗ ⁡and⁡⁡𝜋 ∗ , they will have identical (similar) values
of 𝛾.25 This similarity in both 𝑟 ∗ ⁡and⁡⁡𝜋 ∗ suffices to make the relationships between 𝑟 ∗ ⁡and⁡⁡𝜔
similar for 𝑈(𝐶) and 𝑊(𝐻).26

an interim approach is to assume similar risk attitudes in 𝐻 and 𝐶, i.e., 𝜔𝐻 ≈ 1, and to conduct

                                                 𝜔

aversion in 𝑊(𝐻) and 𝑈(𝐶).
   3.2. Estimating the GRA-QALY
       The GRA-QALY associated with a technology that increases QoL by 𝐵 and survival by
an average of 𝜇𝑝 is given by 𝐺𝑅𝐴-𝑄𝐴𝐿𝑌(𝜇𝑝 , 𝐵) = {𝜇𝑝 𝛿 + 𝑝1 𝜙𝜇𝐵 𝜖}. This requires estimates of
𝛿, the marginal rate of substitution between survival and QoL, and of 𝜖, the certainty-
equivalence ratio.
       3.2.1. Marginal rate of substitution between survival and QoL
                                      [𝜙𝐸(𝑊(𝐻1𝑠 +𝐵))+(1−𝜙)𝑊(𝐻1𝑤 )]
       Recall the definition 𝛿 ≡                                 , which represents the ratio between
                                                𝑊 ′ (𝜇𝐻 )

the marginal utility of survival gains and the marginal utility of QoL improvement. In
                                                                        𝑑𝐻
equilibrium, this marginal rate of substitution will also satisfy 𝛿 = 𝑑𝑝𝑆, which measures the units

of QoL that an individual will give up in exchange for a unit gain in survival probability. Using
this latter representation, 𝛿 can be recovered via standard time tradeoff (TTO) approaches to
valuing different health states: specifically, one needs to estimate the rate of trade between
survival and expected quality of life, holding consumption fixed. TTO methods rely on the
concept of compensating variation (see Figure 1a). Consumers are given a choice between one
fixed alternative (baseline survival probability and expected QoL) and another with less
remaining survival probability but perfect health (QoL = 1). They are asked to state what




       22
survival probability they would give up to move from their current health condition to perfect
health, thus representing WTP in the same way that Figure 1a considers.27
             To illustrate how a TTO study would estimate 𝛿, define the baseline expected QoL in the
study as 𝐸(𝐻 𝐵 ). Define the survey respondent’s “stated” change in the survival probability as
|Δ𝑝 𝑆 |. Based on the results of the TTO study design above, 𝛿 could be estimated as, 𝛿̂ =
1−𝐸(𝐻 𝐵 )
    |Δ𝑝𝑆 |
             . For example, suppose survey respondents were asked to consider end-stage

osteoarthritis of the knee, which presents with 𝐻1𝑠 ≈ 0.75.⁡⁡We would then ask how much
survival probability they would give up in exchange for restoring perfect QoL. Suppose they
state a willingness to reduce survival by 5 percentage points in exchange for this increase in
                                                    1−𝐸(𝐻 )  1−0.75    𝐵
QoL. In this case, therefore, we would estimate 𝛿̂ = |Δ𝑝𝑆 | = 0.05 = 5.0.28

             As Figure 1 illustrates, 𝛿 varies with disease severity, and thus is essentially a disease-
specific parameter. Health states involving high longevity but low QoL will likely result in
lower values of 𝛿, because individuals in such states are more willing to trade away longevity in
exchange for QoL. As an example, suppose we surveyed respondents about severe Alzheimer’s
disease rather than osteoarthritis, so that 𝐻1𝑠 ≈ 0.25. The QoL loss is three times what it was in
the osteoarthritis example. Therefore, if diminishing marginal utility of QoL holds, we expect
that respondents will give up more than three times the survival reduction they agreed to in the
osteoarthritis case, or more than 3 ∗ 5% = 15% points of survival.
             3.2.2. Calibrating the certainty-equivalence ratio
                                                                               1         1
             The certainty-equivalence ratio is defined as 𝜖 = {1 + [𝜇               ][− 2 𝑟𝐻∗ Δ𝜎 2 +
                                                                              𝐵 𝜇𝐻

1                 1
    𝜋𝐻∗ 𝑟𝐻∗ (μ ) Δ(𝛾𝜎 3 ) + ⋯ ]}. Therefore, 𝜖 depends on consumer risk-attitudes (𝑟𝐻∗ , 𝜋𝐻∗ ) and
6                 H

differences in statistical risks between patients treated by 𝑇 and the relevant control group (𝐶).
While 𝜖 is technically a disease-specific parameter, it can in practice be recovered quite readily


             27
            Earlier methods simply asked consumers for their estimated tradeoff value. More modern approaches
use discrete choice experiments to show subjects continuously modified pairs of choices until they reach the point of
indifference. This process is logically equivalent to standard methods for selecting corrective lenses for eyeglasses,
e.g. “Which do you prefer, A or B” with the pairs adjusted according to prior responses.
         28
            For simplicity, we consider a deterministic example in which 𝜙 = 1 and 𝜎𝐻2 = 𝜎𝐻+𝐵2
                                                                                                  = 0. Stochastic
cases would simply fold the relevant uncertainties into the problem. E.g., one might ask, “suppose you have an X%
chance of osteoarthritis,” or “suppose you have a Y% chance of mild osteoarthritis with QoL=0.85 and a 1-Y%
chance of severe osteoarthritis with QOL=0.7,” and so on.

             23
for each decision context. First, risk attitudes over consumption are typically assumed to be
constant and context-independent (Chetty, 2006; Noussair et al., 2013), and we would propose a
similar approach to risk attitudes over health. Second, the parameters 𝜇𝐵 and 𝜇𝐻 are already
routinely estimated on a disease- and treatment-specific basis. Finally, as we discuss below,
changes in variance and skewness could be recovered from clinical trials or cost-effectiveness
simulation models.
       Estimating risk-attitudes in health.

       To date, there are no estimates of relative risk-aversion and relative prudence over QoL
or any measure of health. Given the evident importance of risk preferences over health, we hope
this deficiency will be remedied in the near future. The current cost-effectiveness literature
assumes 𝑟𝐻∗ = 𝜋𝐻∗ = 0. As a placeholder, we suggest assuming that risk attitudes over QoL and
consumption are similar and conducting sensitivity analyses that allow the ratio between the
two⁡to vary. In other words, the analyst can explore what happens if relative risk-aversion over
QoL is X% higher or lower than relative risk-aversion over consumption, and so forth.
       Estimating variability in QoL benefits.

       The statistical parameters to calculate 𝛥𝜎 2 and 𝛥(𝛾𝜎 3 ) can be estimated from the data
readily available in normal HTA studies, e.g., Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs). Such
studies routinely measure average differences in QoL outcomes (𝜇𝐵 ) and the variance of these
outcomes in treatment and control populations, in order to estimate standard errors of mean
differences. Thus, nearly all current HTA efforts have the data to incorporate the higher-order
risk terms necessary for computing the certainty equivalence ratio, 𝜖. To incorporate effects of
changes in skewness will require (at a minimum) further data analysis to measure skewness of
outcome distributions for alternative treatments and then their differences. We leave to relevant
experts (e.g., biostatisticians and statisticians) the proper study design and calculations for these
parameter estimates. We note, however, that if QALYs are not estimated in clinical trials, cost-
effectiveness studies will typically produce them via simulation models; in this case, the cost-
effectiveness researcher should estimate the variance and skewness in QoL benefits.

becomes 𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅 ≈ 𝐶𝑅 . For mild-severity diseases (where 𝑅 ≈ 1), this is approximately 𝐶 𝜔𝐻 =
                                                                                                              𝐶

𝐶, well below common estimates in the current literature, which suggests 2𝐶 to 3𝐶 as
appropriate values (Phelps, 2019a). Therefore, our analysis suggests that the correct WTP
threshold might fall for mild conditions, relative to current practice.
       However, for severe illnesses, the threshold might well be larger than current methods
suggest, because the multiplier 𝑅 rises with illness severity. For values of 𝑟𝐻∗ meaningfully
different from zero, R rises geometrically with illness severity (see Table 2). Instead of applying
a single threshold 𝐾 to every illness condition, it will be necessary to evaluate the level of health
for untreated patients in various health conditions, and to adjust the threshold as illustrated in
Table 2.

       Using 𝑟𝐻∗ = 1, 𝜔𝐻 ≈ 1, and using the diseases in Table 3 as examples, severe Alzheimer’s

disease (𝐻1𝑠 ≈ 0.2, or ℓ∗ ≈ 0.8) calls for a threshold of 5 times annual consumption, pressure
ulcers in nursing home residents (𝐻1𝑠 ≈ 0.35) calls for a threshold around 2.85 times annual
consumption, acute lung injury (𝐻1𝑠 ≈ 0.6) calls for 1.67 times annual consumption, and peptic
ulcers (𝐻1𝑠 ≈ 0.97) requires a threshold approximately the same as annual consumption.29 The
severity gradient steepens as 𝑟𝐻∗ increases, as Table 2 shows. As more specific information
                            𝜔𝐻
becomes known about                , these thresholds can be adjusted more precisely.

       Care must be taken to ensure objectivity in the evaluation of illness severity, and the
associated computation of cost-effectiveness thresholds. Both third-party payers and life
sciences manufacturers benefit from changes in these severity estimates, but in opposite
directions. Similar tables of severity are in widespread use in hospital payment systems in the

United States, such as the Diagnosis-Related-Groups (DRG) system in Medicare. Creating such
a table for general use would seem relatively straightforward. Building upon registries of cost-
effectiveness analyses – e.g., the Tufts Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, used for the
examples in Table 3 – would seem a natural way to proceed.
         3.3.2. The Consequences of Permanent Disability
         Cost-effectiveness thresholds will also need to vary for those with permanent disability.
To pursue this point, we now relax the assumption that 𝐻0 = 1. Consider a permanent disability
                                                                                 𝑈(𝐶 )      1
that reduces 𝐻0 to some other level. Recall from Equation (1) that 𝐾 ≡ 𝑈 ′ (𝐶1 ) [𝐻 ]. When we
                                                                                        0   0

                                𝜔             𝐶
rewritten as 𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅 = 𝐺 [ 𝜔𝐻] 𝑅 [𝐻0 ]. Assuming that consumption growth is approximately zero,
                                    𝐶             0

𝐺 can be ignored, and 𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅 ≈ [ 𝜔𝐻] 𝑅 [𝐻0 ]. The value-per-QALY measure is a multiple of
                                                      𝐶           0

                                                                                𝜔
         To keep the key issue in focus, we assume for the moment that [ 𝜔𝐻] remains constant
                                                                                    𝐶

across health and consumption levels; for instance, this would be true if both 𝑈(𝐶) and 𝑊(𝐻)
exhibited constant relative risk aversion. Under this assumption, permanent disability increases
                                                                                𝜔           𝐶
the cost-effectiveness threshold for two reasons. First, since 𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅 ≈ [ 𝜔𝐻] 𝑅 [𝐻0 ], reductions in
                                                                                    𝐶           0

𝐻0 proportionally inflate WTP by reducing the denominator. Second, permanent disability also
increases 𝑅. To see why, return to equation (19), which defines 𝑅. Notice that the parameter ℓ∗
representing illness severity is normalized by 𝐻0 . As 𝐻0 shrinks from 𝐻0 = 1, therefore, ℓ∗
increases, and the Taylor series for 𝑅 grows.
         To give an example of the combined magnitudes of these effects, suppose that a
permanent disability reduces 𝐻0 from 1 to 0.8. Now introduce an acute illness that has ℓ∗ = 0.4
when 𝐻0 = 1, but that results in ℓ∗ = 0.5⁡ when 𝐻0 = 0.8. We can readily calculate the effect of
                                                                                                        1
disability by assuming CRRA for 𝑊(𝐻). Then, the perpetuity value of R increases from 1−0.4 =
1                    1         1                                                                2   1
      = 1.667 to            = 0.5 = 2. This disability increases 𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅 by a factor of [1.667] [0.8] = 1.5.
0.6                1−0..5

This effect expands geometrically as the disability severity increases (𝐻0 falls).



         26
           Through this analysis, introducing risk aversion in QoL resolves a long-standing dilemma
in the practice of CEA, wherein people with permanent disabilities are disfavored. Indeed, the
Affordable Care Act explicitly prohibits using any CEA model that discriminates against
disabled persons. Several “workaround” efforts have emerged to attempt to repair this problem
(Basu et al., 2020; Nord et al., 1999), altering QALY equivalents received by persons with
permanent disability. Our approach shows that this may not be necessary. Our model of value
does not discriminate against disabled persons when valuing QoL improvements. Rather, it adds
value to curing their disabilities and makes it more (not less) valuable to cure them of any acute
illness.
           Some complexities continue to arise in the valuation of survival gains for the
permanently disabled. Diminishing returns to QoL gains mean that rational consumers demand
more QoL in exchange for a given gain in survival, when QoL falls. Our model then implies that
a unit change in survival is worth fewer QoL units to a disabled person. Theoretically, this is a
fairly direct and uncontroversial implication of diminishing returns to QoL.
           To see this precisely, from equation (14), the component valuing survival gains is
                                                                     [𝜙𝐸(𝑊(𝐻1𝑠 +𝐵))+(1−𝜙)𝑊(𝐻1𝑤 )]

                                                                                𝑊(𝐻0 )

the change over time in utility from health-related QoL. Further, to emphasize the role of
disability, consider the case where 𝜙 = 0, eliminating acute illnesses from the analysis. Now
define 𝐻1𝑊 = 𝐻0 − 𝑑, where 𝑑 is the QoL loss from disability.
                                                       𝛿        𝐷
           A bit of algebraic manipulation shows that 𝐻 = 𝜔 𝑅.⁡ Therefore, the expression for the

value of survival improvement—𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅𝛿𝜇𝑝 —reduces to 𝐾𝐷𝜇𝑝 In the general evaluation of
GRA-QALYs, the concavity effects of 𝑊(𝐻) are removed when evaluating the deterministic
components of life expectancy gains. This is intuitively plausible, since we have assumed risk
neutrality in survival. With these simplifying assumptions that remove acute illness from the
picture, the WTP for survival becomes:
                                                     𝑊(𝐻0 −𝑑)
                                            𝐾𝐷 = 𝐾                                              (22)
                                                      𝑊(𝐻0 )


           WTP for survival declines as disability worsens. This is wholly expected, as portrayed in
Figure 1a. People with lower QoL would be more willing to give up LY to gain QoL.
Preferences change as disability alters health status.


           27
       As logical as this conclusion is, decision makers might wish to remove permanent
disability from evaluation of technologies that extend life expectancy. For the sake of
consistency, this would then imply that the WTP for QoL improvements is the same for the
permanently disabled as the non-disabled, thus discarding our earlier conclusion at Equation (8)
that value of QoL gains rises with disability severity. The ethical question becomes whether or
not to acknowledge the higher relative value of QoL improvements compared to survival gains
among the disabled. The answer to this question lies beyond the scope of economic analysis.
   3.4. Summary of Parameters to be Estimated
       Equation 17 provides the generalized ICER decision rule for our context:
                                                 Δ𝐶0
                                                         ≤ 𝐾𝜔𝐻 𝑅
                                        𝜇𝑝 𝛿+𝑝1 𝜙𝜇𝐵 𝜖


       Leveraging the approximations in the prior section, we can rewrite this as:
                                          Δ𝐶0             𝜔       𝐶
                                                       ≤ [ 𝜔𝐻] 𝑅 [𝐻0 ]                          (23)
                                     𝜇𝑝 𝛿+𝑝1 𝜙𝜇𝐵 𝜖            𝐶       0


The parameters, Δ𝐶0 , 𝜇𝑝 , 𝑝1, and 𝜇𝐵 are routinely estimated in the current literature, and the
probability of illness, 𝜙, is also widely available in burden of illness estimates. Furthermore, 𝐶0
and 𝐻0 can be taken from a variety of existing sources on income, consumption, and QoL for a
                                         𝜔
subgroup of interest. This leaves 𝛿, 𝜖, 𝜔𝐻, and 𝑅 to be estimated.
                                             𝐶

       In summarizing the estimation approaches, we suggest restricting attention to the case of
HARA utility, which covers a wide variety of common utility functions. We also suggest
borrowing from the empirical literature on consumption risk-aversion the assumption that
relative risk-aversion over health, 𝑟𝐻∗ , is roughly constant empirically. This leads to the
following estimation approaches.
       𝒓∗𝑯 , 𝝅∗𝑯 : Relative risk attitudes over health need to be estimated, if we are to measure
accurately the costs and benefits of risky health outcomes. These can be estimated using
methods from the happiness economics literature (Easterlin, 2004) or discrete choice
experiments (Dohmen et al., 2011; Ebert and Wiesen, 2011, 2014; Eckel and Grossman, 2008;
Eisenhauer and Ventura, 2003; Harrison et al., 2007; Meyer and Meyer, 2006; Noussair et al.,
2013). As an interim step, we recommend using the corresponding risk attitudes over
consumption as placeholders, with appropriate sensitivity analysis around this benchmark.


       28
       𝑹: Under CRRA utility, 𝑅 depends entirely on 𝑟𝐻∗ . Thus, once 𝑟𝐻∗ is known, so is 𝑅.
More general estimates are possible when relative prudence, 𝜋𝐻∗ , is also known, according to
Equation 19 and with assumptions about whether 𝑟𝐻∗ is constant, increasing or decreasing in 𝐻.
       𝝎𝑯
            : Under HARA utility and constant relative risk-aversion, 𝜔𝐻 depends on 𝑟𝐻∗ and the
       𝝎𝑪

HARA utility parameter 𝛾𝐻 . Moreover, in this case, 𝛾𝐻 depends on 𝑟𝐻∗ and 𝜋𝐻∗ (see footnote 25).
                                             𝜔𝐻
Analogous results hold for 𝜔𝐶 . Therefore,        is identified as soon as estimates of 𝑟𝐻∗ and 𝜋𝐻∗ are
                                             𝜔𝐶

in hand.
       𝝐: The certainty-equivalence ratio depends on relative risk preferences, 𝑟𝐻∗ and 𝜋𝐻∗ , along
with 𝜇𝐵 , 𝜇𝐻 , Δ𝜎 2 , and Δ(𝛾𝜎 3 ). As discussed earlier, the latter two parameters must be estimated
in randomized trials or in cost-effectiveness simulation models that predict QoL improvements.
       𝜹: The marginal rate of substitution between longevity and QoL likely varies with disease
severity, by the logic of Figure 1. As discussed in Section 3.2.1, it can be recovered via time
trade-off survey methods implemented in relevant patient populations.


4. CONCLUSIONS
       Cost-effectiveness analysis has become one of the most successful economic methods in
real-world applications to evaluate medical technologies, and its use continues to expand.
However, standard CEA frameworks fail to adequately account for the role of risk aversion in
QoL and attendant uncertainty in treatment effects. This can lead to misallocation of resources
by health insurers and/or health care systems that rely on it. We develop a relatively
straightforward and tractable way for analysts and real-world decision makers to account for
these limitations. While several new parameters are needed, once these estimates are in place,
our method is no more taxing to carry out than current approaches.
       How often will our generalized methods matter? Our calibration analysis provides some
insight. Momentarily ignoring changes in uncertainty of treatment outcomes, cost-effectiveness
decision thresholds should be about 5 times higher for severe Alzheimer’s disease than for peptic
ulcer disease. Currently, these and every other disease are treated uniformly. These adjustments,
of course, vary with the degree of risk-aversion over health, 𝑟𝐻∗ . In addition, as we discussed,
treatments with highly variable outcomes will have their values reduced from current levels.




       29
       Our analysis has implications for both public-sector and private-sector payers. Public-
sector payers would benefit from more accurate assessments of value to avoid setting prices that
are too high or low from the perspective of encouraging efficient innovation. Private-sector
payers could use our approach to match their coverage and reimbursement decisions more
closely to the preferences of their beneficiaries. Future research ought to consider how to
aggregate our representative consumer model into a payer population of heterogeneous types.
       These issues regularly appear in real-world coverage determinations and other policy
choices affecting people’s access to various healthcare innovations. These appear most clearly in
decision processes of the British National Health Service and NICE. While they have an
announced CEA threshold of ₤20,000 to ₤30,000 per QALY, they have formal exceptions for
end of life care, rare diseases, and other circumstances. A separate “Cancer Fund” was
established in 2011 to provide access to new cancer drugs that did not meet NICE thresholds
(Chambers et al., 2020). These and related “adjustments” signal the inadequacy of the current
model, wherein one threshold 𝐾 is applied to all diseases. Our generalized model makes it
abundantly clear why that approach is fundamentally flawed. Severity of illness adjustments are
necessary to align decision thresholds with preferences of risk-averse people.
       Finally, we note that these results could help to focus R&D efforts and guide design of
new technologies in beneficial ways. Different diseases have health consequences varying from
relatively small to very large. Interventions that affect the lower end of severity produce less
total expected utility gain than those treating patients with the most severe disease, holding
constant the magnitude of average improvement (𝜇𝐵 ). A properly designed reimbursement
system would alter incentives towards assisting those most-afflicted by illness or injury, whether
through chronic disability or acute illness. We believe that such an approach will improve
population health efficiently and humanely.

       BOX A: THREE WAYS TO INTERPRET PRUDENCE AND TEMPERANCE
        Most economists are familiar with the standard measure of risk aversion (Arrow, 1965;
Pratt, 1964), but less so (perhaps wholly unfamiliar) with the higher-order terms of prudence and
temperance. We discuss these further here.
        1. Rates at which absolute and relative risk aversion change. Consider the common
question of whether absolute risk aversion is constant (CARA), decreasing (DARA) or increasing
(IARA). The economics literature widely assumes that utility is DARA (Gollier, 2001). In parallel
comes the question of whether relative risk aversion is constant (CRRA), increasing (IRRA) or
decreasing (DRRA). Here the literature is less settled (Meyer and Meyer, 2006). Where relative
                       𝑈 ′′′ (𝐶)
prudence is 𝜋𝐶∗ = −𝐶( 𝑈 ′′ (𝐶) ), Appendix 7.3 proves that:
       If    (𝜋 ∗ − 𝑟 ∗ ) = 1         then utility is CRRA,
             (𝜋 ∗ − 𝑟 ∗ ) > ⁡1        then utility is IRRA,
                ∗     ∗
             (𝜋 − 𝑟 ) < ⁡1            then utility is DRRA.
       Concurrently, since 𝜖(𝑟, 𝑀) = 𝜖(𝑟 ∗ , 𝑀) − 1,
       If    𝜋 ∗ = 𝑟 ∗⁡               then utility is CARA,
             𝜋∗ > 𝑟∗           then utility is DARA,
             𝜋∗ < 𝑟∗          then utility is IARA.
                                                                                        𝑈 ′′′′ (𝐶)
       Similar relationships hold between 𝜋 ∗ and relative temperance, 𝜏 ∗ ≡ −𝐶( 𝑈 ′′′ (𝐶) ).
        As a useful benchmark, for iso-elastic utility where 𝑟 ∗ = 𝛾, we have that 𝜋 ∗ = 𝛾 + 1, 𝜏 ∗ =
𝛾 + 2, … … For example, when 𝑈(𝐶) = ln⁡(𝐶), 𝑟 ∗ = 1, 𝜋 ∗ = 2, 𝜏 ∗ = 3, …
        2. Savings Behavior. In his pioneering work on the concept, Kimball (1990) defines
prudence as “the sensitivity of a decision variable to risk.” An individual with positive prudence
will respond to increases in the variance of future income by saving more today, known as
                                                𝑢′′′′ (𝑌𝑇 )⁡
“precautionary savings.” Similarly, for 𝜏 ≡ −                  (Kimball, 1990, 1992), individuals with
                                                𝑢′′′ (𝑌𝑇 )
positive temperance seek to moderate their total exposure to risk (Kimball, 1992). In risk aversion
in QoL, this involves investment in reductions of future risk (e.g., diet, smoking cessation).
         3. Mean-Preserving Spreads in Risk. The degree of absolute risk-aversion measures a
consumer’s distaste for mean-preserving spreads in the distribution of consumption (Rothschild and
Stiglitz, 1970). As Eeckhoudt et al. (1995) show, risk-averse but prudent people dislike mean-
preserving spreads, but if they must accept one, they prefer that they occur in positive rather than
negative outcomes. Prudence represents the strength of their preferences in this respect (Eeckhoudt
et al., 1995). This links directly to skewness of outcomes’ distributions.
         Finally, temperate, prudent, and risk-averse people dislike mean-preserving spreads, prefer
that any such spreads apply to more positive outcomes, but derive diminishing marginal utility from
successive rightward shifts of mean-preserving spreads of positive outcomes (Eeckhoudt et al.,
1995). This links to kurtosis, the “fatness” of tails of distributions compared with normal
distributions.

7. APPENDIX
Here, we discuss the convergence properties of Taylor Series expansions in our application.
      7.1. Convergence of Taylor Series for HARA Utility
         Proposition 1: Suppose the health index has support on the interval [0,1], and the utility
function takes the form 𝑉(𝑐, 𝐻) = 𝑈(𝑐)𝑊(𝐻), where 𝑊 belongs to the class of HARA
(hyperbolic absolute risk-aversion) utility functions. If 𝐻 is a random variable with support [0,1]
and mean 𝜇0 , then the Taylor expansion of 𝑊(𝐻) around 𝜇0 converges.
         Proof: Any utility function in the HARA family can be written as 𝑈(𝐻) =
1−𝛾     𝛽𝐻           𝛾
      (1−𝛾 + 𝜂) (Merton, 1971). The Taylor expansion around the mean of 𝐻, 𝜇0 , takes the form:
 𝛾

                                                 1 ′′                   1
𝐸𝑈(𝐻) ≈ 𝑈(𝜇0 ) + 𝑈 ′ (𝜇0 )𝐸(𝐻 − 𝜇0 )) +             𝑈 (𝜇0 )𝐸(𝐻 − 𝜇0 )2 + 𝑈 ′′′ (𝜇0 )𝐸(𝐻 − 𝜇0 )3 + ⋯
                                                 2!                     3!
                                                                             𝐸(𝐻−𝜇0 )𝑛+1
         Since 𝐻 has support on the unit interval, it is evident that lim                  = 0. Moreover,
                                                                          𝑛→∞ 𝐸(𝐻−𝜇0 )𝑛

defining the nth derivative of 𝑈 as 𝑈 (𝑛) , we can write:
                                                          𝛾−(𝑛+1)
                                       𝛾−𝑛       𝛽𝜇0
         𝑈   (𝑛+1)       𝛽 𝑛+1 (𝛾 − 2) …       (     + 𝜂)                𝛽(𝛾 − 𝑛)
                                    (1 − 𝛾)𝑛−1 1 − 𝛾
                     =                                            =                     ⁡⁡⁡⁡
          𝑈 (𝑛)                    (𝛾 − (𝑛 − 1)) 𝛽𝜇0        𝛾−𝑛       𝛽𝜇0
                        𝑛
                       𝛽 (𝛾 − 2) …               (     + 𝜂)         (     +  𝜂) (1 − 𝛾)
                                     (1 − 𝛾)𝑛−2 1 − 𝛾                 1−𝛾
                                                       𝑈 (𝑛+1)                𝛽(𝛾−𝑛)                       −𝛽
         Thus, L’Hôpital’s rule implies that lim                  = lim         𝛽𝜇0            =       𝛽𝜇0        .
                                                 𝑛→∞ (𝑛+1)𝑈 (𝑛)    𝑛→∞ (𝑛+1)(       +𝜂)(1−𝛾)       (       +𝜂)(1−𝛾)
                                                                                1−𝛾                    1−𝛾

                                                                             𝐸(𝐻−𝜇0 )𝑛+1
Since 𝛽 and 𝛾 are both finite scalars, since 0 ≤ 𝜇0 ≤ 1, and since lim                         = 0, it follows
                                                                          𝑛→∞ 𝐸(𝐻−𝜇0 )𝑛

that:
                                             𝑈 (𝑛) 𝐸(𝐻 − 𝜇0 )𝑛+1
                                      lim                            =0
                                      𝑛→∞ (𝑛 + 1)𝑈 (𝑛+1) 𝐸(𝐻 − 𝜇0 )𝑛

         This proves the claim.
      7.2. Assessing Convergence of the Taylor Series Expansion
         Next, we assess the convergence characteristics of our Taylor Series expansion using
four-parameter Beta distributions with varying skewness and kurtosis. We calculated the
absolute value of the second, third and fourth-order Taylor series terms to compare various
technologies (𝑇) with a common control (𝑆), where the control intervention always has a four
parameter Beta distribution with parameters 𝛼 = 2, 𝛽 = 2 and support that is 0.5 units wide.


         39
Similarly, the 𝑇 distributions feature 𝛼 = 2 and vary 𝛽 between 5 and 10 in increments of 1, with
0.5-unit width of support. Each increase in 𝛽 increases the skewness and alters the kurtosis in
complex ways (since 𝛽 appears in both the numerator and denominator of the expression for
kurtosis).
         We characterize speed of convergence by calculating ratios between the 3rd-order and 2nd-
order Taylor Series terms, and between 4th-order and 2nd-order Taylor Series terms. Our
simulations illustrate that the speed of convergence varies with the average level of health in the
untreated sick state (𝜇𝐻 ).
         Figure A-2a shows the ratio of the 3rd to the 2nd order terms for distributions of T with
successively increasing skewness (𝛽 ranging from 5 to 10 in increments of 1, with the lowest
skewness in the bottom line, increasingly for higher lines).
         As predicted, convergence is always faster when average health in the untreated sick state
is higher. In Figure A-2a (the ratio of 3rd to 2nd order terms) the ratio is about 0.32 for 𝜇𝐻 =
0.1,⁡rapidly falling below 0.15 as 𝜇𝐻 exceeds 0.2.
         Figure A-2b similarly graphs the ratio of the 4th order (kurtosis-related) term to the 2nd
order term. There, the lines reverse in sequence, with the smallest 𝛽 parameters in the higher
lines. The ratios are all below 0.75 and rapidly fall below 0.17 for values of 𝜇𝐻 exceeding 0.2.
These simulations demonstrate a reasonably rapid rate of convergence with these specific
parameters, particularly when we limit the analysis to values of 𝜇𝐻 ≥ 0.2.30 Since QALY
values below 0.2 correspond to extremely poor health states, e.g., for a person with an
untreatable and highly aggressive cancer, this is a helpful result.
         Figure A-2 also demonstrates that statistical moments produce uncertain effects on speed
of convergence. In our four-parameter beta distributions, higher positive skew (larger values of
𝛽) results in slower convergence for a third-order Taylor expansion, but faster convergence for a




         30
             The width of the support interval affects
           Figure A-2. As the support interval narrows for any 4-parameter Beta distribution, the variance falls with
the square of that interval’s width. Since
           Figure A-2a contains 𝜎 3 in the calculations of the 3rd moment (and similarly Figure 5b contains 𝜎 4 to
calculate the 4th moments), the ratios shown in these figures become smaller as the support interval narrows. The
effect is linear in the support width in
           Figure A-2a and quadratic in
           Figure A-2b. The most pessimistic convergence would occur for support intervals near 1.0.

         40
fourth-order expansion. Nonetheless, our calculations illustrate how practitioners can readily
calculate speed of convergence using their specific statistical moments and parameter values.
       Sensitivity analyses (not shown) identify situations where the higher-order terms have
ratios of the 3rd to 2nd order terms exceed 1.0, indicating slower convergence. The most
important of these cases occurs when the two distributions have nearly identical skewness, so
that their difference is very small, and hence the ratio of the 2nd order to the 3rd order term
relatively large. Even in these cases, it requires a relatively high degree of variance, which
further increases the 3rd and 4th moment values. A similar phenomenon occurs when the two
distributions have nearly identical values of kurtosis.

               Figure A-2a                                               Figure A-2b
       Notes: These figures demonstrate the rate of convergence of the Taylor series by taking
the ratio of the 3rd-order to the 2nd-order Taylor Series terms (Figure A-2a) and the 4th-order to
the 2nd-order terms (Figure A-2b). Smaller ratios, and y-axis values, demonstrate faster
convergence. In both panels, the control group (S) outcomes have Beta distribution parameters
of 𝛼 = 2; 𝛽 = 4. In Figure A-2a, the topmost curve has the greatest skewness (𝛼 = 2; 𝛽 = 10),
with the value of 𝛽 declining (serially) in the lower curves by one unit (10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5) holding
𝛼 constant at 2. Therefore, the skewness declines as one moves from the top to the bottom
curves. In Figure A-2b, the sequence is reversed (following the formula for kurtosis in the 4-
parameter Beta distribution). Apart from this difference, Figure A-2a and Figure A-2b share a
similar structure.

   7.3. Relative Risk Preferences and Income
       Consider the basic question of how 𝑟 ∗ changes with consumption—whether 𝑟 ∗ is IRRA,
CRRA or DRRA. And, consider the related question of how 𝑟𝐻∗ changes with health. Since the
analysis for both these cases is identical, we will present only the case of 𝑟𝐶∗ and consumption.
Define the elasticity of 𝑟 ∗ with respect to consumption as 𝜖(𝑟𝐶∗ , 𝐶). Following Kimball (1999):

                                                         𝑈 ′′
                                              𝑟𝐶 = ⁡ − 𝑈 ′ and 𝑟𝐶∗ = 𝑟𝐶

                                                            (24)

                                                        𝑈 ′′′
                                            𝜋𝐶 = ⁡ − 𝑈 ′′ , and 𝜋C∗ = 𝜋𝐶                          (25)

Here, 𝑟𝐶∗ is relative risk aversion and 𝜋𝐶∗ is relative prudence, as defined by Kimball (1993).
       The derivative of 𝑟𝐶∗ with respect to 𝐶 is:

                       𝑑𝑟𝐶∗         𝑈 ′′        [𝑈 ′ 𝑈 ′′′ −𝑈 ′′ 𝑈 ′′ ]            𝑈 ′′′
                              = − 𝑈 ′ + 𝐶[            [𝑈 ′ 𝑈 ′ ]
                                                                      ] = 𝑟𝐶 + 𝐶 ( 𝑈 ′ + 𝑟𝐶2 )    (26)
                        𝑑𝐶


       Hence the elasticity of 𝑟𝐶∗ with respect to 𝐶 is:

                                                         𝑈 ′′′
                              𝜖(𝑟𝐶∗ , 𝐶) = ⁡1 + 𝐶 [ 𝑈 ′′ + 𝑟𝐶 ] = 1 − (𝜋𝐶∗ − 𝑟𝐶∗ )                (27)

       or

                                            𝜖(𝑟𝐶∗ , 𝐶) = ⁡1 − (𝜋𝐶∗ − 𝑟𝐶∗ )                        (28)

       From this, we can infer that if:

                                   (𝜋𝐶∗ − 𝑟𝐶∗ ) = 1, then utility is CRRA                         (29)

                                   (𝜋𝐶∗ − 𝑟𝐶∗ ) > 1, then utility is DRRA                         (30)

                                   (𝜋𝐶∗ − 𝑟𝐶∗ ) < 1, then utility is IRRA                         (31)

       Similarly, since 𝜖(𝑟𝐶 , 𝐶) = 𝜖(𝑟𝐶∗ , 𝐶) − 1, if:

                                           𝜋𝐶∗ = 𝑟𝐶∗ ,⁡then utility is CARA                       (32)

                                       𝜋𝐶∗ > 𝑟𝐶∗ , then utility is DARA                           (33)

                                           𝜋𝐶∗ < 𝑟𝐶∗ , then utility is IARA                       (34)




       42
        Condition (34) is widely considered as empirically implausible, all known estimates of
𝜋𝐶∗ ⁡and⁡𝑟𝐶∗ indicate that utility is DARA (condition (33)).
        An identical relationship exists between relative prudence and relative temperance when
the utility function is differentiable four times and similarly for all higher-order ratios of utility-
function derivatives. Again following Kimball (1999), define relative temperance as

                                                        𝑈 ′′′′
                                              𝜏𝐶∗ = 𝐶                                             (35)
                                                        𝑈 ′′′

                                     𝜖(𝜋𝐶∗ , 𝐶) = ⁡1 − (𝜏𝐶∗ − 𝜋𝐶∗ )                               (36)

        Following the same method used to derive Equation (27), we can solve Equation (36) for
𝜏𝐶∗ :

                                       𝜏𝐶∗ = 1 + 𝜋𝐶∗ − 𝜖(𝜋𝐶∗ , 𝐶)                                 (37)

Thus if 𝜋𝐶∗ is constant (i.e., 𝜖(𝜋𝐶∗ , 𝐶) = 0) then 𝜏𝐶∗ = 1 + 𝜋𝐶∗ . The same relationships hold for all
higher-order risk parameter similar to those defined by Kimball (1999).
