                                         ABSTRACT

A large body of evidence documents a link between alcohol consumption and violence involving
intimate partners and close family members. Recent scholarship suggests that since the onset of
the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent stay-at-home orders, there has been a marked increase
in domestic violence. This research considers an important mechanism behind the increase
in domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic: an increase in the riskiness of
alcohol consumption. We combine 911 call data with newly-available high-resolution microdata
on visits to bars and liquor stores in Detroit, MI and find that the strength of the relationship
between visits to alcohol outlets and domestic violence more than doubles starting in March
2020. We find more limited evidence with respect to non-domestic assaults, supporting our
conclusion that it is not alcohol consumption per se but alcohol consumption at home that
is a principal driver of domestic violence

1    Introduction

The statistics on domestic violence are grim: 1 in every 4 women in the United States will

experience violence at the hands of an intimate partner during her lifetime (Alhabib et al.,

2010). The consequences of domestic violence include not only the shorter-term physical

injuries (Le et al., 2001; Plichta, 2004; Sheridan and Nash, 2007; Ellsberg et al., 2008)

and mental harms (Roberts et al., 1998; Tolman and Rosen, 2001; Humphreys and Thiara,

2003) that are the immediate consequences of abuse, but also longer-term medical issues

such as chronic pain (Wuest et al., 2008), depression (Dienemann et al., 2000), sexually-

transmitted diseases (Martin et al., 1999), and post-traumatic stress disorder (Jones et al.,

2001). Given that approximately half of all domestic violence occurs in households where

children under the age of 12 are present, domestic violence imposes a terrible burden, not

only on the victim of the abuse, but also on children who witness it (Holt et al., 2008). Given

the psychosocial malleability of children, domestic violence has profound implications for

their cognitive and social development. Sadly, this burden compounds itself generation after

generation, becoming an engine for the intergenerational transmission of violence (Simons

et al., 1995).

    The COVID-19 pandemic and its many accompanying disruptions to economic and

social life have changed the world both unexpectedly and dramatically. In addition to

mechanically increasing exposure to violence for those who are not safe at home (Peterman

et al., 2019), stay-at-home-orders have affected a host of determinants of domestic violence

such as increasing stress brought by job loss and material deprivation (Bitler et al., 2020),

gender equality (Alon et al., 2020), and mental health (Pfefferbaum and North, 2020) (Galea

et al., 2020) among others. Stay-at-home-orders may also create hostile conditions at home,



                                              1
aggravate already hostile conditions, prevent victims from fleeing violent situations or filing

protective orders, and reduce availability of police officers to respond to domestic arguments.

Consistent with the expectations of many observers (Taub, 2020), recent scholarship has

documented a notable increase in domestic violence since March 2020 in the US as well as

in a number of other countries (Boserup et al., 2020; Leslie and Wilson, 2020a; McCrary

and Sanga, 2020; Leslie and Wilson, 2020b). In this paper, we build upon this literature and

provide novel evidence for an important mechanism through which lockdowns have affected

household violence; we argue that during the COVID-19 pandemic, consumption of alcohol

has become more risky, as the venue of consumption has shifted into homes, leading to

increased intra-personal conflict.

   The relationship between alcohol and violence is well documented. Alcohol use is impli-

cated in approximately 50 percent of all violent crimes and sexual assaults in industrialized

nations (Heinz et al., 2011) and a large literature in public health, criminology and eco-

nomics establishes a correlational and, more recently, a causal link between problematic

drinking and violence (Carpenter and Dobkin, 2009, 2011; Chalfin et al., 2019; Kypri et al.,

2014). Research shows that both the perpetration of violence and victimization increases

discretely at age 21, the age at which individuals can legally drink alcohol in the United

States (Chalfin et al., 2019; Kypri et al., 2014). There is likewise evidence that policy levers

such as Sunday liquor laws, "wet laws" that expand the footprint of drinking establishments,

underage driving laws, and alcohol excise taxes can have an important impact on public

safety as well as morbidity and mortality rates. Owing to its effects on aggression and the

ease with which it can change the nature of routine activities among members of the same

household, alcohol consumption has been linked, in particular, to violence between family




                                               2
members, especially intimate partners (Bushman, 2002; Livingston, 2010; Markowitz and

Grossman, 1998; Foran and O'Leary, 2008; Caetano et al., 2001).

   By making it more difficult to drink in bars or restaurants, the COVID-19 pandemic

has pushed alcohol consumption into residential settings (Usher et al., 2020). The majority

of recent studies suggest that alcohol consumption has increased since March 2020 (Biddle

et al., 2020; Brenmer, 2020), though there is no definitive empirical evidence of such a

trend (Chodkiewicz et al., 2020). To the extent that residential and non-residential alcohol

consumption are differentially conducive to violence -- especially domestic violence --

the pandemic provides an unfortunate but unique opportunity to better understand the

extent to which venue of alcohol consumption differentially affects violence. We test this

hypothesis by merging public microdata on 911 calls for police service in Detroit, MI, with

newly available­and remarkably detailed­geo-location data that allows us to measure daily

visits to bars and liquor stores. We study whether Michigan's March 2020 stay-at-home

order -- which led to a dramatic reduction in drinking at bars and restaurants -- changed

the relationship between alcohol purchases and community violence. Consistent with prior

research, during the pre-pandemic period, we observe a positive relationship between visits

to both bars and liquor stores and general violence. After the onset of the COVID-19

pandemic and the subsequent stay-at-home order issued by Michigan Governor Gretchen

Whitmer, there is evidence that the relationship between alcohol consumption and violence

-- especially domestic violence -- strengthens considerably. This effect is especially large

for visits to liquor stores which account for the majority of alcohol purchases in the post-

pandemic period and is even stronger when we flexibly account for temporal spillovers

from alcohol purchases. We find considerably more limited evidence for a change in the




                                             3
relationship between alcohol purchases and non-domestic assaults, which is consistent with

the idea that alcohol consumption at home has a particularly close nexus to domestic

violence.

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present our data

and empirical models. Section 3 presents our findings and Section 4 concludes.



2       Data and Methods

2.1     Data

2.1.1    Customer Visit Data


We measure the number of visits to establishments that sell alcohol using data from Safe-

Graph's Patterns platform, which organizes location data for commercial points of interest

(POIs). The SafeGraph data consists of high-resolution cellular device location data that

link tracked mobile devices to specific commercial establishments in space and time. The

data combine information on more than 4 million POIs in the US with visit patterns col-

lected by SafeGraph using location tracking apps. The data contain information on POI

location name, address, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code,

brand association, and business descriptor categories as well as the volume of daily visits to

each establishment. We restrict the data to visits to POIs within Detroit determined by zip

code. Using NAICS codes, we further restrict the data to POI visits associated with sale or

service of alcohol. These include grocery stores (NAICS 445110, 445120, 445210, 445220,

445230, 44591, 445292)1 ; bars and restaurants with an explicit focus on alcoholic beverages


    1
    Full-line grocery stores in Michigan may be licensed to sell all alcohol. Our definition of grocery extends
beyond full-line grocery stores, including specialty stores that may carry alcohol as well.


                                                      4
(NAICS 722410, 722511)2 ; full service restaurants excluding bars (NAICS 722511); and

beer, wine, and liquor stores (NAICS 445310, henceforth liquor stores). We aggregate the

daily number of visits by type of establishment within each zip code. The choice of geo-

graphic unit is constrained by the 911 calls data, discussed below; the choice of time unit is

conditioned by our desire to use highly granular time fixed effects to remove variation due

to confounding factors which are more likely to co-move within a week. While SafeGraph

data does provide the census block group of visitors to the alcohol outlets, we are unable

to use this information as it is available only aggregated to the week.

    While the SafeGraph data allow us to identify foot traffic to alcohol outlets with re-

markable granularity, they are subject to three important limitations. First, we are unable

to track every cellular phone in the United States. While this could potentially lead to

selection bias, we note that SafeGraph's internal research has found that the sample of

users is representative of the US population at the census block group level.3 Second, these

data do not constitute a comprehensive count of visits to a particular POI, as they are not

based on the universe of cellular devices, nor do they capture visits by individuals without

cellular devices. To address this limitation, our analysis focuses on changes in the volume

of visits, rather than the number of visits. Finally, visits to alcohol outlets do not allow

us to observe the amount of alcohol purchased or when it was consumed. While this is a

notable limitation, our estimates -- which relate violence to the number of visits to alco-

hol outlets -- nevertheless constitute prima facie evidence that violence is sensitive to the

timing and location of alcohol purchases. We further note that if there is imperfect corre-

   2
      Because NAICS 722410 only includes establishments that serve alcohol but no food, we extended
the definition of bars to include full-line restaurants with the following terms in their business descriptor
categories: "Bar or Pub", "Cocktail", "Sports Bar", "Dive Bar", "Brewery".

spondence between the visit data and alcohol consumption, and as long as the errors are

uncorrelated with community violence, this generates a conservative bias in our "reduced

form" estimates.


2.1.2   911 Call Data


We measure violence known to law enforcement using 911 call data from the City of Detroit

Open Data Portal. The 911 calls for service dataset compiles all emergency calls requiring

law enforcement response as well as officer-initiated calls for service in the City of Detroit.

Between January 1, 2019 and June 10, 2020 there were 1,471,211 calls for emergency ser-

vice. The dataset includes two types of calls: (1) emergency response calls, which result from

people requesting police services by calling 911 directly, and (2) officer-initiated calls, which

document policing activities such as traffic stops, street investigations, and other situations

where a police officer initiates the response. For each call, we observe the responding agency,

zip code of incident, information about the agency (precinct, responding unit), date of inci-

dent, information about response to the incident (time on scene, total response time, total

time, travel time, intake time), and information regarding the nature of the call (call code

number, call description). We use a combination of call code numbers and call descriptions

to identify which assault calls can be attributed to domestic violence and which cannot.

We define non-domestic assault as either felonious assault         4   or assault and battery 5 . We

define domestic violence as calls concerning inter-partner and intra-household violence, in-

cluding child or adult abuse with or without a weapon, with or without a report.6 We sum

domestic violence calls and assaults to the uniquely identified zip code, year, month, and

                                                  6
day. Our analysis is based on 26 zip codes tracked across 552 days, totalling 14,352 zip code

observations per day between January 1, 2019 and July 4, 2020.


2.1.3   Descriptive Analysis


Figure 1 presents unadjusted trends in domestic assault (Panel A) and non-domestic

assault (Panel B) along with the liquor store share of visits to outlets that sell alcohol. Both

panels provide evidence of substantial seasonal variation in violence, with both domestic

and non-domestic assaults peaking in the summer months and reaching their lowest points

between November and March. While non-domestic assaults increased in summer 2020

to levels comparable to those in summer 2019, domestic assaults are noticeably higher in

summer 2020. In accordance with emerging literature on this topic (Boserup et al., 2020;

Leslie and Wilson, 2020a), the figure thus provides suggestive evidence that, unlike general

forms of violence, domestic violence has increased during the pandemic, even after taking

seasonal trends into account.

   The figure also suggests that the sources of alcohol consumption have changed markedly.

Prior to the onset of the pandemic the relative share of visits to liquor stores was remarkably

stable, at approximately 30%. As stay-at-home orders closed bars and restaurants, liquor

stores became the main venue of alcohol sales. By May 2020, liquor stores accounted for

over 70% of all visits to alcohol outlets. Taken together, the two series suggest that domestic

violence might be particularly sensitive to venue of alcohol consumption.

   Next, in Table 1, we present summary statistics for our zip-code-by-date-level analytic

dataset. We report descriptive statistics for the entire city (Panel A) as well as for zip codes

with a higher than median number of 911 calls for violence (Panel B) and a lower than

median number of 911 calls for violence (Panel C). With respect to pre-pandemic visits, we


                                               7
observe 235 daily visits to restaurants, 99 daily visits to food stores, 90 daily visits to bars,

and 35 daily visits to liquor stores in an average zip code. As the SafeGraph data allow us

to observe only a fraction of all visits, these numbers do not have a direct interpretation.

However, ratios and trends are highly instructive. In the pre-pandemic period, there were

2.5 visits to bars for every visit to a liquor store. Since the onset of the pandemic, the

ratios have reversed. In the post-March 2020 period, there has been a notable decline in

the number of visits to alcohol outlets. However, while visits to bars have declined by more

than 80 percent, visits to liquor stores have declined by around one third. These declines

are consistent with an overall decline in consumer activity, as evidenced from large declines

in the number of customer visits to restaurants and food outlets. In subsequent analyses,

we control for visits to restaurants and food outlets in order to account for the large secular

decline in economic activity that has been brought about by the pandemic.


2.2      Empirical Methods

We study the effect of community-level alcohol sales on violence using natural variation

in the measured number of visits to alcohol outlets. We focus, in particular, on two types

of alcohol outlets: bars and liquor stores and two types of violence: domestic violence and

no-domestic assaults. In order to estimate the proportional change in violence with respect

to visits to alcohol outlets, we estimate Poisson regression models in which the count of 911

calls made in a zip code on a date is Yit .         7   In (1), Yit  Poisson(it ), is regressed on the

number of measured visits to each type of alcohol establishment. In order to account for

changing behavior introduced by stay-at-home orders, we interact the number of measured

visits for each type of alcohol establishment with an indicator for the post-March 10 period.

   7
       As a robustness check, we also estimate models via ordinary least squares.


                                                        8
We define the post-COVID period flexibly, dividing it into a March 10-May 25 period, when

the stay-at-home was in effect, and a May 26-June 10 period, when the order was lifted. In

practice, our empirical estimates focus on the stay-at-home period.

                j
In (1), V ISIT Sit is the daily number of measured visits in a given zip code to an estab-

lishment of type j . We include all establishments which serve alcohol ­ bars, liquor stores,

restaurants, and grocery stores. Though restaurants and grocery stores are not primarily

sources of alcohol sales, we include them for completeness. The post March 2020 period is

identified using P OSTi t indicator and interacted with the visit terms separated by alcohol

outlet type. In practice, we separate the pandemic into two post-periods, P OST 1it and

P OST 2it , which are equal to one for the time periods between March 10-May 25 and May
                                                                                        j

the incidence rate ratios for the pre-pandemic period and e are the incidence rate ratios

for the stay-at-home period. These coefficients provide an estimate of the elasticity of vio-

lence with respect to visits to each type of establishment. In auxiliary models, we allow for

temporal spillovers in the effect of alcohol consumption by including various lags for each

of the visit variables.

   In all models, we condition on Xit-1 , the number of shootings in a given zip code in

the previous day, a proxy for stress which may be induced by serious violence experienced



                                                     9
recently. We include zip code fixed effects, i , in order to absorb time-invariant character-

istics across zip codes in Detroit and day-by-month fixed effects and year fixed effects, t ,

which account for daily variation in citywide crime trends. In practice, we utilize an addi-

tional innovation, allowing t to vary according to whether a zip code's baseline number of

911 calls for violence is above or below the median. This innovation is notable in that it

allows us to account for events, whether observable or not, which vary over time and and

have differing effects on relatively poor and relatively affluent communities. For example,

though the post-pandemic period coincides with the a number of protests associated with

police killings of Black civilians, to the extent that such events have similar effects across

similar neighborhoods, they are accounted for by the interacted fixed effects. In all models,

standard errors are clustered at the zip code level to account for both heteroskedasticity

and arbitrary serial correlation in the error terms for observations in the same geographic

unit measured at different time periods (Bertrand et al., 2004).

   While the data allow us to identify foot traffic to alcohol outlets with remarkable granu-

larity, the data do have several limitations. First, as not every cellular phone in the United

States is tracked with these data, our measure of visits is imperfect. To the extent that

there are systematic errors in the data, this could lead to bias in our estimates. That said,

we note that as long as errors in the data are unrelated to violence -- and we have no rea-

sons to suspect that they are -- this will bias our estimates downward (Hyslop and Imbens,

2001; Chalfin and McCrary, 2018). As such, our estimates may, if anything, be conservative.

Second, while we argue that visits to alcohol outlets are a reasonable proxy for the volume

of alcohol consumed, we are unable to measure the amount of alcohol purchased or when it

was consumed. Since liquor purchased at liquor stores can be consumed for a long period




                                             10
of time after purchase, our proxy for alcohol consumption is imperfect. In order to address

this issue, we test for lagged effects of visits to alcohol outlets and find some evidence of

delayed effects.

    Before presenting results, one more feature of the data requires discussion. The visit

data we use cover only a subset of cellular devices in the city of Detroit; consequently
        j
V ISIT Sit is measured with error. For any given establishment, these errors may be large,

so we aggregate the data up to the zip code to shrink the degree of any resulting bias.

Nevertheless, it is worth considering the extent to which our estimate of  j might be subject

to measurement error bias. We begin by noting that measurement errors that are persistent

across space and time -- for example, if data errors are more common in zip codes or on

days where traffic to alcohol outlets is high -- will be addressed by the fixed effects. That

is, zip-code and time-invariant measurement errors will not lead to bias in our estimates.

On the other hand, consider the possibility that the measurement errors are random. In

this case, the classical measurement error model will hold and our estimate of  j will be

attenuated toward zero; as such our estimates would be conservative (Wooldridge, 2002;

Cameron and Trivedi, 2005).8 Since we do not have a second measure of visits, we cannot

formally derive the magnitude of any attenuation that is present in the models. However,

given the relatively small degree of within-zip code heterogeneity in the visits data, the

scope for measurement error bias to be an important source of error in our estimates is

reduced.

3    Results

Our principal estimates are presented in Table 2. We report estimates from equation (1)

for the entirety of Detroit (Panel A) as well as for zip codes with higher than median 911

call volumes (Panel B) and lower than median 911 call volumes (Panel C). In each panel, we

present estimates separately for domestic and non-domestic assaults. We likewise present

estimates separately for both the pre-pandemic period (the  j terms in equation 1) and

the first part of the post-pandemic period (the  j terms in equation 1) for each of the four

types of establishment: bars, liquor stores, restaurants, and food outlets.

    With respect to domestic assaults, there is little evidence that domestic violence is re-

lated to either bar or liquor store visits prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we

observe that domestic violence calls rise with the number of visits to both bars and liquor

stores in the post-pandemic period. In particular, the elasticity of domestic violence calls

with respect to visits increases by approximately 0.049 for bars and 0.063 for liquor stores.

While these level changes are modest, we note that they are reduced forms and do not ac-

count for temporal spillovers in alcohol consumption. The sub-city analysis indicates that

the relationship between liquor store visits and domestic violence is particularly strong in

low-crime zip codes, while the relationship between bar visits and domestic violence is par-

ticularly strong in high-crime zip codes. In contrast to domestic assaults, the relationship

between visits to alcohol outlets and non-domestic assaults does not strengthen significantly

in the post-pandemic period. As such, even though alcohol consumption may interact pos-

itively with pandemic-induced stress, this has not led to an increase in alcohol-induced

violence more generally.

    While we condition on a granular set of fixed effects, concerns about omitted variable



                                             12
bias may remain. In order to test for the possibility that the effects we observe are part and

parcel of broader trends in economic activity and the movement of people in a community,

we consider whether domestic violence is impacted by visits to restaurants and food stores.

As expected, we find little evidence of a positive relationship between restaurants or food

outlets and violence, whether residential or non residential, pre- or post-pandemic.

    Because alcohol purchased at a liquor store can be consumed for a period of time after

its purchase, we next consider the lagged effect of visits to alcohol outlets. We run an

auxiliary model in which we augment equation (1) to include the first and second lags of

visits to each type of commercial outlet in each time period studied. These terms allow us

to observe dynamic correlations between violence and alcohol purchases made in the prior

two days. We present these results in Table 3. In the table, we present the cumulative effect

of three consecutive days of visits by summing coefficients on concurrent and two lagged

effects. The cumulative coefficients are presented for bars and liquor stores only. For bars,

the estimates presented in Table 3 are twice as large as those in Table 2, offering evidence in

favor of temporal spillovers. On the other hand, for liquor stores, the estimates in Table 3 are

approximately 50% larger than those in Table 2, indicating that the elasticities reported in

Table 2 are conservative estimates of the effect of alcohol consumption on domestic violence.



4    Discussion

In this research, we show that the relationship between visits to alcohol outlets and domestic

violence -- but not other forms of violence -- has grown considerably stronger since March

2020. Our conclusions are based on newly-available data provided by SafeGraph that allow

us to estimate daily changes to the number of visitors to establishments selling alcohol. Due



                                              13
to the remarkable resolution of the data, we are able to construct a daily proxy for alcohol

consumption in each community, a measure that researchers have long wished to use but

which has, until recently, been impossible to collect due to technological limitations.

   Why has alcohol consumption become riskier during the pandemic? We offer three rea-

sons. First, the location of alcohol consumption changed markedly since stay-at-home orders

took effect. Whereas liquor stores accounted for only 28 percent of visits to alcohol outlets

in the pre-pandemic period, since March 2020 this proportion has more than doubled to

nearly 60 percent. Second, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to job loss, economic hard-

ship, and a great deal of stress as families struggle to cope with considerable disruptions

to their daily lives. While it is easy to imagine that these factors have led to an increase

in violence in the absence of alcohol, it also stands to reason that they have made alcohol

consumption riskier. Finally, stay-at-home orders have mechanically increased the amount

of time that people are spending at home (Peterman et al., 2019). As such, the opportunity

for problematic drinking to lead to family violence has increased. At the same time, we

observe little evidence that the relationship between alcohol and other types of violence has

changed since the COVID-19 pandemic. As such it appears as though the pandemic has

caused a substitution of violence away from acquaintances and strangers and toward family

members.

   Beyond developing a deeper understanding of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,

this research contributes to the large literature that studies geo-spatial correlations between

the location of alcohol outlets and violence (Gruenewald et al., 2006; Franklin et al., 2010;

Grubesic and Pridemore, 2011; Roman and Reid, 2012). By leveraging highly granular visit

data and exploiting changes in the density of visits over time, we are able to draw stronger




                                              14
causal inferences about the relationship between alcohol outlets and community violence.

Our estimates suggest that regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic, visits to bars and liquor

stores lead to increased violence, providing more credible evidence that prior evidence is

not merely correlational.

   This research likewise helps to deepen our understanding of the nature of domestic

violence, suggesting that the venue of alcohol consumption, rather than merely the volume

of alcohol consumed may be a principal driver of household violence. The idea that venue

may be an important characteristic of alcohol consumption can be found in research on the

minimum legal drinking age (Chalfin et al., 2019) and is likewise implicated in research that

suggests that family violence is triggered by frustration such as that which is generated by

an unexpected football loss (Card and Dahl, 2011). However, thus far, this has been mostly

a topic of speculation and has been subject to little empirical testing. Our principle finding

-- that the relationship between alcohol purchases and domestic violence but not other

forms of violence -- has grown considerably stronger since the pandemic, is among the

most direct evidence, to date, that venue matters.

     Note: Estimates are from Poisson regressions of the daily count of 911 calls for assault in a zip code on the number of visits to bars, alcohol outlets,
     restaurants and food outlets in that zip code. Panel A includes data for all of Detroit during the January 2019-July 2020 period. Panel B includes
     zip codes where the number of domestic assault calls is above the median in the sample; Panel C includes zip codes where the number of domestic
     assault calls is below the median in the sample. In each model, we condition on zip code and year and month-day fixed effects; In Panel A, we allow
     the month-day fixed effects to vary according to whether a zip code is above or below the city's median crime rate. In all models, standard errors are
     clustered at the zip code level. Significance: * p <0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.
