                             Marriage Patterns in the
                                  United States



                                     ABSTRACT




             This paper analyzes cohort marriage patterns in the United States in

order to determine whether declining rates of first marriage are due to

changes in the timing of marriage, the incidence of marriage, or both.

Parametric models, which are well—suited to the analysis of censored or trun-

cated data, are fit separately to information on age at first marriage derived

from three data sets which were collected independently and at different points

in time.     Extended versions of the models are also estimated in which the param-

eters of the model distributions are allowed to depend on social and, economic

variables.     The results provide evidence that the incidence of first marriage is

declining and that there is only a slight tendency for women to delay marriage.

In addition, education is the most important correlate of decisions about the

timing of first marriage whereas race is the most important correlate of deci-

sions about its incidence.

1.   Introduction

            Since the late 1960s, the rate of first marriages experienced by

individuals aged fourteen and over has declined substantially in the United

States (see Figure I).      This pattern, which has been characteristic ot both

men and women and has been quite steady over time, has contributed to the

increasing proportion of single young adults in the population. According to

some researchers, these facts reflect changes in the timing of marriage, and

not changes in its ultimate incidence.     For example, according to Cherlin

(1981, p. ii), "The higher proportion ot single young adults in the 1970s and

early 1930s suggests only that they are marrying later, not foregoing

marriage.    It is unlikely that their litetime proportions marrying will tall

below the historical minimum bf QO percent."      Indeed, as Figure II shows, the

median age at first marriage increased by more than one year tor both males and

temales during the 1970s.

            On the other hand, other researchers such as Becker (1981) present

theoretical nx1e1s which suggest that the recent trends are primarily reflec-

tive ot changes in the incidence ot marriage since the rising economic status

ot women leaves them with less incentive to enter traditional marriages.

These researchers are also quick to point out that a secular increase in the

median age at first nnrriage is consistent with a decline in the proportion of

individuals who ever marry, and not only with the phenomenon ot delayed

marriage.

            Implicit in both ot these views are projections ot the tuture time

series ot marriage rates.     For example, it marriage rates have declined mainly

because of an increasing tendency to delay marriage, the rates should soon
                                        —3--



begin to rise as the delayers reach their desired ages of first marriage.

Alternatively, if the decline is mostly the result of an increasing proportion

of women deciding to (or, by default, just happening to) forego marriage, then

marriage rates will tend to remain depressed in the future.

            The purpose of this paper is to analyze recent nuptiality patterns

in the United States in an attempt to distinguish between these alternative

vieis   of recent marriage trends. We   do this by using a parametric model to

analyze survey data on age at first marriage for successive birth cohorts.

Because the model is parametric, it allows us to project marriage rates for

cohorts which have yet to complete their first marriage experience and to

thereby estimate their mean age at marriage and the proportion ultimately

marrying.    We also estimate an extended version of this model in which the

parameters are allowed to depend on social and economic variables such as race

and education.    In this way, we investigate the correlates of the timing and

incidence of marriage for a succession of birth cohorts.

            Section II provides a brief description of the parametric model we

use to represent the underlying pattern of age at first marriage; this section

also discusses both the extension of the rrridel to incorporate covariate effects

and maximum likelihood estimation from truncated and non—truncated data sets.

Section III describes the three data sets used in this study. Section IV pre-

sents and discusses the results of fitting various specifications of the model

to cohort data in each of these data sets; this section also examines the sen-

sitivity of our results to the degree of censoring.    Section V discusses our

results and comments on their implications for the evolution of nuptiality pat-

terns in the United States.1

II.      The Model

              In 1971, Ansley Coale observed that age distributions of first

marriages are structurally similar in difterent populations.         As shown by Coale,

these distributions tend to be smooth, unimodal, skewed to the right, and have

density close to zero below age fifteen and above age fifty. Coale also

observed that the differences in age—at—irarriage distributions across female

populations are largely accounted tor by difterences in their means, their

standard      deviations, and their cunnxlativ-e values at the older ages, e.g., age

fifty.     As a basis for the application of these observations, Coale

constructed a standard schedule of age at first nnrriage using data from

Sweden,     1865—69.

             Coale and McNeil    (1972)   subsequently developed a closed—form

expression which closely replicates the reference distribution presented by

Coale     (1971)


             g(x)      O.196exp{—.171i(x—6.o6)_exp_2.B81(x_6.o5)]}                 (1)



This tunction can be related to any observed distribution by adjusting its

location and dispersion, and its cumulative value as x +        . The    particular

form of the rde1 that we shall use, which characterizes any observed distri-

bution,    was derived by Rodriguez and Trussell (1980)

             g(a)                                                                  (2)



where g(a) is the proportion marrying at age a in the observed population and
ii, a, and E are, respectively, the mean and standard deviation ot      age   at
marriage (for those who ever rnrry) and the proportion ever marrying.
                                           —5—



              It   is interesting to note that Coale and McNeilTs model distribution

of first marriage by age (e.g., equation (1)) arises as the convolution of an

infinite number of mean—corrected exponential distributions whose parameters

increase     in arithmetic sequence. Moveover, Coale and McNeil have shown that
this distribution is very closely approximated by the convolution of the three
exponential distributions with the largest exponents (in the infinite sequence)
and a normal distribution.       This latter property of the Coale—MeWeil model
gives rise to an appealing behavioral interpretation of the model. According
to   this interpretation, each of the three exponential distributions charac-

terizes the waiting time between two premarital stages (i.e., between the com-

mencement of dating and ultimately meeting one's spouse, between meeting the

spouse and engagement, and between engagement and marriage); the norm.1

distribution describes the age of entry of women into the marriage market.

This interpretation received some empirical support in the original paper by

Coale and McNeil in a direct test using data on the length of time that a

sample of French husbands and wives knew each other before marrying.

Subsequent     research,   however, has done little to confirm or     deny the beha-
vioral interpretation of the model.        Nevertheless,     a number of studies have
provided additional support for the ability of the model to fit first marriage
data   (see, e.g., Ew1ank,     1974;   Rodriguez    and Trussell, 1980; Trussell, 1980;

and Trussell and Bloom, 1983) . To some extent, the good fit my be due to the

flexihility of three—parameter models       to     fit distributions that are smooth,

unimodal, and skewed to the right.         It is also likely that the Coale—MeNeil

model performs well because it is based on the marriage rates for an actual

population.        In other words, even though the true model generating a given
                                               —6—


distribution of marriage rates is unknown, the Coale—Metleil model may fit well

 (and better than a purely theoretical model such as that due to Hernes (1972)

or purely ad hoc empirical TrxDdel such as that due to Keeley (1979)) because

the true model is captured implicitly in the rates on which it (i.e., the

Coale—MeMeil model) is based.2

            The parameters of equation (2) may be estimated in a variety of ways

depending on the nature of the available data (see Rodriguez and Trussell

(1980)   for further details) .       In   the present application we shall work with

survey data on age at first marriage for individual women and will use a maximum

likelihood estimator. Thus, for a sample of all—women (i.e., a random sample

of ever—married and never—married women in some population or cohort), we will

estimate ji,   a,   and E by maximizing the following log likelihood function:


            log LA =   1og    g(a'     i.i,a,E) +   )1ogI1—G(a7]   ii,a,E)I,      (3)
                      leM                           iM
where a1 is age at first nnrriage for those individuals who have married (the set

N),      is age at the time of survey for never—married individuals (the set

and GN) is the cumulative distribution function for the density function g(')

expressed in equation       (2) .   Observe   that the second summation on the right

hand side of equation (3) accounts for censoring which will be present to the

extent that not all women who ultimately do marry will have done so by the

time of the survey.

            Alternatively, for a sample or ever—married women we employ a con-

ditional likelihood function which is constructed from the likelihoods of

individualsT    usrrying at particular ages (a) conditional on their having

married by their age on the date of the interview:
                                            —7—



           log M =      [log g(a') -   log G(a)I.                                   Pd


 Observe that this function does not depend on the parameter E, because E is a

 proportionality factor in both g() and G() and therefore cancels when the

 conditional likelihood (i.e., g(a)/G(4)) is expressed. This formulation

 therefore corrects for the truncation of never—married women, although the

 parameter E is not estimable from the truncated data.

           Following Trussell and Bloom (1983),we extend this model to allow

 for •coyariate effects by specifying a functional relationship between the

 parameters of the model distribution and a set of covariates. For example, we

 may specify these relationships in linear form as follows:



            s. =
               1
                   La
                    1


           a
               1   1


           E. = W.y


                             — X,. ,   1,   and
 where i denotes individual 1,                    W. are the vector values of charac-
                                 1                 1

 teristics of that individual that determine respectively,                and        and

 a, , and y, are the associated parameter vectors to be estimated. Because of
 the modelTs inherent nonlinearity, the parameters are identified even if all of

 the covariate vectors are the same.        Standard statistical tests   (t—tests    and

likelihood ratio tests) can, however, be used to assess the validity of dif-

 ferent exclusion restrictions   (e.g., a. = C and E. = E for all

           All of the maximum likelihood estimates presented in this paper were

 computed using the Davidon—Fletcher—Powell routine contained in the numerical

optimization     package     GQOPT.     This routine is described in Goldfeld and Quandt

(1972,     pp. 5-P).


III.      The Data

             As noted in Section I, this study uses three independent data sets

to investigate the narriage patterns of American women. The use of multiple

data sets is prompted by the fact that no single data set is uniquely well—

suited to the tasks at hand.             In addition, we teel that the consistency ot

results derived from difterent sources ot intormation, collected at difterent

points in time, is an important indication ot their strength.               The remainder

ot this section provides descriptions ot the three data sets.



         A. National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), Cycle II

             Cycle II of the NSFG was conducted in 1976 by the National Center

for Health Statistics through personal interviews with 8,611 women aged 15b1

years.     For the purposes ot this study, the NSFG is usetul because it provides

data on a representative sample ot ever—married women with intormation on age at

first narriage along with several socioeconomic variables which presumably

influence age at marriage.             These variables and the coding scheme adopted tor

them are:      race (black or non—black), religion        (Catholic or non—Catholic),

childhood residence        (rural     or urban), and education at time ot survey (less

than high school, high school, greater than high school) .            All   women aged

2O_1i. at the time of the survey who first married between ages 12 and 1 are

included in our data file.             Because we do not have information on a represen-

tative sample of never—married women, we cannot estimate the parameter E
(i.e., the proportion ever—marrying) tram this sample; nor can we estimate

its   covariates.    However,     as discussed above, consistent estimates at the

parameters i and 0     and      their covariates can still be computed provided this

sample selection rule is explicitly incorporated in the estimation procedure

(which we do when we analyze the NSFG data) .         Observations   were counted more

or less heavily depending on their sample weights, with the weights adjusted

to have mean unity.



      B. Current Population Survey (cPs)

              The CPS is a nationwide sample survey conducted nDnthly by the

Bureau at the Census.        It involves detailed personal interviews in about

70,000 households during which intarmatian an a variety at demographic,

social, and economic variables is recorded.          The unit at observation is the

individual; the sample universe consists at all persons living in the surveyed

households.

              In the June, 1982 CPS, the normal set of questions was supplemented

with a. set of retrospective rinrital history questions.         Included an the

supplementary survey instrument was a question on age at first narriage which

was asked of all women 'aged 13—75. Untartunately, there are tew retrospec-

tive covariates in the CPS that could sensibly be hypothesized to affect age

at marriage.      However, we have constructed the tallawing two variables:         race

(black, non—black) and education at time at survey (less than high school,

high school, greater than high school).

              Although the CPS data set permits estimation of only two covariate

ettects, it is extremely useful in this study because (a) it refers to all
                                       -10—


women, (b) it includes an exceptionally large number of observations, and (a)

it is very recent.    As with the NSFG, sample weights were used in creating

this data tile after adjusting them so they average to one.



        C. National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) of Young Women

            This survey has been conducted annually since 1968 when it started

with 5,159 women aged 14-24.    The main purpose of this survey has been to

gather longitudinal intormation on a wide range ot socioeconomic variables

for use in analyzing the labor market experiences of young women.    In 1978, a

complete reinterview ot the original sample ot women was conducted which

included a question on age at first marriage.    We have used this intormation,

along with information on number of rinrriages and marital status from each prior

wave ot this survey (tor ever—married women who tailed to report their age at

first marriage in 1978), to construct a data set on age at first marriage for

women aged 2b—35 in 197'8.

            In comparison to the NSFG and CPS data, the NES data are more usetul

because they contain intormation on two socioeconomic variables relevant to a

study ot age at first marriage that are not available in the 'other two data

sets.    This intormation reters to the occupation ot the respondent's tather

(i.e., blue collar or not) and to the structure ot the respondent's tamily when

she was age 14 (i.e., both parents present or not) .   In addition, the NLS

includes information on race    (black or non—black), childhood residence (rural
or urban), and education at time ot survey (less than high school; equal to

high school; greater than high school). The IlLS does, however, have several

weaknesses in that it does not include information about religion, it has a
                                          —11—


smaller sample size than the CPS, and it refers to a narrower group of ages

than either the NSFG or the CPS. The NLS data ray also be a nonrepresentative

sample of the population because of sample attrition, although the 1918 file

includes infornation on 79 percent of the original NLS participants.



IV.     Results

        A. Estimates Computed Without Covariates


             We first fit the Coale—McNeil model without covariates to data from

the NSFG, CPS, and NLS in order to ascertain the general trends in marriage

patterns     across cohorts.   The fact that we do not include covariates in the

estimation procedure implies that we treat the parameters U, J, and E as

constants, i.e., U, a, and E are not allowed to depend on individual charac-

teristics.

              These preliminary results derived from the three data sets are pre-

sented in Table I.      Since the NSFG and CPS data were collected at points in

time    six years apart, we have created age groups such that cohorts can be
followed over the six-year period.       Our confidence in the estimates of U   and C

would be enhanced if     the   estimates were similar for each cohort across data
sets.
             Despite conventional wisdom that age at first rTflrriage has been

increasing dramatically in this era of increased labor force participation and

careerism    among women, we find that the mean age at first rrrtiage has
remained quite stable Tacross cohorts.      Results from the NSFG indicate that U
has    increased by only 'one year over cohorts born 20 years apart. Estimates of
ii derived from the CPS and NTJS indicate perhaps even smaller increases over
                                         -.12—



time,
             In comparing the results from the NSFG and the CPS we see a

remarkable consistency in the estimates of p and a,      Estimates of U are very

similar across data sets and are essentially constant across cohorts.

Estimates of p are virtually identical between data sets for the younger

cohorts and diverge slightly tor the older cohorts.      This divergence may be

accounted for in part by sampling variability since the estimated standard error

of p for the L6—50 year aids in the CPS is .01 and for the 1O—1t1t years olds in

the NSFG, .11).

             Another prominent feature of Table I are the estimates of E derived

from the CPS data.     The parameter E cannot, ot course, be estimated from the

NSFG because the sample consists only of ever—married women. From the CPS

results,     however, we can clearly see a monotonic, downward trend across

cohorts in the proportion ot women who will ultimately marry.      it appears that

only 1 percent of those who were in their late GO's in 1982 will never marry,

whereas as many as 13 percent of those in their late 20's will remain

unmarried.     The estimates of E also decline across the two ¶3 cohorts.

Moreover, they are extremely close to the CPS estimates for roughly the same

cohorts.

             It should be emphasized that the strong agreement among the

results derived from the three data sets—points toward the overall robustness

ot the estimates.     The fact that different data were used, obtained at dif—

terent points in time, and that estimates were derived using somewhat dit—

ferent nrdels (i.e., with regard to the difterent likelihood tunctions
                                             —13—



employed in order to account for the differing nature of the two samples ——

one     of all women and one of only ever—married women) adds to our overall con-

fidence in the parameter estimates. Of course, it is possible that the model

fits the data poorly, hut in roughly the same way across data sets. To exa-

mine this possibility, we have calculated observed marriage rates by age for

the four oldest cohorts in the CPS data and have plotted these in Figure III

in relation to the estimated models. Although the ttdels tend to underpredict

the proportion of marriages occurring at the modal age at marriage, they do

correspond to the data quite closely, and especially in the tails ot the

distributions.       Thus, it appears that equation (2) does indeed provide a

satistactory fit to the data.


B. Estimates Computed with Covariates

             We now introduce covariates into the specification of i. Table            II,

which reports estimates computed from the 19T6 NSFG, reveals that the effects of

three      covariates--Black,     Catholic, and Rural--are statistically significant,        but


substantively      trivial.      In contrast, the impact ot education on age at first

marriage     is   substantial.    Women who are high school graduates with no further

education marry approximately two years later, on average, than women with less

education (controlling tor race,          religion, and childhood residence) .   The   mean

age at first marriage of women with education beyond high school is nearly four

years higher than that ot women who are not high school graduates.

              Table III reports parameter and hyperparaneter estimates computed

using   data from the 1982       CPS.   In the first nodel we estimate, we allow p     to
depend on covariates while C and E are assumed to be constant across all Indivi-

duals in the sample.        The results generated by fitting this first model are

qualitatively similar to those obtained using data from the NSFG. Given that a.

women   eventually rtrries, whether she is black has little bearing in and of
itself on when she marries. However,        educational   attainment has a significant
positive effect on age at msrriage.5
            In   addition to allowing Ii to vary among subgroups of the population,

in   our second ndel we permit E     to depend on covariates.     The striking result is

that while ji    is   strongly associated with educational level, E is not: With the

exception of the most recent cohorts, education is either statistically insigni-

ficant in its association with proportions ever—marrying or the association is

of small enough magnitude to be of little substantive interest.

           On the other hand, among younger cohorts of women, race is strongly

correlated with the probabilty of ever—marrying.          The correlation was minimal

for the oldest cohort in our study.       Thus, race has been of increasing impor-

tance in differentiating those who will rarry from those who will not.

           Results derived from the 1QIB NLS, as shown in Table IV, while

somewhat difficult to compare with the results in Tables II and III, reveal pat-

terns of nuptiality that are similar to those revealed by estimates computed

from the other data sets.        Education is positively associated with the age at

which a woman marries and negatively associated with her propensity to marry.

Here, too, we see that being black is associated with a substantially reduced

probabilty of ever—marrying, yet has a trivial association with the age at which

one marries (conditioned upon marrying).6
                                           —15—


            The additional variables incorporated in the more complex model are

substantively (and in narl3r cases, statistically)      insignificant.   For example, it

appears that        variables which measure parental background (e.g., the blue collar

—    white collar variable) are minor factors in the determination of age at

marriage.    Moreover, the fact that the marriage of a woman's parents dissolved

sometime prior to her adolescence has only a small negative association with the

age at which she marries.        We might speculate that, under the (debatable)

assumption that young women with single parents find their home lite less

pleasant than it would he otherwise, these women are motivated to leave home

earlier than their counterparts who have parents with intact marriages.

Traditionally,       marriage has been one mechanism by which a woman can leave home

at an early age, although marriage is increasingly less necessary in recent

years tor her to do so.



C.    Sensitivity     Analysis

            Since many of the parameter estimates reported in Tables II—IV are

computed from data that are either truncated, censored, or both, their reliabi-

lity is heavily dependent on the statistical structure which we have imposed on

the data.     To some extent, the underlying structure is supported by the reaso-

nably close fits of the model to the data as shown in Figure III. The closeness

of the parameter and hyperparameter estimates derived from different riatasets

collected at difterent points in time provides turther support tor the model.

However, one additional test ot the adequacy ot the model seems appropriate and

has been conducted.        This test essentially involves censoring intormation on

first marriages that took place in the last ten years ot the data and fitting
the model to the artificially censored data to see how well the estimates

predict     actual experience.

             We have carried out this experiment using the CPS data. Estimates

were computed for cohorts aged                   41—45, and 6—o in 1982, using data on

their first narriage experience as of 1972. These estimates are reported in

Table V for what we found to be the strictest form of this test of the model:

estimates of the extended version of equation (2) which allow for covariate

eftects.

             The estimates in Table V may be compared to those presented in the

last three columns ot Table III.              In general, the estimates computed tor indivi-

dual cohorts as ot 1972 tend to be quite close to those computed using ten years

ot additional marriage experience.              Indeed, the estimates ot the covariate

effects on p and their standard errors are extremely close and would support

identical       substantive    conclusions.    The estimates of a and of the covariate

eftects on E are a bit tarther apart, although not seriously so given the small

absolute magnitudes ot what appear to be statistically significant difterences.

Thus, on balance, we believe the results of this test provide further support for

the ability of the nDdel to fit censored data.


V. Discussion and Conclusion

             Changes in the marriage process can be decomposed into two distin-

guishable     phenomena:      changes in the timing ot marriage and changes in its

overall     incidence.     Period or cross—sectional data relating to these phenomena—

whether first marriage rates, the proportion ever—married in a particular age

group, or the mean age at marriage, tor example——are often misleading in their

implications.       It would be desirable to interpret the various changes we find in
                                        —17-



marriage statistics as reflective ot changes in lite cycle patterns at women.

In a period of potentially unstable nuptiality patterns, the only valid

interpretations are those interred from cohort—based data.         In this analy-

sis we have examined nuptiality patterns of cohorts of American women using data

from the 1976 NSFG, the 1982 CPS, and the 1978 NLS. Implementing a parametric

model, 'we can project the currently incomplete marriage experience of cohorts.

In this fashion, we can estimate the mean age at marriage and the proportion

ever—marrying in young cohorts today.     Thus, we can resolve in good part some of

the arguments in the literature concerning the current and future trends in the

timing and incidence at tirst marriages in the United States.

          We have found that age at first marriage has been quite stable across

birth cohorts spanning twenty years.     However,   the   proportions   ever—marrying

have changed substantially over time:     The proportion of women ultimately never—

marrying will be three times as high for women 26 to 30 years of age in 1982 as

for those 46 to 50 in that year.

          Several additional major tindings emerge in our analysis when we tit

an extended version at the nuptiality model to the three data sets.         Educational

attainment has a strong positive association with the age at which women marry,

given that they nnrry. Further,    higher education is increasingly negatively

associated with the probability at ever—marrying among recent cohorts.          In addi-

tion, race was found to be a large and increasingly important correlate of a

woman's propensity to marry.   Far example, only 66 percent at black women aged

26 to 30 in 1982 who had not graduated high school can be expected to marry, as

compared with 91 percent at their white counterparts.

          Perhaps the mast interesting conclusion that can be drawn tram this
                                             —iR-.



analysis relates to the divergence ct         marriage and tertility patterns that is
now      underway.   For exarnipJ1ii, Bloomi (1i1) amil iBtiftu and •Tnisselr (14)) nprtL
strong evidence ot increasing permanent childlessness across cohorts ot American
women.       Indeed, the gap between proportions never marrying and proportions never
bearing children has increased from roughly 6 percent to 15 percent across the

cohorts analyzed in this study.          Thus, it appears that marriage is being

displaced     as the najor    choice   variable used to control fertility, in favor of
eftective contraception and abortion.          I" other words,   marriage   continues to be
the najor       institution   bringing substantial numbers of couples together,
although childbearing appears to be declining in its importance as a motive tor
the tormation ot those unions.

             1. All of our empirical efforts are focused on analyzing the

marriage patterns of American women, as appropriate data for American men are

ot insufticient quality (see,            e.g., Pendleton, McCarthy, and Cherlin, 198k).

See Rodgers and Thornton (1985) for the results of an attempt to fit parametric

models to survey data on age at marriage tor men (and women)


              2. Period factors, not modelled here, can worsen the fit of the model

to the data and increase the variance of projection errors by generating irregD—

larities in the uncensored portion of the first marriage distribution. However,

period tactors do not seem to be ot substantial importance during the time

period     under    consideration.



              3. Trussell and Bloom (1983) and S4irensen and            Srensen   (1981)

research the use of proportional hazard and general hazard models for estimating

the covariates ot age at first marriage.                 However, hazard models are not used in

this investigation because (i) these earlier studies provide no evidence that

they     fit marriage data better than the extended Coale—McNeil urdel, (2) hazard
'models cannot be fit         to    data for a sample of ever—married women, and (3)       hazard

models     cannot   be used    to    project the marriage experience of young cohorts.

              4.    Some of the 24—year olcis in 1968 had reached age 35 by the time

of the 1978 survey.


              5.    With the exception ot education, all ot the covariates used in

this study are measures which refer to the time of first marriage. Education is

defined as years ot schooling at the time ot the survey and not at the time ot
                                              —20-


the first marriage because we believe that the former measure is a (marginally)

superior social indicator and because it can be constructed for all three data

sets.         In   addition, in experiments conducted using the NLS data, we discovered

that parameter estimates differed trivially using the two alternative measures

ot education.          This finding should not be surprising since few women return to

school after their first marriage and since, of those women who do return to

school, very few shift across the broad educational categories which we have

defined.



                   6. Cross—cohort comparisons of the estimated education effects may be

somewhat biased by cross—cohort changes in mean educational attainment within

the education categories we use. For example, in the 1982 CPS, mean years ot

education was (by definition) unchanged across the cohorts we analyze for the

=US category,         but increased by 1.1 years for   the <HS category and by .2 years

for     the    >116 category.   Thus, the modest increase in estimated education eftects

across     cohorts is likely to underestimate the true increase since cross—cohort
growth in educational attainment within the reference category exceeded that in
the two other education categories.
