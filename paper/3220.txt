                         PARTICIPATION IN A CURRENCY UNION


                                        ABSTRACT

   When countries of different sizes participate in a cooperative agreement, the

potential gain from deviation determines the minimum power that each country re-

quires in the COmmon decision-making.

  This paper studies the problem in the context of a monetary union - multiple

countries sharing a common currency - whose very existence requires coordination

of monetary policies.   In the presence of externalities in the decentralized equi-

librium with national currencies, it is shown that a small economy will in general

require, and obtain, more than proportional power in the agreement.    With a Common

currency, this is equivalent to a transfer of seignorage revenues in its favor.

With national currencies such transfer would not obtain, and the small country

would be even more demanding.   Without additional unconstrained fiscal instruments

it would be impossible to sustain coordination with fixed exchange rates.   When

the number of potential countries in the union is large, it is not generally pos-

sible to prevent deviations from individual countries or from coalitions.    The

currency union might emerge as a mixed strategy equilibrium, but the probability

of deviation rises sharply with the number of countries and of possible coali-

tions.
