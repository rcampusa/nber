      In this paper, we argue that actuarial valuation of annuity benefit

streams is theoretically inconsistent with the assumption of pure life

cycle motives. Instead, we show that the simple discounted value of

future benefits (ignoring the possibility of death) is often a good

approximation to the relevant concept of value. This observation moti-

vates a re—examination of existing empirical evidence concerning the

effects of Social Security on personal savings, retirement, and the

distribution of wealth, as well as the proper computation of age—wealth

profiles. The conceptual points raised here are also relevant for eval-

uating the relative merits of wage and consumption taxes. In each case,

we argue that the use of simple, rather than actuarial discounting of

survival—contingent income streams dramatically alters the conclusions

of previous studies.

 I.    Introduction

      Most empirical analyses of the behavioral and distribution conse-

 quences of public retirement annuity provision (e.g. Social Security)

are based upon simple life cycle models where, in particular, individ-

uals have no bequest motives, and lifespans are certain. In moving from

tractable theoretical models to empirical implementation, such studies

typically accomodate uncertain lifespans by employing actuarial dis-

counting to compute the 'values' of annuity benefit streams (see, for

example, Feldstein's [191)4] analysis of personal savings). In this

paper, we argue that the practice of employing actuarial valuation can-

not be reconciled with models encompassing pure life cycle motives, and

that this practice systematically biases results in predictable direc-

tions. Instead, we show that under very general conditions (discussed

below), the simple discounted value of benefits (ignoring the possi-

bility of death) is ordinarily a good approximation to the relevant

concept of value.

      The intuition for these results is straightforward. Actuarial

valuation is appropriate only if annuity markets are perfect, in which

case positive holdings of bequeathable assets are inconsistent with pure

life cycle motives (see Yaari [1965]). To rescue the life cycle hypo-

thesis, it is necessary to assume a partial or complete failure of

annuity markets. In particular, one can explain the presence of

bequeathable wealth in either of two ways.

      First, one might assume that groups of individuals (typically

friends or family, who share private information concerning survival

probabilities) contrive imperfect substitutes for annuity markets by
                                    —2—



pooling risks. The 'value' of an annuity will then exceed its actuarial

value   by a risk premium, but the magnitude of this premium will be
related to the size of the group (in the limit, as   the   group becomes

infinitely   large, the premium shrinks to zero). Kotlikoff and Spivak

[19811 have shown that even relatively small groups manage to appro-

priate a large fraction of the potential surplus available from risk

sharing.

        It may, however, be difficult to enforce non—contractual agree-

ments between family members, other than spouses.--' Furthermore, there

is reason to believe that the advantages of risk pooling between spouses

may be overstated.--'1 In the absence of compelling empirical evidence

establishing the prevalence of such arrangements, it is therefore

important to consider the case in which imperfect substitutes for

annuity markets are unavailable; indeed, most theoretical and empirical

work in this area proceeds on this basis.

        When 'homemade' risk pooling arrangements are unavailable, posi-

tive holdings of bequeathable wealth can be reconciled with life cycle

motives only if annuity markets fail completely (Yaari [19651), or if

insurance market equilibrium involves quantity constraints, so that

annuities are unavailable on the margin. Under these circumstances, the

value of an annuity is suggested by the following hypothetical exercise:

how much bequeathable wealth would one have to give a life cycle saver

to compensate him for the loss of an annuity which pays $1 per year? A

bequeathable asset which pays $1 per year costs $1/r (where r is the

 rate of interest). Of course, it generates income even if the individ—
                                    —3—



 ual dies, while the annuity does not. However, this difference is

 irrelevant to the pure life cycle saver: both assets generate the same

 survival—contingent income stream, and the absence of annuity markets

 precludes the consumer from selling the death—contingent stream asso-

 ciated with his beq.ueathable asset. So far as he is concerned, the only

 relevant difference between these two assets is that he cannot consume

 the principal of the annuity (he cannot sell the rights to future

 benefits). But if the date at which he plans to drive his bequeathable

 wealth to zero is sufficiently distant, the benefits associated with

 being able to consume the principal of the marginal asset are negli-

 gible. In such cases, simple discounting of annuity benefits (computed

 as if the consumer will live forever) is therefore a good approximation

 to value.

       This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formalize

the preceeding argument within the context of a simple life cycle model

with an uncertain horizon. Annuity values are calculated for a range of

hypothetical parameter values. In Section 3, we discuss the implica-

tions of employing simple, rather than actuarial, valuation for several

empirical problem areas, including the effects of Social Security on

personal savings, retirement, and the distribution of wealth, as well as

the proper computation of age—wealth profiles. Our central results also

form the basis for some remarks concerning the comparison of wage and

consumption taxes. In each case, we argue that the use of simple,

rather than actuarial valuation of survival—contingent income streams

dramatically alters the conclusions of previous studies. The paper

closes with a brief conclusion.

2. Annuity Valuation

        %hen annuity markets fail and consumers are risk averse, the true

value of an annuity exceeds its actuarial value by a risk premium. In

this section, we calculate the magnitude of this premium within the

context of a simple life cycle model.

        We will assume that lifetime utility is intertemporally separable

and hornothetic, and that each consumer has a constant pure rate of time

preference p, and a constant instantaneous survival probability 1 —       .
Under these assumptions, the only utility functions consistent with

Yaari's [l965J formulation of the consumer's optimal control program

have the form



(1)                              i_f       e)tCdt
                                               t

where X =    p +   ii. At   time 0, the individual is endowed with some level

of bequeathable wealth, W0, which earns a rate of return r..!L' Beginning

in period L (representing retirement), he receives income from an

exogenous annuity. Anuity benefits At thereafter grow at the rate g;

thus,

                                       0                       t<L

                       At=

                                 g(t—L)

The choice of a particular consumption profile determines the evolution

of bequeathable wealth, as follows:


                                  =          +        —
                                       rWt       At       Ct
                                                  —5—



        The consumer is constrained in two ways. First, his resources

must be sufficient to finance planned consumption in all states of

nature; thus,



                                                               dt
                              j (C — At)e_rt

Further, the absence of annuity markets implies that he is unable to

finance      current consumption by selling (borrowing on) future annuity
benefits,J      so

        By considering perturbations of the planned consumption profile,
we see that as long as beq.ueathable wealth is positive at t and T,

the   optimal program must satisfy

where    y     (r —   x)/(i   — ct) <   r.-'          Ignoring the non—negativity con-

                                       VLer(t_L)


        Of course, there is no guarantee that the program described by

(6), (1), and (8) is feasible, given (14). To proceed, it is necessary

to classify the various ways in which (1) may bind. First, it is clear

from (2) and (8) that if y >            g, there exists some t such        that if

t >   'r,   W (as given in equation (7)) would necessarily exceed 0

(wt +            grows at the rate y, while V., after L, grows at the rate
            Vt
g). Conversely, if y <           g, W (as given by (7)) would at some point
necessarily fall below, and remain below 0. We refer to these as case

I (y > g)         and case II (y <      g).
            We divide these two cases into subcategories, according to whether,

along the optimal plan, W > 0                   binds (cases lb and lib) or does not

bind (cases Ia and ha) at L (given the form of the utility function,

it will never bind before L, since at C = 0                     the individual has

infinite marginal utility of consumption). These four cases are

exhaustive. We consider each in turn.


            Case Ia; y >   g,   WL >   0.       In this case, the program described in

(6), (7), and (8) never violates (14), so it is optimal. The evolution

of C, A, and W is depicted in panel Ia of Figure 1 (note: AL need

not exceed CL). Observe that the annuity wealth term, A/(r —                    g),
equal to the simple discounted value of future benefits (ignoring death).

Swapping a bequeathable asset worth $1 for an annuity which pays $r per
year until death will not alter the optimal program, or affect utility.

Intuitively, unless an individual plans to consume his principal at some

point in the future, he will be indifferent between these two assets

(both generate the same survival contingent income stream).

        An interesting feature of this regime is that the value of

insurance is independent of the consumer's risk aversion parameter, .

Whether or not we are in this regime is, as well, often independent of

c .11



        Case Ib: y >   g,   WL =   0.   The consumer completely exhausts W0

over [0,L1, with C- obeying (5). At L, consumption rises discon-

tinuously, but CL < AL, so that bequeathable assets begin to accumulate

once again. Thereafter, C. obeys (5). This pattern is depicted in

panel   lb of Figure I.
        Shifting resources from bequeathable wealth to annuities neces-
sarily alters the   optimal program, depressing consumption prior to L

and raising it thereafter. In this case, simple discounting is only

approximately appropriate, and the accuracy of the approximation depends

upon the magnitude of the discontinuity at L. In particular,


                                                     l—ci
                            dW0                CL
                            dV0 u* CL+
(CL_ and CL+ are defined, respectively, as the left and right hand

limits of C as t approaches L). Thus, when CL = CL+, simple

discounting is exactly appropriate.
                                   —8—




     Within   this regime, higher risk aversion may either increase or

decrease the marginal value of insurance. One effect is obvious: since

CL < CL+, the consumer is overinsured," and more risk averse individ-
uals will have a stronger desire to smooth the discontinuity (further

annuitization accentuates the discontinuity). However, there is a

second effect: the degree of risk aversion affects the magnitude of

CL/CL+. Higher risk aversion rotates the consumption profiles both

before and after L to flatter positions. If y >      0,   this increases

the discontinuity——since this works in the same direction as the

previous effect, risk averse individuals will place a lower value on

insurance. If y < 0, this rotation works in the opposite direction,

and the net effect of risk aversion on annuity valuation is ambiguous.


      Case ha: y < g, WL > 0.     This is the most interesting case,

since it applies to an individual who reaches retirement with positive

resources, whose real annuity profile is relatively flat (g       0), and

who dissaves after retirment (y <   0).   There is strong empirical evi-

dence indicating that these features characterize most consumers (see

Bernheim [198a], King and Dicks—Mireaux [19821, or Diamond and Hausman

[19801). It is also the most difficult case, and so warrants careful

attention.

      The qualitative pattern is depicted in panel ha of Figure 1.

Along the optimal program, consumption will obey the first order condi-

tion (5) as long as wealth is positive; however, once (1) binds, we will

simply have C =    At.   Let T denote the age at which ()     first   binds.

Then the first order conditions imply that
                                        —9—

                                   At             t>T

From the resource constraint, we have



 (io)                          f(c — At)      e_rtdt



Finally, it is easy to see that despite the binding constraint, consump-

tion must be continuous in time, so that


                             1T    -    g(T-L)


         Unfortunately, the solution is highly non—linear, so the appropriate

"value" of an annuity cannot be inferred directly from an equation such

as (7). Instead, we calculate the compensating variation associated

with annuitization. This is done by changing AL (with associated

changes in zi+), and allowing wealth to adjust endogenously so that

utility is held constant:



(12)                         - I eXCadt       =   U
                                    t
                              a0
where U* is fixed at the level associated with the initial program.

Given TJ* and AL, equations (2), (9), (10), (ii) and (12) determine

        C0, and T (we use (2) and (9) to substitute out for At and

leaving 3 equations in 3 unknowns).

        This system of equations can be differentiated implicitly to

yield, after some tedious manipulations,i

Intuitively,   since (4) may bind at some point, the annuity is worth less

than an asset which yields the same yearly income. As T goes to

infinity (or y to g), this event becomes more remote, so naturally the

value of annuitization approaches A0/(r —               g).
        Eciuations (14) and (15) tell us that when y <                  g,   the marginal

value of an annuity is equal to the simple discounted value of future

benefits (calculated as if the individual will live forever), minus a

proportional adjustment factor. How large is the adjustment? It is

impossible to say without substituting numerical values.
                                      —11.-




        The results of calculations based on alternative hypothetical

parameter values are presented in Table 1. We consider real interest

rates (r) of 1%, 3% and 5%, felicity discount rates (A) of 5% and

1%, and relative risk aversion coefficients ()         of   0, -.1, and —2.

All   eighteen   permutations of these values are included; throughout, we

set the growth rate of annuity benefits (g) equal to zero (more on

this below), the length of an individual's preretirement economic life

(L) equal to         and the ratio of annuity wealth to bequeathable wealth

at retirement (VL/WL) equal to 2. This last value is roughly consis-

tent with empirical evidence on retirees (see Bernheini [l98ltaI); if' any-

thing, the large assumed relative magnitude of annuity wealth will tend

to generate small values of T, thereby overstating the difference

between simple discounted value and compensating variation.

       For each set of parameter values, we report y, P —      L,   the ratio

of the compensating variation associated with the marginal annuity to

its simple discounted value (M1T/SDV = 1 —    ), and   the approximate ratio

of the value of all annuities held by this consumer to their simple

discounted value (AV/sDV). The last of these calculations is based on

numerical integration——the true relationship is highly non—linear, and

analytic integration is impossible.

       Calculated values of y lie between —.06 and 0. Evidence on

dissaving among retirees leads us to believe that y typically lies

between .011 and 0 (see Bernheim [1981a1)——the plausibility of

particular parametric values should be judged accordingly. Note that

even when rates of dissaving are relatively high, the associated uncon-

strained interval (T) is quite long.

     For r = 0.03    and 0.05,   simple     discounting approximates annuity

values extremely well. Only for very low risk aversion (a = 0)        and

high felicity discounting (x =   .oi)     does the value of the marginal

annuity fall below 80% of its simple discounted value, and the value of

all annuities below 90%. In contrast, actuarial discounting is much

less accurate. Assuming a single year survival probability of .95

(this is approximately appropriate for an individual of retirement age),

actuarial values at retirement are only 37.5%, and 50% of simple

discounted values (depending on whether r =       0.03 or 0.05). In all

cases, simple discounting is far superior.

      For r = 0.01, simple dicounting performs less well. However,

this conclusion should be tempered by two comments. First, in this

case, actuarial values at retirement are only 16.7% of simple dis-

counted values, which implies that, even in the most favorable case,

actuarial discounting understates total annuity valuation by a factor of

almost three. Second, the 'poor' performance of simple discounting is

directly attributable to the difference between r and g (this can be

seen from equation (lu): since g —      r   = —.01, the adjustment factor is

discounted very little even though T is large). If one believes that

inflation erodes private pension values so that g is, say, —0.02, then

once again the accuracy of simple discounting will be evident.

      Equations (1)4) and (is) also allow us to draw some qualitative

conclusions concerning the role of risk aversion in determining the

value of insurance provided by annuities. If g = 0         (annuities pay a

constant real streat), the coefficient of relative risk aversion (a)
                                             —13—



    appears only   through its effect on T. As ci            falls   (the individual

    becomes more risk averse), yj falls. Since this flattens the consump-

    tion profile, T rises. From (9), the marginal value of an annuity

    rises as well, as we would expect. As a a goes to -, T approaches

    infinity, and the value of an annuity rises to A/r (intuitively, it is

    less likely that the constraint well ever bind). As a approaches 1

    (risk neutrality), -    goes to          and T to 0——before we reach this

    limit, we move into regime lib. However, if L = 0                so that we remain

    in ha, the limiting value of the annuity is AIX (intuitively, future

    consumption is discounted at the rate .          > r).    Note that this is the

    actuarial value of the benefit stream only if we discount by the

    individual's pure rate of time preference, rather than by the market

    rate of interest. In a strict sense, not even risk neutrality justifies

    actuarial valuation, as typically defined !5L1


          Case lib: y <    g,   WL =   0.   As in Ib, the consumer completely

    exhausts       over [0,LJ, with C. obeying (5). At L, consumption

    rises discontinuously, but since the desired consumption profile falls

    more rapidly than his annuity profile, he is immediately constrained to
—   consume exactly his annuity benefit. This pattern is depicted in panel

    hib of Figure 1.

          As before, additional annuitization raises consumption after L,

    and depresses it before. However, in this case,_9i

                                                —            i—a
                            dO0
                            i;-                     c
                                                    0L—
                                     —l4—



Again we see that simple discounting approximates true value, but in

this case there are two adjustment factors. First, as in Ib, additional

annuitization magnifies the discontinuity at L. Second, as in ha,

additional annuitization forces the individual to choose a consumption

profile with the wrong slope (this is captured by •).

      The effect of risk aversion on annuity valuation is ambiguous
here, and the analysis parallels that for regime lb. We leave the

details to the readers.

      The model considered here is, of course, quite restrictive. We

have employed specific functional forms (e.g. survival probabilities are

constant; utility is intertemporally separable and has constant elast—

icity), and have ignored the problems which arise when the relevant

decision unit   is   a family or household. While these considerations

undoubtably effect our hypothetical calculations, we believe that our

basic qualitative results are quite robust. In particular, regardless

of functional forms, if the individual has no desire to borrow on future

annuity benefits, simple discounting is exactly correct; if this desire

arises only in the distant future (when bequeathable wealth reaches

zero), simple discounting yields a good approximation to value. By the

same reasoning, for households consisting of more than one member,

simple discounting will be (approximately) appropriate for the assumable

portion of annuity benefits. A large fraction of Social Security

benefits are assumable by a surviving spouse, and many private pensions

are fully   assumable.

3.    Implications

      In this section, we apply the preceding analysis to several

important empirical questions concerning behavior and distribution. It

is, of course, far from clear that one ought to use compensating varia—

tion as a measure of value in a behavioral context, so it is necessary

to supplement the analysis of Section 2. In each case, we find that the

use of simple discounting would dramatically alter the conclusions of

earlier authors, who employed actuarial valuation. Our central results

also form the basis of some remarks concerning consumption and wage

taxation.


A.    Personal Saving and Asset Substitution

      The question of whether (and to what extent) Social Security

displaces personal wealth accumulation is, by now, a familiar one. In

his seminal work, Feldstein [19711 employed a simple life cycle model

with certain lifespans to show that, abstracting from the effects of

induced retirement, Social Security would displace private savings

"dollar for dollar". In moving to his empirical implementation,

Feldstein used actuarial values to accoinodate uncertain horizons. While

more recent studies have modified his estimation procedure in a variety

of ways (producing a range of estimates), the practice of employing

actuarial values has been nearly universal.-' Yet, as we have argued,

actuarial valuation is inconsistent with life cycle assumptions.!V

     One might defend this practice by arguing that the life cycle

model outlined by Feldstein is merely suggestive——the notion that Social

Security displaces personal savings is, perhaps, not intrinsically tied
                                  —16—



to this particular formulation of consumer behavior. Specifically, if

we assume that consumers have bequest motives, it is entirely consistent

to posit efficient annuity markets, in which case actuarial valuation is

appropriate.

      Unfortunately, this argument runs afoul of a severe conceptual

difficulty. In the world outlined above each consumer will have an

optimal degree of annuitization. When the government imposes compulsory

saving for retirement annuities, consumers will alter their investment

strategies to offset not only the additional savings, but also the addi-

tional annuitization. That is, in such a world, Social Security should

displace private pensions dollar for dollar, leaving bequeathable wealth

unaffected. Yet microeconomic estimates of this relationship (such as

Feldstein and Pellechio [19791, Kotlikoff [1979] and King and Dicks—

Mireaux [1983]) employ bequeathable wealth as the dependent variable.

By finding that the coefficient of Social Security is significantly

different from zero, these studies effectively reject the hypotheses

upon which the use of actuarial valuation is based!

      In geneal, unless insurance markets fail completely, Social

Security will, at least in some regimes, alter insurance holdings rather

than bequeathable wealth. When discretionary annuity holdings are

positive, Social Security simply displaces annuities; when term life

insurance is positive, consumers neutralize increases in Social Security

by purchasing additional insurance (in both cases, these conclusions

apply to a Social Security system which is "fair" using survival pro-

babilities implicit in market prices of insurance; "unfair" Social
                                   —"1—



Security would, in addition, generate an income effect). Unless

estimation procedures make use of information identifying appropriate

regimes (i.e., whether annuities or term life insurance holdings are

positive), the use of bequeathable wealth as a dependent variable may

involve   severe econometric mispecification. In Bernheim [198Lb1, we

elaborate on these issues, and discuss consistent estimation of asset—

annuity substitution in the presence of imperfect insurance markets.

       When insurance market failure is severe or complete, the investi-

gator can safely confine his attention to the relationship between

compulsory annuities and bequeathable assets. In the presence of non-

trivial bequest motives, appropriate valuation of Social Security wealth

is problematic, and there is, of course, no reason to believe that the

rate of displacement should be dollar—for—dollar. On the other hand,

for pure life cycle assumptions, the analysis of Section 2 creates a

presumption in favor of simple discounting.

       Is the simple discounted value of benefit streams the appropriate

variable for behavioral relationships concerning life cycle savings? To

answer this question, we must return to the theoretical model of Section

2. We will confine attention to the two cases in which WL > 0     (Ia and

ha).
       Consider first case Ia. Suppose we consider a change in Vt

(increasing the level of benefits while preserving g and L) for

which total initial resources,
                                      —18—



are held constant. What effect will this have on Wt? It is straight-

forward to calculate that


                            dWt        dWt
                            t     R    dvt u
                                                   1




Within   this regime, a regression of bequeathable wealth on Social

Security wealth (calculated with simple discounting), controlling for

total resources, would confirm the tldollar_for_dollarfl substitution

bypothesis. Furthermore, the regression coefficient would measure a

"pure" substitution effect, as in simple life cycle models with certain

horizons.

         In Case ha, the pure substitution effect may be substantially

less than dollar for dollar, due to the presence of binding constraints.

Analyses of asset—annuity substitution based on simple discounting will

yield only an approximation of this effect. In what follows, we show

that the accuracy of this approximation is determined by , as defined

in Section 2. Thus, simple discounting is appropriate for behavioral

savings equations precisely when it yields a satisfactory approximation

to compensating variation!

         First, we calculate the pure substitution effect by differenti-

ating the optimal program implicitly, as in Section 2. We find:



          dW
                       -1 +     e_T{(t)      +   (1 -   (t))(i -      t   < L

(16)               =


                       -l   +   e_Tt){(t)    +   (1 -   (t))(i - )}   t   >   L
                                            —19—



where


                                               (y—r)t
                               4'(t)
                                       =1
For t = 0,      =   0,   so our result is consistent with that of Section 2.

As t rises, 4'       rises,   and the rate of substitution falls smoothly to

0. This does not, however, imply that annuitization is worthless:

since the policy is fully anticipated, endogenous readjustments in the

wealth profile simple minimize changes in wealth near the date at which

liquidity constraints bind. If T is large relative to t, substitu-

tion will be nearly dollar—for—dollar.

        Now suppose that we attempt to measure this pure substitution

effect as before by estimating a regression of bequeathable wealth on

Social Security wealth and total resources, where simple discounting is

used to value annuity streams. We this yield an accurate approximation

of pure behavioral substitution? Rather than fixing utility as above,

we fix R0 and differentiate:


                                                              t <   L
                                —l +    (_r)(T_L)4'()
(ri)
               tR0              -l +   (_r)(T_t)4'()          t > L

        Using the facts that r > y          and r > g, it is easy to see that


                          0> dWt   dWt
                           _dVt u*dVt
                                        >—              >—l
                                                   R0
                                   —20—




That is, the use of simple discounting overstates the rate of substitu-

tion, but the estimated rate should lie between 0 and —1. How accu-

rate is the approximation? By comparing (16) and (ii), we see that


                                                         t<L
        dW          dW

        dvt u*t R
                                ( -                      t L
where F is the adjustment factor discussed in Section 2. In both

cases, the multiplicative term associated with       lies between 0 and

1. Thus, the error induced by using simple valuation is bounded by c——

the   use of simple discounting in behavioral savings relations is justi-

fied whenever it yields a good approximation to compensating variation.

        If liquidity constraints eventually bind for most consumers, we

would not expect to find evidence of dollar—for—dollar substitution.

What rates of displacement are plausible, and how well will estimates

based on simple discounting approximate true values? In Table 2, we

present sample calculations for the cases labelled 1 and 3 in Table 1

(note that Case 3 is the least favorable to simple discounting when

r =   0.03   or 0.05). We present both the pure substitution effect and

our approximation for two ages—--t = 20   represents an individual (or

sample of individuals) in the middle of his working life, while t = 1O

represents an individual at retirement. Values of the pure substitution

effect range between 564 and 784 on the dollar; approximations based on

simple discounting are generally quite accurate.
                                        —21—



      Suppose instead that, as in most empirical work, we employed

actuarial valuation of annuity benefit streams. How would we interpret

an estimated "rate of displacement"? We will focus entirely on Case Ia

(the "easy" case), since it allows us to illustrate the important

principles. Paralleling our previous analysis, we will denote actuarial

valuations as follows:


                                    A
                                     t
                             r+lt—g
                                                   t>L
                                                    =
                         a
                      Vt
                                 (Tr+r)(t—L) a
                             e                 V   t<L

and




      First, it is easy to see the basis for Hubbard's 1198)4j result,

that an actuarially fair Social Security system will displace bequeath—

able wealth accumulation by more than the taxes paid. We can think of

such a system as a combination of one which is fair in the sense of

simple discounting, with one which entails benefits, but no taxes. The

first portion would displace savings dollar—for—dollar. The subsidy

late in life generates an income effect, which increases consumption in

every period, thereby depressing savings prior to retirement even

further. Note, however, that this result is quite sensitive to the

assumption that we are in regime Ia. In other regimes, the first

portion of the system generates less than dollar—for—dollar substitu-

tion, and the net result is ambiguous.
                                        —22--




       Most empirical studies of these issues, however, measure the rate

of displacement as dWt/dVR, rather than dWt/dTIR (where T, here,

refers to taxes). As we will see, the choice of denominator makes an

enormous difference.

       We begin by calculating the pure rate of substitution between

bequeathable wealth and actuarially valued annuities in regime Ia. It

is easy to see that

                       dW
                                =   —
                                        r   + it — g
                                                     <   —1
(18)                                        r-g

That is, income effects aside, we would expect to observe more than

dollar—for—dollar substitution, because the use of actuarial valuation

has changed the units of measurement. We refer to this as the "scale

effect •"

       In   addition, we will have an income effect as before. However,

given our current choice of denominator, the income effect works in the

opposite direction. This may seem counterintuitive, but is simply a

matter of what one chooses to hold constant. By employing          as the

denominator, we must perform our decomposition by holding the change in

benefits, rather than the change in taxes constant. That is, we decom-

pose an actuarially fair system into a system which is fair in the sense

of simple discounting (and which has the same benefits), plus a t,ax

rebate. The first portion will displace resources at the rate indicated

in Equation (18). Since the marginal propensity to consume the tax
                                         —23—



rebate is less than one, the second component will increase wealth accu—

niulation, depressing the rate of displacement. The net result is

ambiguous.

      Formally, a regression of bequeathable wealth on Social Security

wealth and total resources (employing actuarial discounting) would esti-

mate the rate of displacement to be


                     — re ir(L—t)r + if —   g(   — e (y—r)t\       e
                                                                       —iTt
                                                                              e

      dW                           r—g

                                     —

                                                                   _mL(g_r)(i_g)tj          t L

These expressions are quite complex, but one can reach certain qualita-

tive conclusions. The derivative can, in both cases be either greater

or less than —1 (we will see examples below). For t < L, is always

negative; however, it may be                 for t > L         (this is true even

when taxes are used as the denominator——by moving sufficiently far into

retirement, one puts the income effect into the past, reversing its

impact).

      This analysis suggests that the use of actuarial valuation con-

founds efforts to measure behavioral substitution between compulsory

annuities and bequeathable assets, in part because of a scale effect,

and in part because the introduction of an actuarially fair Social

Security system generates a blend of income and substitution effects.

The problem is sufficiently severe that theory yields essentially no

prediction as to the magnitude of the relevant regression coefficient,

or (if the sample includes retirees) even its sign! While such

estimates may be valid for assessing the "reduced form" impact of Social
Security on capital accumulation, (although, see below) they do not

allow us to evaluate theories of behavior.

      Nevertheless, we may evaluate estimates based on actuarial

valuation by comparing them with the predictions of our model for

particular, reasonable parameter values. Sample calculations are

presented in Table 3. Since our analysis of actuarial valuation has

focused on regime Ia, we cannot employ the parameter values used in

Tables 1 and 2 (which correspond to ha). Instead, we take r =        = 0.03,
L = 10, g = 0   and —0.03, and y = 0   and 0.02. Note that the rate of

displacement tends to rise, then fall with age. Further, for the most

reasonable case (y, g near zero) it substantially exceeds unity (the

scale effect dominates). By increasing the gap between y and g, one

can drive the rate of displacement below unity, even changing its sign

in extreme cases.

      These calculations shed rather a different light on existing

estimates of asset—annuity substitution. Since it is commonly presumed

that pure theory predicts dollar—for—dollar displacement, estimates of

504 to 154 on the dollar have been interpreted as roughly consistent

with life cycle behavior. However, the coefficient actually predicted

by theory (assuming reasonable parameter values) may be twice as large.

This suggests that existing estimates are consistent with much more

limited asset—annuity substitution than was previously believed.

      However, the analysis points to at least one more problem with

existing estimates of displacement, even when they are interpreted as

reduced forms for the aggregate effect (income and substitution) of an
                                     —25—



actuarially fair Social Security system on savings. Specifically, for

the age group which dominates most microeconoinic cross—sections (J-o to

60, and over), the rate of displacement falls with age. Thus,

specifications should include an interaction term between age and Social

Security wealth. A moment's reflection suggests that, implicitly,

common specifications do include such an interaction. To step outside

our formal model, survival probabilities decline with age, which makes

actuarial values fall, or equivalently, makes the "scale effect" rise.

Thus, these specifications constrain the rate of displacement to rise

with age, exactly contrary to the predicted pattern. The effect of this

mispecification may be to weaken the link between measured Social

Security wealth and behaviorally relevant variables, and might account

for the magnitude of existing estimates.

         It is worth noting that Diamond and Hausman [19801 did not employ

actuarial valuation in their study, but instead simply included the

yearly benefit as an explanatory variable. Within the context of our

model, it is natural to think of the estimated coefficient as measuring

l/(r —   g)   times the pure rate of subsitution. Yet for reasonable

values of r and g, their estimates suggest a rate of displacement far

below any of those calculated earlier for reasonable parameter values.

This is consistent with our evaluation of the evidence based on actu-

arial discounting. It is not clear, however, that their procedure

controls for lifetime resources in a way which includes the insurance

value of annuities. Since their estimated coefficient therefore

subsumes an income effect, it may significantly understate the true rate

of substitution.

B.    Age—Wealth Profiles

      Until recently, most evidence on age—wealth profiles among the

elderly has suggested that consumers do not significantly deplete accu—

inulated resources after retirement, contrary to the predictions of

simple life cycle models (see, for example, Lydall 119551, Projector and

Weiss [19661, Projector [19681, and Mirer [19821). Studies by Diamond

and Hausman [19801, King and Dicks—Mireaux [1982] and Bernheini [l984a]

have criticized the empirical methodology underlying these earlier

estimates, and have found to the contrary that bequeathable wealth

declines significantly after retirement.

      Yet there is an additional problem with using this evidence to

test life cycle predictions: a very large fraction of the total

resources available to many retired individuals is locked into non—

bequeathable annuities. It has frequently been argued that the

inclusion of annuities would vindicate the hump—shaped age—wealth

profile, since the actuarial value of survival contingent claims falls

with age (single year survival probabilities decline). Thus, Mirer

[19191 concedes that, "to some extent, perhaps a great one for many

people, pension and Social Secruity programs tend to institutionalize

the tenets of the life cycle theory." Likewise, King and Dicks—Mireaux

[1983] find evidence of "a clear life—cycle pattern" when the actuarial

value of annuity claims are included in measures of net worth.

      Yet if one wishes to infer an age—wealth profile in order to judge

the plausibility of life cycle motives, the analysis of Section 2 sug-

gests that actuarial valuation is inappropriate. Instead, we would

expect simple discounting to better approximate the relevant notion of
                                   —21--




 value. Since this measure changes very little with age, proper compu-

 tation of age—wealth profiles will reverse the conclusion of King and

 Dicks—Mireaux: the inclusion of annuities will reinforce earlier find-

 ings that resources decline only slightly, if at all, after retirement.

       In Bernheim [198la], we employ simple discounting of annuity bene-

fits in calculations of age—wealth profiles, and find little evidence of

rapid resource depletion even though bequeathable assets appear to

decline rapidly after retirement. It may, of course, be inappropriate

to use the compensating variation as a measure of annuity valuation when

calculating wealth trajectories. For ths reason, we also examine the

accuracy of the approximation entailed by the use of simple

discounting. In particular, we show that, for y <   g,     the behavioral

rate of depletion (y) is bounded between the depletion rate for

bequeathable resources, y', and the depletion rate for total

resources, 1r, where total resources are defined to include the simple

discounted value of annuity benefits:


                               w           r
                              1 <1<1.

For a range of hypothetical parameter values, the upper bound (1')      is
in fact a much better approximation of y. When y >    g,    it is easy to

see (ecjuation (1)) that simple discounting is exactly appropriate (1r =


C.    Retirement

      In recent years, a large number of authors have examined the

effect of Social Security on work incentives (see, for example, Boskin

and Hurd [19181, Blinder, Gordon, and Weiss [19801, Burkhauser [1980]
                                   —28—




Hurd and Boskin [19811, and Burtless and Moffitt [19831). Kotlikoff and

Wise 1198-1 have also considered the relationship between the structure

of private pension plans and labor force incentives. In most studies of

pensions and retirement, the effect of continued labor force participa-

tion on the actuarial value of pension benefits plays a prominent role.

Yet in a life cycle world, any   inducement   to retirement built into pen-

sion plans cannot arise from mortality rates. Calculations based on

actuarial values will therefore tend to overstate the incentive effects

of pensions.-'

      We must qualify this conclusion in two ways. First, estimation of

pension induced work disincentives is not intrinsically tied to pure

life cycle assumptions (unlike the prtctiction of dollar—for—dollar

asset-annuity substitution, or the computation of meaningful age—wealth

profiles). Under the maintained hypotheses that individuals have

bequest motives and annuity markets are perfect, the use of actuarial

values is sensible. Second, we have not explicitly shown that simple

discounting is, under life cycle assumptions, approximately appropriate

within this particular behavioral contexts Unfortunately, our model is

not sufficiently rich to permit consideration of endogenous retirement.

Yet the fundamental insights still seem applicable: if non—negativity

constraints on bequeathable wealth will never bind, simple discounting

yields the proper behavioral variable; if these constraints bind only in

the distant future, than this measure will be approximately appropriate.

D.      Distribution

        The public provision of Social Security has important distri-

butional implications. In considering these issues, Hurd and Shoven

[1983], Kotlikoff [19831, Pellechio [l983], and others have typically

employed actuarial valuation of annuity benefits. While the analysis of

distribution is not intrinsically tied to life cycle assumptions, it is

noteworthy that the use of simple discounting (associated with the

assumption of pure life cycle motives) would dramatically alter many of

the conclusions which appear in this literature.

        In particular, many results based on actuarial valuation are

driven by the observation that annuity wealth rises with survival

probabilities. Thus, while consumers make the same contributions to

Social Security irrespective of race and sex, whites receive in return

more than blacks; women more than men. Yet if one assumes life cycle

behavior with missing annuity markets and uses compensating variation to

measure value, equal yearly benefits generate equal return. From this

point of view, the current Social Security system seems entirely equit-

able.

        Once again, simple discounting is, of course, not exactly appro-

priate even in a pure life cycle world. Furthermore, individuals with

high survival probabilities will tend to have large T's, so that there

will be some vestigial correlation between survival probabilities and

value. However, the calculations of Section 2 appear to suggest that

actuarial valuation will significantly overstate these differences.

E.   Wage Taxes vs. Consumption Taxes

      "Textbook't wisdom holds that proportional wage taxes and consump-

tion taxes are equivalent, from the point of view both of the individual,

and of the government. In recent years, this belief has been modified

by the recognition that there are important transitional distinctions

between these two taxes (see, for example, Auerbach, Kotlikoff, and

Skinner [19811). The current analysis raises a second potentially

important set of distinctions, which arise when lifetimes are uncertin.

      If annuity markets are perfect, then, as in the textbook case, a

wage tax and a consumption tax which raise the same expected revenue

will be equivalent from the individual's point of view. When annuity

markets are either imperfect or fail completely, this equivalence

dissolves.

      Consider a pure life cycle saver who has no access to private

annuity markets, and suppose his lifetime consumption plan places him in

regime Ia (for simplicity, no constraints bind). He will be indifferent

between proportional wage and consumption taxes as long as the simple

discounted value (ignoring death) of tax payments is the same for each.

However, since the government taxes many individuals, it is concerned

with expected revenue. Since wage taxes raise revenue sooner, the wage

tax raises more expected revenue. Equivalently, if the government

wishes to raise a certain amount of revenue, consumers would prefer to

have the tax applied to wages, rather than to consumption. The poten-

tial importance of this observation is clear when one considers the

nature of transitional distinctions between wage and consumption

taxation——the wage tax raises less revenue in the short run, because the
                                   —31—



consumption tax falls heavily on retirees. Considerations based on

uncertin lifetimes work in the opposite direction, offsetting this

effect.

      Of course, this result is driven by the assumption that market

imperfections make it more efficient for government, rather than

individuals, to save. This property holds for some, but not all, models

of adverse selection (see King [198111,   and   Eckstein, Eichenbaum, and

Peled [19831).



4.    Concluding   Remarks

      When annuity markets are perfect and individuals have bequest

motives, actuarial valuation of benefits is clearly appropriate. In

this paper, we have shown that, when annuity markets are missing and

individuals have no bequest motives, simple discounting of benefits

yields a good approximation to the appropriate concept of value.

Between these two polar, "easy" cases, there is a range of possibilities

for which the valuation of annuities is significantly more difficult.

Calculation of realistic annuity values must recognize not only the

existence of potentially significant bequest motives, but also the

potential imperfections in annuity markets, including idiosynchratic

intrafamily arrangements designed to improve upon imperfect markets

(see, for example, Kotlikoff and Spivak [19811, and Bernheini, Shleifer

and Summers [19841). These important intermediate cases are left for

future work.

 *These calculations are based on trapazoidal approximations of the appropriate

 obtain bounds on the true integral by employing rectangular approximations. Such
 calculations suggest that every entry in this column is within 0.01 of its true
 value (most bounds are, in fact, much tighter).

21 This result can be understood as follows. Since . > r, the
    individual wishes to consume all resources immediately. He cannot
    borrow on annuities, so annuitization forces him to defer consump-
    tion to the future. Thus, annuitization generates at net loss given
    actuarially fair financing.

    This formula matches our previous result (Equation (i4)) in the
    borderline case where T    L and CL_ =  CL+.
    See, for example, Feldstein and Pellechio [19791, Kotlikoff [19791
    and King and Dicks—Mireaux [19821,. A notable exception is Diamond
    and Hausman [19801,.

    The inconsistency would disappear if each individual belonged to a
    sufficiently large risk—pooling family, as discussed in the intro-
    duction.

    I would like to thank Michael Hurd for pointing this effect out to
    me.
