Oil and Democracy in Russia

                                            ABSTRACT

Russia is often considered a perfect example of the so-called “resource curse”—the argument that
natural resource wealth tends to undermine democracy. Given high oil prices, some observers see the
country as virtually condemned to authoritarian government for the foreseeable future. Reexamining
various data, I show that such fears are exaggerated. Evidence from around the world suggests that
for countries like Russia with an established oil industry, even large increases in the scale of mineral
incomes have only a minor effect on the political regime. In addition, Russia—a country with an
industrialized economy, a highly educated, urbanized population, and an oil sector that remains majority
private-owned—is unlikely to be susceptible to most of the hypothesized pernicious effects of resource
dependence.

Russia is often thought to be a classic case of the so-called “resource curse”—the idea that

natural resource wealth tends to impair democracy.1 Indeed, some see the country as virtually

doomed to authoritarian politics by its enormous endowments of oil and gas. “Russia’s future

will be defined as much by the geology of its subsoil as by the ideology of its leaders,” writes

Moisés Naím, Editor-in-Chief of Foreign Policy magazine, and a former trade and industry

minister of petroleum-rich Venezuela. “A lot of oil combined with weak public institutions

produces poverty, inequality, and corruption. It also undermines democracy” (Naím 2004). The

New York Times columnist Tom Friedman sees a close relationship between world commodity

prices and the extent of liberty in resource-rich states: a higher oil price means less freedom.

Russia, from Gorbachev to Putin, seems to him to fit perfectly (Friedman 2006).


        This view has an immediate plausibility. There is no question that oil and gas have been

at the core of Russia’s political economy in recent decades. The plunge in petroleum prices in the

1980s helped create the economic crisis that the last Soviet governments failed to overcome

(Gaidar 2007). Surging commodity prices after 1998 coincided with the re-centralization of

power under Putin, the reassertion of Kremlin control over national television, the spread of

credible reports of electoral fraud, and the harassment of independent social and political

organizations. The leading state-controlled oil and gas companies even served as the regime’s

favored tool for chipping away at civic freedoms. It was the Kremlin-led gas monopoly Gazprom

that, with a mixture of business maneuvers and administrative muscle, took over previously


1
  In fact, there are several “resource curse” arguments, asserting respectively that resource wealth: (a)
slows economic growth, (b) fosters civil wars, and (c) impairs the quality of governance and erodes
democracy. I focus here exclusively on (c).
critical media outlets. And it was the state-owned oil company Rosneft that swallowed assets

owned by the oligarch Mikhail Khodorokovsky, who had been funding the political opposition

and civil society groups.


       Still, arguments that seem to fit so well deserve particular scrutiny. Were oil and gas—

and the fluctuations in their prices—as central to determining the course of political development

in Russia as advocates of this view suggest? If so, by what pathways did the resource curse

operate? Is Russia condemned to endure authoritarian government—in the worst case, to

degenerate into the kind of oil-fueled autocracy characteristic of the Persian Gulf? In this paper, I

briefly examine the evidence for the resource curse worldwide and use cross-national experience

to gauge the likely effect of resource wealth on political institutions in Russia.


       The evidence is consistent with the claim that Russia would be somewhat more

democratic if it had no oil or gas. However, international comparisons also suggest that very

little of the variation over time in Russia’s political regime since 1985 can be attributed to

changes in its oil and gas income or reserves. When studied systematically, cross-national data

imply that for countries like Russia with an established petroleum industry even large gyrations

in oil revenues have a relatively minor impact. Based on this experience, there is little reason to

fear that mineral wealth will cause Russia to sink deep into autocracy even if oil prices rise to

unprecedented heights.




1 What do we know about the “oil curse”?

In the last decade, scholars have used statistical methods to test the hypothesis that oil and gas

wealth is inimical to democracy. Most believe there is evidence of a statistically significant

                                                  2
relationship, although there are some dissenters.2 At the same time, recognition has been growing

that the effects of oil can be quite different in different types of countries and in different periods.


         Figure 1 plots the political regimes in 2000-05 of the world’s 32 largest oil and gas

producers. I include all countries that in this period had average annual output of oil and gas

worth at least $400 per capita at world prices.3 To classify the countries’ political regimes, I use

the ratings of the Polity IV dataset (September 2009 revision), compiled by a team under Monty

Marshall and Keith Jaggers, at George Mason University. The scale runs from -10 to +10. Scores

of -10 to -6 represent autocracies, and scores of 6 to 10 represent democracies.


                                                 [Figure 1]


        A first point to note is the great variation in types of regime among the major oil

producers. Their political systems range from consolidated autocracies (like Saudi Arabia and

Qatar) to consolidated democracies (like Norway and Trinidad and Tobago). Moreover, the

pattern looks anything but random. With one exception, the countries fall naturally into four

groups. First, there are the highly industrialized countries of Western Europe, North America,

and Oceania. Major oil producers in this category such as Norway, Canada, and Denmark are




2
 An excellent review that reaches a positive conclusion is Ross (2009), a revised version of which will
appear as a chapter in Ross’s forthcoming book, The Curse of Oil Wealth. A skeptical reading of the
evidence appears in Haber and Menaldo (2009).

  The data come from Michael Ross, Database on oil and gas income, 2009, UCLA. I am grateful to Ross
for sharing this. The income data are constructed from the reported physical quantities of oil and gas
produced, which are then multiplied by the average world price for these commodities. No adjustment is
made for production costs. Thus, the data represent potential receipts (if all oil and gas were sold at world
market prices), not profits. So long as the physical quantities are reported accurately, the estimates are not
vulnerable to distortions generated by transfer pricing, cost inflation, and other deceptive accounting.
Gaddy and Ickes (2005) argue that such tricks often lead to underestimation of the rents from oil and gas
in Russia.


                                                      3
stable liberal democracies. Research confirms that they are not subject to any resource curse.4

Second, there are the oil-rich states of Latin America such as Venezuela, Mexico, and Trinidad

and Tobago. These are also classified by Polity as democracies, although some are closer to the

category’s bottom edge. As Dunning has shown, not only is there no evidence of a resource curse

in Latin America, there appears to be a resource blessing. The oil-rich countries in that region

have actually been more democratic on average than their peers. Dictatorships in Latin America

that had oil were more likely to democratize than those that did not.5


          The third group consists of oil-producers in Sub-Saharan Africa, which are found

between -6 and -2 on the 21-point scale, intermediate regimes just above the range of

“autocracy.” In this region, scholars have found evidence that greater resource dependence

renders democracies more vulnerable (Jensen and Wantchekon 2004). Fourth, there are the

countries of the Muslim world. It is striking that all the countries at the bottom of Figure 1 have

large Muslim communities. (The converse is not true: some Muslim oil producers like Malaysia

are closer to democracy than dictatorship.) Indeed, among the major oil producers, the only ones

that Polity classified as autocracies, with scores of -6 or lower, were countries in which Muslim

adherents made up more than three quarters of the population. Of course, this is merely an

observation about the pattern rather than a claim about what causes what. Some evidence

presented below suggests that, once all the differences among countries are taken into account,

the effects of oil and gas are just as strong in non-Muslim as in Muslim countries.

 Ross (2009) finds, for instance, that greater oil and gas income is not associated with a greater chance of
democratic failure in countries with income per capita above $5,000.

          Finally, there is the one country that does not belong in any of these groups—Russia—

which, in Figure 1, appears to blend in with Latin America.


          Some simple statistics help to elucidate the patterns in the data. In Table 1, I show a

series of regressions of countries’ Polity scores on the natural log of their per capita income from

oil and gas. In all regressions, I control for the natural log of countries’ gross domestic product

per capita (at purchasing power parity, from the Penn World Tables), since a great deal of work

suggests that more developed countries tend to be more democratic. All regressions are run on

panels that include all countries for which data were available in the period from 1960 to 2005.

To reduce autocorrelation, I follow established practice and use only observations from every

fifth year, starting in 1960.6 In all regressions, I include a full set of year dummies. In models 1

to 9, I also include country fixed effects, which control for any unchanging characteristics of the

country. Thus, these regressions pick up the way in which, within given countries, changing

levels of oil and gas income correlate over time with the nature of those countries’ political

regimes. In models 10-18, I do not include country fixed effects, but include a one-period

autoregressive process to correct for autocorrelation. Thus, these models capture both

correlations between petroleum income and regimes over time and correlations between these

variables across countries. Since the correlations across countries may be caused by other factors

left out of the regressions, these models may overestimate the true effects of oil.


                                               [Table 1]


          Columns 1 and 10 show that, looking at all countries for the full period from 1960 to

2005, there is a statistically significant relationship between higher oil and gas income and less

    See Ross (2009), Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, and Yared (2008).

                                                    5
democratic government. This is so whether one looks just at change over time (model 1) or both

variation over time and across countries (model 10). If one controls for the nature of the regime

five years earlier, the effect of oil and gas income is still significant, but only a little more than

half as large (models 2 and 11). Thus, the short run effect of an increase in resource income may

be smaller than the total effect. Although the effect of oil and gas appears weaker in

predominantly Muslim countries if we look at the random effects models (compare the

coefficients of -.23 in column 12 and -.52 in column 10), controlling for all countries’ fixed

characteristics, more oil and gas income is associated with just as large a decrease in democracy

in non-Muslim countries (columns 3 and 1).7


        Controlling for country characteristics, and looking at the full period, it is only among

very poor countries that oil and gas income correlates over time with less democracy. If one

looks also at the cross-country variation, however, the strongest correlation is among countries at

intermediate levels of development (GDP per capita at PPP between $5,000 and $15,000). Ross

has noted that the relationship between resource wealth and less democracy does not appear in

data from before the early 1980s. Up to that point, oil and gas did not appear to have any

negative effect. It was in the “Third Wave” of democracy, which culminated in the East

European transition from communism, that major oil producers started to stand out,

democratizing less than their oil-poor neighbors. The regressions in Table 1 confirm this. In the

fixed effects regressions, there is no effect of oil in the period before 1985, and in the random

effects models the earlier effect is weaker (columns 7, 8, 16, and 17).




7
  It could be, however, that the fixed effect regressions underestimate the impact of changes in oil and gas
income on democracy in Muslim countries because a good number of the major Muslim oil producers
were from early on at the bottom of Polity’s scale, with nowhere further to drop.

                                                     6
        The impact of oil at different income levels also appears to change after 1985. In the later

period, it was actually the countries at intermediate income levels that showed the strongest

effect of mineral wealth. I therefore present one final pair of models (colums 9 and 18) that

include only countries with intermediate income levels in the post-1985 period. These models

show the largest estimated effects of oil and gas income on democracy that I have been able to

find by experimenting with different specifications.


        In short, the regressions illustrate and confirm the results of earlier work on the

relationship between mineral wealth and democracy. Since the early 1980s—but not before

that—poor and middle income countries outside Latin America that earned large amounts of

income from oil and gas have tended to become less democratic.




2 What does this imply about Russia?

Most of the models in Table 1 suggest a statistically significant negative relationship between

petroleum income and democracy. It is difficult to be sure how large the effect is given the wide

range of estimates across different specifications. But the pattern of evidence worldwide is

generally consistent with the claim that Russia would be more democratic today if it had no oil

or gas at all.


        What about the effect of changes in Russia’s oil and gas income since the late Soviet

period? Between 1985 and 1998, the value of Russia’s oil and gas output fell from $2,207 per

capita to $476 per capita, by Ross’s estimates. By 2006, the value had risen again to $2,765. As

many observers have pointed out, the fall and rise in Russia’s oil receipts mirror the rise and fall




                                                  7
in political freedom in the country under the consecutive leadership of Gorbachev, Yeltsin, and

Putin. Can oil explain Russia’s political trajectory?


       The answer appears to be: only a small part of it. The true effect of petroleum income

probably lies somewhere within the range defined by the coefficients in the various models of

Table 1. It turns out that whichever of these one uses, the implied effect of Russia’s changing oil

and gas income is surprisingly small. A low estimate is the coefficient of -.32 in model 1. The

highest estimate is the coefficient of -1.58 in model 9. Applying these to the Russian data, the

drop in oil and gas earnings after 1985 predicts an increase in Russia’s Polity score of between

0.5 and 2.4 points on the 21-point Polity scale. The increase in oil and gas income after 1998

implies a fall in the country’s Polity score of 0.6 to 2.8 points. Figure 2 shows the predicted path

of Russia’s score based on just the variation over time in its oil and gas income.


                                             [Figure 2]
       Clearly, if the experience of other countries is a guide, the ups and downs of Russia’s

petroleum income can explain at most a small fraction of the changes in its political regime over

the last 25 years. This, too, is consistent with what previous research has shown about the

“resource curse”. As Ross pointed out in a seminal article in 2001, the marginal effect of oil on

the political regime falls sharply as the amount of oil produced increases (Ross 2001). This is

captured here by the modeling of the oil effect in logs. In models with the oil and gas income

variable not logged (not shown here), this variable has a perversely positive coefficient in the

fixed effects basic model, marginally significant. It is significantly negative in the random effects

models. But here too, the implied effect is small. In a version of model 10 with oil and gas

income not logged, the estimated coefficient implies that the increase in oil and gas income

between 1998 and 2006 should have reduced Russia’s Polity score by just 0.2 points.

                                                  8
       The effects of oil are not always tiny. For a country that starts producing a large amount

of oil from scratch, the implied effect on the regime can be sizeable. In Equatorial Guinea,

between 1990 and 2005, oil and gas income increased from nothing to $13,674 per capita. Since

the country’s GDP per capita started out well below $5,000, I use the estimated coefficient of -

.60 from model 4 in Table 1. The model predicts a fall in Equatorial Guinea’s Polity score of

almost six points. The diminishing marginal effect of oil also implies an asymmetry worth

keeping in mind. Were Russia’s oil and gas income to increase from its present level, the models

suggest this would lead to only a very small further deterioration in its politics. By contrast, were

Russia’s oil and gas income to dry up completely, the implied increase in democracy would be

much larger.


       The small size of the estimated effect in Russia is not just an idiosyncracy of my analysis.

Applying the estimates of other scholars yields similar results. For instance, Silje Aslaksen

(2010) estimates the relationship between the value of countries’ oil production (as a share of

GDP) and democracy, as measured by both Polity and Freedom House. Using either democracy

measure, she finds coefficients of -.002 to -.004, depending on the specification, where the

dependent variable, democracy, is normalized to range between 0 and 1. Using the same data

(from the World Bank’s Adjusted Saving Database), I find that Russia’s oil production as a share

of GDP rose from about 11 percent in 1998 to about 23 percent in 2006, an increase of 12

percentage points. Applying Aslaksen’s estimated coefficients, this increase would result in a

decrease in democracy of between 2.4 and 4.8 points on a 100-point scale. On the Polity scale,

running from -10 to +10, that corresponds to a change of just 0.5 to 1 point.


       In another paper, Egorov, Guriev, and Sonin (2009) demonstrate that among autocracies

and imperfect democracies, greater proven oil reserves correlate with lower media freedom, as

                                                  9
judged by the organization Freedom House. This relationship holds both cross-nationally and

over time. However, again the oil variable enters logarithmically, which implies that for

countries like Russia the effect of recent changes is very small. Using the largest negative

coefficient the authors obtained (-2.87, from their Model 5, Table 1), I calculate that the massive

increase in the value of Russia’s proven oil reserves from $710 billion in 1998 to $7.68 trillion in

2008 should have reduced press freedom by seven points on a 100-point scale—roughly

equivalent to the gap in press freedom between the US and Norway.8


        In short, the pattern of evidence from around the world suggests that the ups and downs

in Russia’s oil and gas income in recent decades have had only a minor influence on its regime.

Given that, by almost any measure, very large changes occurred in Russia’s political system

during the last 25 years, one must look to other factors to explain these changes. Of course, oil

and gas revenues may have been more important in certain years, but on average they apear to

have played a secondary role.




3 Specific pathways

The apparently limited impact of oil on politics in Russia makes sense when one considers the

various mechanisms by which scholars have argued that natural resource wealth blocks or erodes




8
  The coefficient, -2.87, is from a model in which media freedom is regressed on the log of oil reserves
multiplied by the world oil price, controlling for log GDP per capita, log population and log government
expenditure as a share of GDP. The regression is run on just “non-democracies”—i.e. countries with
Polity scores below six. Of course, press freedom is just one element or concomitant of democracy; if oil
affects other aspects of democracy as well, the total effect would be greater. Unlike Polity, which did not
record a deterioration in Russia’s democracy until 2007, the Freedom House media index recorded a
sharp drop in freedom starting from 1999. For a skeptical view of Freedom House’s ratings—for instance
its equation of press freedom in Russia to that in Yemen—see Treisman (2010).

                                                    10
democracy. It is hard to find much evidence of these mechanisms at work in Russia. There are

five main arguments.



3.1 Fiscal bargains

The argument that has found the most support is that large mineral endowments obviate the need

for rulers to come to agreement with their subjects over fiscal issues. Democracy developed in

Europe, according to one popular view, because rulers were forced to grant representation to at

least some classes of the population in return for taxation. By contrast, in resource-rich states,

rulers can live as “rentiers,” spending their revenues from the sale of minerals rather than relying

on taxes.

          This fits the situation in the Persian Gulf, where the burden of taxation is, indeed,

unusually low. In Bahrain, tax revenues make up just four or five percent of GDP; in Kuwait,

they come to about one percent (World Bank 2009). Qatar has no personal income tax, no tax on

personal property, and no value added or sales tax. Despite not paying much tax at all, the

country’s population receives a remarkable set of benefits from the state—from free education,

healthcare, and telephone service to guaranteed jobs in the civil service upon graduation from

high school, housing allowances, and free plots of land (Kamrava 2009). Overwhelmed with

royal largesse, most Qataris have been reluctant to campaign for political rights.

          Of course, the “rentier” argument assumes that there are sufficient rents to keep the

public at bay. Yet oil states differ greatly in how large their oil revenues are in per capita terms.

In Qatar and its Persian Gulf neighbors, the amounts are truly astounding. If the value of oil and

gas produced in 2006 had been shared among all Qataris, each would have received $45,000.9

The government could have financed all its expenditures for two years with its annual revenues

from exports of oil and gas.10 In many other oil states, however, the take is far more modest. In

Malaysia, for instance, the country’s total income from oil and gas in 2006, valued at world

prices, came to only $1,300 per capita (see Figure 1). In the oil-rich sultanate of Brunei, fuel

exports in 2006 came to 64 percent of GDP. In Malaysia, they were 14 percent (Table 2). The

political consequences of $45,000 a year per capita in oil income are bound to be different from

those of $1,000 a year.

                                                    [Table 2]


        Another key distinction is whether oil and gas are exploited by the state itself or by

private companies, which the state must then tax. In recent years, about three quarters of all oil

was produced worldwide by state-owned national oil companies (McPherson 2003, p.3). But

there are some exceptions. The logic of the “rentier” argument suggests that if governments must

bargain with the private sector owners of oil companies over taxation, this could lead to a more

open and competitive type of politics.11

        How do these considerations apply to Russia? Although its oil and gas reserves are vast,

so is its population. As a result, its annual income from oil and gas per capita—about $2,800 in

2006, if all sold at world market prices, which it was not—is nowhere near that of a Persian Gulf

emirate.12 Revenues from oil and gas exports in 2006 came to about $1,340 per person, a bit



10
  Revenues from fuel exports in 2006 came to about $31 billion; government expenditures, to about $14
billion (calculated from World Bank (2009)).
11
  Jones Luong and Weinthal (2006) argue that the weak institutions associated with resource wealth
should “instead be attributed to the pathologies associated with state ownership.” When resource sectors
are predominantly privately owned, there are incentives for the creation of strong institutions.
12
  Much of Russia’s oil and gas is sold domestically, at prices that have in the past been far below world
prices.

                                                    12
below the level for Australia.13 The budget derived only about one third of its revenues in 2007

from oil and gas.14 As for ownership of the oil sector, Russia since the mid-1990s has been one

of a handful of countries that includes the USA and Canada where most oil is produced by

independent, private companies, rather than in projects dominated by the state (with or without

foreign partners). It is easy to forget this amid the outcry over Putin’s measures to expand the

state’s presence. But even after the re-nationalizations of Yukos and Sibneft and the revision of

terms on the Sakhalin II project, estimates of the share of oil produced in majority state-owned

companies ranged from 37 to 42 percent.15 In the gas sector, the state’s stake in Gazprom was

increased to just over 50 percent through the repurchase of shares. But at the same time it

became legal for foreigners to own shares directly.16

          As a result, although the oil and gas sectors contribute a great deal to the budget, most

revenues come from other sectors. And much of the oil and gas revenues have to be extracted in

the form of taxes from privately owned companies. The government cannot live off its rents. Nor

does it have remotely enough oil wealth to keep the population cocooned in a Persian-Gulf-style

system of cradle-to-grave benefits. As a result, the government must enter into negotiations with

  Hanson (2009, p.15), OECD (2006, p.38), Rutland (2008). Rutland points out that not only does Russia
have a sizeable private oil sector, it also has competition among its domestic oil producers.
16
   Of course, private ownership means a great deal more when property rights are secure. In Russia, the
owners of private oil companies rely on connections to those in high office to prevent predatory
interventions. Minority shareholders in Gazprom understand very well that decisions on corporate
strategy are made by the government. Still, a game with two sides in which one side is weak is different
from a game with just one side. Were the incumbent political team to weaken, magnates controlling large
concentrations of private wealth could reconsider their allegiances. Another point to note is that
ownership of the oil industry is endogenous. As Guriev, Kolotilin, and Sonin (2008) show, state
expropriations of oil companies tend to increase when the oil price is high.


                                                    13
the private sector—in the 1990s, the level of ad hoc bargaining was considered a scandal—and it

has worked to create a modern tax system, with personal income taxes, VAT, and payroll taxes.

Tax revenues of the consolidated budget came to about 30 percent of GDP in 2007.17



3.2 Repression

A second argument is that revenues from oil and gas enable governments to repress their

populations. Mineral rents provide the cash to hire more policemen, train security services, and

monitor citizens with high technology equipment. The huge stakes involved might also make

incumbents more determined to use violence to crush political opposition.

          Ross examined this, using as a measure of repression the annual frequencies of torture,

extrajudicial killings, political imprisonment, and disappearances attributable to the government,

as collected from US State Department human rights reports by Cingranelli and Richards (2008).

He found that, in fact, controlling for regime type, oil producers were no more repressive than

non-oil producers (Ross 2009).



3.3 Oil and modernization

An influential tradition of thought argues that democratization tends to occur only after societies

are transformed by modernization. The spread of education, industrialization, urbanization,

occupational specialization, and modern mass media prompt new popular demands for

government accountability. However, if countries grow rich by extracting oil or other minerals,

the social changes associated with modernization in Western Europe and North America may not

                                                  14
take place. Minerals can be extracted in enclaves, often staffed by foreigners, while the

surrounding society remains predominantly traditional.

        Whether such social transformations are necessary or sufficient conditions for

democratization is debated. The Soviet Union was able to industrialize without prompting any

mass demands for democracy before the Gorbachev years.18 But, regardless, the argument that

resource wealth prevents industrialization does not apply well to countries that were already

industrialized when they discovered oil or when the oil boom of the 1970s occurred, creating

massive rents for petroleum producers. Oil rich states began from very different starting points.

In the Persian Gulf and North Africa, many were tribal communities of farmers, nomads, traders,

or pearl divers when the oil industry first developed. By contrast, others were highly

industrialized and urbanized, with educated populations and extensive mass media. Norway and

Denmark, for instance, were already stable, industrialized democracies by the 1970s when North

Sea oil came on line. As noted, such countries have shown no signs of sliding into autocracy as

oil revenues grew. Similarly, the prior industrialization of many Latin American countries may

help explain why mineral wealth there did not impede democratization.

        In this regard, Russia looks like one of the oil producers least likely to fall victim to the

curse. Although just a middle-income country, Russia was even more industrialized than many

of the Latin American mineral-rich states when oil prices first spiked. Developed in the

distinctive Soviet manner, it has rates of educational and scientific achievement more

comparable to those of developed countries (see Table 3). Along with the other former Soviet oil

producers, it has an unusually high rate of female labor participation. Maintaining political

control over a literate, highly educated population, rich in scientists, where women are integrated

18
   One can define modernization to include not just industrialization but also the development of high
quality institutions, but then it becomes almost tautological to say that modernization leads to democracy.
I defer discussion of the quality of institutions to Section 3.5.

                                                    15
into the workforce, is bound to be more challenging than imposing an authoritarian regime on

traditional communities of farmers and local traders.

                                                       [Table 3]


3.4 Media Freedom

As already mentioned, Egorov et al. find a relationship between oil reserves and lower media

freedom. However, as also noted, the effects of new reserves or increases in the oil price turn out

to be small for countries that already had significant proven reserves. The implied effect for

Russia was tiny.



3.5 Corruption

Finally, resource wealth is often thought to foster corruption, which might in turn erode

democracy or perpetuate dictatorship. Widespread graft is likely to discredit democratic officials

and may make them eager to reduce the transparency of government. Steven Fish argues that this

was a main reason for Russia’s stalled democratization (Fish 2005, p.134).

           Is there a relationship between oil income and corruption? Where oil and gas are

abundant, corruption is perceived to be higher. Various scholars, using indexes of perceived

corruption compiled by polling international businessmen and experts, have found a relationship

between perceived corruption as captured by such indexes and natural resource wealth.19 Oil rich

states such as Qatar and Equatorial Guinea are perceived to be considerably more corrupt than

most others at their income level. Russia is perceived to be somewhat more corrupt than one

would expect given its gdp per capita.



19
     The first study to find this was Ades and Di Tella (1999).

                                                       16
           However, perceptions are sensitive to how countries are portrayed in the world media.

Experts may reason backwards; if they have come to associate oil rents with corruption, they

may assume oil-rich states are corrupt. If belief in such an association becomes widespread, it

may influence how journalists pick and frame the stories they report in oil-rich countries. In a

previous paper, I showed that measures of perceived corruption did not always coincide with

measures of corruption based on surveys in which individuals or businesses were asked concrete

questions about whether members of their family or “firms like theirs” had been expected to

make unofficial payments during the previous year (Treisman 2007). In the data from such

experience-based surveys, evidence of a link between oil and higher corruption is far weaker,

and often non-existent. For instance, using reports on the frequency of bribery from the World

Bank’s World Business Environment Survey (which surveyed firm managers) and the

organization Transparency International’s Global Corruption Barometer Survey (which

interviewed individuals), I found little or no relationship, even controlling for income. In Russia,

reports of bribery were not more frequent on average than in other countries around its income

level.20

           These surveys inevitably focus more on low level corruption than on kleptocracy at the

top. Low level officials do not appear to be more corrupt in countries with mineral wealth. But

the story might be different for government ministers. In Russia, as the oil price rose after 1999,

stories circulated of brazen venality at the highest levels involving mind-boggling sums. Such




20
  It is possible that there is underreporting of corruption in surveys that ask about respondents’ direct
experience. Many surveys seek to avoid alarming respondents by asking about bribery in “firms like
yours” rather than in the respondent’s own enterprise. Such underreporting would only bias estimates if
underreporting were greater in countries with natural resources than in those without. It is not obvious
why that should be the case.


                                                    17
stories may very well be true.21 Unfortunately, there is little way to know—and to compare the

scope of such corruption in Russia to that in other countries that lack oil. Nor is it clear whether

or not corruption itself undermines democracy. There are some suggestive arguments to this

effect, but as yet little empirical evidence to back them up.




4 Conclusion

Russia’s oil and gas income—even at the height of the recent price surge—was nowhere near

enough to fund the kind of politically enervating welfare state found in the Persian Gulf.

Moreover, much of the government’s share of oil revenues still has to be extracted in the form of

taxes from the private magnates who control most of the country’s oil production. Unlike in

Qatar or Kuwait, the Russian state will have to continue taxing the population, and dealing with

the discontent that engenders. Nor can Russia’s oil preclude modernization since the country is

in most ways already modernized. Rising oil prices since 1999 may have prompted a reduction in

press freedom, but, judging from experience elsewhere, only by a very small amount. Oil-rich

states like Russia are perceived to be more corrupt. But, although it is certainly possible that they

are, there is little reliable evidence to this effect.


        If Russia’s oil and gas do not doom the country to autocracy, they do nevertheless play a

part in a more complicated process. Surging oil prices have in certain periods stimulated

economic growth. As in many other countries, improving economic conditions buy the president


21
  One possible indirect indicator reported in the Russian press is the frequency with which top officials
are observed wearing watches that cost tens of thousands of dollars. Prime Minister Putin has been
photographed wearing a Patek Philippe watch that retails for about $60,000 (Russky Newsweek,
“Starinnye chasy yeshche idut,” February 14, 2005). Unfortunately, there are no time series datasets on
this variable.

                                                     18
greater popular support (Treisman 2009, 2010). At moments of overwhelming popularity, a

president has the opportunity to make significant changes to the system, pushing it towards either

more or less democracy. President Putin, with an approval rating close to 80 percent, chose the

latter. This was not inevitable; had the Kremlin candidate in 2000 been a more committed

democrat, one can imagine that the subsequent boom might have helped sustain support for

further democratic reforms. At the same time, the price of oil, although important, was not the

only determinant of Russia’s growth rate. Studies suggest that higher oil prices explain between

one third and one half of the total growth since 1999.22 The impact of oil prices was apparently

stronger in 2005-9 than in 1999-2001, when growth was fueled by the effects of devaluation, and

2001-4, when higher output of oil and minerals—mostly achieved by private companies—was at

least as important as higher prices. Thus, the path from oil prices to weaker democracy in Russia

since 1999 has been somewhat indirect and contingent.

        More generally, resource endowments have two effects. First, they may provide rents

that, if controlled by the government, can be used for political purposes. Second, dependence on

commodity exports subjects countries to sometimes extreme economic gyrations as the prices of

commodities are more volatile than those of manufactured products and services (Jacks,

O’Rourke, and Williamson 2009). In countries for which the rents are large relative to the

volatility, natural resources may enable incumbent rulers to entrench themselves and avoid

sharing power. In those for which the volatility is large relative to the rents, the main political

consequence of resource dependence is likely to be not so much authoritarianism as instability.


22
  Suni (2007) estimates that higher oil prices explain about 2.5 points (38 percent) of the 6.5 percent
average growth rate in 2001-06. Beck, Kamps and Mileva (2007), reviewing previous studies, note
estimated long-run elasticities of GDP to permanent increases in the oil price of .15 to .20. Using the
monthly prices of European Brent oil, these elasticities imply that the change in oil prices in 1999-2007
can explain 25 to 33 points of the 72 percent increase in GDP (measured in constant rubles) between
those years—or, in other words, 35 to 46 percent of the total growth.

                                                    19
        Such instability may not always be bad for democracy. If the instability is moderate, it

may help facilitate turnover at the top of the state.23 Turnover does not by itself create

democracy, but from alternation of elites democracy can emerge. On the other hand, extreme

instability may discredit and incapacitate the state, leading to civil conflict rather than peaceful

alternation. From this perspective, the second rank oil producers of Latin America and Asia

(Argentina, Mexico, Ecuador, Indonesia, Malaysia) may have a combination of rents and

volatility that is consistent with—or even conducive to—democratization, while the major oil

producers like Qatar and Brunei have such high rents that the volatility is hardly felt. To the

extent this is correct, Russia fits best into the first category, along with Latin American peers like

Mexico and Venezuela. Its mineral wealth adds an element of periodic turbulence to its political

economy, which will sometimes disrupt—but could at times even catalyze—democratic

transition.




23
   If dependence is only moderate, however, the incumbents may be able to shield themselves from
political instability by saving significant oil revenues in reserve funds—as Russia has done—and using
these funds to cushion price shocks. The effectiveness of such a strategy obviously depends on how great
is the price volatility and how long the shocks last.
