Dominated Options in Health-Insurance Plans

NBER Working Paper No. 24392

JEL No. D22,G22,I13

                                        ABSTRACT

Recent studies have found that many people select into health plans with higher coverage (e.g.,
lower deductibles) even when those plans are financially dominated by other options. We explore
whether having dominated options is common by analyzing data on plan designs from the Kaiser
Family Foundation Employer Health Benefits Survey for firms that offered employees both a
high-deductible (HD) health plan and a lower-deductible (LD) option. In 65% of firms the high-
deductible option would result in lower maximum possible health spending for the employee for
the year. We estimate that the HD plan financially dominates the LD plan at roughly half of
firms across a wide range of possible health spending needs employees might anticipate. The
expected savings from selecting the HD plan are typically over $500 per year, often with no
increase in financial risk. We present evidence that these patterns may arise naturally from
employers passing through large average-cost differences between HD and LD plans to their
employees. We discuss the implications of those dynamics for the nature of transfers between
employees and the efficiency of health spending.

         As part of a broader pattern of expanding insurance choice in the U.S., employers are
increasingly giving employees the option to select plans with different coverage levels as part of
their benefit packages (Bundorf, 2016; Claxton, 2016). For example, many firms offer both plans
with lower deductibles and a qualifying high-deductible health plan that can be matched with a
health savings account. It is natural to think about these menus as offering employees tradeoffs
between expected spending and risk. However, a few recent studies have analyzed situations where
higher-deductible plans financially dominate lower-deductible options for employees (Handel,
2013; Bhargava, Loewenstein and Sydnor, 2017). This raises the question of whether these are
unique (and valuable) case studies for analyzing individual decision making or if there are more
systematic patterns causing plan options with lower coverage levels to be relatively financially
attractive and even dominating.

    We explore this question by analyzing data on employer-sponsored health plans from the
Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) and Health Research Educational Trust (HRET) Survey of
Employer Health Benefits. The KFF/HRET survey includes detailed information on health plan
designs, including employee premium contributions and plan cost-sharing rules. Our analysis
focuses on the details for employee-only coverage. 1 To isolate firms offering employees a choice
based on different levels of insurance coverage, we identify 331 firms that offered both a high-
deductible (HD) health plan paired with a health savings or reimbursement account (HSA or HRA)
and a second plan with a lower deductible (LD). Under the assumption that the unobservable
quality of the provider network of an HD plan offered by an employer is at least as good as the
network in the lower-deductible option, we can use the details about the financial plan designs to
compare plans. 2

    We find that high-deductible plans often offer employees lower worst-case spending risk. This
occurs because the combination of employee premium savings and the contributions to health
savings/reimbursement accounts that employers make for those who opt into the high-deductible
plans often exceeds the increase in out-of-pocket maximums employees face with high-deductible
plans. On average the difference in deductibles between the high-deductible and low-deductible
options for employee-only coverage is around $1,300 and the differences in maximum-out-of-

  The KFF data do not have full details of plan designs for the family-level coverage, but from the data we can observe
we suspect that the patterns we document would likely be at least as strong for family-level coverage.
2
  In Section 2 we discuss this assumption and argue that it is likely to be reasonable in this setting.



                                                                                                                     1
pocket limits between these plans is around $550. The direct savings that employees receive from
selecting the HD options, through employee-premium reductions and firm contributions to HSAs
and HRAs, averages over $1,000. Ultimately, at 65% of the firms, the direct savings for those
who select HD plans exceeds the increase in maximum-out-of-pocket limits.

   We further estimate that at a substantial fraction of firms the HD plan offers employees
stochastically dominating, and frequently even strictly dominating, distributions of total yearly
health costs. This analysis requires us to account for the complexities of the full schedule of cost-
sharing for each plan. In order to make this comparison in a tractable way, we use an approach
developed by Ericson, Kircher, Spinnewijn and Starc (2015) that transforms a highly complex
health plan with many different procedure-specific cost-sharing rules into a simpler approximation
of that plan based on the same deductible and maximum-out-of-pocket limit but a single
coinsurance rate. With these simplified plan representations, we can compare the spending
consequences for employees of different plan choices for different levels of total medical bills they
may incur for the year. We find that with the simplified plan representations, at one third of firms
the employee’s total costs for the year with the HD plans strictly dominates the total costs with the
LD plan for any level of total medical spending. When we further combine the information on
plan schedules with possible ex-ante distributions of total medical spending employees might face,
we find that the HD plan second-order stochastically dominates at about half of the firms across a
wide range of possible ex-ante spending distributions.

   These differences in plan value might be insignificant if few employees select into lower-
deductible plans at the firms where those plans have especially high relative costs. Prior research
on individual decisions in these settings, however, reveals that high shares of employees select
lower-deductible plans even at extremely high costs due both to inertia (Handel, 2013) and active
choice into those plans (Bhargava et al., 2017). While the KFF survey does not have individual-
choice data, firms do report the total share of enrollment in their different plan categories. On
average the majority of employees are enrolled in LD options, even at firms where we estimate
that the HD plan dominates.

       The expected financial savings to employees who select high-deductible plans are non-
trivial. We estimate that the average savings to employees of selecting the high-deductible option
across all firms offering both types of plans is over $500 per year for a wide range of different ex-




                                                                                                   2
ante medical-spending distributions the employee might face. At the firms where the simplified
representation of the high-deductible plan strictly dominates the alternative, the expected savings
from selecting the HD plan are frequently over $1,000 for the year for a typical employee. The
sizeable level of savings for an HD plan is not affected much by instead measuring risk-adjusted
savings using various levels of constant absolute risk aversion.

   A natural question is why employers would design menus that present employees with
dominant and dominated options. The data available in the KFF survey do not allow us to answer
this question conclusively and it is generally difficult to disentangle the potential motivations
behind employers’ benefit designs. However, we present analysis that helps explain how these
situations can arise rather naturally in employer-sponsored settings. The mechanism is that a
combination of adverse selection and moral hazard may cause a wider disparity in the average
costs (from the insurer perspective) for enrollees in the HD plans versus the LD plans than would
be expected simply from the reduction in coverage levels between those plans. Firms appear to
roughly equalize their total contributions to health care across plans in their menu, which means
they pass through these large average cost differences to employees enrolling in the HD plans.
This can generate substantial savings for those who enroll in the HD option and when the
difference in deductibles and out-of-pocket limits between plans are not large, can cause the HD
option to become financially dominant.

   We discuss how the implications of these dynamics depend on the extent to which excess
disparities in average costs across plans arise due to adverse selection versus moral hazard. If the
differences were entirely driven by selection on ex-ante health risk, then there is a large transfer
from LD plan enrollees to HD plan enrollees relative to a situation where all employees pool in a
single plan option. We quantify the size of that transfer using a simplified counter-factual analysis
in the spirit of Handel and Kolstad (2015) and find that it averages around $200 per year. The
other possibility is that HD plans have lower average cost because employees reduce medical
spending substantially in response to higher cost-sharing. In this case, the emergence of
dominating HD options that do not attract all employees suggests sizeable economic inefficiencies.
Frictions people face in choosing plans or anticipated behavioral inefficiencies under higher cost-
sharing (ala Baicker et al., 2015) could make it difficult for some employees to take advantage of
the available savings with HD options they could have even if they did not want to alter their
medical spending under the HD plan. The existing literature has documented strong evidence for



                                                                                                   3
both substantial adverse selection and moral hazard responses in employers-sponsored health
insurance. While we cannot disentangle these forces for the firms in the Kaiser Family Foundation
data, this analysis highlights that these dynamics are important for better understanding the effects
of the proliferation of coverage-level options in employers-sponsored insurance.

   This study presents the first systematic analysis of the net financial value of plan options with
different levels of coverage in employer-sponsored health insurance. Prior research has exploited
situations where plans with lower deductibles are dominated by higher-deductible options to
evaluate individual insurance decisions relative to the benchmark of standard insurance-demand
models (Handel, 2013; Bhargava et al., 2017). Our results show that these situations are not only
interesting case studies, but are common in employer-sponsored health insurance. In fact, we find
that HD plans are equally likely to dominate LD plans across firms with very different
characteristics, such as size and employee salary levels. These findings are significant, in part,
because prior research has documented that employees with chronic health conditions, lower
incomes and lower education levels are more likely to select costly lower-deductible plans in these
situations (Bhargava, et al., 2017). For example, Handel (2013) documented that families of 3 or
more who were earning less than $41,000 per year were often choosing dominated options, costing
them at least an additional $1,000 per year for sure. The fact that high-deductible options offer
substantial expected savings relative to their additional out-of-pocket risk, even to the point of
dominating lower-deductible options in many cases, implies that the expansion of plan options
may be creating substantial benefit disparities between groups of employees based on health,
financial security, and insurance literacy.

   Our findings also highlight an interesting disconnect between the popular perception of high-
deductible options and the reality of the economic value of these plans in employer-sponsored
settings. There has been substantial focus in recent years on the fact that deductibles in employee-
sponsored health plans are rising faster than wages and concern that this trend is exposing
employees to financial harm (e.g., Altman, 2016; Evans, 2017). Some of this concern may,
however, be exaggerated if analysis does not also account for the size of premium reductions and
contributions firms make to health savings and reimbursement accounts for those in high-
deductible plans. Yet it is also clear that aversion to higher-deductibles is widespread in insurance
(Sydnor, 2010; Abaluck and Gruber, 2011; Bharshegyan et al., 2013; Handel and Kolstad, 2015;
Bhargava et al., 2017). This highlights the need for more research into decision aids that help



                                                                                                   4
people better understand the consequences of insurance options (Johnson et al., 2013; Loewenstein
et al., 2013; Samek and Sydnor, 2017). It also suggests a need for more research into alternative
motives driving insurance demand, including liquidity constraints and budgeting problems
(Ericson and Sydnor, 2018) as well as concerns people may have about how higher levels of cost
sharing might cause them to avoid getting care in suboptimal ways (Brot-Goldberg et al., 2017;
Baicker, Mullainathan and Schwartzstein, 2015). These considerations may well imply that the
choice of lower-deductible options that appear to be dominated from classical insurance-demand
perspectives are rational for some people. What our analysis shows is that at many companies
employees who select LD options over HD options, whatever the mix of rationality and confusion
behind that choice, are receiving a lower level of net health benefits for the year.

       Finally, the results call into question the role of corporate human resource departments and
benefit consultants in designing choice options for health insurance. While there may be a number
of motives for firms to offer high-deductible plans that are relatively attractive, we suspect that
relatively few benefits departments at companies where HD options dominate have analyzed the
plan options from that perspective or communicate that fact clearly to their employees in benefit
materials. Our findings complement recent research by Abaluck and Gruber (2016), who find that
school districts with more plan options tended to have more low-value options in their menu,
suggesting that some benefit managers fail to eliminate low-value options as they expand choice.
Overall, it may be important to invest more research into helping firms better understand the
consequence of their insurance-option designs. Regulation of employer-sponsored insurance may
also benefit from focusing on the details of plan designs and how employees’ choices across
insurance levels may generate disparities in the overall benefit value employees receive.



       2. Data

           Our primary dataset is the Kaiser Family Foundation Employer Health Benefits Survey
(KFF EHBS). The EHBS is an annual survey on employer-sponsored health insurance plans that
is widely cited in health care research. 3 The survey draws its sample from a list of U.S. private and



3
    See for example, Claxton et al. (2015)



                                                                                                    5
public employers with three or more workers, covering ten industry categories and six firm-size
categories. 4 We use data from the 2015 survey. 5

         The key benefit of the survey for our purposes is that firms are asked to provide rich details
about the plans they offer to their employees, including information on cost-sharing features and
premiums. Each plan reported by a firm is classified within the survey into one of four plan types:
preferred provider organization (PPO), health maintenance organization (HMO), point-of-service
plans (POS), and high deductible health plans (HDHP). Plans are classified as HDHPs if they have
both a deductible for single (i.e., employee-only) coverage larger than $1000 and either a paired
health saving account (HSA) or health reimbursement arrangement (HRA) option. 6 We refer to
these as HDHPs or simply high deductible (HD) plans throughout. All other plans are classified
as either preferred provider organization (PPO) plans, health maintenance organization (HMO)
plans or point-of-service (POS) plans. We refer to the latter three as either non-HD or equivalently
as low deductible (LD) plans throughout the analysis. For each type of plan offered, the survey
collected information including premium, deductible, cost-sharing etc. If a firm offers more than
one plan in each type, only details of the plan of that type with the largest enrollment are recorded.

         Our analysis focuses on firms in the survey that report data for both an HDHP plan and
exactly one of the low deductible (LD) plan types. We compare HDHP with an LD alternative in
part because the anecdotal cases of health plan menus with dominated options reported in previous
studies have been situations where higher deductible plans dominated lower deductible plans.
Furthermore, our ideal experiment would be a situation where the other aspects of plans, including
the generosity of their network and restrictions on access to care or covered services, are held fixed.
The Kaiser Family Foundation data do not have information about the networks covered in the
different plans. By their very nature, HMO and PPO plans almost surely differ on some of these
dimensions and for this reason we do not compare HMO and PPO offerings to one another. In
contrast, HD plans often have similar networks as LD plans within the same firm (e.g., Handel
2013, Brot-Goldberg et al., 2017), or have more generous network access since high deductibles

  Some firms responded with options offered in 2014, some with 2015 options. That means all plans are offered at the
same time within a firm, but the plan-year covered in the data may differ across firms.
6 For a single-coverage plan to be eligible for a paired Health Savings Account per IRS rules it needs a deductible of

$1250 in 2014 and $1300 in 2015.



                                                                                                                    6
can substitute for other forms of cost control (Ellis and Zhu, 2016) 7. A key assumption for the
analysis to follow is that the non-financial features of the HD and LD plans offered by the same
firm are similar enough (or potentially slightly biased in favor of HD plans) so as to make a
comparison of the financial features of those plans meaningful.

         It is also important for the relevance of our analysis that employees actually have a choice
between these plan options and that the plans we observe in the data are not offered to separate
subsets of employees. The Kaiser Family Foundation survey does not explicitly address the issue,
but we believe for most firms employees face a choice. First, the survey excludes any plan that is
offered and administered exclusively by a union. Second, Bundorf (2012, 2016) reports that large
firms generally offer high-deductible options alongside other plans. Recent empirical studies have
also relied on data from firms offering employees choices between coverage options (e.g., Einav,
Finkelstein and Cullen, 2010; Handel, 2013; Handel and Kolstad, 2015; Bhargava, Loewenstein
and Sydnor, 2017). Finally, a recent study by Willis Towers Watson (2015) on U.S. firms with
1,000 or more employees reports that while the number of firms offering only a HDHP is rising,
that a large number of firms “still offer alternatives”. That same study reports that around half of
those firms are planning to more highly subsidize HDHP plans in an effort to encourage employees
to enroll in those options, again implying that employees are being given a choice.

         There are a total of 1771 firms that responded to the 2015 version of the survey and reported
offering at least one health insurance plan to their employees. Among those firms, we have
complete and consistent plan information for 2372 plans offered by 1529 firms. About 30% of all
plans are HD plan, and they are offered by about 46% firms. For our analysis sample, we focus on
firms reporting details for 1 HD plan and 1 LD plan. After dropping firms with plans with certain
complicated cost-sharing structures for which an actuarial value cannot be calculated us the CMS
Actuarial Value Calculator, we are left with a match sample of 331 firms offering 662 plans.
Detailed cleaning steps are in Appendix I.

         We analyze information for the single-coverage (i.e., employee-only) tier at each firm. The
KFF data does not contain complete plan information for family-level coverage, which prevents
us from doing our full analysis on the family-coverage level. However, we present some limited


7
  This does not rule out the possibility that firms offering HD plans may tend to have more restrictive networks than
firms that do not offer HD plans, but within firm we expect the HD plans to have a weakly more generous network.



                                                                                                                   7
comparison between single-coverage and family-coverage on the variables where we have
information below.

         Table 1 presents summary statistics of key plan financial features and firm demographics
both in the broader sample of surveyed firms and for the 331 firms for our analysis sample. We
discuss the details of these statistics for our analysis sample in more detail in the next section. At
this stage we note primarily that the financial features of HD and non-HD plans look broadly
similar when we compare the full sample and the analysis sample of firms offering both types of
plans. Key differences are that firms in the analysis sample are somewhat more likely to have self-
insured their plans and are somewhat more likely to report having more than 1,000 employees.

         In parts of our analysis we supplement the data on plan options with information on
distributions of total medical spending. For those analyses we use data from the Center for
Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We describe the
relevant details of these data sources below when we incorporate them in the analysis.



    3. Analysis of Maximum-Spending Risk using Raw Plan Designs

    We begin our analysis by examining how plan designs and contributions to health
savings/reimbursement accounts map into maximum-spending risk for an employee. This analysis
allows us to get a first simple look at the financial value of different insurance options before
delving into the complexities of cost-sharing rules, which we address in the next section.

    In Table 1, consider first the average lower-deductible option. For these plans, the average
annual deductible is $846 and the maximum-out-of-pocket limit averages $3,464. The employee
is responsible for a total of $1,450 for employee-paid premiums on average for these plans. So an
employee that hits her deductible would expect to pay approximately $2,300 on average for the
year in health costs (premium + deductible). The worst-case total health spending in these plans
would average just over $4,900 (premium + max out-of-pocket). 8


8
  The numbers we report here and throughout the analysis are pre-tax dollars. While health-insurance premiums are
paid with pre-tax dollars, out-of-pocket medical costs are sometimes paid with post-tax dollars. For all HD plans
considered here, however, employees have access to HSA/HRA accounts that allow them to pay for out-of-pocket
costs with pre-tax dollars. Many LD plans can also be paired with medical spending accounts that similarly allow
them to cover out-of-pocket costs with pre-tax dollars, though these accounts are more limited than HSA accounts.
Our focus on pre-tax dollars, if anything, creates a slight bias that makes LD plans look more financially attractive



                                                                                                                   8
    The HD plans at these firms naturally have higher deductibles (avg. $2,166) and maximum-
out-of-pocket limits (avg. $4,011), but also have substantially lower premiums (avg. $841) and
additional contributions by the firms to health savings and reimbursement accounts. When we
compare the plan types we see that an employee selecting an HD plan would on average be exposed
to a $1,320 increase in the deductible and a $547 increase in the maximum-out-of-pocket limit.
An employee in the average HD plan, however, would pay $609 less in employee-paid premiums
over the course of the year. This alone is enough to cover the difference in maximum out-of-
pocket spending for the year and is just under half of the deductible difference.

    Firms, however, also tend to contribute to a health savings account or a health reimbursement
account for employees who select the HD options. A contribution made by the firm to a health
savings account is fully vested immediately for the employee. Money in an HSA can be used to
pay for medical spending with pre-tax dollars at any time and can be withdrawn for non-medical
spending with rules similar to those in tax-advantaged retirement accounts. An HSA contribution
by the firm is very similar to a reduction in the required employee premium. Contributions firms
make to a health reimbursement account (HRA) are used to reimburse employees for uninsured
health spending, but unlike an HSA these funds are the property of the employer and unused funds
do not follow the employee if the employee leaves the firm. In our sample we observe that 86%
of the firms offer an HSA and 14% offer an HRA, with most firms making contributions into these
accounts for their employees. As Table 1 shows, the average contributions to HSAs ($473) and
HRAs ($758) are sizable, which substantially reduces an employee’s maximum-spending risk with
the HD option.

    Figure 1 shows the cumulative distribution function for the difference in worst-case spending
between HD and LD plans across the 331 firms in our analysis sample. We define worst-case
spending here as employee premium plus maximum out-of-pocket limit minus any contribution to
HSA or HRA for the plan. We find that at 65% of the firms the worst-case spending is lower with
the HD plan after accounting for both employee-paid premiums and health savings/reimbursement
contributions by the firm. On average, the worst-case spending risk is $576 lower with the HD




than they really would be because some out-of-pocket costs for LD plans might require post-tax dollars while in
principle out-of-pocket costs can be paid with pre-tax dollars in almost all cases with an HD plan.



                                                                                                             9
plans. The HD option reduces worst-case spending risk by over $1,000 at 38% of firms, while it
increases the worst-case spending risk by over $1,000 at only 14% of firms.

   We can also do a limited version of this same analysis for the family-coverage data. The KFF
data do not have information about the maximum-out-of-pocket limit for family coverage tiers.
However, they do have information about the family deductible level for each plan. That
information still may be somewhat incomplete for family coverage, because family coverage often
included individual-specific sub-deductibles along with the overall family deductible. However,
analyzing the information we do have gives us at least suggestive evidence that the issues we
document here for single-coverage tiers likely also apply for family coverage. In particular, we
compare the net difference in premiums (including HSA/HRA contributions) between HD and LD
plans to the net difference in deductibles between plans for both single and family coverage. We
find that for single coverage, 140 of the 331 firms offer a greater net premium reduction (employee
premium + HSA/HRA contribution) for choosing the HD plan than the deductible difference
between HD and LD. For the family-coverage tier we find that 186 of the 331 firms have a larger
net premium difference than deductible difference, which suggests this issue is likely to be at least
as prevalent for family coverage. We further find that of the cases where the single coverage tier
shows this pattern of higher net premium differences than deductible differences, that also holds
for the family coverage tier at those firms in 85% of cases.

   The analysis in this section shows that the worst-case spending risk is lower with the HD option
at nearly two-thirds of the firms offering an HD and LD option. This pattern is consistent with the
possibility that the total health spending distributions employees face with HD plans could
dominate what they face with LD alternatives. However, it is also important to note that the worst-
case level of spending will not be reached by most people and assessing the net insurance value of
different options requires us to do more to account for the full range of spending consequences an
employee could face with each plan.



   4. Analysis of Dominance using Simplified Plan Representations

   We aim in this section to analyze the distribution of total-spending consequences an employee
would face under the different plan options. At a basic level, most health insurance plans create a
non-linear schedule that maps from total medical bills to the insured’s out-of-pocket spending in



                                                                                                  10
three segments: 1) the region under the deductible, where medical bills transfer to out-of-pocket
costs on a one-to-one basis 2) a partial cost-sharing region above the deductible where the
individual pays a fraction of each marginal medical bill and 3) a maximum-out-of-pocket region
where the limit has been hit and the individual’s out-of-pocket spending no longer increases with
medical bills. The details of most plans are, of course, more complicated than that, but this basic
structure guides the approach for our analysis.

   Figure 2 provides an illustration of four different cases we might see when comparing these
types of non-linear mappings from medical bills to out-of-pocket costs across plans. For each
figure on the x-axis we graph total medical bills for the year. The y-axis shows the employee’s
total health spending for the year, which in these graphs is the employee’s premium plus out-of-
pocket costs. We discuss how we incorporate HSA and HRA contributions for HD plans below.
Case 1 is an example of a classic tradeoff between HD and LD plans and is likely what most
economists would have in mind when considering a comparison of an HD and LD option. In this
example, the premium is lower for the HD plan, but the higher deductible and maximum out-of-
pocket limits for the HD plan cause the schedules to cross for relatively moderate levels of total
medical bills (in this case around $3,000). The other three cases, however, show examples where
the worst-case spending risk is lower with the HD option. In Cases 2 and 3 the HD plan would
result in higher costs for the employee only for intermediate levels of medical bills. In a situation
like Case 3 the HD plan is likely to second-order stochastically dominate the LD plan. Finally, in
Case 4 we see an example where the employee’s costs strictly dominate under the HD plan. In
Section 4.1 we describe how we transform complex schedules of cost-sharing rules observed for
actual plan designs into simplified plan representations that allow us to make the type of
comparisons presented in Figure 2.



   4.1 Creating Simplified Plan Representations

   For our analysis we transform the schedule of cost-sharing rules for each plan into these types
of simplified schedules. These simplified representations allow us to compare how different plans
map to employee spending (premiums + cost-sharing) for different levels of total medical spending.
We follow a procedure introduced by Ericson, Kircher, Spinnewijn and Starc (2015). Their
procedure involves first calculating the actuarial value (AV), i.e., share of medical spending



                                                                                                  11
covered by insurance, of a plan using the full cost-sharing provisions of the plan. The AV is
calculated using the Actuarial Value Calculator established by CMS for estimating the AV of plans
for the Affordable Care Act exchanges. The next step is to solve for a single co-insurance
percentage – i.e., fraction of bills the individual must pay once the annual deductible has been met
– that generates a plan with the same AV, holding fixed the original deductible and maximum-out-
of-pocket limit from the original plan. This generates a simplified plan with only the basic cost-
sharing features (deductible, coinsurance, and max out-of-pocket) so that the out-of-pocket
consequences of each plan are simply a function of total medial spending for the year. The
coinsurance rate for this simplified plan will approximate the average fraction of medical bills paid
out-of-pocket under the original plan design at different levels of total health spending. The
simplified coinsurance rate is based on the average mix of health services used by people at
different levels of total spending.

   For example, one of the firms in our analysis sample offers a plan with a $1,500 deductible,
$5,000 maximum-out-of-pocket limit, a 20% employee coinsurance rate on most medical services
once the deductible is hit, a $20 copay per primary-care office visit, and a 25% employee
coinsurance rate on most prescription drugs. We calculate an actuarial value for this plan based
on the full set of cost-sharing features of 74.1%. We then calculate that a simpler plan design with
the same $1,500 deductible and $5,000 maximum out-of-pocket limit would need a single
coinsurance rate of 21% to have the same actuarial value.

   There are a few other complications that arise in trying to map complex service-specific cost-
sharing rules into a simpler structure based on total spending. The main issue is that in many plan
designs, some specific services are subject to fixed copayment amounts even before the individual
has hit the deductible for the year. This issues tends to most often affect cost-sharing for
prescription drug coverage and physician office visits and is much more likely to occur in LD
plans than HD plans because federal rules for HD plans typically limit their ability to provide
partial coverage for services before the deductible is met. We use information contained in the
continuance tables that underlie the CMS AV calculator to break down each total spending level
into different categories so that we can get a simplified plan representation that accounts for these
nuances of how different services apply to the deductible. Appendix B outlines the steps of our
full procedure in detail.




                                                                                                  12
    The other slight complication in generating the final simplified plan representations is
accounting for contributions by firms to HSAs and HRAs. Since HSA contributions are fully
vested for employees immediately, we treat them simply as equivalent to a reduction in the
premium paid. As such, they represent a constant shift down in the entire schedule of employee
costs at every level of total medical spending. For HRA contributions, in contrast, the money can
only be used to offset out-of-pocket medical spending. This then creates in initial section of the
employee-cost schedule that is flat under the assumption that medical bills are paid from HRA
funds before employee cost-sharing kicks in. Again, the details of this structure are outlined in
Appendix B.

    It is worth clarifying the way in which our simplified plan representations do and do not rely
on distributional assumptions. These representations create a mapping between total medical
spending levels and an employee’s total costs. The mapping works for people who might end up
at different total spending levels and does not rely on assumptions about the distribution over total
spending levels. Where the mappings are affected by underlying distributions is that they rely on
information on the share of total medical bills going to different medical services. For each level
of total medical bills, the CMS continuance tables provide a breakdown of spending by services
(e.g., office visits, inpatient, etc…) that is based on the average mix of services used by people
with that level of medical bills in the broader population. It is possible, though, for two people to
reach a given level of total medical bills with different mixes of services, which means the
approach is accurate for people with a typical mix of services given a level of expenditure but will
not perfectly represent all situations.

    There are a number of reasons that relying on the average mix of services conditional on the
level of medical spending is not likely to be a substantial concern for our analysis. First, 22% of
all plans start out as simplified plans to begin with and are unaffected by the procedure.
Furthermore, there is strong correlation between the level of cost-sharing for different services
within plan designs. Plans with low coverage on one service tend to have low coverage on other
services as well, which mutes the potential effects of different services mixes. 9 Finally, using a


9For example, we calculate that there is a correlation of 0.72 between a plan’s coinsurance rate for outpatient surgery
and the effective coinsurance rate on primary-care office visits (transforming copays to coinsurance rates using the
average office visit cost in the CMS actuarial value calculator of $147). There are also positive correlations between
spending on different services. Those who have high drug expenditures, for example, are also likely to have high



                                                                                                                    13
typical mixture of underlying services for each level of medical spending is likely to be an
appropriate approach for analyzing the insurance value of different plan designs for most people.
Most people face fairly substantial uncertainty about the level of total medical spending they will
incur in a year and it is that uncertainty which drives the first-order differences in insurance value.
Most people, in contrast, have little reason to anticipate that they will use unusual mixes of services
conditional on a level of spending and the degree of uncertainty generated by variation in the mix
of services conditional on the level of medical spending is likely to be more second order.

    We use the procedures outlined in this section to map each of the 662 plans in our analysis
sample to simplified plan representations. Appendix C (intended for online publication only) has
graphs of the two simplified plan representations (LD and HD) for each of the 331 firms in the
analysis sample.



    4.2 Results

    Once we have converted each plan into a simplified plan representation, it is straightforward
to classify the firms based on which of their plans exposes the individual to greater worst-case
spending risk and whether one plan strictly dominates the other. That is, we can map the firms to
the cases we highlighted in Figure 2. This analysis simply compares the different schedules of
employee spending (net premiums plus out-of-pocket costs) as a function of total medical spending
and does not require additional assumptions about the ex-ante distribution of total medical
spending the individual faces.

    Table 2 shows this classification and reveals that a substantial share of firms have menus where
the HD plan strictly dominates the LD plan based on their simplified plan representations. We
find that 32% of firms have HD and LD options that present a classic tradeoff (Case 1 from Figure
2) where the HD plan has lower spending for the employee if total medical spending is low but the
LD plan has lower worst-case spending for the employee. At 37% of firms, however, the HD
plan’s simplified plan representation strictly dominates the schedule for the LD plan (Case 4). At
another 25% of firms, the HD plan shows the Case 3 profile of having lower spending for the
employee under both best-case and worst-case medical-spending needs, but higher spending for

levels of inpatient services and/or specialist visits. This type of positive correlation reduces the amount of variation
in service mix for a given level of total medical spending.



                                                                                                                     14
some intermediate ranges of medical spending. A small fraction of firms (6%) show other patterns,
including 2% where the LD option appears to strictly dominate. 10

     The final column of Table 2 shows the average percent of enrollees in an HD option for the
firms in each of these classification groups. It is important to note that this may not be the fraction
enrolled in the specific HD plan for which we have the plan details, as firms report the plan within
each category with the highest enrollment. Nonetheless, these reported fractions are revealing in
two ways. First, there is a correlation between the classifications and enrollment. On average 25%
of employees are enrolled in HD options at the firms where there is a classic tradeoff between HD
and LD, while 47% enrolled in HD plans on average at the firms where HD plans strictly dominate
the LD plans. So enrollment in HD plans is higher where standard theory says that the HD option
is more attractive. Yet it is perhaps more remarkable that even at firms where the HD plan
dominates the LD plan only 47% of employees are enrolled in HD plans. This finding is broadly
consistent with the results in Handel (2013) and Bhargava et al., (2017).

     In Table 3 we classify firms based on whether either of the plan schedules displays first-order
or second-order stochastic dominance relative to the other option. 11 This analysis requires us to
impose a particular ex-ante distribution of total medical spending. For our baseline analysis we
use the distribution of total medical spending from the gold-tier combined (medical plus
prescription drug) continuance table from the CMS Actuarial Value Calculator. We discuss the
robustness of the results to alternative medical-spending distributions in the next section, but note
here that this distribution is based on claims data for privately insured individual and is likely a
reasonable ex-ante distribution for the average person covered by employer-sponsored insurance.

     The table shows that no additional firms have first-order-stochastically-dominant HD plans
beyond those already identified as strictly dominant in Table 2. A higher share (53%) of firms,



10 These few cases where the LD options strictly dominates implies that the higher-coverage LD plan has a lower
employee premium than the HD plan, which may suggest a data error in the survey or a case where the LD plan has a
much more restrictive network than the HD option. We keep these firms in the analysis, however, so as not to bias the
results in favor of finding dominance for HD plans.
11 For two risky prospects represented by the cumulative distribution function F and G, F first-order stochastically

dominates G if F(z) ≤ G(z), for all z. All expected-utility maximizers whose marginal utility of wealth is positive
will prefer prospect F over G if F first-order stochastically dominates G. Prospect F second order stochastically
                    k           k
dominates G if ∫x F(x)dx ≤ ∫x G(x)dx, for all k. All risk-averse expected-utility maximizer will prefer prospect F
over G if F second-order stochastically dominates G.




                                                                                                                  15
though, have HD plans that second-order stochastically dominate the LD option. This implies that
at these firms any risk-averse expected-utility maximizer who faces the average distribution of
total medical spending should prefer the HD option over the LD option, regardless of their degree
of risk aversion.

   Beyond classifying the firms based on measures of dominance, it is instructive to consider how
much money an average employee could expect to save by selecting the HD option over the LD
option. For this analysis we again use the CMS gold-tier continuance table for the distribution of
ex-ante total medical spending, though in the next section we explore the robustness of these
measures to alternative spending distributions. Table 4 shows the results. We calculate on average
across all 331 firms that an employee facing this ex-ante distribution of medical spending could
expect to save $569 by selecting the HD option over the LD option. The 25th percentile of expected
savings is $192 and the 75th percentile is $884. At the 37% of firms where the HD option strictly
dominates, the HD option would save the representative employee an average of $1,121.

   Of course, when considering insurance options, focusing on expected savings is not entirely
appropriate because foregoing some money in expectation for a reduction in risk is the ultimate
purpose of insurance. In order to address that point we also analyze risk-adjusted measures of
spending. For this analysis we assume that the individual has constant absolute risk aversion
(CARA) utility over total employee spending for the year, which is a common functional form
used for utility in studies of health-insurance demand. For different levels of constant absolute
risk aversion (r), we can then calculate the expected utility for each plan option, again integrating
over the distribution of total medical spending from the CMS gold-tier continuance table. In order
to calculate the risk-adjusted savings measure we then simply solve for the minimum sure amount
of money that would have to be given to the individual under the LD plan to equate the utility of
the LD plan with that of the HD plan.

   The second two columns of Table 4 give the risk-adjusted savings results for r = 0.0005 and
0.002 respectively. The bottom rows of the table help to benchmark the implications of these
levels of risk aversion. One benchmark is the certainty equivalent a person with CARA utility of
that degree would have for a 50% chance of winning $1,000, which is $438 for r = 0.0005 (i.e., a
$62 risk premium) and $283 for r = 0.002 (i.e., a $217 risk premium). The second benchmark
calculates the gain a person with that risk aversion would need to accept a 50/50 gamble with a




                                                                                                  16
downside of losing $1,000. For r = 0.0005 that gain is $2,092, while there is no level of gain that
would make an individual with CARA r = 0.002 accept a 50% chance of losing $1,000. As such,
we can reasonably classify these cases as spanning substantial to extreme levels of risk aversion.
On average the risk-adjusted savings levels for choosing HD plans are somewhat lower than, but
similar to, the expected savings at $471 for r = 0.0005 and $440 for r = 0.002. So even if we
assumed that employees had extreme levels of risk aversion (r = 0.002), employees with
representative distributions of medical spending would on average see a risk-adjusted savings of
over $400 for opting into HD plans over LD plans. At the 37% of firms where the HD plan strictly
dominates, increasing levels of risk aversion actually lead to greater levels of risk-adjusted savings
than expected savings, which relates to the fact that HD plans have lower worst-case spending.



       4.3 Robustness of Main Results

       The analysis of second-order-stochastic dominance patterns and (risk adjusted) savings in
Section 4.2 used the CMS gold-tier distribution for total medical spending. While this is a
reasonable representation of the ex-ante medical spending for an average employee, it is worth
considering how our analysis would look for employees facing different distributions of medical
spending. The CMS Actuarial Value Calculator actually has four different underlying continuance
tables, one for each tier in the ACA exchange market (bronze, silver, gold, and platinum). We
find that the results from Section 4.2 are nearly identical using any of these distributions. However,
these distributions are all based on large populations of people with certain levels of insurance
coverage and as such may not represent the type of idiosyncratic variation in medical-spending
risk we might reasonably see within the employee population at a given firm.

       In order to generate additional variation in the medical-spending distributions for our analysis,
we turn to data on total medical spending from the 2014 wave of the Medical Expenditure Panel
Survey (MEPS). We use data for the population with coverage from an employer or group
insurance plan in place throughout the year. We then run an ordinary-least-squares regression of
total medical spending for the year on a cubic polynomial in age, gender and indicators for self-
reported health status (5-categories) and the interactions of all of those variables. 12 We obtain the



12
     MEPS respondents evaluate their health status according to 5 categories: excellent, very good, good fair, and poor.



                                                                                                                     17
predicted values from this regression, which is a measure of the expected total medical spending
based on these basic demographic indicators. We then group the individual MEPS respondents in
our regression sample into deciles of predicted medical spending. This yields 10 distinct groups
of people, with substantial variation across groups in expected medical spending. For each of these
ten groups we then consider the distribution of realized medical spending. That is, we generate 10
representative individuals with different ex-ante medical spending distributions (which match the
distribution of ex-post realizations for the MEPS respondents in that group). 13

     Figure 3 plots the mean, median and 80th percentiles of realized spending for each of these
deciles of predicted medical spending. The 10th decile, for example, has average total medical
spending of around $15,000 and median spending of just under $6,000, the latter of which is
comparable to the mean spending from the CMS gold-tier distribution used in our baseline analysis.
Overall, we see that these 10 distributions vary substantially in both their expected spending and
the spread of spending from the median to 80th percentile. 14

     Figure 4 shows how our classification of firms based on whether the HD plan second-order
stochastically dominates the LD plan varies across these different distributions. Consistent with
our baseline results, we find that approximately 50% of firms have HD plans that second-order
stochastically dominate the LD plan across these very different distributions of medical spending
risk. The basic trend is that for lower-expected-spending distributions there is a slightly lower
share of second-order-stochastically-dominant HD plans and a somewhat higher share for the
highest-spending distributions. This is consistent with the fact that many HD plans have lower
employee spending for very high levels of medical spending but not for more intermediate
medical-spending outcomes. Hence, these results show that the basic conclusion that around half
of firms in this sample have dominant HD plans is robust to a wide range of different ex-ante
distributions of medical spending needs one could consider. Moreover, if one were concerned that



13
   For this analysis we use the sample weights provided in the MEPS in the regression predicting total spending. We
also use the weights to calculate discrete probabilities of different total spending levels (84 atoms), consistent with the
atoms in the CMS continuance tables used in the primary analysis.
14
   The mean spending in the CMS gold-tier distribution is very close to the mean spending for the 8th decile of expected
spending in our MEPS sample. This suggests that the MEPS spending levels are lower than those used in the CMS
continuance tables. This partly reflects the fact that our MEPS data is from 2014, while the CMS continuance tables
are projected for spending levels in 2016. This pattern is also consistent with analysis by Aizcorbe et al., (2012), who
compare total spending levels in the MEPS 2005 data and claims data from the Marketscan database and conclude
that MEPS estimates are 10% lower on average.



                                                                                                                        18
our baseline analysis might overstate the dominance of HD plans for those who could reasonably
anticipate that they have high medical spending results, these results show that if anything the
share of firms with dominant HD plans looks larger for those who can expect to have very high
levels of medical spending.

     Figure 5 shows the robustness of the expected-savings and risk-adjusted-expected-savings
results across these alternative medical-spending distributions. Here we see more variation based
on the distribution used, but again the basic conclusions that HD plans offer large average and
risk-adjusted savings compared to LD plans holds. Specifically, we estimate average savings for
HD plans (across all 331 firms) of over $400 for the year with every one of the medical spending
distributions, including the very high-risk distribution in the 10th decile. The risk-adjusted savings
for CARA r = 0.0005 are again substantial, over $400, for each of the 10 distributions.

     Another potential concern for the robustness of our baseline results is that our procedure for
calculating the actuarial value of each plan using the CMS Actuarial Value Calculator requires us
to make some judgment calls about certain cost-sharing features that do not perfectly align with
the CMS calculator. Those judgment calls are typically quite minor and are detailed in Appendix
B. Appendix Table B1 shows the fraction of firms at which the HD option is classified as strictly
dominant based on the simplified plan representations and the expected savings to an employee
selecting the HD plan for various subsamples of the data. If we limit analysis to the 166 firms
where we do not need to make any judgment calls, the fraction with strictly dominant HD plans
and the average expected savings measures are nearly identical to those in the main analysis.
Similarly, the KFF survey data contains a small number of imputed values, but we find that the
results are not affected if we limit to the subsample with no imputed values. 15 Finally, we find
that the CMS AV calculator can generate errors at times in situations where the plan cost-sharing
rules involve per-day copays for inpatient stays. Again, we find that the results are unchanged if
we limit the analysis to firms where neither plan has these types of copays.




15
   The KFF survey imputes values for a limited number of cases with missing values, which occurs for about 5% of
observations. In our matched sample, none of the main variables like premium, deductible, HSA contribution,
coinsurance rate and copayment amount for inpatient stay are imputed. Some other variables are imputed in rare cases
by KFF by replacing “the missing information with observed values from a firm similar in size and industry to the
firm for which data are missing” (KFF, 2015).



                                                                                                                 19
     5. Analysis of Sources of Plan-value Disparities

     Our analysis has established that many firms offering a high-deductible option provide
employees large enough premium differentials and health savings/reimbursement accounts that
the HD plan offers substantial expected savings and frequently dominates. A natural question then
is why employers would offer menus of health insurance options for employees where some
options dominate.

     As a first approach to exploring this question, in Table 5 we analyze whether the likelihood of
offering a dominated option is related to firm characteristics in a series of one-way correlations.
We find that offering a dominant HD plans is not correlated with major characteristics of the firm,
including measures of firm size, employee salaries, employee age, unionization status, or whether
the firm is self-insured for health benefits. Multivariate regressions controlling for these features
simultaneously similarly show little correlation between firm characteristics and offering a
dominant HD option. The fact that dominated options appear at similar rates across different firm
situations suggests that the reasons that options include dominant HD plans is likely rooted in some
process that is common across many firms. While the data available do not allow us to resolve
this issue conclusively, our additional analysis that suggests that dominated options may result
from some basic forces in how employee health-insurance benefits are established.

     First, we note that the total premiums firms report for their plans are consistent with substantial
differences in average medical costs for those enrolled in LD plans versus HD plans. Average cost
differences could arise due to differential plan selection by employees with different health status
or due to the moral hazard effects of the HD plan. 16 Figure 6 shows that the total premium
differences between HD and LD plans are substantially larger than the differences in expected
coverage between these plans for an average population. For the population distribution of medical
costs we use the CMS gold-tier distribution from our primary analysis.                   The graph divides firms
into four groups based on the difference in the deductible between their HD and LD plans. For
each of these groups, the graph plots the average differences in expected out-of-pocket costs (HD


16
   Proportional loading built into premiums to recover administrative costs can also increase the cost differentials
between plans with different levels of coverage. Loading is likely, however, to account for only a small portion of the
differences. Medical loss ratios (claims pay outs over total premiums) for group policies of this type are typically
between .8 and .85, which equates to a loading of 1.18 to 1.25. The ratios of premium differences to expected-coverage
differences we observe, however, are generally more than 2 and often over 5.



                                                                                                                    20
– LD) and the difference in reported total premiums between the plans (LD – HD). These total
premiums include the firm’s contribution and employee contributions. The total premiums are
significantly larger than the expected coverage differences. For example, for firms where the
average deductible difference is around $1,000, the average difference in expected out-of-pocket
costs for a representative employee based on the CMS gold-tier distribution is $407. The total
premium difference between the HD and LD option in these cases, however, is more than double
that level at $952, which in turn is nearly equal to the deductible difference. Similar patterns hold
for other deductibles, with the largest absolute and proportional differences between premium
differentials and out-of-pocket differentials occurring for plans with deductible differences around
$500.

     Whether average-cost differences between HD and LD plans will lead to situations of
dominance depends largely on how employers pass through those cost differentials to employees.
Figure 6 shows that on average these total premium differences are fully passed through to
employees. We calculate the net employee premium difference as the difference in employee
premium between the LD and HD plan plus any HSA contribution an employee would receive
from selecting the HD plan. This difference is very close to the total premium differentials at each
level of deductible difference. Figure 7 shows another way of seeing the pass-through of premium
differentials. This figure plots the difference in total firm contributions (employer paid premiums
+ any HSA contribution) for firms in our matched sample offering HD plans paired with HSA
accounts. 17 Here we see that firms typically contribute very similar total amounts toward these
two plan types. In fact, just under 15% of firms have total contributions that differ by less than
$50.    Firms, on average, contribute a little more to the HD plans (after account for HSA
contributions), but the average difference is only $16.

     Taken together these pieces of information suggest a straightforward mechanism for how
dominated options emerge. The average medical costs of employees who opt into HD options are
substantially lower than the cost for those who opt into LD plans, reflecting the impacts of adverse
selection and moral hazard. Those average-cost differences are reflected in the total premiums for
plans. Firms equalize their contribution to the two different plan types, which means they pass on

  We omit the firms with HD plans paired with HRAs from this analysis because it is unclear how to calculate the
expected firm contribution under HRAs.



                                                                                                             21
these large average-cost differentials to the employees through a combination of differential
employee-premium contributions across plans and HSA/HRA contributions by the firm. Finally,
in cases where the coverage levels are not too different, e.g., deductible differences of $1,000 or
less between HD and LD plan, these large premium and HSA/HRA differentials cause the HD
plans to dominate the LD plans.

     This basic mechanism is consistent with the differences we see in the patterns of premiums
and firm contributions when we compare firms based on our classification from Section 4 of
whether or not the HD plan strictly dominates. For example, the difference in deductibles between
the HD and LD plans is smaller at the firms where the HD plan strictly dominates, averaging just
under $1,000 at those firms versus just over $1,500 at the firms without strictly dominant HD plans.
The firms with dominant HD plans, though, also report especially high total premium differences
between the plans, consistent with strong average cost differences across plans at those firms. 18
The firms with dominant HD plans also come close to equalizing their total contributions between
the HD and LD plans, meaning that these large premium differentials are passed through to
employees. 19

     Of course, not all instances of dominance necessarily result from this exact process. For
example, some cases where HD plans dominate arise in situations where the firm has made
substantial HSA contributions so that the firm is actually contributing more for the HD plans than
the LD plans by a significant margin. In some of these cases, firms may be temporarily offering
strong subsidies to induce employees to switch voluntarily to HD options with the intention of
lowering firm contributions to that plan over time or eventually limiting to only the HD option.
One motivation for such an approach could be avoidance of the possibility of paying the so-called
Cadillac Tax on high-actuarial-value health plans established by the Affordable Care Act. We note
that Table 5 shows that firms that reported doing some analysis in anticipation of the Cadillac Tax



18
   The average premium difference at firms with strictly dominant HD plans (among firms offering HSAs) is $1,325,
while the expected difference in out-of-pocket costs for a representative employee facing the CMS gold-tier medical
spending distribution is only $343. In contrast, at the firms without strictly dominant HD options, the average reported
premium differences are $963, while the average expected difference in out of pocket costs is $613.
19
   On average the firms with strictly dominant HD plans contribute $144 more to the HD plans, while firms without
strictly dominant HD plans contribute $55 less on average to the HD plans. These contribution differentials, however,
do not explain much of the dominance patterns. At the firms with the dominant HD plans, the average net difference
in costs (including premiums and firm HSA contributions) an employee faces between the plans is $1,469, which
means that the excess contributions to the HD plan account for less than 10% of the differential at these firms.



                                                                                                                     22
were slightly more likely to have a strictly dominant HD plan (39% vs 32%).                        It is also worth
noting that our baseline explanation laid out above also leaves open the question of why firms
equalize contributions between plans and why reported plan premiums seem to reflect average-
cost differentials rather than being set based on plan’s actuarial value differences applied to the
expected spending for the employee population as a whole. We discuss this question in the
concluding section. What the results in this section do suggest, however, is that there is a
straightforward mechanism by which dominated menus, and more generally large expected
savings from the HD plans, can arise without firms consciously and purposely creating dominated
menus.

     One important note here is that the mechanism discussed in this section implies that the
domination of HD plans is a partial-equilibrium effect. That is, if all employees shifted to the HD
plans and did not alter their medical utilization, firms likely would change the contributions they
make so that these HD plans are not so attractive. For example, if the large premium differences
between HD and LD plans reflect adverse selection into LD plans, employees shifting away from
LD plans would cause the premiums for HD plans to rise. 20 Similarly, if premium differentials
reflect moral hazard effects, employees who currently select LD plans could not shift wholesale to
HD plans while keeping their use of medical services the same without that affecting the premium
differences that drive the domination in the first place. This means that HD plans are not dominant
options in any absolute sense, but instead are dominant within menus that offer multiple coverage
levels as options. We elaborate on this point in more detail in the next section.



     6. Economic Implications of Health-Plan Menus with Dominated Options

     We have documented that the health-plan menus at many firms are setup so that an employee
who fails to select the higher-deductible plan is leaving money on the table. In this section, we
consider the economic implications of these patterns. Specifically, who benefits from this situation
and do these empirical patterns point to any underlying economic inefficiency in employer-
sponsored health insurance?


20
   The premium levels of HD and LD plans at firms that offer only one type of plan are consistent with this point. The
difference in average total premium between HD plans and LD plans reported by these firms is consistent with the
difference in average actuarial value between these plan types.



                                                                                                                   23
     Based on the prior section, if we assume that HD plans dominate because firms pass through
large average-cost differences to those who choose the HD plans, then the economic implications
of these patterns depends in large part on the extent to which those average cost differences are
driven by risk selection versus moral hazard. 21 In general, plan disparities rooted in risk selection
have bigger implications for the nature of transfers between different groups of employees, while
disparities rooted in the causal effects of higher cost-sharing on medical spending (i.e., moral
hazard) have bigger implications for the efficiency of medical spending.


     6.1 Implications When Average Cost Differences are Driven by Selection


     Consider first the “selection case” where the discrepancy between the HD and LD plans is
solely the result of different average ex-ante medical needs between employees selecting into the
different plans. In this case, employees in the HD plan are able to avoid pooling with the LD-plan
enrollees who are less healthy on average. Because the firms’ total contribution to benefits,
through employer-paid premiums and HSA/HRA contributions, are the same on average across
plans, the higher benefits of the HD plan represent a transfer from the LD-plan enrollees to the
HD-plan enrollees relative to the situation where they all pool together in a single plan.
     We can provide a quantitative estimate of the size of that transfer by considering how the
situation for employees enrolling in the HD plans would change in the event that all employees
were either forced or effectively nudged to enroll in the HD plan. To get this estimate, we need to
have an estimate of how much the total premium for the HD plans would rise if all employees
were shifted in the HD plan. In Appendix C we discuss how we create an estimate for these implied
premium changes using some assumptions about how total premiums are set and the level of
loading factors incorporated into premiums. Table 6 reports our approximations for how the
premium levels and the net costs employees face for coverage would change under the
counterfactual where everyone is enrolled in the HD plan. We limit this analysis to firms that offer
HSAs for their HD plans because HRAs are complicated by the fact that the firm retains control
of unused HRA contributions. We assume that the firms would hold their total employer

21Consistent with much of the empirical literature on the effects of insurance coverage on medical spending, we are
using the term “moral hazard” here broadly to denote any effect different insurance coverage has on the total amount
of medical spending a person incurs for the year. Later in this section we briefly discuss the distinction between
reducing spending on “wasteful” versus “valuable” medical services.



                                                                                                                 24
contributions fixed and we do not distinguish here between the mix of premium versus HSA
contributions firms would make. We calculate that the total premiums for HD plans would rise on
average by $221 if all of the LD enrollees switched to the HD plan. After considering employer
contribution adjustments, the net impact to the original HD-plan enrollees would be an increase in
their costs of $208 on average. So relative to the counterfactual where everyone pools in the same
HD plan, the current HD plan enrollees on average are receiving an average transfer of about two
hundred dollars from the LD enrollees. At the 36% of these firms where our analysis in Section 4
labels the HD plan as strictly dominant, the size of the average transfer in this calculation is $463.
     These counterfactual premium help to highlight Handel’s (2013) argument that using
techniques like “nudges” to help people spot dominant options may not improve and may
sometimes harm overall average welfare. If there is substantial scope for adverse selection,
offering plans with different coverage levels should lead to “unraveling” where all employees end
up in the HD plan with least coverage (Ericson and Sydnor, 2017). The fact that the HD plans can
come to dominate the LD plans without attracting all employees suggests there are frictions in plan
choice that prevent that full unraveling. Helping a single employee to overcome those frictions
and enroll in the HD plan may have large benefits for the single employee. However, doing so for
all of the employees requires the premiums and firm contributions to adjust to the new equilibrium.
So the switch to the new equilibrium has a cost for the employees who were originally in the HD
plan and also erodes part of the savings for the original LD-plan enrollees. As Handel (2013)
illustrates, nudging can potentially lower average welfare and may in some cases even make those
who were originally violating dominance worse off in the end. However, the size of the average
potential savings we observe for those enrolled in LD plans is large enough that employees
enrolled in LD plans would likely be better off at most firms if everyone were enrolled in the HD
plan. 22 It is also important to note that these discussions of welfare, including the analysis in
Handel (2013), do not take a social welfare perspective. From a social welfare perspective
eliminating transfers from LD-enrollees to HD-enrollees would likely be beneficial, since prior


22 In Section 4 we calculated average savings for those enrolled in LD plans of around $500 overall and around
$1,000 for those at firms with strictly dominant HD options. Even with premiums rising on average by $200 to
$500 at these firms in the full-HD-enrollment counterfactual, those originally enrolled in LD plans would likely
have average savings of more than $300 across all firms and over $500 at firms with strictly dominant HD options.
Table 4 suggests that the additional variance in out-of-pocket spending in the HD plan would reduce the value of
that option by an additional $100 on average for reasonable levels of risk aversion. As such, the original LD-plan
enrollees would likely benefit from interventions that switched all employees to the HD plan.



                                                                                                                 25
research has shown that lower-income employees are more likely to enroll in costly LD options
(Bhargava et al., 2017).
   Finally, if dominant options are arising in employer-sponsored menus due to the effects of
adverse selection, it raises the question of whether offering employees a choice over coverage
levels is beneficial to begin with. Ericson and Sydnor (2017) highlight that the primary benefit of
offering choice is the possibility to allow people with different levels of risk aversion to sort into
different options. They also argue that those benefits are likely to be strongest if there are controls
that prevent premiums from reflecting differential selection. Employers do not, in principle, need
to pass through the average cost differences between LD and HD plans to employees, yet the
widespread presence of plan menus with dominant HD options suggests that in practice employers
may be allowing their plan options to be affected by adverse selection. When adverse selection is
causing premium differentials between plans to spike, the logical consequence, if people
understand their options, should be that the system will unravel toward the lower-coverage option
over time. In that case, there is no real value of the “choice” and the real question is whether a
menu with only the HD plan is preferable to a menu with only the LD plan.


   6.2 Implications When Average Cost Differences are Driven by Moral Hazard


   The other possibility is that the differences in average cost between the LD and HD plans are
driven not by selection but instead by the causal effects of greater levels of cost sharing on the
level of medical care that employees seek. Assume first that the medical spending reductions that
result from the increased cost-sharing in HD plans comes entirely from the reduction of wasteful
medical services with little value to the individual. In that case, the patterns we document suggest
that the frictions that prevent a greater number of people from selecting HD plans, such as inertia
and confusion about plan options, result in substantial inefficiencies. Based on our estimates from
Section 4, the unexploited savings on wasteful medical spending in this scenario are over $500 on
average and frequently over $1,000 per employee per year. In fact, if moral hazard is the entire
mechanism, our calculations understate the full size of the potential savings at the individual level




                                                                                                    26
because they are based on assuming a fixed distribution of medical spending and the individual
would in fact endogenously reduce their spending on low-value services. 23
     There is good reason to suspect, however, that some of the reduction in medical spending
associated with HD plans involves reductions in valuable care (e.g., Brot-Goldberg et al., 2017)
and is the result of inefficient behavioral hazard (Newhouse, 2006; Baicker et al., 2015). People
may find immediate costs for medical care particularly painful or may find it difficult to finance
higher out-of-pocket medical spending with HD plans due to budgeting problems and liquidity
constraints, even when the premium reductions from an HD plan are enough to cover any increase
in out-of-pocket spending. This raises the important possibility that when people enroll in
dominated LD plans they are doing it in part because they realize that they would struggle to
efficiently access care in a plan with higher deductibles.
     The best-case scenario for the efficiency of plan menus at the firms we study may be if the HD
enrollees are able to reduce spending efficiently under the HD plan, while the LD enrollees
rationally avoid that option because they know it would lead to inefficient medical utilization for
them. In that case, the dominated menus we observe represent neither a transfer from LD enrollees
to HD enrollees nor inefficiencies due to frictions in plan choice. Instead, the availability of both
the LD and HD options allows those who can efficiently reduce spending to do so in the HD plan
and those who cannot to remain in a plan with higher insurance coverage.


        6.3 Discussion of the Relative Importance of Adverse Selection and Moral Hazard

     This section has discussed how the implications of the emergence of dominated health plan
menus at firms offering choices between HD and LD plans likely depends on the importance of
adverse selection versus moral hazard in driving plan disparities. There is, of course, clear
evidence in the literature of both substantial risk selection when employees can choose between
plans with different levels of coverage and of causal effects of insurance coverage on the total level
of medical spending (see Bundorf, 2016 for a review). The relative importance of these different
forces is not something we can disentangle for the firms in the Employer Health Benefits Survey.

23
  In equilibrium the levels of calculated savings would only hold if employees who currently enroll in LD plans would
have a similar (or greater) behavioral response to being in the HD plan as those who currently enroll in HD plans. If
the LD enrollees were switched into the HD plan but did not change their medical spending, the premiums for the HD
plan would rise along the lines of the calculations in Table 6 from the prior subsection for the risk-selection case.




                                                                                                                  27
However, in this brief sub-section, we consider what the existing literature on selection and moral
hazard in health insurance might suggest for our setting.
    Research by Einav et al (2013) suggests that in situations where firms offer plan options,
adverse selection may be a larger driver of total spending differentials than moral hazard. They
provide evidence from a large employer-sponsored health plan that those who endogenously opt
into higher-deductible options on average have lower moral hazard responses than would be
observed if higher-deductible options were imposed on the full employee group. In their setting,
there is around a $1,000 total difference in spending between those opting into high and low
deductible options and they estimate that around $130 of that difference would be expected to
come from the moral hazard effect.
        However, the moral hazard effects needed to explain the premium differences for the firms
in our sample are also broadly consistent with estimates from the literature. For example, to
explain the entire average differential in total premiums between LD and HD plans we observe,
we estimate that the higher cost-sharing in HD plans would need to reduce medical spending by
around 10% at the firms that have strictly dominant HD plans. 24 We can compare this to Brot-
Goldberg et al., (2017), who estimate that a shift from a nearly full-coverage plan to an HD plan
with 76% actuarial value at a large employer caused a reduction of 12-14% in total medical
spending. While the Brot-Goldberg estimate is consistent with the moral hazard effects needed to
explain premium differentials in our sample, it is also likely an upper bound on what we might
expect in the Kaiser Family Foundation Sample. The gap in AV between HD and LD plans at the
firms with dominant HD plans is much smaller (82% vs 76%) in our sample than in the Brot-
Goldberg et al. study. Also, as Einav et al. (2013) highlighted, spending reductions observed for
firms where the HD plan is an option rather than a requirement would likely be lower. Furthermore,
Leive (2018) presents evidence that employees may consider HSA funds as dedicated to medical
spending, rather than treating them as more fungible with other wealth, thereby reducing the moral
hazard effects for firms that offer substantial HSA contributions along with their HD plans.



24 To get these estimates we start with the total average premium reported for the LD plans. We then estimate how

much premiums should fall on average if they simply accounted for the reduction in covered spending when moving
to the HD plan, holding fixed the underlying medical utilization. This is equivalent to estimating the ratio of total
spending of LD and HD plans, because all total costs difference comes from moral hazard. Using the framework in
section 6.1, we calculated the ratio of total premium divided by the ratio of the actuarial value, which reveals how
large the moral hazard response would need to be to account for the full premium differential.



                                                                                                                  28
       Ultimately, it is likely that the dynamics we observe in the plan menus at firms offering
different levels of coverage to their employees reflect a mix of the effects of selection and moral
hazard. Our reading of the existing evidence suggests to us that adverse selection may be the more
important factor overall, but ultimately more research will be needed to better understand the
relative importance of adverse selection and moral hazard in determining premium differentials
for employer-sponsored health plan options.



   7. Conclusion
   This study presents an analysis of the insurance value of plan options available to employees
at firms that offer both a qualifying high-deductible plan paired with a health
savings/reimbursement account and another option with a lower deductible. We find that on
average the HD plans offer lower worst-case spending risk and substantial expected savings and
risk-adjusted expected savings. Based on simplified representations of plans that transform
complex cost-sharing rules into a schedule mapping total medical spending to out-of-pocket costs,
we estimate that HD plans strictly dominate in about one third of firms and second-order
stochastically dominate LD options at around half of firms. As such, we conclude that at many
firms employees do not face a classic tradeoff between expected spending and risk when selecting
between health plan options with different coverage levels. Instead, employees who select high-
deductible plans at many firms receive a superior net health insurance benefit than employees who
select into lower-deductible options.
   These findings suggest that those interested in health policy, and in particular the issue of risk
pooling across people with different underlying status, may benefit from focusing less exclusively
on the private-market exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and more on
employer-sponsored insurance. The ACA anticipated that health plans with different levels of
coverage (e.g., different deductibles) might attract people with different underlying health status
and required that insurers use a “single risk pool” when pricing plans. This implies that premium
differences across plans by an insurer reflect the differences in coverage between plans for a
common average population. This requirement, and related policies regarding risk adjustments
across plans, has received substantial attention, especially during discussions in 2017 around
health care reform. Interestingly, however, there is no similar requirement in employer-sponsored
health insurance. Employers are prohibited from discriminating against employees on the basis of



                                                                                                  29
health status in their health insurance programs. 25 However, there is no regulation governing the
premium levels and firm contribution levels across different plans the employer offers to
employees. Our results suggest that the principle of a “single risk pool” may often not hold in
employer-sponsored health insurance plans that offer multiple plan options.
     More research is needed to better understand the extent to which firms actively establish plan
options to weaken risk pooling across employees. There is also a need for research to better
understand whether offering options with large disparities in net benefits between health plans
with different coverage levels has spillovers on labor relations relating to the hiring, retention or
wage negotiations with employees of different health status. The results of this paper are also
limited to comparisons at firms that offer a very particular mix of high-deductible and lower-
deductible options. More research is needed to better understand the average level of benefit
disparities experienced by employees across firms throughout the U.S. Given that some firms do
not offer choices of plans with different coverage levels, our results may over-state the extent to
which health plan options create opportunities for benefit disparities between employees. On the
other hand, existing research has documented large differentials (and even dominance) between
plan options with varying deductibles that would all be considered low-deductible plans within the
Kaiser Family Foundation data. As such, it is possible that situations where plan options varying
in coverage level create large net benefit disparities are even more widespread than what we see
for the set of firms we analyze here.
     Finally, we think the results of this study should encourage those who are investing in research
on decision aids that help people to better understand and compare health insurance options. It is
quite difficult to compare insurance plan options that differ on the basis of premiums, cost-sharing
rules, and even contributions to health savings and reimbursement accounts. Prior to our study
one might have reasonably hoped that the ecosystem of human resource departments and benefit
consultants and larger employers would have limited the size of financial losses one could incur
from not being able to compare plans. Our results show, however, that in employer-sponsored


25
  The primary regulation of employer-sponsored health insurance plans comes through the rules imposed by the
Employee Retirement and Income Security Act (ERISA). ERISA rules prohibit employers who offer group health
insurance plans from discriminating on the basis of employee health status, which generally means that employers
charge the same employee premiums to all employees enrolled in the same health plan. The 2010 Affordable Care
Act amended ERISA by creating a provision that allows employers to create “health-contingent” wellness programs
that can vary the premium and employee pays based on health status. These programs, however, have to follow a
number of regulations.



                                                                                                             30
insurance settings being able to make the comparison between plans can often have substantial
financial consequences.

Figure 1. Distribution of Worst-Case Spending Difference: HD – LD




Notes: This graph plots the CDF of worst-case spending differences across firms, such that the y-
axis shows the fraction of firms with a worst-case spending difference (HD – LD) smaller than x.
For each plan, we calculate the worst-case spending as the annual premium paid by the employee
plus the maximum out-of-pocket limit on the plan. For high-deductible (HD) options, we subtract
from that amount any contribution the firm makes to a health savings account or health
reimbursement account. A negative (positive) number means the HD plan has lower (higher)
worst-case spending than the LD plan at that firm.




                                                                                              34

Notes: Illustration of different types of plan comparisons. We transform each plan into a simplified
plan based on deductible, coinsurance and maximum out of pocket. We then classify them based
on the relative size of net premium (the y-intercept), net premium + maximum out of pocket (the
flat range) and the cost sharing region.




                                                                                                                     35
Figure 3. MEPS Projected Health Spending




Notes: This graph characterizes the realized health spending for ten groups of people defined by
deciles of projected health spending as described in the text. This graph uses data on total spending
from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) in 2014 for the population covered by
employer/group insurance throughout the year. We regress total medical spending on a fully
interacted model including age, gender, and self-reported health status (as explained in the text)
and generate predicted levels of total spending based on those characteristics. We then group
MEPS participants into 10 groups (deciles) based on their predicted level of medical spending
from this regression, which gives us 10 groups with different ex-ante health risk. The graph
provides the mean and percentiles of realized spending for people in each of these 10 MEPs deciles.




                                                                                                  36
Figure 4. Proportion of Firms where HD Second Order Stochastically Dominates
LD for Different Spending Distributions




Notes: For each of the deciles of MEPS projected spending, we use the empirical distribution of
realized spending for people in that decile and compare whether for that distribution the HD plan
second order stochastically dominates the LD plan or not. The graph shows the proportion of firms
(across the 331-firm sample) offering HD plan that is second order stochastically dominant for the
distribution in each MEPs decile.




                                                                                               37
Figure 5. Expected and Risk-adjusted Average Savings from Choosing the HD Plan
over the LD Plan for Different Spending Distributions




Notes: We calculated the expected savings or risk-adjusted expected savings from choosing the
HD plan over the LD plan for each of the 331 firms. We do this separately for each of the 10
different realized spending distributions defined by the deciles of predicted values in the MEPS.
The lines then graph the average values of those savings across the 331 firms. The risk-adjusted
savings are created by assuming Constant Absolute Risk Aversion Utility with an r = 0.005. The
risk-adjusted savings is then the amount of money a person facing that particular spending
distribution would need to be given with certainty to remain in the LD plan and have the same
expected utility as instead switching to the HD plan.




                                                                                              38
Figure 6. Average Differences in Premiums and Expected Out-of-Pocket Costs by
Deductible Difference




Notes: Total premium is the annual premium for single coverage, including contribution from the
employer and employee. Net premium is the premium paid by employee, minus any HSA
contribution from the firm. Expected out-of-pocket costs is the expected enrollee out-of-pocket
spending under the CMS Gold distribution. We subtract any HRA contribution by the firm, as long
as the out-of-pocket spending is non-negative. We then calculate the difference of the first two
variables as LD value minus HD value, and the difference of expected out-of-pocket costs as the
HD value minus LD value. For firms where the HD plan has a strictly higher deductible (309
firms), we put them into 4 groups based on deductible difference: (0,$750],($750-
$1250],($1250,$1750],($1750,larger). For each group, we plot the mean and also the 95%
confidence interval on the mean (the error bar at each data point).



                                                                                             39
Figure 7. Distribution of Difference in Total Firm Contributions to Plans




Notes: This graph shows the distribution of the difference in total firm contribution to health plans
(HD – LD) for firms in the sample that offer an HD plan with an HSA account (284 firms). For
the LD plans this is simply the firm’s contribution toward the premium on the plan. For the HD
plan it is the sum of the firm’s contribution to premium and the firm’s contribution to the HSA
account. The bin size is set to $100. So, for example, the bar centered at 0 shows that at just under
15% of these firms the total contribution difference is within $50.

shows our calculation of the implied total plan premium, firm contributions, and
employee net premium in the counterfactual where only the HD plan is offered. This
counterfactual assumes that original differences in plan premiums in excess of those
predicted by the actuarial-value difference between plans are generated by differences
in the ex-ante spending needs of the enrollees in the two plans (i.e., adverse selection)
as described in Section 6.1.

removes firms with any form of imputation. B1d includes firms that have no copayment as cost-
sharing for hospital stays for both the LD and HD plans. (They may have coinsurance rate for
hospital stay though.) Data is from Kaiser Family Foundation Employer Health Benefits Survey
(2015) and CMS AV Calculator Gold continuance table.

Appendix A Sample Construction

Appendix Table A1 gives a breakdown of our sample construction. There are a total of 1,771
firms that responded to the 2015 version of the Kaiser Family Foundation Employer Health
Benefits Survey and reported offering at least one health insurance plan to their employees.
Among these firms, we dropped firms with missing or contradictory plan information for any of
the plans they reported on, leaving us with 2372 plans offered by 1529 firms. This is our full
sample.

In the cleaning step going from firms in category 1 (firms reported offering at least one health plan)
and to the subsample of firms in category 2 (firms with complete and consistent plan information),
we dropped the firms with any health plan with the following features:

    1. Missing plan information
             a. No cost-sharing information
             b. No maximum out-of-pocket amount
    2. Contradictory plan information
             a. Plan information not consistent with plan type variable
             b. HDHP with neither health savings account (HSA) nor health reimbursement
                 arrangement (HRA) information. (By definition of the survey, plans must have
                 either HSA or HRA to be classified as HDHP.)
             c. Deductible amount is larger than maximum out-of-pocket amount
             d. Deductible amount is the same as maximum out-of-pocket amount, but there is
                 cost-sharing after the deductible range
             e. Deductible amount is smaller than maximum out-of-pocket amount, but there is no
                 cost-sharing after deductible for any service
    3. Potential data error
             a. Deductible amount or maximum out-of-pocket amount is not divisible by 5

                                                                                                    1
We also confirmed that the remaining HD plans satisfy the IRS regulation on HDHP.



1
  For HDHP, there is regulation on a) caps of maximum out-of-pocket value for HDHP (for individual coverage, $6450
in 2014 and $6600 in 2015) and minimum deductible value (for individual coverage, $1250 in 2014, $1300 in 2015).



                                                                                                               50
From the main sample we then restrict our sample to firms reporting details for 1 HD plan and 1
LD plan, which is a sample of 373 firms with 746 plans. To be consistent with later analysis, we
further dropped 42 firms with at least one plan that has cost-sharing features that are not compatible
with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Actuarial Value Calculator. This
leaves us with 331 firms offering 662 plans. This is our analysis sample (matched sample).

The cleaning step going from firms in category 3 (Firms offering both 1 HD and 1 LD) to the sub-
sample of firms in category 4 (Firms offering both 1 HD and 1 LD and features consistent with
AV calculator), we dropped firms with any health plan with the following features:

   1. Maximum out-of-pocket amount larger than $6850 (this is the upper bound imposed by
       CMS Actuarial Value calculator) [1 Firm; 1 LD plan]
   2. There is a copayment for outpatient surgery (CMS AV calculator only supports
       coinsurance rate for this type of services). [41 Firms; 40 LD plans; 6 HD plans]




                                                                                                   51
Appendix B Creating Simplified Plan Representations

   In our main analysis, we create a simplified plan representation for each plan (deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket limit). In our sample, there are 146 plans that are
originally simple plans. For the rest, we follow the approach in Ericson et al. (2015) to create a
simplified plan representation using the CMS AV Calculator.

   When calculating actuarial value and the equivalent coinsurance rate, we ignore the following
features reported in the Kaiser Family Foundation Survey data that are not supported by AV
Calculator:

   1. maximum and/or minimum limit for coinsurance payment
   2. separate deductible for hospital and/or outpatient surgery
   3. If the cost-sharing rule is paying both coinsurance and copayment, we treat it as paying
        whichever is higher. The former is not supported by CMS AV calculator.

   For drug cost sharing features, the KFF survey uses different category labels than the CMS
AV calculator. We make the following assumptions in mapping the KFF data to the CMS AV
calculator:

   1.   We map tier 1-4 cost-sharing rule for drugs in the KFF data to generics, preferred brand
        drugs, non-preferred brand drugs, and specialty drugs in the CMS AV calculator
        respectively.
   2. If a plan has a 2-tier drug cost-sharing rule, we use the cost sharing information for the first
        tier for tier 1 drug, and second tier sharing rule for 2-4 tiers. We do the same thing for 1-
        tier and 3-tier plans.
   3. The only exception to 2) is when the plan does not cover specialty drugs. If that is the case,
        we indicate tier-4 cost sharing rule as not covered by the plan.

   As mentioned in the main text, there are a few complications to the basic approach. Specifically,
about 40% of plan designs have office visits copays before the deductible and/or separate
deductibles for drug coverage. To get the simplified plan representation for these plans, we follow
the procedures below.




                                                                                                   52
   We split medical spending into three categories: office visits, prescription drugs, and all other
services. Following the approach in Ericson et al. (2015), we calculate out-of-pocket spending
given total spending x in the following steps:

   Step 1: determine which services are subject to the general deductible. Index them with g. Split
   x into spending on each service using information from the Gold continuance table from CMS
   AV Calculator. Denote the amount of spending on services subject to the general deductible
   as 𝒙𝒙𝒈𝒈 . For example, if drugs are not subject to general deductible, and represents 20% of total
   spending at 𝐱𝐱, then g represents all services other than drug, and 𝒙𝒙𝒈𝒈 = (1 − 0.2)𝒙𝒙 = 0.8𝒙𝒙.

   Step 2: input all plan information into AV calculator and get the actuarial value for the plan.
   We show the details of how we map KFF data into the AV Calculator below. In this and the
   next step, we set the underlying metal tier as Gold. (We also tried other metal tiers, the numbers
   are very close.)

   Step 3: keep cost-sharing feature of services not subject to the deductible as given, remove all
   other copay or coinsurance (i.e., on services subject to the general deductible), and input the
   deductible and MOOP of the plan. Find a single coinsurance rate paid by enrollee that gives
   the same AV as calculated in step 2. We label it as 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑔𝑔 . The idea is to convert complicated cost
   sharing feature into an equivalent single coinsurance rate. If all services subject to general
   deductible have the same coinsurance rate, then 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑔𝑔 will be that number. Intuitively, 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑔𝑔 is the
   average amount an enrollee needs to pay for each dollar of medical services after the deductible
   is met for services subject to the general deductible.

   Step 4: calculate the out-of-pocket for services subject to the general deductible at each level
   of total spending x as:

                   𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑔𝑔 = 𝕝𝕝(𝒙𝒙𝒈𝒈 > 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡𝑔𝑔 ) ∙ 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑔𝑔 ∙ (𝒙𝒙𝑔𝑔 − 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑔𝑔 ) + min(𝒙𝒙𝑔𝑔 , 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑔𝑔 ).



   Step 5: If office visits are not subject to the general deductible, calculate the out-of-pocket
   spending on office visits oopov . Let 𝐱𝐱 𝐨𝐨𝐨𝐨 denote the portion of total spending on office visits.
   For example, if at total spending level x, 10% is spent on office visits, then 𝐱𝐱 𝐨𝐨𝐨𝐨 = 0.1𝐱𝐱. Let
   co𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 denote the equivalent coinsurance rate for office visits. If the plan has coinsurance rate




                                                                                                                  53
    for office visits, then co𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 is that coinsurance rate. If the plan has copayment for office visits,
    then

                                                𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ∗ # 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦
                                     co𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 =                                                    .2
                                                                   𝑥𝑥𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜

    Then the out-of-pocket spending on office visits oop𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 is

                                                  𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 = 𝒙𝒙𝒐𝒐𝒐𝒐 ∙ 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 ,

    Step 6: In the KFF EHBS and AV Calculator, drugs are split into four tiers. If drugs have a
    separate deductible, calculate the drug cost sharing 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑑𝑑 for each tier in the same way as for
    office visits (Step 5). Then the drug out-of-pocket spending is:
                                       4

                        𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑑𝑑 = �� 𝕝𝕝(𝒙𝒙𝒅𝒅 > 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ) ∙ 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ∙ 𝒙𝒙𝒅𝒅𝒅𝒅 � + min(𝒙𝒙𝒅𝒅 , 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ),
                                      𝑖𝑖=1

    where 𝒙𝒙𝒅𝒅 is the total drug spending at total spending level x, 𝒙𝒙𝒅𝒅𝒅𝒅 is the amount spent on each
    tier beyond the deductible range. We determine 𝒙𝒙𝒅𝒅𝒅𝒅 based on the proportion of spending on
    each tier. For example, if there is a drug deductible of $100, and at total spending level $x, the
    spending on drugs tier 1-4 is $30, $40, $30, and $20 respectively, and exceed the deductible
                                                                 30
    by $20. Then we calculate 𝑥𝑥𝑑𝑑1 = 20 ∗ 40+30+30+20 = $5. The calculations for other tiers are

    similar.

    Step 7: Then the total spending over the year is:

                     𝑝𝑝 + 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 = 𝑝𝑝 + max�min�𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑔𝑔 + 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 + 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑑𝑑 , 𝑚𝑚� − 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻, 0�.

    𝑝𝑝 is the net premium (employee premium minus any firm contribution to HSA), 𝑚𝑚 is the
    MOOP of the plan, HRA is the amount that the firm contributes into health reimbursement
    arraignment. According to the definition of HRA contribution, we treat this value as a
    reduction of out-of-pocket cost: if an enrollee has no out-of-pocket cost, he cannot use the
    money. He also cannot withdraw the money or take the money if he leaves the firm.

 In a few rare cases, this rate is higher than 1, implying that the copayment amount is higher than 𝑥𝑥𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 . When this
happens, we replace 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 by 1. This is consistent with the AV Calculator methodology.



                                                                                                                   54
Appendix C Calculating Counterfactual Premium of HD-only Menu

    To get the estimate of the counterfactual total premium for the HD plans if all employees were
shifted in the HD plan, we need an estimate of the underlying expected medical costs differences
between the LD-plan enrollees and the HD-plan enrollees. The KFF survey data does not have
direct information about medical claims costs, but we can get an approximation under the
assumption that total premiums 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 reported in the survey are based on the following basic formula:
                                                    𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 = 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑗𝑗 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 ,
where 𝛾𝛾 is a proportional loading factor, 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑗𝑗 is the actuarial value of plan j, and 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 is the average
expected level of medical spending for the employees who enroll in plan j. We use that formula to
solve for an estimate of the average medical costs of the employees enrolled in each plan type by
dividing the total premiums reported for each plan by the plan’s actuarial value and a loading factor.
For the actuarial value we use the CMS Actuarial Value Calculator estimates as in the main text.
For the loading factor, we use a common factor of 1.18 for all plans. That loading is consistent
with a medical loss ratio of 85%, which is the regulated minimum ratio allowed for large group
plans under the Affordable Care Act.
        After getting the average expected level of medical spending 𝜇𝜇𝐻𝐻 and 𝜇𝜇𝐿𝐿 , we can calculate
the new HD premium as
                                 𝑃𝑃𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 = 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐻𝐻 (𝜇𝜇𝐻𝐻 ∗ 𝑠𝑠𝐻𝐻 + 𝜇𝜇𝐿𝐿 ∗ 𝑠𝑠𝐿𝐿 ),
        where 𝑠𝑠𝐻𝐻 and 𝑠𝑠𝐿𝐿 represent the shares of employees enrolling in each plan category. The
weighted average (𝜇𝜇𝐻𝐻 ∗ 𝑠𝑠𝐻𝐻 + 𝜇𝜇𝐿𝐿 ∗ 𝑠𝑠𝐿𝐿 ) represents the expected medical costs for the full population
of employees at each firm. This estimate is, of course, only an approximation and relies on a
number of assumptions. Nonetheless, we believe this exercise provides a useful estimate for
evaluating the size of the transfer from LD to HD enrollees.
