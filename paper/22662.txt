Single-equation estimates of fiscal reaction functions, which relate primary surpluses to past
debt-GDP ratios and control variables, are subject to potentially serious simultaneity bias that can
produce misleading inferences about fiscal behavior. Biases arise from failure to model the
general equilibrium relationships between government debt and surpluses, relationships that bring
in the forward-looking nature of nominal debt valuation and the role of monetary policy in that
valuation.

1 Introduction
Elevated government debt levels worldwide and recent sovereign debt troubles in the Euro
Area have increased interest in estimates of fiscal rules to shed light on the sustainability of
fiscal policies. Many studies follow Bohn (1998) to regress the primary surplus-GDP ratio,
st , against the lagged debt-GDP ratio, bt−1 , and a set of controls, Xt

                                           st = γbt−1 + µt                                           (1)

where µt ≡ ΓXt + εSt and εSt is the fiscal policy shock. Bohn (1998, p. 949) interprets
significantly positive estimates of γ as evidence that “the government is taking actions—
reducing noninterest outlays or raising revenue—that counteract the changes in debt.” Those
fiscal actions, Bohn argues, imply that fiscal policy is sustainable.
    Regressions like (1) play a key role in policy analyses. They underlie the IMF’s cal-
culations of “fiscal space” [Mendoza and Ostry (2008), Ghosh, Kim, Mendoza, Ostry, and
Qureshi (2012), and Mauro, Romeu, Binder, and Zaman (2015)] and a large literature that
aims to test for fiscal sustainability [see D’Erasmo, Mendoza, and Zhang (2016) for an
overview]. Those studies refine Bohn’s criterion by requiring that γ exceed the real-interest
rate–economic growth rate differential to ensure that the debt-GDP ratio stabilizes in the
long run. Because estimates of γ lie at the heart of important policy decisions, it is essential
to explore the conditions under which the regressions that (1) describes are likely to recover
accurate estimates of this critical parameter.
    This note does not dispute the theoretical claim that if fiscal policy obeys (1) with γ larger
than the interest rate-growth rate differential, then fiscal policy is sustainable. Instead, we
question whether single-equation regressions of equilibrium surpluses on debt can reliably
recover fiscal policy behavior.

   For (1) to be a regression, bt−1 must be predetermined. That is, E[εSt |bt−1 ] = 0. The
economic content of this orthogonality condition is that shocks at t − 1 that affect bt−1 must
not predict εSt and that the real value of debt at t−1 (or the debt-GDP ratio) cannot depend
on the expectation of εSt . This note scrutinizes these requirements.
   Scrutiny begins by recognizing that policy rule (1) is just one of many equations that
determine equilibrium sequences of surpluses and real government debt.1 Three features of
any equilibrium can be important for estimates of γ:

  (i) Asset-pricing relations that determine government bond yields.

 (ii) Monetary policy behavior, which affects the aggregate price level and the relationship
      between inflation and nominal bond returns.

 (iii) The debt valuation equation, a forward-looking equilibrium condition that equates the
       value of government debt to the expected discounted value of primary surpluses.

    The third feature, which embeds the first and optimizing private behavior, implies that
                                                        ∞
                                                        X
                                         bt−1 = Et−1           qt−1,T sT                                    (2)
                                                        T =t

where qt−1,T is the stochastic discount factor between periods t − 1 and T and Et−1 denotes
the expectation conditional on date t − 1 information. This expression implies that in any
equilibrium real debt tends to be positively correlated with future surpluses. Viewed in
conjunction with the policy rule, (2) raises the possibility that bt−1 is not a predetermined
regressor in regression (1), as it will be correlated with the policy disturbance εSt when that
disturbance is serially correlated.
    The second feature, monetary policy, comes into play once one acknowledges that the
vast majority of debt that governments issue is nominal, denominated in the country’s home
currency. Nominal debt is a claim to currency in the future. Governments make a policy
choice about whether to pay the claim in goods (primary surpluses) or currency (“paper
money” in Sims’s (2013) terminology). Because bt−1 ≡ Bt−1 /Pt−1 , where B is nominal debt,
if the price level at t − 1 depends in any way on expected future surpluses, then an additional
channel exists to stabilize real debt that can undermine the maintained predeterminedness
assumption that underlies treating (1) as a regression.
    This note uses a simple model to illustrate the nature of potential simultaneity biases in
surplus-debt regressions. Bias depends on the joint monetary-fiscal regime that determines
the equilibrium price level. Bias problems are negligible when the monetary-fiscal mix implies
the price level is unrelated to budget surpluses, an implication of the Ricardian nature of
this equilibrium. In regimes where the price level is a function of expected surpluses, the bias
is ubiquitous and may be positive or negative, depending on monetary policy behavior and
the persistence of the fiscal shock. When monetary policy follows an interest-rate rule that
reacts weakly to inflation—which Clarida, Galı́, and Gertler (2000) document was true in
the United States before 1980 and as it has in most countries since 2009—the bias is positive
   1
     For the purposes of this note, we need not distinguish between levels and ratios of variables. We also need
not examine the determinants of the control variables. For actual estimation, both of these are important.

and can be quite large: estimates of γ can be large and positive even when surpluses have
evolved independently of debt.
    In sum, the model suggests that studies that rely on estimates of γ from regressions like
(1) are valid only conditional on the maintained assumption that a particular monetary-fiscal
regime prevails in which γ is positive. That maintained assumption cannot be scrutinized by
single-equation analyses. Scrutiny comes only from empirical work that combines (1) with
the features in (i)–(iii).

2 An Illustrative Model and Solution
Consider a cashless version of Leeper (1991). The real interest rate is 1/β, the representative
agent’s discount factor. Government purchases are zero, but the government issues nominal,
one-period discount bonds, Bt , and levies lump-sum taxes, which equal primary surpluses, st .
An infinitely-lived agent derives utility from consumption and optimally chooses consumption
and bond holdings each period.
   Baseline surplus-debt regressions are linear, so it is without loss of generality to examine
a version of the model that is log-linearized around a deterministic steady state with zero
net inflation and a surplus-debt ratio of s/b = 1 − β. The linearized model is summarized
by the four equations

                         Fisher relation :   Rt = Et πt+1                                     (3)
                       Monetary policy :     Rt = απt + εR
                                                         t                                    (4)
                         Fiscal policy : st = γbt−1 + εSt                                     (5)
                  Government budget : bt−1 = βbt − βRt + πt + (1 − β)st                       (6)

where Rt is the one-period nominal interest rate controlled by the central bank, so its inverse
is the price of government bonds, πt ≡ Pt /Pt−1 is the inflation rate, and εR               S
                                                                                   t and εt are
exogenous, AR(1) policy disturbances with AR coefficients 0 ≤ ρR , ρS < 1 and innovations
ξtR and ξtS , which are serially and mutually uncorrelated with bounded support and variances
σR2 and σS2 . Equation (3) is the model’s asset-pricing relationship, equation (4) is a simplified
Taylor-type rule, equation (5) is the fiscal rule, the model analog to the rule that (1) aims
to estimate, and (6) is the government’s flow budget constraint.
    We focus on two regions of the policy parameter space that deliver unique bounded
equilibria [see Leeper (1991)]:

          |α| > 1, |γ| > 1 : active monetary/passive fiscal policies “Regime M”
          |α| < 1, |γ| < 1 : passive monetary/active fiscal policies “Regime F”

2.1 Regime M

Equilibria in regime M are conventional monetarist/new Keynesian/Ricardian solutions. Ac-
tive monetary policy makes inflation depend only on monetary policy parameters and shocks
and passive fiscal policy makes debt converge gradually back to steady state following either

kind of policy disturbance. The equilibrium is

                      bt−1 = (1 − ΓL) −1

                                                                                                        (8)

                        st = γbt−1 + εSt                                                                (9)

where Γ ≡ β −1 − γ(β −1 − 1) < 1 and L is the lag operator.

2.2 Regime F

For this regime, we consider the case of exogenous surpluses, γ = 0, which is an analytically
simple case of active fiscal policy. Inflation now depends on the fiscal disturbance and the
state of government debt, while monetary policy acts to stabilize the real value of debt. This
equilibrium is
                                     1−β S
                         πt = bt−1 −         ε                                                         (10)
                                    1 − βρS t
                                                                       
                                            R       (1 − β)(ρS − α) S
                       bt−1 = (1 − αL) −1
                                           εt−1 +                    εt−1                              (11)
                                                        1 − βρS
                         st = εSt                                                                      (12)

where we take α ∈ [0, 1) because negative responses of the interest rate to inflation, although
theoretically possible, make little economic sense.
    Notice that government debt is stable in both regimes. In regime M, the fiscal choice of γ
ensures stability and determines how rapidly debt returns to steady state. In regime F, the
monetary choice of α does the job: as (11) reveals, α determines the speed of adjustment of
debt toward steady state. In fact, if monetary policy were active, α > 1, debt would grow
without bound.
    Another important difference between regimes is the equilibrium inflation process. In
regime M, as (7)–(9) make clear, inflation is decoupled from the joint (st , bt−1 ) process, an im-
plication of Ricardian equivalence. In regime F, although the surplus evolves autonomously,
it feeds directly into inflation and bt−1 affects πt through a breakdown of Ricardian equiva-
lence.2 This creates a potential dependence between Pt−1 , which determines real debt, bt−1 ,
and expected fiscal disturbances.

3 Surplus-Debt Regressions
We take the model to be the data-generating process and imagine that an econometrician
who is endowed with the correct form of the fiscal policy rule estimates the surplus-debt
regression (1). We use the solutions for {st , bt−1 } reported for the two regimes to compute
the linear projection P[st |bt−1 ] = φbt−1 that the surplus-debt regression in (1) estimates. We
   2
     In regime F, nominal debt expansions raise nominal wealth and nominal spending, raising the price level
to ensure that in equilibrium there is no change in real wealth. Details of the transmission mechanisms in
this regime appear in Leeper and Leith (2016).

need not include the controls, Xt , that Bohn (1998) employs—wartime government spending
and a business cycle indicator—because the model does not include these factors: if the model
implies that (1) is a valid regression, then the linear projection will recover φ = γ.
   Model variables are deviations from steady state and have means of zero. This implies
that the linear projection may be written as

                          E(st bt−1 )       E(bt−1 εSt )       cov(bt−1 , εSt )
                     φ=               = γ +              = γ +
                           Eb2t−1            Eb2t−1              var(bt−1 )

    We use the analytical solutions for equilibrium surplus and debt processes under the
two policy regimes to compute the linear projection’s bias—cov(bt−1 , εSt )/var(bt−1 )—in each
regime. Single-equation estimates are generally biased. Bias stems from failure to satisfy
the predeterminedness requirement for lagged government debt, but the nature of the bias
depends on the underlying monetary-fiscal regime.
    Government debt generally depends on both policy shocks in the two regimes, so the
variance of debt reflects the relative variances of the two shocks as well as the policy param-
eters α and γ. But because the shocks are mutually uncorrelated, the covariance between εSt
and bt−1 in the surplus-debt regression (1) depends only on the fiscal disturbance, its serial
correlation, and how monetary and fiscal policies react to the macroeconomic consequences
of the disturbance.

3.1 Regime M

Because the policy shock processes are AR(1) by assumption, the solution for debt in ex-
pression (8) is an AR(2) in real debt. Exploiting this permits us to compute the variance of
bt−1 easily as

    To derive the covariance, write out the polynomial in the lag operator in (8), multiply
through by εSt , noting that E[εSt−j εR
                                      t−i ] = 0 for all i and j. Then use the AR(1) specification
of εt and apply the fact that the innovation ξtS is i.i.d. to yield

    The bias disappears when the fiscal disturbance is i.i.d., but the bias is always negative
when the disturbance is positively serially correlated, 0 < ρS < 1. Bias is clearly increasing
in the variance of the fiscal disturbance relative to the monetary shock. Less obvious is that

the absolute value of the bias rises the more aggressively monetary policy targets inflation—
higher α—because doing so reduces the variance of real debt. Similarly, one can show that
the bias rises in absolute value with a more aggressive reaction of surpluses to debt—higher
γ or lower Γ.
    Equilibrium condition (2) creates a positive correlation between the real value of debt,
bt−1 , and the present value of surpluses, but implies nothing about the correlation between
bt−1 and st . The negative bias that (13) reports arises from positive serial correlation in the
surplus disturbance, a fact that is well documented by estimated models. Higher εSt−1 reduces
bt−1 and, when it also portends a higher surplus in period t, cov(εSt , bt−1 ) < 0. Passive fiscal
behavior gradually reduces surpluses with lower debt to ensure that their present value falls
by an amount equal to the initial drop in bt−1 . Monetary policy plays no role in determining
the sign of the bias.

Applying similar reasoning to the solutions in regime F yields the variance of real debt

    As in regime M, the bias disappears when the fiscal disturbance is serially uncorrelated.
In contrast to regime M, as we shall show, the magnitude of the bias depends in important
ways on the monetary policy parameter α. As above, bias is increasing in var(εSt )/var(εR        t ).
    When the fiscal shock is positively serially correlated, the sign of the bias depends on the
sign of ρS −α, the difference between the persistence of the fiscal disturbance and the strength
of monetary policy’s response to inflation. To understand this, first consider the case of a
pegged nominal interest rate—α = 0—as, for example, when monetary policy is at the zero
lower bound. Imagine the economy starts in steady state and is hit by a positive innovation
to the surplus at time t−1. Substituting (11) into the solution for inflation in (10), we obtain
πt−1 = −[(1 − β)/(1 − βρS )]εSt−1 , while real debt is bt−1 = ρS [(1 − β)/(1 − βρS )]εSt−1 . Because
the central bank is holding fixed the nominal interest rate (and the bond price), there can be
no change in expected inflation and real debt decays toward steady state at a rate determined
by the serial correlation of the fiscal disturbance, ρS . Positive serial correlation creates a
positive covariance between bt−1 and εSt .
    Now suppose that monetary policy responds to lower inflation by reducing the nominal
interest rate by απt−1 . Lower Rt−1 raises the price of newly-issued bonds at that date. The


                                                      6
                          Leeper & Li: Surplus-Debt Regressions


government’s flow budget constraint at t − 1 explains how this monetary reaction can induce
a negative covariance between bt−1 and εSt

                                βbt−1 = −(1 − αβ)πt−1 − (1 − β)εSt−1

where in steady state bt−2 = 0 and we have replaced the nominal interest rate with the policy
rule, setting the monetary shock to zero. Lower πt−1 raises the first term on the right, while
higher surpluses reduce the second term. The ultimate effect on the real value of new debt
issuance at t − 1 can go either way, so it is possible for bt−1 to fall. Essentially, a larger value
of α raises the price of bonds enough to allow a lower quantity of real bonds to satisfy the
budget constraint to create the negative covariance.
    Although the sign and the bias are empirical matters, estimated models generally find
that ρS > α. In a policy rule like (5), the disturbance tends to be highly serially correlated,
with ρS values in the neighborhood of 0.95. And estimates of α in passive monetary policy
episodes come in well below such values, so positive bias in regime F is quite likely.

4 Numerical Exploration of Bias in Regime F
Because the bias is always negative in regime M when surpluses are positively serially cor-
related, when the true value of γ is greater than one linear projections will not mislead.
The same cannot be said if policy behavior places the economy in regime F. If in regime
F γ = 0 and the bias is sufficiently large and positive, linear projections will mistakenly
lead to an inference that fiscal policy is passively adjusting surpluses to stabilize debt: an
econometrician will make a Type I error by incorrectly rejecting the null H0 : γ = 0.
    A visual representation of the potential bias may be more illuminating than expression
(14). Figures 1 and 2 plot the bias as a function of the crucial parameters α, ρS , and
                S 3
var(εRt )/var(εt ). Estimates of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models with mone-
tary and fiscal policy tend to find that ρS > α and var(εR                    S
                                                                  t ) < var(εt ), with the standard
deviation of fiscal shocks usually many times larger than the standard deviation of the mon-
etary shock.4 The figures report both a three-dimension plot of the bias as a function of ρS
and α and a contour plot, which reports level curves for the bias in ρS -α space. Figure 1
sets std(εR         S
           t )/std(εt ) = 0.25 and figure 2 sets the ratio at 0.10.
    Weak monetary policy responses to inflation (small α) together with strong serial corre-
lation in the fiscal disturbance (large ρS ) can produce significant positive biases. At values
of ρS = 0.95, which are typical in empirical estimates, an econometrician would obtain es-
timates of γ greater than 1 for values of α up to 0.35 when the standard deviation of the
surplus shock is four times that of the monetary shock (figure 1). Raising the relative volatil-
ity of the two disturbances to 10 leads to estimates of γ over 1 for values of α up to about
0.75. Higher volatility of εSt raise both cov(εSt , bt−1 ) and var(bt−1 ) to produce large effects on
the magnitude of the bias.
   3
     The model is calibrated to a quarterly frequency so β = 0.99 and sets ρR = 0.7, but results are not very
sensitive to the serial correlation of the monetary disturbance. To hold var(εSt ) fixed while ρS changes, the
calculations vary the variance of the innovation ξtS , σS2 , as needed.

5 Discussion
This note’s analysis finds that surplus-debt regressions are likely to yield qualitatively ac-
curate inferences in the case when there is actually no need to be concerned about whether
fiscal policy responds to stabilize debt—in regime M. Unfortunately, inferences may be seri-
ously misleading in precisely those circumstances when actual responses of surpluses to debt
are weak or non-existent—in regime F.
    Although the model in this note is too simple to make plausible quantitative predictions,
it serves to highlight an economic mechanism that can create bias in surplus-debt regressions.
First generation estimated DSGE models like Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005) and
Smets and Wouters (2007) built in Ricardian equivalence, just as in our model’s regime M.
The current generation of models breaks down Ricardian equivalence in a wide variety of
ways: finitely-lived agents [Annicchiarico, Giammarioli, and Piergallini (2012)], liquidity-
constrained consumers [Coenen, Straub, and Trabandt (2013)], distorting taxes [Traum and
Yang (2011)], financial intermediation that relies on government bonds [Villa (2013), Gelain
and Ilbas (2014)], and heterogeneous agents [Kaplan, Moll, and Violante (2015)]. Each of
these enrichments can make the price level depend on future surpluses to introduce the
biases that appear in regime F of the simple model. Quantitative assessments of bias in
surplus-debt regressions call for richer models like these that have been fit to data.
    A thorough answer to the question of whether economies have actually resided in regime
F is well beyond the scope of this note. But there is plenty of suggestive evidence that
monetary policy has been passive—0 ≤ α < 1. Clarida, Galı́, and Gertler (2000) and many
other studies document that for the 20 years before Paul Volcker became chair of the Fed,

Figure 2: Regime F bias as a function of serial correlation of fiscal shock (ρS ) and monetary
policy response to inflation (α). Figure on right depicts contours for the bias. Standard
deviation of surplus shock is 10 times that of monetary shock; γ = 0.

α was well below unity in the United States. And for over seven years since the financial
crisis, policy rates in many countries have been at or near their lower bounds. The Bank of
Japan has pegged overnight call rate for nearly 20 consecutive years. Similar findings emerge
from Markov-switching estimates of Federal Reserve behavior [see footnote 4]. There is little
doubt that monetary policy behaves passively, sometimes for extended periods.
    There are fewer studies of fiscal regime. But recent estimates find that at times fiscal
policy has behaved actively, as regime F prescribes. Several papers find that fiscal behavior
in the United States fluctuates between passive and active episodes and other work concludes
that regimes M and F fit U.S. data equally well, making it difficult to dismiss regime F as a
plausible explanation of data [see footnote 4].
    This note scrutinizes surplus-debt regressions that are used to test for fiscal sustainability.
The analysis quickly evolved to examine how monetary and fiscal policies jointly determine
the price level and stabilize debt. This evolution is natural when we recognize that most
countries issue nominal government bonds—often the vast majority of debt—whose real
value or, equivalently, whose debt-GDP ratio, depends on the aggregate price level.
    Studies of fiscal sustainability rarely distinguish between real—inflation-indexed, foreign
currency denominated—debt and nominal debt. Implicitly, those studies assume economies
reside permanently in regime M so that any expansion in debt must be backed wholly by
higher subsequent surpluses to assure sustainability. By not considering regime F, that work
has not brought into the analysis the roles that monetary policy and price-level adjustments
may play in stabilizing the real value of government debt. As this note illustrates, surplus-
debt regressions cannot control for those monetary factors.


                                                                   9

    Recognizing that different mechanisms can stabilize real and nominal debt raises concerns
about empirical findings based on long time series [Bohn (1998), Mauro, Romeu, Binder, and
Zaman (2015), and D’Erasmo, Mendoza, and Zhang (2016)]. Until 1933, the United States
operated under commodity money standards. Although U.S. treasuries were denominated in
“dollars,” because those dollars were convertible to precious metal, the government required
real resources to back treasuries: debt was effectively real. After leaving the gold standard,
debt obligations were payable in paper money: debt has been nominal. Regime M treats
debt as real; regime F treats it as nominal. The two kinds of debt call for different analyses
of fiscal sustainability.
    If single-equation regressions cannot reliably recover fiscal rules, what can? Even the
simple theory in this note points toward the need to integrate features (i)–(iii) in the in-
troduction to identify and estimate fiscal behavior. Those features imply cross-equation
restrictions that affect estimates of γ. Fully specified DSGE models can impose those re-
strictions, but whether they generally obtain accurate estimates of fiscal behavior has not
been studied. Identified vector autoregressions can, in principle, also impose cross-equation
restrictions [Del Negro and Schorfheide (2004)]; their ability to recover policy behavior also
remains unexplored.
    Estimating policy behavior requires identifying assumptions. Regressions of equilib-
rium surpluses and debt recover actual policy behavior only under very strong restrictions.
Whether those restrictions hold in general calls for more detailed analyses.
