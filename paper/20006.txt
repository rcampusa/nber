                                              ABSTRACT

We test whether students in a hybrid format of introductory microeconomics, which met once per
week, performed as well as students in a traditional lecture format of the same class, which met twice
per week. We randomized 725 students at a large, urban public university into the two formats, and
unlike past studies, had a very high participation rate of 96 percent. Two experienced professors taught
one section of each format, and students in both formats had access to the same online materials. We
find that students in the traditional format scored 2.3 percentage points more on a 100-point scale on
the combined midterm and final. There were no differences between formats in non-cognitive effort
(attendance, time spent with online materials) nor in withdrawal from the class. Comparing our experimental
estimates of the effect of attendance with non-experimental estimates using only students in the traditional
format, we find that the non-experimental were 2.5 times larger, suggesting that the large effects of
attending lectures found in the previous literature are likely due to selection bias. Overall our results
suggest that hybrid classes may offer a cost effective alternative to traditional lectures while having
a small impact on student performance.

       James A. Garfield, twentieth president of the United States and a graduate of Williams

College, is reputed once to have said of renowned educator Mark Hopkins: “the ideal college is

Mark Hopkins on one end of a log and a student on the other” (Rudolf, 1956, p. vii). Garfield's

epigram embodies the notion that the best learning takes place in a dialogue between student and

professor, in which students take an active role in the learning process and professors can easily

gauge a student's comprehension through verbal and non-verbal cues. This ideal remains at the

core of American higher education despite the enormous changes in instructional technology that

have occurred since the mid-19th century when Garfield was educated. In the mid 1950's,

television was the first technology to capture the imagination of university administrators keen to

reach a larger student population and, most importantly, hold the costs of instruction down

(Macmitchell 1955; Eurich 1958). Most recently, the Internet and various modes of online

instruction have captured the imaginations of university administrators anxious to cut costs --

particularly courses taught online to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of students, so-

called massive open online courses, or MOOCs − despite being the diametric opposites of

Garfield’s “log” ideal. Although the initial excitement over MOOCs has diminished somewhat

due to questions of completion rates and efficacy (Collins, 2013; Lewin, 2013), and the fact that

MOOCs are completed primarily by college graduates (Ho et al. 2014), online learning in some

form will surely be an increasingly important component of university education, even

potentially improving on the kind of instruction Mark Hopkins might have offered to his students

(Bowen, 2013).

        Despite potentially large cost savings in moving teaching fully or partially online from

the traditional classroom, there is a dearth of academic research that rigorously evaluates the

impact of various non-traditional learning formats on student outcomes. For example, of the



                                                1
1,132 studies examined in a recent U.S. Department of Education (2010) meta-analysis of online

learning at all levels from kindergarten to graduate study, only 45 followed experimental or

quasi-experimental designs, and of those 45 studies, only 5 had sample sizes greater than 400.

On the basis of the 45 experimental studies, the Department of Education authors concluded that

there was a modest gain in performance for students taught in online formats relative to those

taught with traditional or face-to-face methods.

       More recently, two research teams have also used randomized designs to evaluate fully or

partially online formats in full-semester undergraduate classes. Figlio, Rush, and Yin (2013)

compared students who took introductory economics online versus a traditional lecture format at

a major research university. Bowen, et al. (2014) examine the performance of students in an

introductory statistics class held on six public university campuses, contrasting the performance

of students attending a traditional class with two weekly meetings with those whose class

material was delivered online supplemented by one weekly class meeting. Both studies reported

no overall difference in performance as measured by test grades between formats, although

Figlio, Rush, Yin (2013) did find that Hispanic students and those with a grade point average

below the median did less well in the online economics class.

       Both of these studies make important contributions to the literature, while at the same

time underscoring the challenges of undertaking randomized designs in a university setting.

Participation rates in both studies were less than 25 percent, highlighting the difficulty of

recruiting students when the ability to offer incentives is limited by institutional review board

protocols. Such low participation rates clearly raise questions of external validity. In addition,

although sample sizes in both studies were large enough to provide sufficient statistical power to

detect overall differences between formats, they were not large enough for most sub-group



                                                   2
analyses, either by baseline demographics or, in the case of Bowen, et al. (2014), across

campuses.

         Other issues beyond selective participation and small samples also affect these studies.

For example, Figlio, Rush, and Yin (2013) present results showing that the mean differences in

test scores between formats increased between 60 and 100 percent when adjusted for baseline

covariates, suggesting a lack of balance in the characteristics of the students in each of the

formats.1 The statistics experiment conducted by Bowen, et al. (2014) encountered difficulty

coordinating test and grading across campuses and faculty – not all campuses used a common set

of questions on the final and faculty, aware they were part of an experiment, may have graded

more leniently in order to reduce failure rates. Lastly, substitution bias is an ever-present threat

to randomized designs in university settings. It is very difficult to limit class-specific online

content only to those in a particular treatment group and students restricted to traditional lecture

formats can easily access tutorials, practice problems, and videos online.2 Online materials may

not be perfect substitutes for what is covered in a specific class, but they may blur the distinction

between a traditional format and either a hybrid or purely online class.

         We randomly assigned 725 students into traditional and “hybrid” formats of introductory

microeconomics at a large, urban, public university.3 We examine whether students who were

offered class once a week for 75-minutes over a 14-week semester performed as well as students

who were offered class twice per week, each for 75-minutes. Two experienced professors (the

higher (p<.01) on the average of all three exams than students restricted to the video-taped lectures. See Table 3 in
Figlio, Rush, and Yin (2013).

  Both formats could be considered “hybrid” formats because there was a significant online component in both. For
ease of explication, we shall refer to the once-per-week class as the hybrid format and the twice-per-week class as
the traditional format.

first two authors) taught four sections, one of each format. Students in the two formats had

access to the same lecture slides, online material, and faculty-produced videos, which eliminated

substitution bias as a source of attenuation since classroom time was the only difference between

formats.     Because research on student learning suggests that frequent assessments with

immediate feedback improve performance (Pennebaker, Gosling and Ferrell 2013), we also

required weekly graded quizzes for both formats. We required students in both formats to take

the online quizzes both before and after lectures, using sophisticated interactive software (Aplia)

to deliver and grade them. This type of software is available “off-the-shelf” from numerous

publishers for large introductory undergraduate classes at less than the price of a traditional

textbook. This online component of our courses should not be costly to reproduce and is easy to

replicate.

        We find that students in the traditional format performed better on the midterm and final

exams and in their overall grade. The effects are not large, however: approximately 2.5 points

on a 100-point scale. To put this result in perspective, if we divide this 2.5 point effect by the

median difference in classes attended between formats, 11, then each extra class offered in the

traditional format increased the final grade by 0.23 percentage points. We find little difference

in attendance, as students in both formats attended the same proportion of classes, and there were

no differences in withdrawal rates by format. We also find no difference in hours logged into

the online software or differences in the number of videos watched by class format. We further

examine the impact of attendance on performance with a non-experimental subset of our data

and find that the non-experimental estimates are between 2.5 and 4.7 times greater (in absolute

value) than the experimental estimates, suggesting that non-randomized designs may

significantly overstate the impact of attendance on outcomes.



                                                4
       Our results have meaningful pedagogical and administrative implications for

undergraduate education. The fundamental difference in treatment between the traditional and

hybrid formats is the amount of time spent in the classroom, with students in the hybrid having

only half the amount of formal class time as those in the traditional sections. Our study can

therefore be viewed as a strong test of whether substantial differences in attendance matter to

academic performance when online materials are also available.             We provide the first

experimental evidence on the effects of attendance and academic performance.            When we

replicate the observational literature, we get very similar (and large) estimates of the effect of

attendance. Our experimental estimates of the effect of attendance are much smaller, however,

and indicate that the large effects in the previous literature are likely to be due to selection on

unobservable characteristics.

       Given the relatively small differences in students’ academic performance between

formats, our study points to potential savings in terms of classroom space and faculty staffing.

The software that now accompanies introductory textbooks from for-profit publishers, and

administered on their servers, allows for more frequent, machine-graded assignments at little cost

to universities.. These online components enhance core skill-building and enable faculty to

spend classroom time on more complex material. Large lecture halls are scarce resources and

small recitations are costly to staff and schedule. One faculty with many fewer teaching

assistants but with online material may be able to teach twice the number of introductory

students with no substantial diminution in measured learning.

I.      The Experiment



Setting



          The study took place at Baruch College, part of the City University of New York, and

one the most ethnically diverse campuses in the country, where one hundred and sixty three

countries are represented and 110 languages are spoken.4 Baruch’s Zicklin School of Business is

the largest accredited collegiate school of business in the country with 12,000 undergraduates.

Almost all students commute to campus and most attend full-time.

          Principles of Microeconomics (ECO 1001) is a required course for all students applying

to the business program at Baruch. It also fulfills a social science requirement for non-business

majors. Nearly one thousand students take ECO 1001 each fall. Four sections with seats for a

total of 776 students were part of our study, which accounted for 95% of the daytime non-honors

seats available for the course.5 Students could register for class on Mondays and Wednesdays in

the morning or Tuesdays and Thursdays in the late afternoon. Classes were listed as taught by

the first two authors of the study. Both are full-time, tenured faculty members who have taught

the class for the past 6 years and both have strong teaching evaluations.6 Registration for the

fall classes began in April of 2013 and continued through August. Students currently enrolled in

  Twenty seats went unfilled in the sections of the course in this study. Just over 100 students took ECO 1001 in the
evening, most of whom were part-time students. Of the remaining students who were not part of our study, one
section of 25 students was reserved for honors students only, and another daytime section of 40 students was taught
by an adjunct faculty member.

four-year colleges could not begin registration until June.



The Course



         All sections of the class used N. Gregory Mankiw’s Principles of Microeconomics (6th

Edition) as the textbook along with Cengage Aplia software to administer and grade online

quizzes. Each week students took a Sunday “pre-lecture quiz” covering material to be taught in

the upcoming week, and a Saturday “post-lecture quiz” covering material that had been taught

during the week. The pre-lecture quizzes were pass/fail (students who answered at least half of

the questions correctly received 100% for the quiz) and were generally easier than the post-

lecture quizzes; they were designed to ensure students came to lectures with some basic

understanding of the material, without which the pace of the hybrid lectures in particular would

have been quite challenging for most students.

         Lectures by professors formed the core of ECO 1001. During lectures, the professors

presented microeconomic theory and examples using Power Point slides. The same slides were

used in the hybrid and traditional lectures by both professors, and were made available to all

students for download, but they were covered more selectively and quickly in the hybrid format,

with less time to verbally annotate the slides, work through examples, and answer student

questions. There was also less time in the hybrid to go over difficult problems from the Aplia

quizzes and to review practice questions for exams.7 In addition, one of the professors recorded

videos for each chapter from the text, in which he annotated answers to 10 multiple choice

7
 While several practice exams and solutions were made available to all students online, the traditional lecture
format presented more opportunities to visit the practice exams during class.


                                                          7
questions. Each video was approximately 30 minutes long but was broken up into segments

ranging from 5 to 10 minutes each, so that students could easily select only the videos for which

they sought explanations. The videos were taped in a studio with no audience but the lighting

and sound were professionally supervised. A priori we expected students in the hybrid sections

to make more use of the videos than those in the traditional sections.

       Because the hybrid format forced the professors to compress their lectures to fit the

reduced class time, the fundamental differences between the two formats were the amount of

contact that students had with their course professor and classmates, the tempo of learning

required during the lectures, and the amount of class time available for questions. While other

studies have tried to limit access to online material, this struck us as infeasible and a potential

confounding factor for the results. All online content was available to students in both formats

of the class in order to isolate the impact of classroom time on student performance. We believe

the contrast between the two formats in our study is likely to be closer to the “real world”

implementation of such courses. Formal online materials are likely to be available in both

“traditional” and “hybrid” courses. Moreover, because classroom space and time are far more

costly to provide than online materials, our treatment captures the relevant margin on which

university administrators are likely to prefer one format over another.



Recruitment and Randomization



       Recruitment began in May of 2013, shortly after the beginning of registration for the Fall

2013 semester. Students who had registered for one of the four class sections were sent an email

inviting them to participate in the study with a link to the electronic consent form.          The



                                                 8
Institutional Review Board of CUNY, in approving our application, allowed us to offer an

incentive of five extra-credit points (out of 100) on their course average to students who

participated in the study.8 For example, if a student’s course average was 90 (an A-) the

student’s final numerical grade was increased to 95 (an A).9 Students who chose not to

participate were allowed to do an extra credit project for the same five points.10

         The flow of students is shown in Figure 1. Seven hundred and fifty-five students

registered for the four sections of ECO 1001, of which 381 were in the Monday-Wednesday

classes and 374 in the Tuesday-Thursday classes. Of the 755 registrants, 725 consented to be in

the study, a 96% participation rate that represented 91 percent of all non-honors daytime students

enrolled in ECO 1001. This participation rate is far greater than recent experimental studies of

online learning and is likely due to the 5 point participation incentive. Thirty-two students either

dropped the class before the midterm or did not take the midterm, and an additional 37 students

took the midterm but afterwards either withdrew or did not take the final exam. The total post-

randomization attrition rate was 9.5 percent.

         We randomized students between formats within days (i.e. Monday-Wednesday or

Tuesday-Thursday).11 One section was taught in a large lecture hall that seats 274 students and



8
  In our IRB application we estimated that 132 students in each treatment arm were necessary for a minimum
detectable effect size of 4.2 percentage points with 90 percent power. Lowering power to 80 percent, the required
sample sizes fell to 98 students in each treatment arm. By offering an incentive to participate, we expected to
recruit most of the 776 students that were likely to register for the 4 experimental sections. Even with a withdrawal
rate of 10 percent, the research plan included large enough sample sizes to detect effects with sufficient power.
9
  The five extra credit points proved crucial to recruitment. The IRB also allowed us to offer a raffle in which 40
students picked randomly from the participants would be given priority registration for their classes in the spring of
2014. Comments from students suggested that the number of priority registrations was too few to be a significant
incentive, but that the five extra-credit points for one of the 8 classes that determines admission to the business
school was highly valued.
10
   Of the 26 non-participants who finished the course (2 others withdrew and 2 did not take the final), only 11 (42%)
completed the extra credit project.
11
   Students that registered for a Monday-Wednesday section could not be randomized into Tuesday-Thursday
sections because it would have potentially created conflicts with other classes for which they had registered.


                                                          9
the other section, given at the same time, was in a classroom that held 114 students.12 Each

professor taught one hybrid section and one traditional section, each in the same classroom. That

is, Professor A taught a traditional section in the small classroom on Monday and Wednesday

mornings and a hybrid section in the same small room on Tuesday afternoons. Similarly,

Professor B taught a traditional section in the large lecture hall on Tuesday and Thursday

afternoons and the hybrid section in the same room on Wednesday mornings. We can therefore

control for the professor and classroom size fixed effects, but we cannot separately identify them.

Moreover, the administratively imposed restriction of having different class sizes introduces a

potential source of treatment heterogeneity.           “Within professor” comparisons contrast students

from different randomized samples and “within day” comparisons contrast performance across

classroom/professor. We therefore present several sets of results: the pooled sample of all

students with controls for day and classroom/professor, comparisons within classroom/professor,

and third, comparisons within day but across classroom/professor and course format.



Outcomes



        As with other experiments, our fundamental outcome measure is academic performance

on exams and the final course grade. We administered both the midterm and final exams in

class, and on both tests the same questions were used in all four sections. The midterm and final

consisted of 30 and 40 multiple choice questions, respectively. The questions came both from a

standardized test bank as well as being written by Professors A and B. A copy of each exam is

included in the Appendix. As an overall measure of test performance, we summed the total

12
  The Baruch administration could not commit two large lecture halls during the same class period to the study
given the demand from other large lecture classes.


                                                        10
number of correctly answered questions on the midterm and final and divided by 70, the total

number of questions. We also present results with the overall course grade, in which the midterm

and final exams counted for 35 and 45 percent, respectively. The remaining 20 percent of the

course grade comprise online quizzes managed and graded with Cengage’s Aplia software. The

course grade also includes the penalty for missed classes described below, the 5 percentage-point

bonus for participation, as well as curves for each exam.13 In the results that we present below,

we scale all test scores and the course grade so that they range from 0 to 100. We prefer the

midterm+final measure of academic performance because unlike the course grade it is does not

conflate non-cognitive (attendance) and cognitive (exams and online quizzes) outcomes.14

        The primary purpose of the Aplia quizzes was to encourage students to keep up with the

material and improve their preparation for the lecture. They were not supervised (i.e. we cannot

determine whether students did their own work or worked with other students) and were intended

as low-stakes assessments. Except for the week in which the midterm was given, students had a

pre-lecture quiz that was graded on a pass-fail basis with only one attempt at the correct answer,

and a post-lecture quiz that was graded on the percent correct.15 Students were permitted three

attempts at the correct answer on the post-lecture quiz. In calculating the contribution of the

Aplia quizzes to the final grade calculation, each quiz was weighted proportionately to its total

possible points (on average, the post-lecture quizzes were worth about three times as many



13
   Each exam was curved so that the median curved exam score was 80%. As a result of this curve, 2 points (out of
30) were added to each midterm score and 6 points (out of 40) were added to each final exam score in the
calculation of course grades.
14
   Attendance is potentially endogenous and students could have worked with other students on their Aplia quizzes
even for the questions that were algorithmic. Thus, the overall grade is a less-controlled measure of performance
than the midterm and final exams.
15
   A student who answered at least 50% of the questions correctly on a pre-lecture quiz earned full points, while a
student who answered less than 50% correctly received no adjustment. Thus 8 out of 15 correct was bumped up to
15/15, while 7 out of 15 was recorded as 7/15.

points as the pre-lecture quizzes), and for each student we dropped the pre-lecture quiz and post-

lecture quiz that most adversely affected his or her grade.

         In addition to students’ cognitive performance, we also examine whether the different

formats elicited different amounts of non-cognitive effort. First, we took attendance at every

lecture. Students were required to swipe their student identification cards in a card reader within

the first 15 minutes of class. The readers were linked to the registrar’s database and the presence

(or absence) of each student was verified and stored on a college server. Excluding the midterm

and the first week of class, which did not count towards attendance requirements, students were

allowed to miss 6 out of 25 lectures in the traditional format and three out of 12 in the hybrid

format without penalty, i.e. approximately 25 percent of the lectures. In the traditional classes,

students lost one percentage point from their final grade for any late or missed classes beyond the

six permitted absences, and in the hybrid classes students lost two percentage points for any late

or missed classes beyond the three permitted absences. The policy provided an incentive for

students to swipe their ID cards, but it also created potentially meaningful variation in attendance

within format.16

         Second, we analyze withdrawal rates. We count as withdrawals students who enrolled in

the class and consented to be in the study, but failed to finish.17 We also measured withdrawals

between the midterm to the final. Withdrawal rates are an important indicator of students’ ability

to manage a hybrid format, but they also allow us to gauge the potential for attrition bias.


16
   Recitation sections, led by a graduate student, were held in conjunction with both large lectures. Each of the four
recitations had a class size of almost 70 students. Attendance was voluntary, however, and extremely low. On
average, students attended 1.1 recitations out of a possible 13 and the median and modal number of recitations
attended was zero. There was no recitation available to students in the smaller classroom. Given the low
participation rate, however, the presence of recitations should have little impact on the results.
17
   As noted, ECO 1001 is one of the eight classes that determine entrance to the Zicklin School of Business.
Students can withdraw or not even show up for the final and accept a grade of F because they can retake the class
and replace the F on their transcript. We treated official withdrawals and “no-shows” as the same.


                                                         12
        Third, for online content, we measured how many course videos the students watched.

Because the videos were located all on one page in Blackboard, we can only measure how many

videos were watched, but not which videos.18 A priori, we expected students in the hybrid

sections to watch more videos. Lastly, In addition to quiz results, we measured the number of

hours students spent logged on to Aplia.



II.     Data



        We combined several sources of data. All baseline characteristics were obtained from

Baruch College’s Office of Institutional Research and Program Assessment.                     These data

included age, race/ethnicity, language spoken at home, major (if declared), grade point average

(GPA), SAT scores, and cumulative credits. Some students have a GPA at Baruch, while

transfer students have only GPA from their former college. Former transfer students have both

GPAs. In the regression analysis, that follows, we include both GPAs and indicator variables for

missing one or both of those GPAs.19 We also do not have SAT scores for all students because

not all transfer students were required to take the SATs. We also administered two short surveys

to students in the first and last week of classes. We solicited their attitudes toward hybrid

courses and whether they worked for compensation during the semester              The     Aplia     server

routinely collected data on student use and data on the number of videos watched were collected

from the Baruch Blackboard servers.



18
  The decision to locate all the videos on one page was made by the Baruch IT department.
19
  We have Baruch GPAs for about 78% of our sample, and Baruch or transfer GPAs for about 93% of our sample.
We have both Baruch and transfer GPAs for about 20% of our sample. Baruch accepts many transfer students,
particularly from other CUNY schools; only about 58% of our sample is “native” Baruch students.

III.   Results



Summary statistics and balance



       We present the baseline characteristics of students by format in the pooled sample in

Table 1. Characteristics of students at the start of the experiment are shown in the left panel and

characteristics at the end of the semester are shown in the right panel.       Overall, balance is

superb, with no statistically significant differences between traditional and hybrid formats on any

of the sample characteristics in the beginning sample and only one statistically significant

difference (age) between the formats among students who took the final exam. For both samples

we estimated a logit with hybrid (1=hybrid, 0=traditional) as the dependent variable and all of

the characteristics (as well as indicators for missing values) as the dependent variables. The p-

value for the overall χ2 statistic from these regressions is 0.626 for the initial registrants and

0.157 in for the students who took the final exam. We also show the distribution of

characteristics for the Monday-Wednesday and Tuesday-Thursday sections in Appendix Table 1

and these show similarly excellent balance.

       Table 2 shows the baseline characteristics within professor/classroom. Estimating similar

logit models as in Table 1 yields p-values that are larger than .05 for both the beginning and

ending samples for Professor A and also in the beginning sample for Professor B, while in the

ending sample for Professor B the differences are jointly significant at the 3.7% level. For both

Professors, we do find some differences in the proportion of Asian students, who were more

likely to register for Tuesday-Thursday sessions than Monday-Wednesday sessions. There are

also some statistically significant differences for Professor A in prior academic performance



                                                14
experience. Recall that we could not randomize within professor/classroom because we could

not randomize across the Monday-Wednesday and Tuesday-Thursday schedules, as this would

have caused conflicts with students’ other scheduled classes, and student preferences for taking

classes on different days or at a different time of day may lead to some small differences

between the hybrid and traditional groups for each professor. Overall, however, the balance

within professor is excellent.



Performance On Tests and Quizzes: Pooled Sample



       We show differences in student performance on the midterm, final, the combination of

both, Aplia quizzes, and the final course grade in Table 3. As noted above, we scaled all results

to range from 0 to 100 to facilitate comparisons across the various performance metrics. For each

outcome we show unadjusted (in odd-numbered columns) and adjusted (in even-numbered

columns) mean percentage point differences.          In all regressions in Table 3 we include an

indicator for the Monday-Wednesday classes because the probability of being placed into the

hybrid was different in the two randomization pools in the experiment. In practice, however, this

variable is never statistically different from zero. Across all performance measures, we find that

students in the hybrid format did less well than students in the traditional format, and that these

differences, except for Aplia scores, are statistically significantly different from zero. Adjusting

for baseline covariates narrows the estimated mean differences between formats by a few tenths

of one percentage point relative to the unadjusted differences. The covariates also tighten the

standard errors and greatly improved the explanatory power of the model. In general, adding




                                                15
covariates increases the R2 from around 1 percent to 30 percent or more. The consistency of the

unadjusted and adjusted results speaks to the balance in the pre-treatment covariates.

        Our preferred measure is the combined midterm and final score (columns 7 and 8). We

find that on average, students in the hybrid format scored around 2.5 percentage points less than

students in the traditional format, adjusted for covariates.20 This 2.5 percentage point difference

represents one fewer correct answer on a test of 40 questions, a relatively modest effect. In

terms of standard deviations, this effect is about .2 standard deviations of the mean score of

students in the traditional sections. The lower bound of the 95 confidence interval from the

estimated effect in column 8 is -4.2, approximately one half of a letter grade, which is more

substantial. The results were nearly identical for the overall course grade (columns 11 and 12).

        Differences in test scores by format were larger for the midterm (columns 1 and 2) than

the final (columns 5 and 6).          We present results for the midterm for those students who

completed the class in columns 3 and 4. The results are nearly identical to those in columns 1

and 2, suggesting that there is not selective attrition between the formats. This is confirmed in

the results in Table 7 below, where we find no differences across format in the overall

withdrawal rate or withdrawal after the midterm.

         To examine visually the effects of being in different formats, in Figure 2 we show kernel

density estimates of all of outcomes in Table 3 for the hybrid and traditional formats. The red

lines indicate the densities for the distribution of outcomes in the hybrid sections while the blue

lines indicate the distribution of outcomes in the traditional sections. The shaded area below

each plot shows the difference in densities between traditional and hybrid formats. The plots

reveal a roughly symmetrical distribution of exam scores and the final grade, with the hybrid

20
  The full output for the adjusted estimates is presented in Appendix Table 2.   Students’ GPAs and math SAT
scores are, unsurprisingly, the primary predictors of class performance.


                                                      16
distribution shifted slightly left to that of the traditional distribution. The exception is the scores

on the Aplia quizzes, which are nearly identical across formats, but are clearly skewed left,

reflecting that students were allowed three attempts to answer post-lecture quizzes correctly but

some students didn’t submit several assignments.          We performed two-sample Kolmogorov-

Smirnoff tests on the difference between the densities in each of the panels of Figure 2. We

rejected the null hypothesis of equal densities only for the midterm, where the test had a p-value

of 0.078. We also performed two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnoff tests on the difference in the

raw (unsmoothed) distribution between the hybrid and traditional sections for all of the outcomes

in Table 3, and rejected the null hypothesis of equal distribution for the midterm (p=.04),

midterm plus final (p=.02), and the course grade (p=.096).



Performance On Tests and Quizzes Within Professor/Classroom



       As discussed earlier, for administrative reasons we were unable to procure classrooms of

equal size. Each professor taught in either a small classroom with a capacity of 114 students

(Professor A) or a large classroom with a capacity of 274 students (Professor B). Although we

control for professor/classroom fixed effects in Table 3, we cannot separately control for the

professor effect and the classroom effect, and it is possible that there is treatment heterogeneity

across classroom sizes that we would not capture in those results. To examine whether this is an

issue, we present estimates of the treatment effects separately for each professor/classroom in

Table 4. The top panel shows the results for Professor A (in the smaller lecture hall) while the

bottom panel shows the results for Professor B (in the larger lecture hall). The outcomes are the

same as in Table 3 and columns present unadjusted and adjusted treatment effects as in Table 3.



                                                  17
       Overall, the results are quite consistent with those from the pooled sample shown in

Table 3. Students in the hybrid taken in the large lecture hall (Professor B) scored approximately

3 percentage points lower on the combined midterm and final than students in the traditional

class (lower panel, columns 5 and 6). Differences by format are somewhat less in the smaller

classroom but are not as precisely estimated, reflecting the smaller sample size (upper panel,

columns 5 and 6).      The estimated differences are also more sensitive to the inclusion of

covariates than those in the pooled sample in Table 3. Recall that we only randomized within

days. The within professor/classroom estimates therefore compare students from two different

randomized samples.      Although the balance of baseline characteristics by format appears

reasonable, there are greater differences in some characteristics by format, as we showed in

Table 2. We view these results as being quite comparable to those from the pooled sample,

however, while eliminating an important source of heterogeneity.



Performance on Tests and Quizzes Within Day



       To illustrate the importance of professor/classroom heterogeneity, we show estimates of

the hybrid effect comparing within days in Table 5. The top panel (Monday-Wednesday)

compares outcomes of students in which the hybrid class was delivered in the large lecture hall

and the traditional class in the smaller room. In the bottom panel (Tuesday-Thursday) the

opposite occurred: students in the hybrid format were in the smaller classroom and those in

traditional format had class in the large lecture hall.   The differences are striking. Students in

the hybrid format scored over 5 percentage points less on the combined midterm and final (top

panel, columns 6 and 7) than those in the traditional class when the hybrid was delivered in the



                                                 18
large lecture hall, but there was no difference between formats when the hybrid class was given

in the smaller classroom (lower panel, columns 6 and 7). These differences are not likely due to

imbalance between students in the two formats because randomization occurred within day (see

Appendix Table 1). The results are at least suggestive that smaller class sizes may play an

important role in learning. Students in smaller classes meeting less frequently seem to perform

about as well as students in larger classes that meets twice as often.



Performance On Tests: Interaction Effects



        Our previous results may mask differences in performance for students with different

characteristics. In Table 6 we show the interaction effects of various student characteristics with

the hybrid indicator using the combined midterm and final score as the outcome.21 For each

model we include main effects for the hybrid and the characteristic of interest along with the

Monday-Wednesday indicator. For models with covariates, we include the full set of covariates

as employed in Table 3. Previous findings by Figlio, Rush and Yin (2013) suggest that that the

performance of students with a higher baseline GPA may be less affected by the lecture format

than weaker students who may need more interactive classroom time. In columns 1 and 2 we

present unadjusted and adjusted effects for students in the upper half of the baseline GPA

distribution.22 Unlike Figlio, Rush, and Yin (2013), we find no evidence that low-GPA students

perform worse in the hybrid format.


21
  Results for the other test-based outcomes are similar and are available from the authors by request.
22
  Recall that we do not observe a Baruch GPA for new transfer students or for first year students. To create a single
baseline GPA index, we regressed Baruch GPA on a quadratic in transfer GPA, a quadratic in age, the number of
cumulative credits, an indicator for female, and an indicator for being an underclassman for the 158 students for
whom we observe both (transfer students who have been at Baruch at least one semester). We use this predicted


                                                         19
         We do not find any differences in being in the hybrid by sex (columns 3 and 4) or race

(columns 5 and 6). Given that students in both formats have access to online materials, we might

expect that non-native English speakers would find it more difficult to keep up with the faster

learning tempo in the hybrid format. But here we also find no difference in effects of being in

the hybrid format (columns 7 and 8).

         Students who work may prefer the flexibility of having fewer class hours to attend. In

columns 9 and 10 we find relatively large, but imprecisely estimated, negative effects of being in

the hybrid for working students.             This suggests that although working students may find the

hybrid more convenient, fewer class hours also translates into fewer hours spent learning overall,

which manifests itself in a poorer performance.                   In our data, students who worked spent

somewhat less time watching videos and working on Aplia as students do did not work.

Students who worked more than 30 hours per week were also less likely to attend class.23



Attendance, Online Usage, Attrition, and Other Classes



         In addition to test scores, we also examine the effect of being in the hybrid format on a

variety of non-cognitive outcomes related to effort. In Table 7 we present the impact of the

hybrid format on attendance, the number of videos watched, time spent online using Aplia, the

probability of withdrawing from the class at any time, and the probability of withdrawing from

the class after the midterm. Columns 1 and 2 show that there is no difference between the

Baruch GPA for students with only a transfer GPA. Our predicted Baruch GPA has a correlation of .504 with the
actual Baruch GPA within the sample of 158 students who have both. Non-transfer first year students will have
neither a transfer GPA or a Baruch GPA, and for these observations (n=34) we include a dummy variable for
missing GPA.
23
   We also estimated models similar to those in Table 7 below with attendance and online usage as the outcomes, but
with the hybrid indicator interacted with working. Although rarely statistically significant the estimated coefficients
on the interaction terms were usually negative.


                                                          20
formats in the average proportion of classes attended. We do find, however, that students in the

smaller classroom taught by Professor A were somewhat more likely to attend and that students

that had the morning Monday-Wednesday lectures were 2.2 percentage points less likely to

attend than those with in the late afternoon Tuesday-Thursday lectures. We should note,

however, that 17 percent of students in the hybrid class were penalized for excessive absences,

relative to 9 percent in the traditional format.

        In column 3 we show that students in the hybrid format watched 1.8 more videos relative

to a mean of 8.5 videos than students in the traditional format. It is noteworthy that when we add

the professor/classroom fixed effect (and other covariates) in column 7, we find that students

whose professor was in the videos watch 8.6 more videos than those whose professor was not in

the videos. Students appear drawn to videos in which their professor appears rather than an

unknown “talking head.” The finding argues for personalizing online material as much as

possible. We find no differences in the number of hours students spent on Aplia (columns 5 and

6), although students spent a substantial amount of time on Aplia. The mean was 44 hours or

about 3.1 hours per week over 14 weeks. Although the result is not statistically significant, there

appears to be some evidence that students in Professor A’s classes substituted time watching

videos for time on Aplia. Overall, student effort as measured by attendance, videos, and online

quizzes was largely the same by format. Importantly, students in the hybrid format did not

appear to substitute more use of the measurable online material for reduced time they spent in the

classroom. While it is possible, of course, that students in the hybrid format spent more time

studying the textbook or with other online materials that we do not measure, we suspect that

reducing time in class leads to an decrease in the total amount of time that students were engaged

with ECO 1001 relative to those in the traditional format.



                                                   21
        The lack of differences in attendance and intensity of online usage by format indicates

that students in the hybrid class had, on average, a minimum of 13.8 more hours during the

semester to apply to other material related ECO 1001 or to their other courses.24 As a check we

tested for variation in student grades in the other classes taken in the same semester with ECO

1001 by format but found no differences.25

        It is possible that fewer contact hours with their professor might lead students in the

hybrid section to withdraw from the course differentially. In columns 7 and 8 we present results

indicating that students did not withdraw more at any time from the class in the hybrid sections

and in columns 9 and 10 we find the same result for withdrawal after the midterm. These

findings are important, because they indicate that attrition bias is unlikely to affect our results.



Student Surveys: Preference for Hybrid or Traditional



        We surveyed students in the first and last week of classes about their preferences for one

format or the other. In the first week of class, we asked students to rate the statement, “I would

have chosen the hybrid over the traditional format if I had had the choice,” on a 4-point scale

(“Strongly Agree,” “Agree,” “Disagree,” and “Strongly Disagree”). The students exhibited a

strong a priori preference for the hybrid, but it varied by their random assignment: 78 percent of

those randomly assigned to the hybrid format agreed or strongly agreed, but only 55 percent in

the traditional format did. When we asked students at the end of the semester (but prior to the

final exam or knowing their final grade) if they would chose the same format for their next


24
   The difference in the median number of classes attended between the two formats was 11, and each class period
was 75 minutes. This figure does not include time getting to and from class.
25
   These results are available from the authors by request.


                                                        22
economics class, the results shifted in favor of the traditional format: sixty-five percent of the

students in the traditional class but only 54 percent in the hybrid agreed or strongly agreed.

Thus, the preference for the traditional format increased by 20 percentage points from the

beginning of the semester amongst those in the traditional format, while the preference for the

hybrid format decreased by 24 percentage points among those in the hybrid format. Despite this

change in preferences, 67 percent of students in the traditional format and 62 percent in the

hybrid format agreed or strongly agreed that having class twice a week helped their grade, but 62

percent students in the hybrid format disagreed with the statement that the hybrid format hurt

their grade. Somewhat surprisingly, we found no differences in responses when we stratified the

data by the students’ baseline GPA. We interpret the survey results to mean that students found

the hybrid format appealing before having experienced it, but found it challenging during the

semester. A substantial proportion would not opt for the hybrid format for their next economics

class.



I V.     Comparison with Observational Estimates of the Effect of Attendance



         Our fundamental experimental manipulation was to randomly assign the number of

classes that students attend. The experimental treatment limited hybrid students to at most 13

classes, inducing a difference in the median number of classes attended to 11, i.e. traditional

format students attended nearly twice as many classes as those in the hybrid format.26 Because

all of the other inputs (textbook, lecture slides, online content, office hours, etc.) were identical

between the two formats, this provides a strong test of the effects of attendance on academic

26
  We permitted any student in the hybrid sections to attend traditional classes if they asked. Five students chose to
do so. For these students the percent of classes attended could exceed 100 percent.


                                                         23
performance and is, to our knowledge, the first such experimental evidence. Although the

induced change in attendance may seem quite large, numerous non-experimental studies have

used differences in attendance of 50 to 75 percent to quantify effects of attendance on student

performance (Romer, 1993; Devadoss and Foltz, 1996; Kirby and McElroy, 2003; Cohn and

Johnson, 2003).    In these studies, the researchers extrapolated the marginal impact of class

attendance on student performance, adjusted for student characteristics.

       To contrast our experimental estimates of the effects of attendance on performance with

those from non-experimental studies, in the old-numbered columns of Table 8 we present results

where we regress measures of student performance (final exam, midterm plus final, and course

grade) on the number of classes attended using only students in the traditional format. These

estimates are of course vulnerable to the same omitted variable problems as the previous

observational studies. Although we had a mandatory attendance policy, there was no penalty for

missing up to six lectures in the traditional format, and there is still substantial variation in

attendance. Among those students in the traditional format who took the final exam, the median

number of classes attended was 22, the minimum was 2, and the standard deviation was 3.1. We

include the same set of control variables as in Table 3, except that instead of separately entering

Baruch GPA and Transfer GPA, we include as a summary measure the Predicted Baruch GPA

measure used in Table 6.

       The results of regressing the final exam score on classes attended for the traditional

format students are shown in column 1 of Table 8. We find that an additional class attended is

associated with 0.54 percentage point gain on the final exam (column 1). As shown in the

bottom row of the table, using this result, a student who missed 11 classes in the traditional

format would be expected to score 6.4 percentage points less (0.58 x 11) on the final exam, or



                                                24
approximately two-thirds of a full grade. Because 11 classes is the median difference in classes

attended between the traditional format and hybrid format, this result allows us to compare this

impact with our experimental estimates. Students who increased their attendance by 50 percent

of 25 class meetings would be expected to increase their final exam grade by 7.25 percentage

points (12.5 × .58=7.25).

       This estimate is very close to results in the observational literature on class attendance.

Romer (1993) found that an increase in attendance from 25 to 100 percent would increase

performance in an introductory economics class by a full grade. Devadoss and Foltz (1996) also

reported that a 50 percent increase in attendance would boost a student’s performance by a full

grade in various agricultural economics classes. Kirby and McElroy (2003) estimated that

students who increased attendance at tutorials from zero to the mean of 62 percent would

improve their grade by 13 percentage points while Cohen and Johnson (2003) report that

students missing 50 percent of classes reduced students’ scores by 4.3 percentage points. More

recently, Dobkin, Gil and Marion (2010) used a clever regression discontinuity design to

compare the performance of students who scored just below the median on the midterm, and who

were required to attend subsequent classes, to students who scored just above the median on the

midterm for whom attendance remained voluntary. Assuming effects are linear, they found that

mandatory attendance after the midterm increased the final test score by 0.17 standard deviations

for every 10 percentage point increase in attendance. To make our results comparable to Dobkin,

Gil and Marion (2010), note that the standard deviation on the final exam in the traditional

format was 5.9 and that a 10 percent increase in classes would be 2.5 classes.         Therefore,

increasing attendance by 10 percent would lead to an increase in the score on the final of 1.35

percentage points, or 0.23 standard deviations. Overall our non-experimental estimate of the



                                               25
association between attendance and performance from our non-randomized analysis is consistent

with the previous observational literature.27 We find a somewhat smaller effect for the combined

final and midterm score (column 3) and a larger effect for the course grade (column 5).

        We contrast our non-experimental estimates with the experimental estimates for the final

exam in the even-numbered columns of Table 8. Comparing the effect of an 11 class increase in

attendance in the last row, the non-experimental estimates of the effect of attendance on

performance are from 2.5 times (for the combined midterm and final) to 4.7 times (for the course

grade) greater than our estimate based on the randomized design. Taken at face value, these

comparisons suggest that the non-experimental estimates are biased upwards, even after

controlling for GPA, SAT scores, and cumulative credits.               Students who choose not to attend

class may be less motivated, diligent, or organized than students that always attend even after

adjustment for these key observable determinants of performance.

        This interpretation of our results comes with three caveats. First, the non-experimental

extrapolations (including ours) all assume a linear effect of attendance on performance. The

effect may be concave, however, with smaller marginal increases in performance as more classes

are attended. Second, our required weekly pre-quizzes and post-quizzes may have reduced the

gains from class attendance relative to studies without such course requirements, since our

students had an incentive to interact with the material regularly even in the event of missed

classes. Third, we assume that attending one less class each week in the hybrid format is the

equivalent to missing one lecture in a course structured to present material over two lectures.

This also may not hold completely. To give a concrete example, consider a chapter on perfect


27
  The comparison comes with caveats. The online material for introductory economics posted for the class but also
available from the Internet more generally may lessen the importance of class attendance as compared to 10 to 20
years ago.


                                                       26
competition. In the traditional class, the first lecture of the week may cover short-run profit

maximization and derivation of the short-run supply curve. In the second lecture of the week,

students are exposed to the dynamics of competition and long-run equilibrium. In the hybrid

format we attempted to touch on all four topics in one lecture.



V.     Conclusion



       We found that students in a traditional lecture format of introductory microeconomics,

with twice as much face-to-face instruction, did modestly better than students in a hybrid version

of the same class.   The difference was equivalent to one question in a 40-question exam. We

found no differential effects by GPA or for those who are native English speakers, but suggestive

evidence that students in the hybrid format who worked did less well than their working

counterparts in the traditional format.

       We have improved on the existing literature in several important dimensions. First, we

had a 96 percent participation rate and an attrition rate of 10 percent that did not vary across

experimental treatments. Second, each of the two participating faculty taught one of each

format, which allowed us to control for faculty fixed effects, a potential source of heterogeneity.

Third, all students had access to the same lecture notes and online materials. This eliminated an

artificial and arguably unenforceable restriction of access to online materials for students in the

traditional class.   Lastly, our sample was large, with 725 student at the beginning of the

experiment and 656 at completion. Given the apparent success of the randomization, we have a

strong claim to internal validity.

           Our results are similar to those of Figlio, Rush and Yin (2013) who reported that students

in the live lecture of introductory economics scored a statistically significant 2.5 percentage

points higher on the average of three exams relative to those in the online section, adjusted for

covariates. Our point estimates are also within the 95 percent confidence intervals of the

difference between scores obtained by students in the hybrid and traditional statistics classes

studied by Bowen et al. (2013).

           Our findings pertain to large urban public universities in which the vast majority of

students commute. Fifty percent of participants in the study were transfer students to Baruch, 21

percent from community colleges within the City University of New York system, a population

is similar to that in Bowen et al. (2013).28 Given this population, our results are also relevant to

recent studies of online instruction at community colleges, because the vast majority of students

at Baruch also commute (Jaggars and Xu, 2011; Xu and Jaggars, 2013). In Washington State, Xu

and Jaggars (2013) reported that community college students scored a full grade lower in courses

delivered completely online relative to their counterparts who took courses in a traditional face-

to-face environment.           Differences in performance by format were much smaller in our study,

which is further evidence that purely online courses may be more challenging for students that

commute and work.

           The hybrid format was not costly to produce. The software available from publishers in

the introductory undergraduate courses is constantly improving, greatly facilitating the move to a

“flipped classroom.” Faculty can assign frequent homework and quizzes as well as provide

students with additional practice problems, videos and whiteboard supplements. Much of the

skill building of basic concepts can be done outside of the classroom, preserving class time for


28
     Indeed Baruch College was one of the six sites in the study by Bowen et al. (2013).

clarification of more complex concepts. The potential gains in faculty productivity as measured

by faculty compensation per student, as well as better use of limited classroom space, are

obvious sources of savings for large introductory classes traditionally delivered twice a week in a

limited number of lecture halls with multiple small-group recitations. Bowen et al. (2013)

estimate savings from a hybrid class based on labor costs alone to be between 36 and 57 percent.

Clearly more work on cost and savings from hybrid formats is needed.               Our study has

demonstrated that face-to-face instruction in large, introductory economics classes can be greatly

reduced if readily available technology is effectively applied, with little impact on student

performance.    We are confident that our findings are relevant for introductory classes in the

natural sciences, mathematics, statistics, and other social sciences.

Note: Outcome is the combined midterm plus final scaled to 100 points. Estimated with OLS. Heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors in parentheses. Significance levels are indicated by * <.10,
** <.05, *** <.01. Coefficients reported are for the interaction with Hybrid of the indicated category. All regressions also include a main effect for Hybrid and for the indicated categories. All
regressions include a dummy variable for Monday-Wednesday class meeting and a main effect for Hybrid. Regressions with covariates include, where appropriate Baruch GPA, Transfer, GPA, Verbal
SAT, Math SAT, Cumulative Credits, Age, indicator variables for Part-Time Student, Underclassman, Female, Asian, Black/Hispanic/Other, and Native Speaker plus indicator variables for missing
Baruch GPA, Transfer GPA, SAT scores, Race, and Native English Speaker. The reported p-values are from χ2 tests that the reported interactions with Hybrid are jointly equal to zero. The sample size
for each regression is 656. In columns (1) and (2) the measure used to stratify is the median of Baruch GPA/Predicted Baruch GPA. We use the Baruch GPA for students who have one, and predicted
Baruch GPA for students who do not have Baruch GPA, but have a Transfer GPA. Predicted Baruch GPA is calculated from a regression of Baruch GPA on a quadratic in Transfer GPA, a quadratic in
Age, Cumulative Credits, and indicators variables for Female and Underclassman for the 148 students who have both a Baruch GPA and a Transfer GPA. There are 51 students who have neither a

both a Baruch GPA and a Transfer GPA. There are 51 students who have neither a Baruch GPA nor a
Predicted Baruch GPA. The difference in median classes attended between the traditional and hybrid
sections was 11 (22 in the traditional, 11 in the hybrid); the difference in mean classes attended between
the traditional and hybrid formats was 11.01 (22.25 in the traditional and 10.24 in the hybrid).

    cost of advertising. If one company advertises while the other does not, the one that
    advertises attracts customers from the other. In this case, the company that advertises earns
    $60 million while the company that does not advertise earns only $30 million. What will the
    two companies do if they behave as individual profit maximizers?
a. Neither company will advertise.
b. Both companies will advertise.
c. One company will advertise, the other will not.
