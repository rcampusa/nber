Experience of and Lessons from Exchange Rate Regimes in Emerging Economies

JEL No. F3

                                           ABSTRACT

The paper reviews recent trends in thinking on exchange rate regimes. It begins by classifying

countries into regimes, noting the distinction between de facto and de jure regimes, but also noting

the low correlation among proposed ways of classifying the latter. The advantages of fixed exchange

rates versus floating are reviewed, including the recent evidence on the trade-promoting effects of

currency unions. Frameworks for tallying up the pros and cons include the traditional Optimum

Currency Area criteria, as well as some new criteria from the experiences of the 1990s. The Corners

Hypothesis may now be "peaking" as rapidly as it rose, in light of its lack of foundations. Empirical

evidence regarding the economic performance of different regimes depends entirely on the

classification scheme. A listing of possible nominal anchors alongside exchange rates observes that

each candidate has its own vulnerability, leading to the author's proposal to Peg the Export Price

(PEP). The concluding section offers some implications for East Asia.

                          Experience of and Lessons from
                   Exchange Rate Regimes in Emerging Economies

                                     Jeffrey A. Frankel



         Emerging market countries in Latin America, East Asia, and Eastern Europe
entered the 1990s with widely varying fundamentals. To over-generalize, Latin American
countries before the 1990s traditionally had low national savings rates, profligate fiscal
and monetary policies, and overvalued currencies, together with a large and growth-
inhibiting role of the government in the economy; however, most took very large steps in
the right direction in the 1990s. East Asian countries had, already for some time,
exhibited high national savings rates, greater monetary and fiscal discipline, and
appropriately valued currencies, together with institutions of financial structure and
government intervention that, though they differed from textbook market economics,
appeared to be, if anything, more successful than Western-style capitalism, until the
1990s. Eastern European countries all entered the 1990s with institutions that had become
universally discredited, but varied widely in their ability to establish macroeconomic
stability and to make the transition to capitalist institutions.

        Although these countries varied in their fundamentals—and varied further within
the geographic groupings—all ended the 1990s as victims of severe financial turbulence
in emerging markets. To name only the most spectacular cases, currency and financial
crises hit Mexico in 1994; Thailand, Republic of Korea, and Indonesia in 1997; Russia in
1998; Brazil in 1999; and Turkey and Argentina in 2001. In most of these cases, the crisis
had severe negative effects on economic growth. The causes of these crises have been
widely debated, but it is difficult to attribute them solely to profligate monetary and fiscal
policies because the East Asian countries had a strong record on this score, and Argentina
had also moved very far to establish macroeconomic discipline in the 1990s.

       Among other factors, exchange rate regimes have been implicated in most
accounts of how these countries got into trouble.

        Every one of the crisis victims named above was forced by large outflows to
abandon an exchange rate target and to move to a regime of greater exchange rate
flexibility. One school of thought has concluded that it was a mistake to have set explicit
exchange rate pegs, and that the solution lies in increased exchange rate flexibility in the
long term as well, perhaps in outright floating of the sort that Brazil and Mexico adopted
after their crises (e.g., Obstfeld and Rogoff 1995 or Larrain and Velasco 2001).

        Others have pointed out that none of the crises of the 1990s occurred in countries
that had in fact been following explicit policies of tight exchange rate pegs. It is true that
Thailand had been following a rather close de facto peg to the dollar over the 2 years
preceding the July 1997 crisis. But—now usually forgotten—Thailand had in the early
1990s been one of those East Asian countries widely said to assign a large weight to the
                                                                                                       4


yen in its basket,1 and was in 1997 still on a de jure basket peg. All the others had been
on intermediate regimes both de facto and de jure. Mexico, Indonesia, Russia, Brazil, and
Turkey had all been keeping their exchange rates within target zones (bands), often
combined with a preannounced rate of crawl. The Market Average Rate system of the
Republic of Korea (Korea) had been classified by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
as managed floating (and the US Treasury semiannual reports to Congress had in the
early 1990s pronounced that the Korean Government had stopped “manipulating” the
value of the won, by which it meant that Korea had supposedly begun to let the private
market determine the exchange rate)2. These arrangements are neither fixed nor floating,
but are properly denoted “intermediate regimes.”

        Accordingly, a second school of thought holds that it is precisely the looseness of
the commitment that gets the intermediate regimes into trouble, and that the prescribed
policy is a firm institutional commitment such as a currency board or the outright
abolition of the national currency, in order to buy absolute credibility for the central bank.
Examples include the currency boards of Hong Kong, China; Argentina (until 2001); and
some other small economies, particularly in Eastern Europe (Estonia, Lithuania,
Bulgaria); the dollarizers, old (Panama) as well as new (Ecuador, El Salvador,
Guatemala); and the 12 members of the European Monetary Union (EMU). Proponents
urge the virtues of currency boards or dollarization on emerging market countries
everywhere.

       The dominant conventional wisdom to emerge in the late 1990s was a third school
of thought: the corners hypothesis. This viewpoint is also variously called bipolarity,
hollowing out, the missing middle, and the hypothesis of the vanishing intermediate
regime. It neither insists that countries generally should float nor that countries generally
should institutionally fix. Rather, it says that countries generally should be (or are)
moving to one extreme or the other, that the lesson of the recent crises is just the
nonviability of intermediate regimes such as those followed in the crisis countries of the
1990s. Part IV of this paper discusses the corners hypothesis in more detail. It argues that
the hypothesis may start to drop out of favor in the aftermath of the experiences of
Argentina in 2001 and Brazil in 2002, as rapidly as it gained favor in the aftermath of the
1997-1998 East Asia crisis.

        Although newspaper opinion/editorial pieces often pretend that there is only one
valid side to an argument, economists are accustomed to thinking of everything as a
trade-off between competing advantages. It is important not to rush to a judgment over
the optimal exchange rate regime before listing pros and cons and then trying to add them
up. The author’s position is that all three categories of exchange rate regime—floating,
firm fixing, and intermediate regimes—are appropriate for some countries, and that the
choice of appropriate regime cannot be made independently of knowledge of the

the common view regarding links to the yen. More recent estimates of the implicit weights in the currency
baskets of East Asian countries are offered by Benassy-Quere (1999) and Ohno (1999).

circumstances facing the country in question. No single regime is right for all countries,
and even for a given country, it may be that no single regime is right at all times.3

        After part I of this paper enumerates alternative exchange rate regimes, part II
briefly reviews the advantages of fixed exchange rates, followed by the advantages of
floating exchange rates. Part III discusses frameworks for tallying up the advantages on
one side versus the other so that individual countries can make a decision; the traditional
framework is the theory of optimum currency areas, but new lessons came out of the
experience of the 1990s. Part IV discusses the rise (and possible fall) of the corners
hypothesis. Part V reviews some empirical evidence on the performance of alternative
regimes. Part VI surveys other possible nominal anchors, recognizing that for monetary
authorities not to target the exchange rate opens the question of whether they should
instead target something else, like the consumer price index (CPI), money supply,
nominal gross domestic product (GDP), price of gold, or (a newly proposed contender for
countries with specialized trade) the price of the export good. Part VII draws some
implications for East Asia and the possibility of a common peg.

Classifying Countries into Regimes

There are of course many more regimes than two, an entire continuum that can be arrayed
from most flexible to most rigidly fixed. I distinguish nine, grouped into the three broad
categories of floating, intermediate, and firmly fixed. The list follows.

A.            Floating corner
1.         Free floating
2.         Managed floating

B.         Intermediate regimes
3.     Band
   3a. Bergsten-Williamson target zone (fundamental equilibrium exchange rate)
   3b. Krugman-ERM target zone (fixed nominal central parity)
4.     Crawling peg
   4a. Indexed
   4b. Preannounced crawl (tablita, in Spanish)
5.     Basket peg
6.     Adjustable peg

C.            Firm fix corner
7.         Currency board
8.         Dollarization (or euro-ization)
9.         Monetary union

    There are many complications. Each of the intermediate regimes can itself range from
so flexible as to belong truly in the floating category, to so rigid as to belong truly to the
fixed corner. The relevant parameter in the case of the target zone is the width of the

3
    This position, while hardly momentous or novel, is the point made in Frankel (1999).
                                                                                            6


margins. In the case of the crawl, it is the speed of crawl; in the case of the basket, it is
the number of currencies in the basket and the extent to which the weights are publicly
announced; and in the case of the adjustable peg, it is the magnitude of the shock
necessary to trigger the change in the parity (the frequency of the contingency in a
formally modeled “escape clause”).

   In addition, the target zone and the crawl each have two prominent subclassifications:
one—deserving to be considered more flexible— in which the parity is adjusted in line
with ex post inflation; and one in which it is not, in order to retain some of the benefits of
a nominal anchor. To complicate things still further, the features of regimes 3-6 are not
mutually exclusive, but rather are regularly mixed and matched. In the language of
Williamson (1996, 1999, 2001), basket-band-crawl constitutes a single regime,
abbreviated BBC. Nevertheless, I have chosen to list them as four separate regimes in the
rough descending order of what seems to me their usual degree of flexibility.

    It is worth being specific about the boundary separating categories A and B, and that
separating categories B and C. The best classification scheme would define any managed
floats as intermediate regimes (category B) if and only if there is an explicit target around
which the central bank intervenes. Countries where the central bank intervenes in the
foreign exchange market occasionally, but without any announced target, must be
classified as floating; otherwise there will be no actual countries in the latter category.
Toward the other end of the spectrum, a commitment to a fixed exchange rate should be
classified in category C, firm fix, rather than category B, if and only if it goes beyond a
declared policy to an institutional commitment (e.g., a law mandating a currency board
that requires a parliamentary supermajority to reverse it).

De facto regimes differ from de jure

Placing actual countries into these categories is far more difficult than one who has never
tried it would guess. One reason is that there is a substantial difference between de jure
classifications and de facto classifications, between what countries say they do and what
they actually do.

       Most of those listed as floating in fact intervene in the foreign exchange market
frequently. As Calvo and Reinhart (2000) and Reinhart (2000) correctly observe,
“Countries that say they allow their exchange rate to float mostly do not.” Only the
United States (US) floats so purely that intervention is relatively rare.

       At the other end of the spectrum, most of those classified as pegged have in fact
had realignments within the last 10 years. Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995) report that as of
1995 only six major economies with open capital markets, in addition to a number of
very small economies, had maintained a fixed exchange rate for 5 years or longer. Klein
and Marion (1997) report that the mean duration of pegs among Western hemisphere
countries is about 10 months. The implication is that conventional pegs should be called
“adjustable pegs,” and classified as intermediate regimes.
                                                                                                               7


        Other methodologies have been suggested to classify countries in terms of the
regimes that they actually follow, for example, by observing the variability in exchange
rates and in reserve levels.4 Typically, however, the classification does not feel
persuasive or definitive. Worryingly, the attempts at de facto classification differ widely,
not just from the de jure classification, but from each other as well.5

Trends in popularity of regimes

We begin by considering the regimes currently followed by countries, as reported in the
classification system of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) International
Financial Statistics. This system does not follow countries’ self-description as slavishly
as it once did, but it is useful to keep in mind that it is nevertheless an official or de jure
classification.

        Forty-eight countries have altogether given up an independent currency, by means
of a firm institutional fix; 12 are the members of European Monetary Union (EMU), and
36 are developing countries or transition economies. Of those 36 countries,

•       8 are “dollarized” (Ecuador, El Salvador, Panama, four South Pacific island
    countries, and San Marino where the legal tender is not the dollar but the Italian lira),
•       20 are in monetary unions (6 in the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union and 14 in
    the CFA franc zone6, and
•       8 are in currency boards (now 7, with the departure of Argentina).

        Of the 36 firm-fixers among developing countries, only Ecuador and El Salvador
have given up national currencies recently. The others never had independent currencies
in the first place. (Guatemala is also apparently on the path to dollarization.) True, five
sovereign countries in the 1990s adopted currency boards that they still have: Estonia
(1992); Lithuania (1994); Bulgaria (1997); and Bosnia (1998);7 plus Hong Kong, China
(1983). If one includes the EMU 12, that adds up to about 20 countries that have chosen
ultra-fixed exchange rate arrangements in the past decade. Does this constitute evidence
that the heralded world trend toward a smaller number of currencies has begun? I will
argue that it does not.

       Ninety-eight members of the IMF are classified in an intermediate regime. Of
these 98 countries, 29 follow conventional fixed peg arrangements, and 10 follow basket

4
  Such as Calvo and Reinhart (2000) or Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2001).
5
  The latest, Reinhart and Rogoff (2002) proposes two new categories, “freely falling” and dual exchange
rates. This classification makes a big difference for the set of countries that remains behind in the traditional
categories. (We return to the question of de facto classification schemes, and the lack of correlation among
them, toward the end of the paper.)
6
  CFA = Communauté Financière de l’Afrique. Even the francophone countries of Africa finally
devalued against the French franc in 1994, though they have retained their currency union among
themselves.
7
  Two smaller countries, Brunei Darussalam and Djibouti, have had currency boards since
independence. In addition to these sovereign countries are some even smaller Caribbean island
dependencies, Democratic Republic of Timor Leste, and Montenegro, which is said to be
adopting a currency board too, or even declaring euros legal tender.
                                                                                           8


pegs. Both categories include some that claim as their regime managed floating while
exhibiting de facto pegs, but both categories should also be called “adjustable pegs.”
Sixteen follow bands or crawls (including five horizontal bands—four of them
developing countries and one, Denmark, a remnant of the European Monetary System;
four crawling pegs; and seven crawling bands). Forty-three are classified by the IMF as
“managed floating with no preannounced path for the exchange rate,” a category that may
sound like a float but which typically entails sufficient de facto targeting and intervention
that it should probably be classified as an intermediate regime.

        That leaves 40 countries that the IMF classifies as independently floating. Of
these, 9 are industrialized countries and 31 are developing, middle-income, or transition
countries. Thus, excluding industrialized countries, 36 can be counted as in the firm fix
corner, 98 classified as intermediate regimes, and 31 assigned to the floating corner.
(Since this compilation, two South American countries in early 2002 adopted some sort
of float, that cannot yet be characterized: Argentina, which left its currency board, and
Venezuela, which previously had a crawling band. For purposes of the three-way
classification, I will treat Argentina as trading places with Guatemala, and Venezuela as
remaining in the intermediate category.)

       There is a clear trend toward increased flexibility over the last 30 years. Some
claim that a trend from the intermediate regimes toward floating has its counterpart in
another trend from the intermediate regimes toward firm fixing. This is the claim that the
middle is hollowing out. It sometimes leads to the claim that there will be fewer
currencies in the future than in the past. Fischer (2001), for example, reports that between
1991 and 1999, the fraction of IMF members that followed intermediate regimes dropped
from 62% (98 countries) to 34% (63 countries). The fraction with hard pegs rose from
16% (25) to 24% (45), while the fraction floating rose from 23% (36) to 42% (77).
       There is nothing wrong with the Fischer statistics; expressing regime popularity in
terms of percentages of IMF membership is probably the relevant metric from the
viewpoint of the management of the organization. But it neglects that the membership of
the IMF, or of just about any other list of the world’s sovereign nations, has been
expanding over time. During the same two decades, when roughly two dozen countries
gave up monetary independence by adopting currency boards, dollarization, or EMU,
roughly the same number of new countries has been created, mainly by the breakup of the
Soviet Union. Each of these previously had shared its currency with neighbors. For this
reason, out of the list of regions that are today’s sovereign countries, roughly the same
number share the currency of another today as they did 20 years ago.

        Thus, only two developing countries that had their own sovereign currencies 10
or 20 years ago have given them up today (Ecuador and El Salvador), and only one more
has adopted a currency board (Bulgaria). So much for the famous trend toward the firm
fix corner! By this criterion, contrary to widespread impression, the facts do not support
the claim that developing countries are rapidly moving toward the corners and vacating
the middle.

       One might instead assert a sort of Markov stasis, in which independent currencies
are always being created, disappearing, and switching among regimes, but the overall
                                                                                             9


pool remains roughly steady. Masson (2001) statistically rejects the hypothesis that "hard
fix" and "hard float" are absorbing states, thus concluding empirically that intermediate
regimes are not in fact vanishing.


Advantages of Fixed Exchange Rates Versus Floating

The starting point in an evaluation of fixed versus floating exchange rates should be a
listing of the advantages of each. We consider here four advantages of fixing: providing a
nominal anchor to monetary policy, encouraging trade and investment, precluding
competitive depreciation, and avoiding speculative bubbles. We then consider four
advantages of floating: giving independence to monetary policy, allowing automatic
adjustment to trade shocks, retaining seigniorage and lender-of-last-resort capability, and
avoiding speculative attacks.

Advantages of fixed exchange rates

Of the four advantages of fixed exchange rates, academic economists tend to focus most
on the nominal anchor for monetary policy. The argument is that there can be an
inflationary bias when monetary policy is set with full discretion. A central bank that
wants to fight inflation can commit more credibly by fixing the exchange rate, or even
giving up its currency altogether. Workers, firm managers, and others who set wages and
prices then perceive that inflation will be low in the future because the currency peg will
prevent the central bank from expanding even if it wanted to. When workers and firm
managers have low expectations of inflation, they set their wages and prices accordingly.
The result is that the country is able to attain a lower level of inflation for any given level
of output. The nominal anchor argument, of course, presupposes that one is pegging to a
hard currency, one that exhibits strong monetary discipline, like the deutsche mark. After
the breakup of the Soviet Union, most of the 15 newly independent states wisely reached
the judgment that the Russian rouble did not offer a good nominal anchor. The strength of
the argument for basing monetary policy on an exchange rate target will also depend on
what alternative nominal anchors might be available; this topic will be explored in part
VI.

        Thirty years ago, the argument most often made against floating currencies was
the second one on the list: higher exchange rate variability would create uncertainty; this
risk would in turn discourage international trade and investment. Fixing the exchange rate
in terms of a large neighbor would eliminate exchange rate risk, and so encourage
international trade and investment. Going one step farther, and actually adopting the
neighbor's currency as one's own, would eliminate transactions costs as well and thus
promote trade and investment still more.

        Over most of the last few decades, academic economists have been skeptical of
this claim, for three reasons. First, in theory, exchange rate uncertainty is merely the
symptom of variability in economic fundamentals, so that if it is suppressed in the foreign
exchange market, it will show up somewhere else, e.g., in the variability of the price
level. Second, logically, anyone adversely affected by exchange rate variability—
                                                                                                10


importers, exporters, borrowers, and lenders—can hedge away the risk, using forward
markets. Third, empirically, it was hard to discern an adverse statistical effect from
increased exchange rate volatility on trade. But each of these arguments can be rebutted.
First, most exchange rate volatility in fact appears to be unrelated to macroeconomic
fundamentals. Second, many developing country currencies have no forward markets;
and even in those that do, there are costs to hedging (transactions costs plus the exchange
risk premium). Third, more recent econometric studies, based on large cross sections that
include many small and developing countries, have found stronger evidence of an effect
of exchange rate variability on trade (especially on a bilateral basis, where far more data
are available)8 than did earlier studies. Table 1 reports estimates of the stimulus to trade
and growth that individual developing countries would eventually experience if they were
to adopt the dollar or the euro as their currencies.

                                      [Table 1 goes about here]

         A third advantage of fixed exchange rates is that they prevent competitive
depreciation or competitive appreciation. Competitive depreciation can be viewed as an
inferior Nash noncooperative equilibrium, where each country tries in vain to win a trade
advantage over its neighbors. In such a model, fixing exchange rates can be an efficient
institution for achieving the cooperative solution. The architects of the Bretton Woods
system thought about the problem in terms of the “beggar thy neighbor” policies of the
1930s. The example can be updated by one possible interpretation of the notorious
contagion experienced in the crises of the 1990s. Each time one country in East Asia or
Latin America devalued, its neighbors were instantly put at a competitive disadvantage,
serving to transfer the balance of payments pressure to them (e.g., from Mexico to
Argentina in 1995, from Thailand to the rest of East Asia in 1997, and from Brazil to the
rest of South America in 1999). Many of them felt that the standard prescription to
devalue did not work, in an environment where their neighbors and competitors were
devaluing at the same time. If so, a cooperative agreement not to devalue might seem
called for.

        The final argument for fixed exchange rates is to preclude speculative bubbles of
the sort that pushed up the dollar in 1985 or the yen in 1995. As we already noted, some
exchange rate fluctuations appear utterly unrelated to economic fundamentals. This
observation then allows at least the possibility that, if the exchange rate fluctuations were
eliminated, there might in fact not be an outburst of fundamental uncertainty somewhere
else. Rather, the “bubble term in the differential equation” might simply disappear.

Advantages of floating exchange rates

As there are four advantages to fixed exchange rates, there are also four advantages to
flexible exchange rates.

      The leading advantage of exchange rate flexibility is that it allows the country to
pursue an independent monetary policy. The argument in favor of monetary

                                                                                                        11


independence, instead of constraining monetary policy by the fixed exchange rate, is the
classic argument for discretion, instead of rules. When the economy is hit by a
disturbance, such as a fall in demand for the goods it produces, the government would
like to be able to respond so that the country does not go into recession. Under fixed
exchange rates, monetary policy is always diverted, at least to some extent, to dealing
with the balance of payments. This single instrument can not be used to achieve both
internal balance and external balance. Under the combination of fixed exchange rates and
complete integration of financial markets, which for example characterizes EMU, the
situation is more extreme: monetary policy becomes altogether powerless to affect
internal balance. Under these conditions, the domestic interest rate is tied to the foreign
interest rate. An expansion in the money supply has no effect: the new money flows out
of the country via a balance-of-payments deficit, just as quickly as it is created. In the
face of an adverse disturbance, the country must simply live with the effects. After a fall
in demand, the recession may last until wages and prices are bid down, or until some
other automatic mechanism of adjustment takes hold, which may be a long time. By
freeing up the currency to float, on the other hand, the country can respond to a recession
by means of monetary expansion and depreciation of the currency. This stimulates the
demand for domestic products and returns the economy to desired levels of employment
and output more rapidly than would be the case under the automatic mechanisms of
adjustment on which a fixed-rate country must rely.

        The unfortunate reality is that few developing countries have been able to make
effective use of discretionary monetary policy. But even if one gives up on deliberate
changes in monetary policy, there is a second advantage of floating: that it allows
automatic adjustment to trade shocks. The currency responds to adverse developments in
the country’s export markets or other shifts in the terms of trade by depreciating, thus
achieving the necessary real depreciation even in the presence of sticky prices or wages.

        The third advantage of an independent currency is that the government retains
two important advantages of an independent central bank: seigniorage and lender-of-last-
resort ability. The central bank’s ability to act as a lender of last resort for the banking
system depends to a degree on the knowledge that it can create as much money as
necessary to bail out banks in difficulty. For a while it was claimed that a country that
moved to the firm-fix corner and allowed foreign banks to operate inside its borders, like
Argentina, would not need a lender of last resort because the foreign parents of local
banking subsidiaries would bail them out in time of difficulty. Unfortunately, Argentina’s
experience in 2001 has now disproved this claim.

        Recall that the fourth argument for stabilizing the exchange rate arose from an
increasingly evident disadvantage of free floating: occasional speculative bubbles
(possibly rational, possibly not) that eventually burst. However, there is a corresponding
fourth argument for flexibility that arises from an increasingly evident disadvantage of
pegging: a tendency toward borrowers’ effectively unhedged exposure in foreign
currency (possibly rational, possibly not9), ending badly in speculative attacks and
9
  Some who have recently argued for floating on these grounds imply that it would be beneficial to introduce
gratuitous volatility into the exchange rate to discourage unhedged borrowing in foreign currency.

multiple equilibrium. Overvaluation, excessive volatility, and crashes are possible in
either regime.


Frameworks for Tallying up the Advantages

Which factors are likely to dominate, the advantages of fixed exchange rates or the
advantages of floating? There is not one right answer for all countries. The answer must
depend, in large part, on the characteristics of the country in question. One example of an
important criterion is the origin of economic disturbances. If the country is subject to
many external disturbances, such as fluctuations in foreigners' eagerness to buy domestic
goods and domestic assets (perhaps arising from business cycle fluctuations among the
country's neighbors), then it is more likely to want to float its currency. In this way, it can
insulate itself from the foreign disturbances, to some degree. On the other hand, if the
country is subject to many internal disturbances, then it is more likely to want to peg its
currency.

Definition of Optimum Currency Area
Many of the country characteristics that are most important to the fixed-versus-floating
question are closely related to the size and openness of the country. This observation
brings us to the theory of the optimum currency area (OCA).10

         Countries that are highly integrated with each other with respect to trade and other
economic relationships are more likely to constitute an OCA. An OCA is a region for
which it is optimal to have its own currency and its own monetary policy. This definition,
though in common use, may be too broad to be of optimum utility. It can be given some
more content by asserting the generalization that smaller units tend to be more open and
integrated with their neighbors than larger units. Then an OCA can be defined as a region
that is neither so small and open that it would be better-off pegging its currency to a
neighbor, nor so large that it would be better-off splitting into subregions with different
currencies. Even to the extent that corner solutions are appropriate for given countries,
the optimal geographic coverage for a common currency is likely to be intermediate in
size: larger than a city and smaller than the entire planet.

The Traditional OCA Criteria

Why do the OCA criteria depend on integration? The advantages of fixed exchange rates
increase with the degree of economic integration, while the advantages of flexible
exchange rates diminish. This is clearest when integration is defined as openness to trade,
but is also true for other sorts of integration.

Openness. Recall the two big advantages of fixing the exchange rate that we identified
earlier: (i) to reduce transactions costs and exchange rate risk that can discourage trade
and investment, and (ii) to provide a credible nominal anchor for monetary policy. If
traded goods constitute a large proportion of the economy, then exchange rate uncertainty

10
     The issues are surveyed by Tavlas (1992), and also reviewed by Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1994).
                                                                                                 13


is a more serious issue for the country in the aggregate.11 Such an economy may be too
small and too open to have an independently floating currency.

Labor mobility. One OCA criterion offered in the original Mundell (1961) article was
labor mobility, here defined as the ease of labor movement between the country in
question and its neighbors. If the economy is highly integrated with its neighbors by this
criterion, then workers may be able to respond to a local recession by moving across the
border to get jobs, so there is less need for a local monetary expansion or devaluation.

Fiscal cushions. The existence of a federal fiscal system to transfer funds to regions that
suffer adverse shocks offers another way to help mitigate macroeconomic fluctuations in
the absence of an independent currency.

Symmetry. To the extent that shocks to the two economies are correlated, monetary
independence is not needed in any case: the two can share a monetary expansion in
tandem.

Political willingness to accept neighbors’ policies To the extent that domestic residents
have economic priorities—especially on fighting inflation versus unemployment—that
are similar to those of their neighbors, there will be less need for a differentiated response
to common shocks.

Criteria of the 1990s

The introduction of currency board-like arrangements in Hong Kong, China (1983);
Argentina (1991); Estonia (1992); Lithuania (1994); Bulgaria (1997); Bosnia (1998); and
two smaller countries constituted a resurgence in their use worldwide. A currency board
can help to create a credible policy environment by removing from the monetary
authorities the option of printing money to finance government deficits. Argentina, for
example, at first benefited from such credibility. Argentina was prompted to adopt a
currency board (which it called the convertibility plan) because of a dramatic
hyperinflation in the 1980s and the absence of a credible monetary authority. After 1991,
Argentina became a model of price stability and achieved laudable growth rates, aside
from setbacks such as the Mexican peso “tequila”-induced recession in 1995, from which
Argentina soon rebounded strongly. By most accounts, the currency board was working
for Argentina.

        And yet Argentina never did fit well the traditional OCA criteria. It is not
particularly small or open, or subject to high labor mobility or close correlation with the
US economy. A new set of criteria to supplement or even replace the OCA framework
were proposed, relevant particularly to the decision to adopt an institutional commitment
to a fixed rate. Whereas the older framework had to do with trade and cyclical stability,
the new characteristics had to do with international financial markets and credibility. The
additional criteria12 follow:

11
     This is the rationale for the openness criterion originally suggested by McKinnon (1963).
12
     Similar lists are also offered by Williamson (1996) and Larrain and Velasco (2001).
                                                                                                            14


     •   a strong (even desperate) need to import monetary stability, due to either a history
         of hyperinflation, an absence of credible public institutions, unusually large
         exposure to nervous international investors, or instability arising from a
         dangerous political environment;

     •   a desire for further close integration with a particular neighbor or trading partner
         (which has the added advantage of enhancing the political credibility of the
         commitment);

     •   an economy in which the foreign currency is already widely used;13

     •   access to an adequate level of reserves;

     •   rule of law; and

     •   a strong, well-supervised, and regulated financial system.

    Currency board supporters pushed for its wider use in the crises of the 1990s—in
particular, for Indonesia, Russia, and Ukraine. Proclaiming a currency board does not
automatically guarantee the credibility of the fixed rate peg. Little credibility is gained
from putting an exchange rate peg into the law, in a country where laws are not heeded or
are changed at will. Beyond the rule of law, a currency board is unlikely to be successful
without the solid fundamentals of adequate reserves, fiscal discipline, and a strong and
well-supervised financial system.


The Rise and fall of the Corners Hypothesis


The debate over exchange rate regimes is an old one. And yet, a genuinely new element
was thrown into the mix in the late 1990s. This is the proposition that countries are—or
should be—moving to the corner solutions. They are said to be opting either, on the one
hand, for full flexibility, or, on the other hand, for rigid institutional commitments to
fixed exchange rates, in the form of currency boards or full monetary union with the
dollar or euro. It is said that the intermediate exchange rate regimes are no longer
feasible. The target zones, crawls, basket pegs, and pegs-adjustable-under-an-implicit-
escape-clause are going the way of the dinosaurs. A corollary of this theory is that the
number of independent currencies in the world is declining, perhaps with a rising fraction
of the world accounted for by a few large regional blocs built around the dollar, the euro,
and perhaps the yen or some other currency in Asia.


13
   In a country that is already partially dollarized, devaluation is of little use. If many wages and prices are
already tied to the dollar, they will simply rise by the same amount as the exchange rate. If liabilities are
already denominated in dollars—and, in the case of international liabilities, foreign creditors in emerging
markets generally insist on this—then devaluation may bankrupt domestic borrowers. Such initial conditions
are discussed as criteria for dollarization by Calvo (1999) and Hausmann et al. (1999).
                                                                                                  15


       Surely a proposition that has become such conventional wisdom as the vanishing
intermediate regime has a distinguished intellectual pedigree? Not really.

Intellectual origins

What is known about the origins of the hypothesis of the vanishing intermediate regime?
Is it new? A sixteenth century proverb says, “There is nothing new under the sun.”14 A
precursor for the corners hypothesis is Friedman (1953, p.164): “In short, the system of
occasional changes in temporarily rigid exchange rates seems to me the worst of two
worlds: it provides neither the stability of expectations that a genuinely rigid and stable
exchange rate could provide in a world of unrestricted trade…nor the continuous
sensitivity of a flexible exchange rate.” Yet the pure corners hypothesis is more recent
than that; such intermediate regimes as target zones did not become popular until the
1980s and 1990s. The earliest known explicit reference to the corners hypothesis is by
Eichengreen (1994). The context was not emerging markets, but rather the European
exchange rate mechanism (ERM). In the ERM crisis of 1992-1993, Italy, the United
Kingdom, and others were forced to devalue or drop out altogether, and the bands had
been subsequently widened substantially so that France could stay in. This crisis
suggested to some that the strategy that had been planned previously—a gradual
transition to the EMU, where the width of the target zone was narrowed in a few steps—
might not be the best way to proceed after all. Crockett (1994) made the same point.
Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995) concluded, “A careful examination of the genesis of
speculative attacks suggests that even broad-band systems in the current EMS style pose
difficulties, and that there is little, if any, comfortable middle ground between floating
rates and the adoption by countries of a common currency.” The lesson that “the best way
to cross a chasm is in a single jump” was seemingly borne out subsequently, when the
leap from wide bands to EMU proved successful in 1998–1999.

        After the East Asia crises of 1997–1998, the hypothesis of the vanishing
intermediate regime was applied to emerging markets. In the effort to “reform the
financial architecture” so as to minimize the frequency and severity of crises in the
future, the proposition was rapidly adopted by the financial establishment as the new
conventional wisdom.


For example, Summers (1999a):

           “There is no single answer, but in light of recent experience what is perhaps
           becoming increasingly clear—and will probably be increasingly reflected in the
           advice that the international community offers—is that in a world of freely
           flowing capital there is shrinking scope for countries to occupy the middle ground
           of fixed but adjustable pegs. As we go forward from the events of the past
           eighteen months, I expect that countries will be increasingly wary about
           committing themselves to fixed exchange rates, whatever the temptations these
           may offer in the short run, unless they are also prepared to dedicate policy

14
     The proverb is based on Ecclesiastes, Ch. 1, v. 9: “…there is no new thing under the sun.”
                                                                                         16


          wholeheartedly to their support and establish extra-ordinary domestic safeguards
          to keep them in place.”

Other high-profile examples include Eichengreen (1999, p.104-105), Minton-Beddoes
(1999), and Council on Foreign Relations (1999, p.87). The G-7 (Group of Seven)
Finance Ministers agreed that the IMF should not in the future bail out countries that get
into trouble by following an intermediate regime, though it qualified the scope of the
generalization a bit, for example, by allowing a possible exception for “systemically”
important countries.
        It is not only the international financial establishment that has decided
intermediate regimes are nonviable. The Meltzer report, commissioned by the US
Congress to recommend fundamental reform of international financial institutions,
adopted the proposition as well: “The Commission recommends that …the IMF should
use its policy consultations to recommend either firmly fixed rates (currency board,
dollarization) or fluctuating rates” (Meltzer 2000, p.8).

        The Economist (1999, p.15-16) was thus probably right when it wrote that “Most
academics now believe that only radical solutions will work: either currencies must float
freely, or they must be tightly tied (through a currency board or, even better, currency
unions).” But the proposition remains yet to be demonstrated.

        It is true that for the middle-income emerging market countries, all of which have
been exposed to substantial financial volatility in recent years, the casualties among
intermediate regimes have been high. Mexico, Thailand, Korea, Indonesia, Russia,
Brazil, and Turkey were each forced by speculative attack to abandon a sort of basket or
band. The other countries that abandoned band arrangements in the late 1990s also
included the Czech Republic (27 May 1997), Ecuador (4 March 1999), Chile (3
September 1999), and Colombia (26 September 1999).15 While most of these policy
changes took place under great pressure, Chile was not facing tremendous speculative
pressure when it made its switch. Indonesia abandoned the bands before the full crisis
hit. This move won praise at the time. Even though the country was soon thereafter hit
with the worst of the Asian crises, commentators today tend to include Indonesia in the
list of data points that is supposed to demonstrate the superiority of the floating option
over the band option.
        At the same time, Hong Kong, China, in Asia and Argentina in Latin America, the
two economies with currency boards, were the ones that got through the 1990s
successfully, judged by the (very particular) criterion of avoiding being forced into
increased exchange rate flexibility. As a statement of observed trends, at least, the set of
emerging market countries in the late 1990s did seem to bear out the claimed movement
toward the corners. It seems intuitively right that these countries, facing finicky
international investors and rapidly disappearing foreign exchange reserves, had little
alternative but to abandon their pegs and baskets and bands and crawls and move to a
float, unless they were prepared to go to the opposite corner. But this proposition is in
need of a rationale.

                  Should countries be moving toward the corners? We saw in part II that a majority
          of developing countries still follow intermediate regimes. Do they have good reasons for
          their choices? Close to the center of the economists’ creed is that interior solutions are
          more likely to be optimal—for the interesting questions—compared with corner
          solutions.

          Lack of theoretical foundations for the corners hypothesis

          What is the analytical rationale for the hypothesis of the disappearing intermediate
          regime (or the “missing middle”)? Surprisingly, none currently exists.

                  At first glance, it appears to be a corollary to the principle of the Impossible
          Trinity.16 That principle says that a country must give up one of three goals: exchange
          rate stability, monetary independence, and financial market integration. It cannot have all
          three simultaneously. If one adds the observation that financial markets are steadily
          becoming more and more integrated internationally, that forces the choice down to giving
          up on exchange rate stability or giving up on monetary independence.

                   This is not the same thing, however, as saying one cannot give up both complete
          stability and complete independence, that one cannot have half-stability and half-
          independence in monetary policy. Economists tend to believe in interior solutions for
not in    most problems. In the closed-economy context, Rogoff (1985) derived the optimal

raphic
data               There is nothing in existing theory, for example, that prevents a country from
          pursuing an exchange rate target zone of moderate width. The elegant line of target-zone
          theory begun by Krugman (1991), in which speculation helped stabilize the currency,
          always assumed perfect capital mobility. Similarly, there is nothing that prevents the
          government from pursuing a managed float in which half of every fluctuation in demand
          for its currency is accommodated by intervention and half is allowed to be reflected in the
          exchange rate. (To model this, one need only introduce a “leaning against the wind”
          central bank reaction function into a standard monetary model of exchange rate
          determination.) And there is nothing that prevents a country from pursuing a peg with an
          escape clause contingent on exogenous shocks or, more practically, a peg that is
          abandoned whenever there is a shock large enough to use up half its reserves.
                   Another justification that has been offered for the corners hypothesis is that when
          a government establishes any sort of exchange rate target, as did the East Asian countries,
          its banks and firms foolishly underestimate the possibility of a future break in the



          16
             Summers (1999b, p. 326) is explicit: “…the core principle of monetary economics is a trilemma: that
          capital mobility, an independent monetary policy, and the maintenance of a fixed exchange rate objective
          are mutually incompatible. I suspect this means that as capital market integration increases, countries will be
          forced increasingly to more pure floating or more purely fixed exchange rate regimes.”
                                                                                                                   18


currency value.17 As a result, they incur large unhedged dollar liabilities abroad. When a
devaluation occurs, their domestic-currency revenues are inadequate for servicing their
debts, and so they go bankrupt, with devastating consequences for the economy.
        “It follows that in a world of high capital mobility there are only two feasible
        approaches to exchange rate policy. One is not just to peg the exchange rate, but
        to lock it in – the Argentine strategy….The vast majority of countries will … have
        to follow the other alternative of allowing their currencies to fluctuate. If the
        exchange rate moves regularly, banks and firms will have an incentive to hedge
        their foreign exposures…” (Eichengreen 1999, p.105).

There is little doubt that the focus on unhedged foreign-currency debt describes
accurately how the 1997–1998 devaluations contributed to recessions in East Asia. But
the argument, as stated, has some weaknesses. First, it appears to depend on irrationality
on the part of banks and firms. Second, it appears to imply that a country would be better-
off by gratuitously introducing extra noise into the exchange rate, to deter borrowers from
incurring unhedged dollar liabilities. This seems unlikely to be right. Third is the point
emphasized by Ricardo Hausmann: foreigners are unwilling to take open positions in the
currencies of emerging-market countries.18 Thus the admonition to avoid borrowing in
dollars is to some extent an admonition to avoid borrowing at all. It may well be that this
is the right road to go down, that exchange rate volatility is a way to put some sand in the
wheels of the excessive capital movements, and that a lower volume of total debt is a
good outcome. But if this is the argument, the proponents should be explicit about it. In
any case, it seems doubtful that this argument could be captured by conventional models.
Recall that Tobin’s original motivation for proposing to put sand in the wheels of
international capital movement was to reduce exchange rate volatility!

        A third possible justification is that governments that adopt an exchange rate
target, and sometime later experience a major reversal of capital inflows, tend to wait too
long before abandoning the target. As of 1998, we thought we had learned that the one
thing an emerging-market government can do to minimize the eventual pain from a
currency crisis is to try to devalue early enough (or else raise interest rates early enough,
as would happen automatically under a currency board—anything to adjust, rather than
try to finance an ongoing deficit). Mexico, Thailand, and Korea made the mistake of
waiting too long until reserves ran very low, so that by the time of the devaluation there
was no good way out, no combination of interest rates and exchange rate that would
simultaneously satisfy the financing constraint externally and prevent recession
domestically. But exiting from an exchange rate target can be difficult politically. The
lesson is drawn that, to avoid this difficulty, governments should either adopt a rigid




17
   The version of this argument in Eichengreen (1999, p.104) overstates the extent to which the East Asians
had “a stated commitment to the peg,” as most commentators have done as well. In fact, as already noted,
few of the East Asian countries had explicit dollar pegs.
18
   He calls this the “original sin.” The term is not meant to imply that the fault lies in policy failings of the local
government. An admonition to hedge the dollar exposure is not helpful; someone has to take the other side
of the futures contract, and this will be difficult in the aggregate if foreigners are unwilling to take the open
position.
                                                                                                         19


institutional fixed-rate commitment (as did Ecuador) or, if not prepared to do that,
abandon the peg early.19
         On this basis, when Brazil in the autumn of 1998 delayed the seemingly inevitable
jettisoning of the exchange rate target that remained from its real plan, many thought this
would be a repeat of the earlier mistakes. Instead, when the devaluation finally came in
January 1999, Brazil’s trade balance improved sharply, the lack of confidence subsided,
and output and employment subsequently performed far better than in neighboring
Argentina. Thus, it is more difficult to generalize from recent experience than widely
believed. Furthermore, if we are to use government reluctance to exit a target
arrangement as the basis of a model of the nonviability of intermediate regimes, it seems
that we would again require some sort of irrationality (or political constraints20) on the
part of policy makers.

        Thus, each of the three arguments offered— the impossible trinity, the dangers of
unhedged dollar liabilities, and the political difficulty of exiting—contains some
important truth. But none seems able to stand as a theoretical rationale for the superiority
of the corners solutions over the intermediate regimes. Perhaps the corners hypothesis,
then, is just a misplaced manifestation of the temptation to believe that the grass is always
greener somewhere else, in this case, in the corners of the pasture?

        Frankel et al. (2000) offer another possible reason to favor the firm fix corner:
verifiability. Central banks announce intermediate targets such as exchange rates so that
the public can judge from observed data whether they are following the policy
announced. The general point of that paper is that simple regimes are more verifiable by
market participants than complicated ones. Of the various intermediate regimes (managed
float, peg with escape clause, etc.), that paper focuses on basket pegs with bands.
Statistically, it takes a surprisingly long span of data to distinguish such a regime from a
floating exchange rate. We apply the econometrics, first, to the example of Chile and,
second, by performing Monte Carlo simulations. The amount of data required to verify
the declared regime may exceed the length of time during which the regime is
maintained. The amount of information necessary increases with the complexity of the
regime, including the width of the band and the number of currencies in the basket.

        Although Frankel et al. (2000) may have convinced a few people that BBC
regimes are not as verifiable as previously thought, it has not been accepted as a
theoretical rationale for the corners hypothesis. The model to support the proposition is
yet to be designed.

      In the author’s view, the Argentine crisis of 2001 dealt a severe blow to the
conventional view that a country that was willing to make a firm and sincere institutional
commitment to a rigidly fixed exchange rate, as under a currency board, could thereby

and Israel are two other countries who are said to have “exited” successfully from exchange rate targets by
doing so sufficiently early. But this has not always worked. When Indonesia in 1997 or Turkey in 2000 built
in some extra flexibility, it did them little good.

   Governments may have an incentive to postpone devaluations until after elections. See Stein and Streb

import credibility, and achieve convergence in price levels and interest rates. It has
thereby also dealt a severe blow to the corners hypothesis. The situation is far worse than
the remarkable fact that a supposedly ironclad fix came undone in a short period of time.
Argentina’s 1999–2002 recession has been so severe as to fully reverse the very good
income gains during the heyday of the currency board, 1991–1998. If the average growth
rates reported in the next section were updated, it seems likely that the entire currency
board category would be pulled down substantially.

         There will be those who will say that the events of 2001 merely prove that
Argentina did not go far enough, that it should have gone all the way to full dollarization.
But the example of Ecuador is instructive. Three years after its move to full dollarization,
inflation still exceeds 20%. True, Ecuador devalued sharply before it decided to dollarize,
so that much of the increase in the price level could be interpreted as catching up to
purchasing power parity (PPP). But there are two disturbing points: (i) the process has
taken 3 years, and inflation is still there; and (ii) apparently the currency is now
overvalued in real terms. Many economists have lost their ability to be surprised by the
realities of slow price adjustment, inertial inflation, and failures of PPP. Nevertheless,
that such imperfections of the goods market can remain so severe in a dollarized
economy means that the transforming benefits of dollarization (and the realism of a
forward-looking expectations theory) have been greatly oversold. Furthermore, Ecuador’s
interest rates have not converged to US interest rates any better than did Argentina’s
interest rates in the 1990s.

        Perhaps Ecuador is too small a country to serve as the basis of generalization. But
it is now probably the largest of the developing countries to be in the institutionally fixed
corner. To say that very small open economies must decide whether or not to give up
their currencies is true. But the firm-fix zealots certainly had in mind something of
general applicability, as did even the mainstream proponents of the corners hypothesis.
That no moderate-size emerging market country has successfully adopted a currency
board or dollarization must cast doubts on the strength of the alleged trend.

         Meanwhile many developing countries, especially in East Asia, have quietly been
moving back in the direction of de facto intermediate regimes. Malaysia has an exchange
rate target (aided, at least initially in 1998, by capital controls). Even the star floaters,
Mexico and Brazil, have started intervening in the foreign exchange market again. The
latter country was under severe financial pressure at the time of writing (August 2002);
the IMF responded with a new program that deliberately increased the central bank’s
ability to intervene in the foreign exchange market.

Empirical evidence on the performance of regimes

Because there are so many pros and cons to exchange rate regimes, there have been few
attempts at an overall empirical evaluation of their performance. The estimates reported
in Table 1 will not serve, for example, because they are designed to capture only one of
many effects on growth (the stimulus that common currencies give to trade). They leave
out the potential advantages of countercyclical stabilization under flexible exchange
                                                                                             21


rates, or long-term price stability under fixed exchange rates. Here we review three recent
attempts to evaluate overall performance that have received a lot of attention.

         Ghosh et al. (2000) compared the economic performance of currency boards, other
pegs, and floating exchange rates, with countries placed into regimes by the IMF’s de jure
classification system. The upper panel of Table 2 summarizes their finding with respect to
the growth rate. The currency boards grew the most rapidly, on average, by a considerable
margin. The average growth rates of the floaters and the regular pegs are fairly close
together; which is higher depending on whether one looks at growth in total income or in
income per capita. Long-term growth, of course, depends on many variables besides the
exchange rate regime, such as size, lagged income, the investment rate, population growth,
openness, and political stability. The authors control for such determinants in a regression
and get similar results. Again currency boards perform the best, followed by floaters and
then by noncurrency board pegs.

                                         [Table 2 about here]

         Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2002) go through a similar exercise, but with
countries classified among regimes based on their de facto classification system explained
earlier. They are interested in the three-way distinction float, fix, and intermediate, shown in
the middle panel of Table 2. When they use the IMF’s classification system, the
intermediate regimes perform the best. But when they use their own de facto system (LYS),
the ranking precisely reverses. Now the floaters grow the most rapidly. When they run
regressions to condition growth rates on standard determinants, they get similar answers to
the unconditional averages: according to the IMF classification, the intermediate regimes do
the best, while according to the LYS classification, the intermediate regimes do the worse,
and the floaters do the best.

         As already mentioned, Reinhart and Rogoff (2002) suggest breaking out countries
that have dual or multiple exchange rates, as a separate category. But for the average growth
rates, it does not seem to make very much difference. Among the remaining categories, the
ranking of the growth rates is almost the same as if one took the IMF classification without
breaking out dual rates. Countries with limited flexibility come in first, and floaters come in
last.
         Three attempts, three different answers. The IMF classification says that
intermediate regimes grow the fastest, the Ghosh et al (2000) classification claims that
currency boards do, and the LYS classification assigns floaters that honor. The differences
appear to have less to do with methodology (what is controlled for) or sample (time period
or set of countries), than with the classification scheme with which each starts. Table 3
shows that the alternative de facto regime classification regimes that have been proposed are
surprisingly uncorrelated with each other, quite aside from the correlation with de jure
classification. This confirms that the distinctions among exchange rate regimes, which seem
so clear-cut when building theories, turn out to be far messier in reality.

       [Table 3 about here]
                                                                                          22


Other possible nominal anchors

Many central banks would like to convince their citizens to expect no inflation. Without
high expectations of inflation, workers will ask for lower wages, firms will accept lower
prices, and investors will demand lower interest rates. As a consequence, the central bank
can achieve any given level of output and employment with a low rate of money creation
and inflation. The question is how to convince the public to lower its expectations of
inflation. The day is past when it is enough for the central bank to proclaim its firm
intention to pursue a low rate of money creation and inflation. Such announcements are
not necessarily considered credible.

         Governments can achieve credibility by tying their hands in some way so that in
the future they cannot follow expansionary policies even if they want to. Otherwise, they
may be tempted in a particular period (such as an election year) to reap the short-run
gains from expansion, knowing that the major inflationary costs will not be borne until
the future. A central bank that would like to constrain itself so that in the future it can
resist the political pressures and economic temptations of expansion is like Odysseus in
the Greek myth. As his ship was approaching the rocks from where the seductive sirens
lured weak-willed sailors to their doom, Odysseus had his sailors tie him to the mast.

        How can a central bank make a binding commitment to refrain from excessive
money creation? It can tie its hands by a rule, a public commitment to fix a nominal
magnitude. Possible candidates for nominally anchored monetary regimes include
monetarism, a gold standard, inflation targeting, nominal income targeting, and exchange
rate pegs. In each case, the central bank is deliberately constrained by a rule setting
monetary policy so as to fix a particular magnitude—the price of gold, the money supply,
the inflation rate, nominal income, or the exchange rate. Monetary policy is automatically
tightened if the magnitude in question is in danger of rising above the pre-set target, and
is automatically loosened if the magnitude is in danger of falling below the target. The
goal of such nominal anchors is to guarantee price stability.

        Preventing excessive money growth and inflation is the principal “pro” argument
for fixing the price of gold or some other nominal anchor. What, then, are the “con”
arguments? The overall argument against the rigid anchor is that a strict rule prevents
monetary policy from changing in response to the needs of the economy. The general
problem of mismatch between the constraints of the anchor and the needs of the economy
can take three forms: (i) loss of monetary independence, (ii) loss of automatic adjustment
to export shocks, and (iii) extraneous volatility. First, under a free-floating currency, a
country has monetary independence. In a recession, when unemployment is temporarily
high and real growth temporarily low, the central bank can respond by increasing money
growth, lowering interest rates, depreciating the currency, and raising asset prices, all of
which to mitigate the downturn. Under a pegged currency, however, the central bank
loses that sort of freedom. It must let recessions run their course. The second point is that
even if the central bank lacks the reflexes to pursue a timely discretionary monetary
policy, under a floating exchange rate, a deterioration in the international market for a
country’s exports should lead to an automatic fall in the value of its currency. The
resulting stimulus to production will mitigate the downturn even without any deliberate
                                                                                                     23


action by the government. Again, this mechanism is normally lost under a rigid nominal
anchor.

        A third consideration makes the problem still more difficult. If a country has
rigidly linked its monetary policy to some nominal anchor, exogenous fluctuations in that
anchor will create gratuitous fluctuations in the country’s monetary conditions that may
not be positively correlated with the needs of that particular economy.

       Each of the various magnitudes that are candidates for nominal anchor has its own
characteristic sort of extraneous fluctuations that can wreck havoc on a country’s
monetary system.

          •    Fixed exchange rate. Under a fixed exchange rate, fluctuations in the value of
               the particular currency to which the home country is pegged can produce
               needless volatility in the country’s international price competitiveness. For
               example, the appreciation of the dollar from 1995 and 2001 was also an
               appreciation for whatever currencies were linked to the dollar. Regardless of
               the extent to which one considers the late-1990s dollar appreciation to have
               been based in the fundamentals of the US economy, there was no necessary
               connection to the fundamentals of smaller dollar-linked economies. The
               problem was particularly severe for some far-flung economies that had
               adopted currency boards over the preceding decade: Hong Kong, China;
               Argentina; and Lithuania.

          •    Monetarism. Under a rule that fixes the rate of growth of the money supply,
               fluctuations in the public’s demand for money or in the behavior of the
               banking system can directly produce gratuitous fluctuations in the interest rate
               and thereby in the real economy. Such velocity shocks may be particularly
               large in developing countries undergoing financial liberalization.21

          •    Inflation targeting. The current fashion is targeting the price level or inflation
               rate. Inflation targeting was adopted in the early 1990s by such countries as
               Australia, Canada, Finland, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, and United
               Kingdom .22 After 1997, some important emerging market countries followed
               suit: Brazil, Chile, Czech Republic, Israel, Poland, and South Africa. East
               Asian countries that have moved in this direction include Indonesia, Korea,
               and Philippines.23 Relative to M1 targeting, a key advantage of inflation
               targeting is the offsetting of velocity shocks. But, as the proponents recognize,
               the inflation target may have to be abandoned in the face of large supply
               shocks, such as oil price increases facing an oil-importing country. The


21
     E.g., Dekle and Pradhan (1997).

22
   Among many possible references on inflation targeting generally are Svensson (1995), Bernanke et al
(1999), and Loayza and Soto (2002).
23
   Proponents of the arrangement for developing countries include Mishkin (2000) and Debelle (2001). But
Masson et al. (1997) argue that developing countries may not be well-suited to inflation targeting.
                                                                                                              24


                alternative of continuing to set monetary policy so as to prevent a surge in the
                price level would imply a needlessly severe recession.

            •   Nominal income targeting. The need for robustness with respect to velocity
                shocks and import price shocks, respectively, is used to argue the superiority
                of nominal income targeting over money targeting and inflation targeting.24
                But nominal income targeting, even as a proposal, has received less attention
                in recent years and most proponents have industrialized countries in mind
                rather than developing countries. On one hand, McKibbin and Singh (2000)
                argue that nominal income targeting is particularly appropriate for developing
                countries because they face large supply shocks. On the other hand, a practical
                argument against nominal income targeting that has been important for
                developing countries, at least in the past, is that the GDP data have often been
                available only with a delay of 1 or 2 years.

            •   Gold standard. If a country pegs the price of gold, the economy is hostage to
                the vagaries of the world gold market. For example, when much of the world
                was on the gold standard in the 19th century, global monetary conditions
                depended on the output of the world’s gold mines. The system did not in fact
                guarantee price stability.25

            •   Commodity basket. One proposal is that monetary policy should target a
                diversified basket of basic mineral and agricultural commodities. The idea is
                that a broad-based commodity standard of this sort would not be subject to the
                vicissitudes of a single commodity such as gold.26 If the basket reflected the
                commodities produced and exported by the country in question, the proposal
                could work. But for a country that is a net importer of oil, wheat, and other
                mineral and agricultural commodities, such a peg gives precisely the wrong
                answer in a year when the prices of these commodities go up. Just when the
                domestic currency should be depreciating to accommodate an adverse
                movement in the terms of trade, it appreciates instead. In other words, a
                regime of pegging to a basket of commodities would be vulnerable to terms of
                trade shocks. Brazil should not peg to oil, Kuwait should not peg to wheat,
                and Korea should not peg to either.

            •   Export commodity standard. Frankel (2002) puts forward the idea of pegging
                the currency to the price of the export good.27 This proposal may sound

24
   E.g., Frankel (1995a) demonstrates the point mathematically and gives many other references on nominal
income targeting. Frankel (1995b) applies to emerging market countries.
25
   Cooper (1985). Proponents reply that the sort of price stability that is most important for efficient long-term
economic planning by individuals is not simply minimizing short-run variability, but rather the guarantee
against large inflationary episodes that a gold standard is designed to offer.
26
   A “commodity standard” was proposed in the 1930s—by B. Graham (1937)—and subsequently discussed
by F. Graham (1941), Keynes (1938), and others. It was revived in the 1980s as a less narrow version of
proposals to return to a gold standard.


27
     Also Schleisser (2001) and Frankel and Saiki (2002).
                                                                                         25


           similar to inflation targeting. But inflation-targeters target the consumer price
           index (CPI). The main difference between the CPI and the export price is the
           terms of trade. When there is an adverse movement in the terms of trade, one
           would like the currency to depreciate, yet price level targeting can have the
           opposite effect. For example, positive oil shocks as in 1973, 1979, or 2000
           would have required monetary tightening in an oil-importing country if the
           central bank had been constrained to hit an inflation target. The result can be
           sharp falls in national output. Thus under rigid inflation targeting, supply or
           terms-of-trade shocks can produce unnecessary and excessive fluctuations in
           the level of economic activity. But targeting the price of domestically
           produced goods is a possible solution. It would have the advantage of
           robustness with respect to import price shocks that a CPI target lacks, without
           the data problems of nominal income targeting. Papua New Guinea could peg
           to gold, Indonesia to oil, Chile to copper, Colombia to coffee, Argentina to
           wheat, and Korea to semiconductors. If these countries had been pegged to
           these commodities in the late 1990s—a time of weak export markets and
           curtailed availability of international finance—their currencies would have
           automatically depreciated and stimulated exports, at precisely the time when a
           boost to the balance of payments was needed.

        To recap, each of the most popular variables that have been proposed as
candidates for nominal anchors is subject to fluctuations that will add an element of
unnecessary monetary volatility to a country that has pegged its money to that variable:
velocity shocks in the case of M1, supply shocks in the case of inflation targeting,
fluctuations in world gold markets in the case of the gold standard, terms of trade shocks
in a commodity basket standard, and fluctuations in the anchor currency in the case of
exchange rate pegs. A novel candidate for nominal anchor, the export price, bears
consideration.

Implications for East Asia

Many Asian countries are reluctant to float freely. They crave a return to some measure
of exchange rate stability. They range in the extent of their desire for stability, or in
willingness to constrain their policies in order to achieve such stability. But even those
who wish to peg—or maintain their peg, like Hong Kong, China—have a problem. To
whom should they peg? The appreciation of the dollar against the yen and euro from
1995 to 2001 hurt countries pegged to the dollar, and is considered by some as a major
cause of the crises of the late 1990s.

        For Eastern European countries wishing to stabilize their exchange rate, the euro
is the natural anchor currency. For most Latin American countries wishing to stabilize
their exchange rate, the dollar is the natural anchor currency. This is less true for
Argentina and Chile, who—in part due to geography—have a more diversified pattern of
trade. For Asian countries wishing to stabilize their exchange rates, the choice of
currency is much less clear. That so many countries in Asia got into trouble by linking to
the dollar is no coincidence. (More precisely, the bad luck of an appreciating dollar in the
second half of the 1990s, especially vis-a-vis the yen, explains the timing of the pressure
                                                                                            26


on Asian countries. But the fact that the dollar had occupied a larger role in their
monetary arrangements than the US played in their economies made an eventual
mismatch inevitable. In this respect East Asia resembles Argentina and Lithuania.) But
neither Japan nor the People’s Republic of China constitutes a large enough share of East
Asian trade to qualify as the obvious anchor either. East Asian countries have patterns of
trade and investment that are too diversified to peg to any one major currency.

        A basket peg is the obvious solution.28 In theory, a country ought to be able to
capture the advantages of a fixed exchange rate with a basket peg, or at least the nominal
anchor advantage. In practice, this seems not to be the case. First, basket pegs tend to be
less firm and less credible than pegs to single currencies. Second, if such recent
econometric studies as Rose (2000) are right, the big trade-promoting gain of fixed
exchange rates arises when countries adopt a common currency, not just when the
variability of the effective exchange rate is reduced. Third, as Ogawa and Ito (2000) and
Ito (2001) point out, it is harder for one East Asian country to peg to a trade-weighted
basket on its own if its neighbors continue to put a large weight on the dollar. In their
model, a coordinated move by all East Asian countries to a common basket peg is better
than a noncooperative equilibrium where each chooses the weights in its basket alone.

       The idea of a common basket peg in East Asia has received a lot of attention. One
could classify as favorably disposed, not just Ogawa and Ito (2000), but also Williamson
(1999, 2001), Dornbusch and Park (1999), Kwan (1998, 2001), and several Japanese
government officials. Others are skeptical.29

        If Asian countries were eventually to peg their currencies to the same unit, they
would reap the advantages of a common currency area, regardless of whether the anchor
is a basket, a major currency like the yen, or some wholly new unit (such as a composite
of the member currencies, the route that Europe took with the European Monetary
System and the ecu, on its way to EMU and the euro). Some observers consider these
advantages substantial.30 Others wonder if Asia satisfies the criteria for an optimum
currency area.31

        In any case, a rapid shift in which a substantial number of Asians peg tightly to a
common currency unit in the near future is unlikely. It took Europe many decades to get
to a common currency, notwithstanding that in the end, the euro 11 made the leap directly
to EMU in January 1999 from a system of moderately wide bands. It is difficult to
imagine the transition having been successful without the run-up that lasted several
decades—including the “Snake” of the 1970s and the European Monetary System of the
1980s. These efforts helped change the optimum currency area parameters over time, to
shift the logic in favor of currency union. So did parallel initiatives like the Schengen
agreement on the movement of persons and the sequence of progressively more serious
regional trading arrangements that culminated in the Single Market of 1992. By 1999, the

degrees of trade integration, labor mobility, correlation of shocks, and political solidarity
were much higher than they had been 50 years earlier. Furthermore, throughout the
postwar period, a strong political motivation drove European economic integration: the
shared desire to ensure that there be no repeat of the three wars that Germany and France
had fought over the preceding century. Even so, the path to EMU included innumerable
crises, devaluations, revaluations, reforms, opting outs, opting back-ins, multispeeds, etc.

        The more important question for Asia is whether some common loose
arrangement could work for the medium term. Realistically, such an arrangement would
have to allow the possibility—depending on circumstances—of individual countries
opting in or opting out, of choosing their own individual degrees of rigidity on the
spectrum between tight peg and loose target zone, and of possible individual balance-of-
payments crises along the way. It is neither possible nor desirable to specify one
exchange rate regime to hold sway across Asia. The most that can be contemplated, in the
medium run, is a sort of monetary framework for the region. The design of such an
arrangement is of interest regardless of whether or not one views it as a possible
transition to tighter monetary integration a la EMU.

         What should be the anchor unit? That no Asian country has pegged to the yen,
even loosely, must reflect, in part, sensible fears that such a country would be exposed to
the large fluctuations in the value of the yen against other major currencies. The same
goes for the idea of pegging to the Chinese renminbi. But a synthetic basket unit is also
unlikely to do the job, at least at the beginning. Among the requirements for a currency to
become used internationally is the condition that there is some nucleus country where the
currency is on “home turf,” i.e., where it is used for domestic transactions. To try to get a
purely synthetic currency unit adopted internationally, no matter how well designed, is
like trying to get Esperanto used as an international language. The IMF has learned this in
its failed efforts to get the special drawing rights (SDR) adopted as an international
currency anchor.32
         Some country has to go first. Let us say it is Singapore. It could announce a
commitment to a diversified basket peg, with explicit weights (on the dollar, yen, euro,
and perhaps the renminbi). Countries in the region that wish to stabilize their exchange
rates in terms of a basket could then choose the Singapore currency as that unit, rather
than an individually concocted basket. Whether to peg or adopt an intermediate regime
such as a target zone would be their choice to make. Their incentive to choose the
Singapore currency as the anchor currency rather than the dollar or yen is that the
weighted basket would prevent fluctuations in the dollar or yen from causing unwanted
fluctuations in local effective exchange rates. As more countries joined, they would also
reap the benefits of facilitated trade among each other. ASEAN members would probably
be more tempted than others.33 Singapore’s incentive to maintain the basket peg at the
core, even if at times domestic economic considerations pointed to an effective
appreciation or depreciation, would include the reaping of seigniorage. Singapore would
in a sense serve as the region’s bank.

     E.g., Mussa et al. (1996).

   ASEAN falls somewhat short of Europe in the economic criteria for an optimum currency area, and more
than a little in the necessary political commitment. (Bayoumi et al. [2000]).

        A moderate gradual approach to East Asian monetary integration along these lines
might not in the end work. But it would be more likely to work than an ambitious attempt
to leap directly to a full-fledged regional currency union. Moderate solutions and gradual

The table shows the correlations and percentage of coincidences between four systems of
annual classification of exchange rate regimes: IMF (end-of-period values); Ghosh,
Gulde, Ostry, and Wolf (Ghosh); Levy Yeyati and Sturzenegger (LY-S); and Reinhart
and Rogoff (R-R). The sample includes 47 countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Dominican
Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Finland, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia,
Mauritius, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Paraguay, Philippines, Portugal,
Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, United
Kingdom, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The period considered is 1974-1998 for the IMF
classification, 1974-1995 for the Ghosh classification, and 1974-2000 for the LY-S and
R-R classifications. Exchange rate regimes are classified as fixed, intermediate, or
floating. The R-R classification was collapsed into these three categories according to the
Appendix Table.

Sources for classifications: IMF; Ghosh, Gulde, Ostry, & Wolf (1996); Levy Yeyati &
Sturzenegger (2000); and Reinhart & Rogoff (2002). Table prepared by Marina Halac &
