        Research and development (R&D) is a key determinant of long run productivity and welfare. A
central issue is whether a decentralized economy undertakes too little or too much R&D. We develop an
endogenous growth model that incorporates parametrically four important distortions to R&D: the surplus
appropriability problem, knowledge spillovers, creative destruction, and congestion externalities. We show
that our model is consistent with the available evidence on R&D, growth, and markups. Calibrating the
model to micro and macro data, we find that the decentralized economy typically underinvests in R&D
relative to what is socially optimal. The only exceptions to this conclusion occur when both the congestion
externality is extremely strong and the equilibrium real interest rate is very high. These results are robust to
reasonable variations in model parameters.

1 Introduction
Research and development (R&D) is a key long-run determinant of productivity
and consumer welfare. But how much R&D is enough? Much of the theoretical
literature has focused on reasons—-such as monopoly pricing and the public good
nature of knowledge—why there is too little private R&D. However, there are equally
compelling reasons, related to the distorted incentives from patent races and the
transfer of rents through creative destruction, to tlnnk that there may be too much
R&D.1 In the end, the question as to the sign and magnitude of the deviation of
R&D investment from its socially optimal level is an empirical one that can be
approached from a number of directions.
   Jones and Williams (1998) show how to interpret existing econometric estimates
of returns to R&D in the context of endogenous growth models and find that optimal
R&D investment is at least four times greater than actual spending. This approach
yields a clear answer as to the degree of over- or underinvestment in R&D, but
it does not tell us which factors determine the overall result, the knowledge of
which may have important policy implications. Furthermore, the answer provided
by this method relies on empirical estimates of the return to R&D, which, given
the econometric difficulties associated with this undertaking, make an independent
check on the results particularly valuable.
   In this paper, we take a different approach and use a calibrated endogenous
growth model to examine the issue of over- and underinvestment in R&D.2 Existing
models in the new growth literature are inadequate for examining this question,
either because they focus on a limited set of distortions or because they generate re-
sults that are contradicted by empirical evidence. We develop an R&D-based growth
model that both incorporates four key distortions to the allocation of resources to
R&D and is broadly consistent with empirical evidence on monopoly pricing power
and the long-run relationship between R&D and productivity gro\vtll.
    Two distortions present in the model promote underinvestment in R&D. First
and foremost, innovators in a decentralized economy are not able to appropriate the
entire "consumer surplus" associated with the good that they create. A markup of
    'Tirole (1988) provides an overview of the relevant literature in the industrial organization
literature. Romer (t990), Aghion and Howitt (1992), and Grossman and I-lelpman (1991) analyze
this issue in the context of endogenous growth models.
    'In this, we follow Stokey (1995), who applies the same method using a different endogenous
growth model, as discussed in the text below.


                                               1
 price over cost distorts sales downward from the optimum level that would occur if
 the good were sold at its marginal cost of productiou. Given the importauce of this
 surplus appropriability pro 51cm, we employ a generalized specification of production
that severs the overly restrictive links between the markup, the capital share, and
the cousumer surplus otherwise iuhereut in the standard formulation found iu the
literature. The second distortion promoting underiuvestment is related to the notion
that present researchers "stand on the shoulders" of past researchers; that is, part
of the output of R&D is knowledge that contributes to the capacity to inuovate.
    On the other side of the ledger, two distortions in the model promote overin-
vestment in R&D. One is a negative congestion externality which we refer to as the
stepping on toes effect. This may arise ont of patent races, in which multiple firms
run parallel research programs in the hope of being the first to succeed at creating
and patenting a new good or process. Holding other factors constant, a pick-up in
R&D effort induces increased duplication of research efforts that reduces the aver-
age productivity of R&D in the economy. Second is the effect of the redistribution
of rents from past innovators to current innovators through a process of creative
destruction. A new good may functionally replace an existing good, cansing the
current innovator to receive the entire flow of rents while the past innovator gets
cut out. On their own, congestive externalities and creative destruction each raise
the private retnrn to R&D above the social return.
   We calibrate the parameters of the model using both macro and micro data to
examine the net effect of the fonr distortions on investment in R&D. Our central
finding, robust to reasonable changes in parameter values, is that in the absence
of taxes and subsidies, the decentralized economy nuderinvests in R&D, with the
primary impetus coming from the surplus appropriability problem. The only ex-
ceptions to this conclusion occur when both the congestion externality is extremely
strong and the equilibrium real interest rate is very high. Overall, there appears to
be too little private R&D. Moreover, because we omit other distortions highlighted
by the literature such as imitation and capital market imperfections due to asym-
metric information, we believe we have biased the case in favor of overinvestrnent .
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We begin in Section 2
by developing a general R&D-based growth model that incorporates a number of
    3Stiglitz (1992) and Hall (1992) argue that capital market imperfections promote underinvest-
ment. Furthermore, iu the United States at least, the net effect of the tax system, which is ignored
in the present paper, likely further reduces the private return to R&D (Williams 1999).

distortions to the private incentive to undertake R&D. Section 3 describes the cali-
bration of the model and analyzes the direction and magnitude of the deviation of
the allocation of resources to R&D from the optimal allocation. Sectiou 4 concludes.

2 The Model
The main building block of the model developed in this section is the variety-based
model due to Romer (1990). The basic structure will be familiar from this and
later work, so we will pause only to highlight the key extensions in our setup. The
main modifications pertain to onr incorporation of four determinants of over and
underinvestment in R&D: (1) the degree of surplus appropriability, (2) creative
destruction, (3) knowledge spillovers, and (4) congestion externalities.

2.1 The Final Goods Sector
A final goods sector produces a homogenous output good Y by using a variety of
intermediate capital goods x, where i indexes the capital good and t denotes time,
according to the CES technology


                                                                                        (1)

At any given point in time, production and trade in intermediate goods is limited
to the set of goods that have been successfully designed in the past, measured by
A. Given A, the production function for final goods exhibits constant returns to
scale (to capital and labor inputs). Profit maximization by the final goods sector
then yields a demand curve for intermediate good i defined by

                         = (1   —
                                    a)L
where q is the price of capital good i.4
                                          (       1_a))
                                                          11
                                                               4°'                      (2)



    The area under this demand curve, down to the point where the price is equal to
the marginal cost of production, is a "consumer" surplus that is available to society
for the production of goods when a new design is invented. The inventor of a new
design captures only part of this surplus: the private incentive to innovate is, all else
   4We require 0 < p < 1/(1 — a) below, so that demand curves slope duwnward and the desired
gross markup on intermediate goods is greater than unity.


                                              3
equal, less than the gain to society. We refer to this as the surplus appropriability
problem.

2.2 The Intermediate Goods Sector and Innovation Clusters
Capital good rj is produced by an intermediate goods firm that owns an infinitely
lived patent for the design of the good. Once the patent is purchased from the R&D
sector, we assume that units of raw capital can be costlessly transformed one for one
into capital goods. The intermediate goods firm acts as a monopolist and charges a
gross markup ij over marginal cost, so that

                                         qt = rtrt,                                        (3)

where t is the real interest rate (cost of capital).
    First, consider the case where an intermediate goods firm is unconstrained by
competitors offering an equivalent product. In this case, profit-maximizing firms
act as monopolists, taking other prices as given. Assuming the number of firms is
large, firms choose a markup determined by the elasticity of substitution between
intermediate capital goods:

                                   UU_1
    In Romer (1990), p is equal to unity so that the monopoly markup is equal
to the inverse of the capital share. Empirically, this implies a gross markup (the
ratio of price to marginal cost) of approximately 3, sharply exceeding empirical
estimates of 1.05—1.4.' For there to be meaningful discussion of the issue of inefficient
allocation of resources to R&D, an R&D-based growth model must conform to
empirically-supported markups. The more general CES production function above
severs the overly restrictive link between the markup and the capital share. In
addition, our modeling of creative destruction relaxes the assumption that firms are
always unconstrained monopolists in setting prices, as described next. This breaks
the link between the equilibrium markup and the "consumer" surplus implied by
the creation of a new good.6
  5See Norrbin (1993) and Basu (1996) for empirical evidence on markups.
  6The bnk is inherent in models with CES production and unconstrained monopoly pricing. For
example, in Romer (1990), the share of the surplus appropriated by the inventor is equal to the
znverse of the markup. This leads to the somewhat counter-intuitive results that higher markups
are associated with a lower share of the surplus being captured.


                                              4
   Now consider the case where firms may face competition from equivalent goods.
Here we depart from existing models b introducing creative destruction into a
variety model. In doing so we not only introduce an additional incentive for overin-
vestment in R&D into the model, but we also modify the nature of competition for
investment goods. This has the effect of freeing the equilibrium markup from the
elasticity of substitution between capital goods.
    To introduce creative destruction, we assume that designs or ideas are linked
together in innovation cinsters. An innovation cluster has two key features. First,
only a fraction of the cluster, defined as      actually increases the variety of in-
termediate goods. The remaining fraction         consists of "upgrades" that replace
existing intermediate goods. Second, all of the goods in the innovation cluster must
be used together; the addition to variety cannot be separated from the upgrades.
    An analogy may be helpful. Consider the invention of a computer technology
that can control all functions of an automobile engine to optimize performance. Use
of this innovation cluster increases the output of services from the car for given
inputs—it increases productivity. In order for this device to be useful, a subset of
engine parts must be redesigned or modified to allow for computer-control. The end
function of these modified parts is identical to the existing parts; they differ only in
the ability to be computer controlled. In designing an engine system, one has the
 choice of using the computer controller with computer-controlled parts ornot using
 the computer at all and using existing parts.
     The creation of an innovation cluster leads to a choice for final goods producers.
 They can either (a) ignore the innovation and continue using the existing technol-
 ogy, or (b) take advantage of the productivity improvement associated with the
 innovation by purchasing quantities of all goods in the new innovation cluster. We
 focus on the equilibrium in which the final goods sector always chooses to adopt the
 new technology. Competition from producers of existing goods, which can at best
 price at marginal cost, leads to an upper bound (corresponding to a limit price) on
 the markup that can be charged for goods in an innovation cluster. Let      be tins




                                            5
maximum markup.7 Then, the adoption constraint is

                                              nit   = miu(ij},nç).                              (5)


As shown in Appendix A, the constrained markup is giveu by

                                                                                                (6)


An increase in the size of innovation clusters (larger i/') reduces the constrained
markup, as does a higher elasticity of substitution between capital goods (higher
                                                                         sell for the
values of p(l — n)). Whatever the value of the markup, all goods will

2.3    The R&D Sector
R&D constitutes the search for new designs for intermediate goods. A research
firm rents labor services (scientists and engineers) and capital inputs (laboratory
equipment) to search for new designs. It simplifies the model considerably if we
 assume that capital goods and labor combine to produce new designs in exactly the
 same way that they combine to produce output.8 We also assume the variety of
 intermediate goods is large so that the summation in the production function can
 be replaced with an integral. We assume that R&D generates new designs according
 to
                           (1 + )A =            = 6RA,           E (0,1],                         (8)

 where R is the amount of output devoted to R&D and A is the derivative of A
 with respect to t; time is continuous. Researchers take the productivity of R&D, 6.
 as given. From society's standpoint, however, the productivity of R&D may vary
 with the amount of R&D expenditure and the stock of ideas.
     7A11 goods in a cluster sell for the same markup. This symmetric price rule is an equilibrium.
 If any firm in the innovation cluster were to raise its price, the final goods firm would switch to
 purchasing the old capital goods. Other equilibria for this game may well exist. Our purpose here
                                                              destruction in a variety model and to see
 is to provide a simple mechanism for introducing creative
 how it affects the rate of return calculation in the productivity literature.
     51n the terminology of Rivera-Batiz and Romer (1991), we employ the "lab equipment" version
 of R&D instead of the "knowledge-driven" specification, in which labor is the only internalized
  input. The results in this paper are very similar if the "knowledge-driven" specification is employed
  instead.


                                                     6
   Several aspects of the R&D equation deserve mention. In its simplest form where
  = 0. A = 1, and = 0, the number of newly discovered designs A is proportional
to the amount of R&D undertaken. We depart from this simple specification in
three ways. First, the presence of the ' terni reflects the existence of innovation
clusters: for each increase in variety of measure one, existing goods of measure
are replaced by "upgrades." From the standpoint of the private inventor, profits are
earned on each good in the innovation cluster. However, as we will see, from society's
standpoint, only the fraction       that increases variety contributes to welfare.
    Second, A < 1 captures congestion externalities in R&D, which we refer to as
the stepping on toes effect. At any point in time, an increase in R&D effort induces
duplication that reduces the average productivity of R&D. Notice that this dupli-
cation may be accidental (unbeknownst to the other, two independent researchers
simultaneously discover the same improvement in inkjet printing), or it may be in-
tentional as in a patent race (because of patent protection or first-mover advantages,
researchers race to be the first to discover and produce a more powerful computer
chip). In either case, in equilibrium private costs are equated to the expected payoff
of research which exceeds the marginal social benefits.
    Finally,      0 allows for "standing on shoulders," an intertemporal knowledge
spillover, as well as for diminishing technological opportunities. This effect is as-
sumed to be external to the private agents; i.e., firms cannot appropriate the value
of the knowledge spillovers from future researchers. At the same time, it is possi-
ble that the advance of science and technology is partially stymied by diminishing
technological opportunities (Evenson (1984). Kortum (1993)). It may simply be
getting harder to make incremental gains in productivity-enhancing technology. In
this case, the "productivity" of R&D is negatively related to the level of technol-
ogy:    is reduced (and negative if diminishing technological opportunities out\veigh
knowledge spillovers).
    From the point of view of atomistic R&D firms, there are constant returns to
R&D, with the firm's perceived marginal product equal to the average product over
all R&D firms. Free entry into R&D drives profits to zero. Letting PAL denote the
market value of a new design, this zero profit condition is

                    P.4t(1 + )A =          :   PAL =                               (9)
                                                       gtAt + ')
where gAL denotes the growth rate of A and s

                                           7
   One can now see how creative destruction operates. As in Aghion and Howitt
(1992) and Grossman and llelpman (1991), new goods effectively replace old goods,
and the profit stream that previously accrued to the inventor of the old good is
captured by the inventor of the new good. Creative destruction has two effects on
the private incentive to undertake R&D, which we can tlunk of as a "carrot" and a
"stick". The "carrot" is seen in eqnation (9): firms earn profits even on goods that
do not constitute an addition to variety. This "business stealing" effect provides an
incentive for overinvestment.
    To see the "stick" associated with creative destruction, notice that the value
of a new design PAt is equal to the present discounted value of the profits that it
commands through the rental of intermediate goods of that type. The arbitrage
equation, equating the real flow cost of a design to the sum of the flow of profits, ire,
capital gains due to an increase in the market value of a design, and the expected
(negative) capital gaiu due to creative destruction, is given by

                                   = itt + PAt —
                                                   tPAt.                            (10)

The third term on the right hand side of the equation gives the expected capital loss
due to creative destruction---—the "stick" in our previous analogy, which represents
the part of creative destruction that promotes underinvestment. Given the creation
of A new designs,        existing goods are replaced among the existing set of A
goods types. The probability of any existing good being replaced at any given point
in time is thus %, and the expected capital loss is iI5LPAt. As shown below,
the "carrot" effect dominates the "stick" effect, making the net impact of creative
destruction one of overinvestment in R&D.

2.4 Steady State Properties
For the remainder of the paper we focus exclusively on the properties of steady state,
or balanced growth path, of the model. We close the model by assuming that the
labor supply is exogenous and growing at rate n, the market for labor clears with
the wage equal to the marginal product of labor, the demand for capital exhausts
the supply, and consumers allocate consumption according to the usual Euler equa-
tion (\vith constant intertemporal elasticity of substitution ) and dynamic budget
constraint. These conditions and the definition of an equilibrium for this economy
are discussed further in Appendix B.

                                            8
    As shown in Appendix B, the steady state growth rate of A is constant and
given by
                                                                                        (11)

where a          —
                     (1
                          —
                              a).9    The steady state growth rate of outpnt is given by
gy = 9A + ii.     The steady state R&D share for the decentralized economy, 5DC, is
given by
                                     5DC   (1—a)(1+)g4                                  (12
                                           r—   gy + (1 + O)g
    This equation relates the steady state share of investment in R&D to its steady
state rate of return r. Because physical capital and R&D investment both represent
foregone consumption, the steady state rate of return to R&D is equal to that for
capital and is given by the Euler equation for consumption: r = 9 + it+ -y(gy — it),
where   9 is the rate of time preference. Recall that the steady state values of r,
gy, and g are determined by model parameters outside this equation, that is by
a, , 9, A, p. and it. Therefore, equation (12) gives the equilibrium R&D share as
a function of model parameters. To ease comparison with the socially optimal
allocation of resources to R&D, we do not make the additional substitutions.
    The intuition underlying equation (12) is simply the zero profit condition for
the R&D sector, as can be seen by multiplying both sides of the equation by Y.
The numerator is the one-period flow of new profits that results from research. The
denominator is the relevant discount rate that converts this one-period flow into a
present discounted value: private agents discount the future flow at rate r + VgA to
reflect the probability that the profit flow will be curtailed by creative destruction,
and the profit flow itself grows over time at rate gy — g. The equation then states
that the cost of doing R&D, R, is equal to the present discounted value of profits
that will accrue.
    In the decentralized equilibrium steady state, the R&D share is increasing in
the markup. A higher equilibrium markup increases the flow of profits to R&D,
raising R&D investment. The steady state share of R&D is also increasing in the
steady state growth rate. Finally, the effect of creative destrnction on private R&D
investment is apparent from equation (12). The O term in the numerator is the
"carrot" and the tO term in the denominator is the 'stick," as discussed earlier.
   9We require 0 + Au/a < 1. Otherwise, no balanced growth path exists and the growth rate is
increasing over time. See Jones (1995).



                                                 9
Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 1 +5, one sees that au increase
in the size of innovation clusters raises the R&D share provided that the interest
rate is greater than the growth rate of the economy. 10

2.5    The Social Planner's Problem and the Social Return to R&D
flow does this decentralized solution compare to the socially optimal allocation of
resources? The answer can be obtained by solving the following social planner
problem for the economy:

                               rnax{c,R} f° u(Ct/Lt)eOtdt                                    (13)

subject to
                             Ct+It+Rt=Yt=AKL7,
                                 k=i, ICo>O
                                             1+ R4,
                                            = n, L0 > 0.
Applying standard methods yields the optimal allocation of resources to R&D in
steady state:
                                     =             AUgA
                                         r — (gy                      ,                      (14)

                                                       gA)
                                                             —
                                                                 gA
where, because the steady state growth rates are the same in the decentralized and
social planner economies, ,' is also the same. The optimal amount of R&D requires
that the marginal cost of doing a unit of R&D equals the marginal benefit, which
includes the effects of the congestion externality and knowledge spillovers.
   Comparison of eqnation (14) to equation (12) demonstrates algebraically the
four wedges between the equilibrium and optimal allocations of R&D. The surplus
appropriability problem is reflected in the numerators of these equations: inventors
                                                    -
appropriate the profit flow ir = iL-t(1 — a) while the gain to society is given by
    = a-. The ratio of these two terms is less than one, promoting underinvest-
ment. The standing on shoulders effect is associated with > 0. The presence of
  10The reason for this is straightforward and has been pointed out by Barro and Sala-i-Martin
(1995). In the steady state of these models, the profit earned from innovating grows at the same
constant growth rate as the economy. In terms of timing, however, an innovator destroys the
incumbent's profits today. while her own profits will not be destroyed until some point in the
future. If the interest rate exceeds the growth rate, the profit destruction effect dominates. This
condition is required hy the transversality condition of the consumer maximization problem.


                                               10
A < 1 represents the stepping on toes effect associated with congestion externalities.
Finally the creative destructio n effect associated with ' promotes overinvestment.
Individual agents nndertake R&D based on the profits they can earn rather than
based on the social surplns created. Note that the social planners allocation of
R&D does not depend on featnres of the market economy snch as the markup or
the creative destrnction parameter.

3 Results from the Calibrated Model
We now attempt to qnantify the degree of nnder- or overinvestment in R&D by
choosing values for model parameters consistent with the micro and macro empirical
evidence. This exercise is in the tradition of Stokey (1995). An important difference
from that work relates to the "stepping on toes" externality associated with A,
which Stokey leaves as a free parameter in her calibration.'1 Stokey argued, and
our results concur, that obtaining estimates of this parameter value is needed to
obtain clear results from the calibration. As shown below, empirical evidence on
the R&D-productivity relationship provides information regarding plausible values
of A.

3.1      Calibration of the Model
Several parameters of the model have close real-world counterparts so that their
calibration is straightforward. Others require a more indirect approach.
    The labor share a and the growth rates of total factor productivity (TFP) ag,
R&D expenditure g, and the labor force n are calibrated according to Table 1.
We allow the remaining two parameters, the interest rate r and the parameter p. to
take on a range of values and examine the robustness of the results to this range.
We initially consider interest rates ranging from .04 to .14, representing one-half
and twice the the average real return on the stock market for the last century of .07
(Mehra and Prescott, (1985)). The interest rate here plays two roles. First, it is the
relevant summary statistic that captures preferences in the model. Second, it also
represents the equilibrium rate of return to R&D for the decentralized economy. For
  11Two other differences are worth noting. First, Stokey's approach is hased on a quality ladders
model that contains parameters (such as a fixed quality step size) that are empirically difficult
to interpret and calibrate. Second. Stokey's model exhibits intertemporal scale effects of the kind
critiozed by Jones (1995): adding population growth to her model results in accelerating growth
rates.

     Notes: The labor share is taken from Kydland and Prescott (1991). TFP
     and labor force growth rates are average growth rates in the private business
     sector over 1948—97 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor
     1999). R&D growth is the average annual growth rate of real industry-
     conducted R&D for 1957-1997 (National Science Foundation 1998). See
     the text for other parameters.




this reason, we were uncomfortable with simply calibrating this interest rate to the
risk free rate on treasury bills, i.e. to some number like .01. However, as will be
clear later, our results are even stronger in the case of a small r.12 The highest value
of p considered is 2.77 which, given a = .64, corresponds to an infinite elasticity of
substitution between intermediate goods. The smallest value of p that we consider
is governed by the equilibrium markup that is implied. A value of .5 yields a gross
markup of 1.37 over marginal cost for intermediate goods pricing. This value is at
the upper end of estimates by Norrbin (1993) and Basn (1996).
    The one parameter that requires further discussion is the expected lifetime of
a design, r. The presence of creative destruction means that designs have a finite
useful life, at least in expectation. Recall that the probability that a design is
destroyed at each instant is /'g. Given the assumptions of the model, the expected
lifetime of a design is simply the inverse of this probability.
    Estimates of the expected life of a design can be obtained in a number of different
ways. One is to estimate directly the mean rate of decay of rents from patented
  12An additional restriction is r > gy. For our parameter values, gy is 033.


                                               12
goods. The inverse is the mean lifetime. The implied depreciation rate of monopoiy
rents from patented goods is estimated to be 0.25 by Pakes and Schankerman (1984),
implying a mean lifetime of fonr years. Mansfield, Schwartz and Wagner (1981) find
that 60% of patented innovations are 'iiuitated' within fonr years, which is equivalent
to a lifespan of five years. Caballero and Jaffe (1993) estimate a mean rate of creative
destrnction of 4% (lifespan of 25 years) nsing patent citation data. Their estimated
rate for electrical eqnipment is 13%, implying a lifespan of 8 years. We assume an
intermediate value of 10 years. The results for other parameter values ranging from
5 years to 20 years are similar, as discnssed below.
    As noted, a parameter that tnrns ont to be very important in the results that
follow is A. Stokey (1995) argues that the empirical literature does not provide much
guidance in choosing a value of £13 In contrast, we find that the empirical evidence
on the R&D-productivity relationship does provide information regarding plausible
values of A.
    Empirical estimates of returns to R&D often are obtained by regressing total fac-
tor productivity growth at the industry level on R&D-output ratios. Such estimates
are reviewed in detail by Criliches (1992) and Nadiri (1993), among others. Under
an R&D-productivity relationship like that given above in equation (8), Jones and
Williams (1998) show that the rate of return parameter that is typically estimated
in this productivity literature, denoted PL, is equal to

                                         PL = AgTFp
where .s is the steady state ratio of R&D spending to output. This implies that
                                                  PL5
                                                                                                (15)
                                                 PTFP
While we do not feel confident picking exact values from the literature for these
parameters, plausible lower bounds are somewhat easier to choose. For example,
taking a lower bound for nPL of 30 percent and a lower bound for s of 2.2 percent,
together with our estimate of TFP of 1.25 percent implies a lower bound for A of
  '3One exception is Kortum (1992), who finds values for a parameter like A of about 0.2. However,
this estimate can be criticized on two grounds. First, the framework is somewhat different from
ours, so it is not clear that the estimate is valid. Second, the estimate is obtained using patent
data. The puzzling aggregate time series properties for patents (i.e. the lack of a clear trend during
most of the 20th century) also suggest problems interpreting the estimates.




                                                 13
about 514 Instead of enforcing this value in our calibrations, we will present results
for values of.\ between zero and one. This allows our calibration to be separate from
our previous results, while allowing for easy evaluation of the results at ,\ = 0.5 or
higher.
   An estimate of        can be derived using the fact that TFP growth has been
relatively constant over the post-war period. Log-differentiating the R&D equation
in (8) yields
                                                                                         (16)
                                                  9TFP
Given values of A and a, this equation determines            Notice that this relationship
is valid along any growth path with constant growth rates, not just in steady state.
This distinction is somewhat important because the historical growth rate of R&D
expenditure has been higher than the growth rate of manufacturing output.15
    Given values for a, A and , the model implies a steady-state growth rate of A,
as in equation (11); this in turn implies a steady-state growth rate of output per
worker. The creative destruction parameter ' is given by 1/(TgA). The constrained
and unconstrained parameter values for the markup are determined by together
with the other fundamental parameter values, and the equilibrium markup is the
smaller of the two. This completes the calibration of all the necessary parameter
values. The decentralized and optimal R&D shares are then calculated according to
equations (12) and (14).

3.2 Equilibrium and Optimal R&D Investment
Table 2 reports the results from a single calibration of the model where r = .07 and
p = 1.8. The implied value of a, the elasticity of output with respect to the level of
knowledge, is about .2. The steady-state growth rates of A and output per worker
are 6.1% and 1.9%, respectively This is associated with a creative destruction
parameter ' of 1.65, which implies that about 40% of each innovation cluster is
accounted for by novel goods. Intermediate goods firnis would like to charge a price
54% over marginal cost, but the adoption constraint limits them to a markup of
  '4The number 2.2 percent comes from the average value of the ratio of industry R&D to private
business output for 1957-1997. The corresponding number for total (i.e., including government)
RD is 3.1 percent. It is plausible to think of these numbers as respective lower bounds because
a substantial amount of what economists would call R&D is probably not counted as R&D in the
collected statistics.
  15Jones (1998) shows that a rising R&D share can be consistent with a constant growth rate of
the aggregate variables in the intermediate run.

about 30% over marginal cost. Note that these values, together with the steady
state growth rate of output per hour are independent of the value of A.
   The value of 5 and the optimal R&D share depend on the particular value of A.
The values of are relatively robust to the value of A in this particular example;
all are positive and greater than .4, suggesting a relatively large positive knowledge
spillover. More generally, for small values of p, can be small and even take negative
values. The R&D share chosen by the decentralized economy is invariant to A, which
is external in the decentralized model. For these parameter values, .sDC is equal to
.066, while s is increasing in A and ranges from .065 to .170. For small values of
A, the decentralized economy slightly overinvests in R&D.
    To get an idea of the relative magnitudes of the different effects promoting under-
and overinvestrnent in R&D, we computed the decentralized R&D shares assuming
that individual distortions were internalized in the decentralized economy. To be
precise, for each case, we altered the equilibrium condition for the R&D share in
the decentralized economy so that one distortion was eliminated. For example, in
the case of the kno\vledge spillover, we assumed the research firm was able to inter-
nalize the marginal benefits to future R&D productivity resulting from its research
investment. For the case of creative destruction, we assumed firms internalized the
fact that only a subset of new goods are true innovations and the indirect effect on
the expected lifespan of a good, hut did not eliminate the effect on the equilibrium
markup.


                                            15
       In the following, the results correspond to values of A over the rauge of .25 to 1.
If the knowledge spillover were internalized, the R&D share would rise hy 16 to 36
percent (.011 to .024) -with the size of the increase larger the larger is (the smaller
is A). Tf the surplus appropriability problem alone were eliminated, the R&D share
would increase by 140%, regardless of the value of A. If the creative destruction effect
alone were internalized, the R&D share would decrease of 24%, again regardless of
A. Finally, if the congestion externality were internalized, the R&D share would fall
by 100 * (1 — A) percent. Therefore, according to this calibration exercise, the main
force promoting underinvestment is the consumer appropriability problem and the
main force promoting overinvestment is the "stepping on toes" effect. These results
hold more generally for other empirically-supported values of the markup and rates
of creative destruction discussed below.

3.3 Refining the Results on Over- and Underinvestment
To provide a broader overview of the calibration results, Figure 1 plots the ratio
3SP/3DC against A for three different values of p. The title for each subpanel reports
the value of p together with the implied values of a, rj, and      the superscript on ij
indicates whether the equilibrium markup ij is unconstrained or constrained. The
four parameter values move together systematically. Each subpanel contains one of
these plots for three different values of the interest rate r = {.04, .07, .10}.
    The decentralized economy only overinvests in R&D when A is small and the
interest rate is relatively high. In comparison, for the case of A .5 and r =
.07, the optimal R&D share is from 1-1/2 to over 3 times as large as that in the
decentralized economy. Small values of A promote overinvestment because of the
congestion externality. High values of r weaken the intertemporal effects in the
model that encourage underinvestment (the knowledge spillover and the "stick" of
creative destruction) and therefore indirectly promote overinvestment. Note that
the range of r,' from 1.11 to 1.37 corresponds to the range of estimated markups;
thus, attempts to restrict the parameter space on the basis of prior information ou
  are not particularly helpful here.
    The value of p has an ambiguous effect on the sign and magnitude of over-
or underinvestmeut in R&D. Increasing p reduces a and p driving down both the
social and private rates of return to R&D. On net, the former effect dominates
and an increase in p reduces the surplus appropriability problem's contribution to

r. The decline in lowers the constrained markup and reduces the direct impetus
toward overinvestment from creative destruction. As shown in the figure, for values
of p between .5 and 2, the effects on s/sD6' of changes in p roughly cancel;
however, for values of p above 2, the effect through the reduction in dominates
and the region of underinvestment in R&D widens considerably.
   Figure 2 summarizes the model's implications for over- versus underinvestinent
and illustrates the robustness of the basic result that the decentralized economy
underinvests in R&D unless .\ is small and the equilibrium interest rate is high to
     This result can be seen by noting that the partial derivative of the ratio                        with
respect to p, holding b constant, is negative.

(dashed hue), aud 2.5 (solid line). we plot the combinations of the real interest rate
r and A which yield the outcome that the R&D share in the decentralized econonìy
is socially optimal, 5D0 = 8SP• The shaded regions indicate the values of A aud r
for which 5DC > 88P for the case of p = 2.5. The upper left panel is computed using
the baseline values of all fundamental model parameters and provides a benchmark
for the other panels. In each of the other panels, one model parameter used iu the
calibration is perturbed, while the others are left at their baseline values.
    The basic resnlts on under- and over-investment in R&D are insensitive to rea-
sonable changes in the assumed values of the labor share, labor force growth rate,
and the ratio of the historical growth rates of R&D spending and total factor pro-
ductivity. Changes in these parameters generate changes in mj, , and other model
parameters that partially offset each other in terms of their effect on the difference
between the private and social returns to R&D. Note that the value of the equi-
librium markup r lies between 1.11 and 1.41—again, within the range of empirical
estimates— for these four calibrations of the model.
    This insensitivity to the calibration of the model does not, however, extend to
the choice of the lifespan of a design, r, as seen in the lower panels of the figure.
Interestingly, lengthening the lifespan of designs, that is, reducing the rate of creative
 destruction, actually expands the region of overinvestment. This outcome owes to
 the effect of on the equilibrium markup: The lower is 5, the larger the constrained
 markup, and hence the greater is the private return to R&D (when the constraint
 is binding, as for the baseline calibration with p > .5). For example, for p = .5,
 iucreasing r from 10 to 20 raises the equilibrium markup from 1.37 to 1.85.
     An alternative approach to evaluating the robustness of the results to changes
 in the rate of creative destruction is to fix the equilibrium markup and compare
 outcomes nuder different values of . Such an approach can be justified on the
 grounds that we have a prior that the markup does not exceed 1.4, but do not have
 strong prior beliefs regarding or r.
      Figure 3 shows the results from such an experimuent. For four values of ',
                                                              rate r and A which yield
  {0, 1, 3, 9}, we plot the combinations of the real interest
  the outcome that the R&D share in the decentralized economy is socially optimal.
  Recall that y percent of new designs are novel, so that the four values of iJ'
  correspond to novel design shares of 100, 50, 25, and 10 percent, respectively. For

equals the equilibrium markup for the case of = 0 and lies at the upper end of
the range of empirical estimates. Given a fixed markup, an increase in clearly
enlarges the region of overinvestment in R&D. Nevertheless, even if only 10 percent
of new designs truly add to productive efficiency ( = 9, r = 1.3), the decentralized
economy underinvests in R&D when r = .07 and A = .5.

4 Conclusion
To what extent does the economy undertake too much or too little research? Jones
and Williams (1998) provide an answer to this question by showing how estimates of
returns to R&D from regressions of productivity growth on R&D as a share of output
can be interpreted in the context of endogenous growth models. This approach has
the advantage that it incorporates the existing policy environment, including the
patent system and subsidies to research. This approach is, however, only as good
as the underlying econometric estimates. Endogeneity and measurement problems
can cause the estimates to be biased.


                                             20
    In this paper, we take a different approach. We develop a gro\vth model that
incorporates parametrically fonr distortions to R&D that have received attention
in either the new growth literature or in the micro theory literature on patent
races: the surplus appropriability problem and knowledge spillovers (both of which
promote underinvestinent in R&D) and creative destruction and congestion exter-
nalities (both of which promote overiuvestment in R&D). Moreover, we show that
our model is consistent with the available evidence on R&D, growth, and markups.
    Calibrating the model to micro and macro data, we find that our decentralized
economy typically underinvests in R&D relative to what is socially optimal. This is
true unless the equilibrium real interest rate is extremely high and the magnitude
of congestion effects is very large. Finally, we feel that we have biased the case in
favor of overinvestment in this paper. For example, the addition of imitation or
uncertainty with asymmetric information would presumably strengthen the case for
underinvestment.

A Appendix — Solving for the Adoption Constraint
In solving for the adoption constraint, we look for an equilibrium path along which
                                                    the latest innovation clnster. This
the final goods prodncers always choose to adopt
 imposes an upper bound on the markup that can be charged for the goods in the
 innovation cluster, and this upper bound is essentially the adoption constraint.
     To calculate this upper bound, we compare the profits earned by adopting the
 innovation cluster versus the profits earned by purchasing the old intermediate goods
                                                                                    and
 at the limit price of marginal cost. Let A be the existing stock of designs,
                                                                                   final
 suppose a new design becomes available. The production function for the
  goods producer who adopts the new design is

 The production function for the final goods producer who does not adopt the new
 design is
                                                             (1Q)

 where     and it are intermediate goods purchased at a markup, and ,j denotes
 the intermediate goods that are displaced by the innovation cluster and therefore
 limit priced at marginal cost.
    Let rj be the common markup charged on all intermediate goods asymptotically.
 The relative demands for intermediate goods by the final goods producer in each of
 these cases are given by
                                       it =

  Then, the final goods producer will adopt the new design if and only if the profits
  from adopting are higher. That is,

               L7[(At —                +                —

      Writing this equation in terms of it and simplifying with tedious algebra reveals
  that the final goods producer will adopt if and only if

                                                 1

    We can now solve for the equilibrium in the decentralized model. For our
                                                                                     pur-
poses, an equilibrium will be defined as a collection of prices and quantities such
that the markets for capital goods, R&D
                                             input, capital, and output clear; the agents
take all prices {PAI. Wt, Tt, qt} as given, except for intermediate goods firms who set
the rental rates for their own capital goods; agents maximize profits in the three
sectors; and consumers choose a consumnpt ion path to maximize utility. The fifteen
unknowns {Y, L, 12t. qt, r, mt, ,     , , A,      R, PAt, K, Wt, ct} are determined by
equations (1) through (10) in the text and the five equations given above.

growth rate of the economy and the steady state allocation of resources to R&D.
To solve for the steady state growth rate of the economy, rewrite the R&D equation
(8) as
                                  A         £

                                                                                    22


                                           23
By definition, A/A will be constant in steady state. so that the numerator and
denominator of the right-hand side of this equation must grow at the sairie rate.
Letting gx denote the steady state growth rate of any variable x, this implies

                                           =                                        (23)
                                               1 —


In steady state, the share of output going to R&D, s , will be constant, so
that R and Yt will grow at the same rate. To tie down this growth rate, notice
that the A capital goods will be produced in equal quantities so that the aggregate
production function can be rewritten as

                                          =                                         (24)

where a      —
                 (1
                      —
                          o. The constancy of the capital-output ratio then implies that
                                         gy = —gA + n.                              (25)

When combined with the results from the R&D equation, this pins down the steady
state growth rate of knowledge 9A and output gy:

                                                                                    (26)


                                         gy = —gA + n.                              (27)

    These last two equations show that the steady state growth rate of per capita
output is proportional to the population growth rate in this model, a result empha-
sized in a similar context by Jones (1995). For the assumption of a constant steady
state growth rate to hold on the balanced growth path we need 1——.X > 0. If this
restriction were violated, a constant R&D output share would imply an increasing
growth rate over time as the labor force grows.
    To solve for the share of output going to R&D, .s, we first solve for the market
value of a design, P11, from the arbitrage equation. Differentiating the zero profit
condition (9) allows us to solve for    as

                                              =gy —gA                               (28)
                                         At
and substituting into the arbitrage equation reveals
                                                     7rt
                                  PAt=                                              (29)
                                         r — (gy   —
                                                       g) + '9A
                                               24
The zero profit condition says that the costs of R&D are equal to the value of R&D,
PA(l + ')A = Re,, which gives
                              gAAi(1+p)
                           r — (gy — gA) + gA =sYt.                           (30)

Substituting from the equation for profits and simplifying yields the steady state
R&D share for the decentralized economy, s:

                          s= (1—a)(1+)g
                             r  + (1 + )9A
                                    — gy                                      (31)
