A Test for Anchoring and Yea-Saying in Experimental Consumption Data
Arthur van Soest and Michael Hurd
NBER Working Paper No. 10462
April 2004
JEL No. C81, D12
                                       ABSTRACT

In the experimental module of the AHEAD 1995 data, the sample is randomly split into respondents

who get an open-ended question on the amount of total family consumption - with follow-up

unfolding brackets (of the form: is consumption $X or more?) for those who answer “don’t know”

or “refuse” - and respondents who are immediately directed to unfolding brackets. In both cases, the

entry point of the unfolding bracket sequence is randomized. These data are used to develop a

nonparametric test for whether people make mistakes in answering the first bracket question,

allowing for any type of selection into answering the open-ended question or not. Two well-known

types of mistakes are considered: anchoring and yea-saying (or acquiescence). While the literature

provides ample evidence that the entry point in the first bracket question serves as an anchor for

follow-up bracket questions, it is less clear whether the answers to the first bracket question are

already affected by anchoring. We reject the joint hypothesis of no anchoring and no yea-saying at

the entry point. Once yea-saying is taken into account, there is no evidence of anchoring.

1. Introduction
Item non-response in survey data is a well-known problem, particularly if questions relate
to sensitive information that respondents are not willing to provide or to information that
respondents do not know exactly and find hard to estimate. Examples are the amounts
invested in saving accounts or the value of assets such as stocks and bonds, or the value
of total family income or consumption. Item non-response becomes particularly
problematic if the information is not missing at random, i.e., if the probability of not
responding correlates with the amount in question conditional on a set of always
observed covariates. See, for example, Manski (1989, 1995) and Little and Rubin (2002,
Chapter 15).
       Follow-up bracketing questions are often used to reduce the loss of information
due to item non-response and to extract at least partial information from initial non-
respondents. See, for example, Juster and Smith (1997). Particularly in telephone
interviews where it is difficult to show range cards on which respondents can choose in
one step from a larger number of categories, unfolding brackets can be used to collect
banded information. For example, a respondent who answers “don’t know” or “refuse” to
a question on total family consumption in the past month then gets the question “Can you
say whether it was $2000 or more?” If the answer is affirmative, the next question is
“Was it $5000 or more?” etc.
       The majority of initial non-respondents typically appear to be willing to answer
one or more unfolding bracket questions, making unfolding brackets a useful tool to
collect at least some information from the initial non-respondents (Juster and Smith,
1997). Several experiments, however, have shown that the distribution of the categorical
answers obtained in an unfolding bracket design depends on the order in which the
bracket points are presented. For example, if the first question is “Was it $ 2000 or
more?” i.e., the entry point is $2000, the distribution gives more weight to the high
consumption outcomes than if the entry point were $500. A psychological explanation is
that if people are unsure about the exact amount, the entry point will serve as an anchor
that provides some information about their own amount. This phenomenon is known as
anchoring (see Tversky and Kahneman, 1974).




                                              2
       The literature shows that anchoring exists and becomes more prominent the more
uncertain the respondent is about the exact answer (see, for example, Jacowitz and
Kahneman, 1995). In order to use the answers to unfolding bracket questions for
meaningful analysis, the possibility of an anchoring bias needs to be taken into account.
Several models for what the answers to bracket questions look like if they suffer from
anchoring have been introduced and estimated, using different sources of experimental
data with random entry points. Examples are Hurd et al. (1998), Herriges and Shogren
(1996), and Cameron and Quiggin (1994). A comparison between competing models for
anchoring, however, has not yet been performed.
       In this paper, some existing models for anchoring are considered and their
implications are analyzed for differences between the true distribution of the variable of
interest and the distribution obtained if anchoring according to a given model is present.
Experimental data on household consumption from the AHEAD 1995 survey will then be
used to test some of these implications. The specific feature of these experimental data on
total family consumption is that the sample is randomly split in respondents that start
with an open question - and get follow-up brackets if they do not answer that - and
respondents who are immediately directed to the unfolding bracket questions without
being asked an open question (see Hurd et al., 1998). Although in the first sub-sample
initial non-response is substantial and respondents to the open-ended question are
probably not a random sub-sample, it will be shown that comparing the combined
distribution of open responses and bracket responses in the first sub-population with the
distribution in the sub-population of immediate bracket responses provides a test for
certain types of anchoring.
       Another problem that leads to incorrect answers in an unfolding bracket design is
acquiescence or “yea- saying” This is the problem that people have a tendency to answer
yes rather than no. See Schuman and Presser (1981) or Hurd (1999). It implies that
answers may depend on the wording of the question. For example, the number of “yes”
answers to the question “Was it 2000 or more?” will be higher than the number of “no”
answers to the question “Was it less than 2000?” The design of the experimental data
used here makes the answers vulnerable to yea-saying.




                                             3
       The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, some
existing models for anchoring are reviewed. In Section 3, we describe the experimental
data. Section 4 explains how these data can be used to distinguish between anchoring
models in a simple, nonparametric framework. This is applied in Section 5. In sections 4
and 5, full non-respondents who provide neither open-ended nor bracket information are
discarded. Section 6 takes them into account, using Manski’s worst-case bounds (Manski
1989). Section 7 incorporates a simple way of “fixed probability” anchoring and
acquiescence in the model and leads to the conclusion that acquiescence alone can
explain the rejections in Section 5. Moreover, it shows that ignoring the acquiescence
problem leads to misleading conclusions about selectivity of open-ended answers and the
distribution of consumption that we are ultimately interested in. It also looks at estimates
of the acquiescence problem for different groups, defined by, for example, education
level or memory skills. Section 8 concludes.


2. Anchoring Models and Acquiescence Bias
An intuitively appealing anchoring model is the fixed-point model used by Herriges and
Shogren (1996), Hurd (1997), O’Connor et al. (1999), and Hurd et al. (2001). In this
model, the entry point E in the first bracket question serves as an anchor for follow-up
questions. In the second bracket question the respondent does not compare E to the true
amount Y, but to the weighted mean Y* = (1-α)Y + αE for some α between 0 and 1. The
intuition is that the respondent is uncertain about the true amount. The entry point E is
seen as an indication of what Y could be, and the respondent’s updated estimate Y* is
drawn towards E. Herriges and Shogren (1996) apply their model to data on willingness
to pay for water quality improvement and find an estimate for α of 0.36, with standard
error 0.14. They also discuss the possibility that α varies with Y and E.
       An important feature of the fixed-point model is that answers to the first bracket
question are not affected. Although the respondent’s estimate of the true amount will be
drawn towards the entry point, it will remain on the same side. Thus if anchoring
according to the fixed-point model is the only source of incorrect answers, answers to the
first bracket question can be taken at face value. The fixed-point model can be interpreted




                                               4
as a Bayesian model, where respondents update their beliefs about an unknown amount if
new information (in the form of an entry point or other bracket point) arrives.
       Jacowitz and Kahneman (1995) and Green et al. (1998) find evidence suggesting
that respondents already give biased answers to the first bracket question. For estimates
of objective quantities as well as willingness to pay for public goods, they find that, for
high entry point values, the proportion of bracket respondents who report that the amount
is larger than the entry point value exceeds the fraction of open-ended answers larger than
the entry point value.
       Hurd et al. (1998) specify a parametric model that captures this phenomenon in a
symmetric way, biasing probabilities smaller than 0.5 upwards and probabilities larger
than 0.5 downward. The idea is that respondents do not compare the true value Y to the
entry point E, but instead compare Y to E+ε, where ε is a mean zero error term, assumed
to be normal and independent of all other components of the model. Hurd et al. (1998)
use the same device also at follow-up bracket questions, with independent errors that can
have a different variance. The model is called a gating model, since respondents have to
pass a number of gates to reach their final bracket answer.
       Somewhat similar, though not yet applied in this context, are the models for
binary regression with contaminated data (e.g., Copas, 1988) or misclassification (e.g.
Hausman et al., 1998). Assume that with some fixed “gating” probability P(Gat), people
give the wrong answer. It implies P[“no”] = P[Y<E](1-P(Gat)) + P[Y≥E]P(Gat) and
P[“yes”] = P[Y≥E](1-P(Gat)) + P[Y<E]P(Gat). If this probability does not depend on the
true value and is thus the same whether the true amount is larger or smaller than the entry
point, the reported probabilities will be too large if they are larger than 0.5 and too small
if they are smaller than 0.5.
       A direct test of yea-saying is preformed by Hurd (1999). He uses experimental
data from the 1996 wave of the Health and Retirement Study, a representative sample of
the US population aged 54-64 with their spouses. Respondents were asked “About how
much could you sell your home for in today’s housing market?” They were forced into
brackets and were randomly assigned to an entry point (E=$50,000, E=$100,000 or
E=$150,000) and to a question format: “Would it be more than E,” “Would it be E or
more?” or “Would it be less than E or more than E?” He found that the first two


                                             5
(unbalanced) formats led to many more “yes” answers than the third (balanced) format
for non-financial respondents, while there was hardly any difference for financial
respondents (i.e., the person in the household most knowledgeable in financial matters).
He interpreted this as evidence of acquiescence related to uncertainty. Acquiescence bias
is also a well-known problem in the willingness-to-pay (WTP) literature. For example,
Boyle et al. (1998) find evidence of yea-saying for bid levels in the upper tail by
comparing open-ended answers and bracket answers on the WTP for a moose hunting
site. On the other hand, Frykblom and Shogren (2000) used experimental data to compare
open-ended and discrete choice answers on students’ WTP for a book (“The
Environment”) and found no differences, leading them to conclude that problems with
discrete choice answers can be due to how the survey is framed rather than to the
questions themselves.


3. The AHEAD Wave 2 Consumption Experiment
We use basically the same data as Hurd et al. (1998), who describe the data in detail. The
AHEAD panel (Assets and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old) is roughly
representative for the US population over 70 and their spouses. The second wave was
mainly done by telephone interviews in 1995. At the end of the regular survey, regular
AHEAD participants were asked to complete an additional experimental module. About
75% of all respondents were willing to do this. This is the sample used by Hurd et al.
(1998) and for this study.
         The participants in the experimental module were randomly separated into 7
groups of approximately equal size. All these groups got some questions on household
consumption in the last month, but the question format differed across the seven groups.
Three groups (sample I) started with an open question: “How much did your household
spend on consumption in the past month?”2 Those who answered “don’t know” or
“refuse” then got unfolding bracket questions, with different entry points for the three
groups. The first unfolding bracket question was formulated as “Would the amount be $E

2
  The exact wording of the question was: “About how much did you and your household spend on
everything in the past month? Please think about all bills such as rent, mortgage loan payments, utility and
other bills, as well as all expenses such as food, clothing, transportation, entertainment and any other
expenses you and your household may have.”



                                                      6
or more in the past month?” with E=500, E=1000 or E=2000. If a respondent answered
“don’t know” or “refuse” to a bracket question, the sequence was stopped. The other four
groups (sample II) immediately were given bracket questions, with different entry points
for the four groups (500, 1000, 2000 and 5000).
       This sample consists of 4928 observations. About 2.6% of them did not give an
answer to either an open-ended question or a follow-up or direct bracket question; these
observations are discarded for the main part of the analysis but will be incorporated in
Section 6. This leaves 4759 observations. About 42% of them (sample I) started with an
open question. Almost two thirds of these gave an open-ended answer (1416
observations). The remaining 681 gave at least one bracket answer. The first panel of
Table 1 presents the fractions with consumption less than each of the entry point values
in the open-ended answers and according to the follow-up bracket answers, separately for
the three entry point groups. There are several explanations for differences between open-
ended answers and the bracket answers and between bracket answers with different entry
points. High consumption families could be more concerned about their privacy and less
willing to give a precise number, i.e., open-ended answers could under-represent high
amounts (selection into open answers is correlated with consumption level, i.e., missing
values in open-ended answers are not completely random). Alternatively, respondents
could make mistakes in either the open-ended answers or in their bracket answers or
both. In particular, the difference between the distributions of bracket responses for the
three entry points suggest that some bracket answers may depend on the (randomly
assigned) entry point. In other words, there is an anchoring problem. Significance levels
are rather low, however, due to the relatively small numbers of observations.

Note: respondents who answer neither an open question nor the first bracket
question are not included.



The bottom panel of Table 1 shows the distributions for the immediate bracket
respondents by entry point. Again, non-random response behavior might in principle
explain why the open-ended answers tend to be small compared to the bracket responses.
A salient feature of the figure is the fact that the distribution shifts with the entry point. In
this case the numbers of observations are much larger and most of the differences are
significant. The anchoring models discussed in the previous section provide several
explanations for these differences.
        There seems to be common agreement in the literature that fixed-point anchoring
affects the answers to bracket questions from the second bracket question onwards. The
entry point in the first bracket question acts as an anchor and the respondent’s estimate is



                                                 8
pushed towards it. This phenomenon makes intuitive sense and is studied relatively often
in the literature and is not the issue of the current paper. Fixed-point anchoring,
however, does not affect the answer to the first bracket question. In this paper we focus
on errors in answers to the first bracket questions. We do not analyze the answers to the
later bracket question, thus avoiding the need to cope with fixed-point anchoring.
         Our nonparametric testing strategy is illustrated in Figure 1, which is largely
derived from the numbers in Table 1. The solid line is the empirical distribution of open-
ended answers. The other curves use only the answers to the first bracket question to
estimate the distributions for the samples of immediate bracket respondents and follow-
up bracket respondents. For example, for the immediate bracket respondents, the fraction
of households with consumption less than $2000 is based upon the group of immediate
respondents who got $2000 as their entry point. This is the point (20,0.701) on the short-
dashed dash-dotted curve in Figure 1. Similarly, the fraction of households with
consumption less than $1000 is based upon the sub-sample of immediate bracket
respondents with entry point $1000, etc.
         The three distributions in Figure 1 will differ if non-response to the open-ended
question is non-random. If all answers are correct, 81.0% in the sub-sample of sample I
that gave an open-ended answer have consumption less than $2000, compared to 75.1%
in the sub-sample who gave a follow-up bracket answer. There is no reason why these
two numbers should be estimates of the same thing, since whether or not a respondent
gives an open answer may be correlated with the level of household consumption
(missing open answers are nonrandom; selective non-response). An estimate for the
fraction of people with household consumption less than $2000 in the total population of
interest on the basis of sample I is 0.675*0.81+0.325*0.751=0.791. Under the assumption
that all answers are correct, this estimate is consistent under any form of selective non-
response between open answers and follow-up bracket answers.3 The open-ended
answers (solid curve) might be negatively selected, implying that follow-up bracket
answers (long-dashed curve) are positively selected.


3
  It is assumed that selection does not depend on whether the follow-up bracket questions start with $500,
$1000 or $2000. This seems quite reasonable since entry points are assigned randomly and people do not
know their entry point at the time they have to decide whether to give an open answer or not. Moreover,
this can easily be tested for and is not rejected.


                                                     9
        The immediate bracket responses are, because of the random assignment, drawn
from the same population as the combined sample of open-ended and follow-up bracket
respondents. This implies that, if all answers to open-ended questions and first bracket
questions are correct, the distribution of immediate bracket respondents should be a
weighted mean of the other two distributions. Figure 1 suggests this is not the case; the
point estimate for sample II is only 0.701. In the next section, we develop a formal test
based upon this intuition that looks at these differences at several entry points.

4. Testing the Fixed-Point Model of Anchoring
A major distinction between the models discussed in section 2 is their implication for the
first bracket point. The fixed-point model assumes that the entry point acts as an anchor
for later bracket questions but does not affect whether the amount is larger or smaller
than or equal to the first entry point itself, and therefore does not lead to an incorrect
answer to the first bracket question. In other words, the fixed-point model implies that
anchoring does not bias the answers to the first bracket question. The same applies to any
Bayesian model: the first entry point leads to an update of prior information, but will not
move the mean or any other location measure of the respondent’s subjective distribution
past the entry point. Thus a Bayesian model will not lead to biased answers to the first
bracket question.
        The gating model, on the other hand, assumes that errors can be made at every
bracket question, including the first one. Explaining the stylized fact that the distribution
shifts in the direction of the first entry point even requires that the errors made in the first
question are typically larger than those in the later stages of the unfolding bracket design
(Hurd et al., 1998). Under plausible distributional assumptions, the gating model implies
that bracket answers give too high probabilities of both very low outcomes and very high
outcomes. If Y is consumption, then, according to the gating model, the fraction of “no”
answers in bracket responses will overestimate P[Y<E] if the entry point E is, for
example, the first decile of the consumption distribution, and the fraction of “yes” bracket
responses will overestimate P[Y≥E] if E is, for example, the ninth decile. The gating bias
on the estimate of P[Y<E] is unclear (zero in case of complete symmetry) if E is the
median.

       Since all the questions in the experiment are of the form “Is it E or more?”
acquiescence bias always goes in one direction: P[Y<E] will be underestimated, P[Y≥E]
will be overestimated, no matter whether E is larger or smaller than (or equal to) the
median.
       If samples of open-ended answers and bracket answers drawn randomly from the
same population would be available, the arguments given above would make it possible
to test the joint null hypothesis of no acquiescence bias and no anchoring in the first
bracket question, i.e., anchoring according to the fixed-point model or a Bayesian model,
but not according to a gating model. Moreover, if this null hypothesis would be rejected,
looking at what happens at a low entry point would make it possible to say whether yea-
saying or anchoring according to the gating model is the main reason for rejection. If
there is yea-saying, the bracket answers will lead to a larger estimate of P[Y≥E] than the
open-ended answers whether E is large or small, but if there is gating, the bracket
answers based estimate of P[Y≥E] will be smaller when E is small.
       The reality of the experiment, however, is slightly more complicated. First, there
are respondents who do not reveal any information. In the sample of immediate bracket
respondents (sample II), these are the respondents that do not answer the first bracket
question. In the sample of those who start with an open-ended question (sample I), some
people answer neither the open-ended nor the first bracket question in the follow-up
unfolding brackets design (i.e., they always answer “don’t know” or “refuse”). We will
assume that the groups of complete non-respondents are the same in the two sub-samples.
That is, we assume that people who do not answer an initial bracket question would also
not have answered an open-ended question, and people who do not answer a follow-up
bracket question would not have answered the same bracket question either if it had been
preceded by an open-ended question. In other words: the population actually analyzed
excludes the people who do not reveal any information at all, and we assume that both
samples (I and II) are random samples from this population. Appendix A presents
detailed information on complete non-response for each group. It suggests that no
systematic differences between samples I and II can be detected, backing up the
assumption that is made. Moreover, in section 6 we show how the assumption can be
relaxed using Manski bounds (Manski 1989).


                                             11
       Second, there is a substantial number of respondents in sample I who do not
answer the open-ended question but do answer one or more follow-up bracket questions.
Whether someone in sample I gives an open-ended answer or a bracket answer may very
well be non-random, in which case ignoring the bracket respondents in sample I leads to
selection bias. The bracket responses in sample I may suffer from the same anchoring or
acquiescence biases as those in sample II. We will combine estimates of P[Y<E] for
various (entry point) values of E in the sub-samples of open-ended and bracket
respondents in sample I and compare them with estimates on sample II. We will only use
the open answers and the first bracket questions, and not the information in other bracket
questions: the latter would suffer from anchoring in any anchoring model, including the
fixed-point model. Under our null hypothesis, answers to the first bracket question will
not suffer from anchoring in either group, and the difference between the sample I and II
based estimates should be insignificant. Under the alternative, both the sample I and the
sample II based estimates will be biased. Since the majority of the sample I answers are
open answers, however – which are assumed to be always correct under the null as well
as the alternative – the bias is expected to be larger in sample II than in sample I. This
will drive the power of the test and will tell us how to interpret deviations from the null.
       To make this more precise, some notation is needed. First consider sample I
(excluding complete non-respondents). Let P[O] denote the probability that an open
answer is given. For E=500, 1000 or 2000, let P[Y<E|O] be the (population) fraction of
people with consumption less than E among those who give an open answer.
       Let P[Y <r E|B] be the fraction among initial non-respondents who, if their entry
point is E, report that their consumption is less than E. Under the null hypothesis, the
fraction P[Y <r E|B] is equal to the fraction P[Y < E|B] of initial non-respondents whose
true consumption level is less than E. Due to selective initial non-response, P[Y < E|B]
and P[Y<E|O] can be different, so that P[Y <r E|B] and [Y<E|O] can also be different,
even under the null.
       With the survey design of sample I, the fraction of people who report
consumption less than E in the whole population (again, excluding full non-respondents,
as explained above) is equal to




                                              12
        P[Y<r E|I] = P[O] P[Y<E|O] + (1-P[O]) P[Y <r E|B].


Under the null hypothesis, this is equal to the fraction of people with actual consumption
less than E, given by


        P[Y< E|I] = P[O] P[Y<E|O] + (1-P[O]) P[Y < E|B].


        Sample II (excluding full non-respondents) is drawn from the same population. It
gives a direct estimate of P[Y <r E|II], the probability that someone who gets an initial
bracket question with entry point E reports that consumption is lower than E. Under the
null, P[Y<E|II] = P[Y<rE|II]. Since I and II are from the same population, P[Y<E|II] =
P[Y<E|I] (= P[Y<E], the fraction in the population with consumption below E). Under
the alternative, both P[Y <r E|I] and P[Y <r E|II] will be different from P[Y<E], and the
sign of the difference depends on the nature of the alternative and the position of E in the
distribution of Y. It seems likely that P[Y<r E|I] will then be closer to P[Y<E] than P[Y<r
E |II], since the bias is attenuated by the open-ended responses (which are assumed to be
always correct). Thus comparing estimates of P[Y<r E|I] and P[Y<r E|II] will give us an
idea of the sign of the bias.
        The easiest way to implement the joint test for the three entry points E=500, 1000
and 2000 is to formulate the above as a model that can be estimated by maximum
likelihood and perform a likelihood ratio test. To account for bunching at the entry points
in the open answers, which is evident in Figure 1, we explicitly estimate mass point
probabilities for the outcomes 500, 1000 and 2000. The complete unrestricted model has
thirteen parameters: P[Y<500|O], P[Y=500|O], P[500<Y<1000|O], …. P[Y=2000|O],
P[Y<r 500|B], P[Y<r 1000|B], P[Y<r 2000|B], P[Y<r 500|II], P[Y<r 1000|II] and P[Y<r
2000|II]. The three restrictions to be tested are P[Y<r E|II]=P[O]P[Y<E|O]+(1-
P[O])P[Y<r E|B], E=500,1000,2000, where P[Y<1000|O] = P[Y<500|O] + P[Y=500|O] +
P[500<Y<1000|O], and P[Y<2000|O] is defined similarly.4 The unrestricted ML

 We cannot use P[Y<5000] since there is no group of follow-up bracket respondents with entry point
$5000, making it impossible to estimate P[Y<r 5000|B].


                                                  13
estimates are given by the corresponding sub-sample fractions. The restricted estimates
have to be determined numerically.


5. Results
Table 2 presents the unrestricted and restricted estimates using the complete samples of
continuous and bracket respondents. The null hypothesis is clearly rejected. Comparing
the implied estimates P[Y<r E|I] with the estimates of P[Y<r E|II] in the unrestricted
model gives some idea why this is the case. The estimates of P[Y<r 500|I] and P[Y<r 500
|II] are not significantly different (t-value of the difference: 0.4). The estimate of P[Y<r
1000|I] is significantly larger than the estimate of P[Y<r 1000|II] (t-value: 2.3). Since this
entry point is close to the median, it seems implausible that this is due to gating. On the
other hand, it could very well be due to acquiescence bias, implying that too many people
give an affirmative answer to the question whether their consumption is at least $1000.
Similarly, the finding that P[Y<r 2000|I] is significantly larger than the estimate of P[Y<r
2000|II] (t-value 3.9) could also be due to acquiescence bias. This finding, however,
would also be in line with gating, since it implies a higher probability of an “extreme”
outcome (>2000) for bracket answers than for continuous answers.
       Qualitatively, one interpretation of these results seems to be a combination of
acquiescence bias and gating. The acquiescence bias makes P[Y<r E|II] smaller than
P[Y<r E|I] for all E. Gating at 500 increases P[Y<r 500|II] more than P[Y<r 500|I]. Thus
for E=500, the two effects are opposite and almost cancel, apparently. For E=1000 there
is no strong gating effect and the acquiescence bias raises P[Y<r E|II] more than P[Y<r
E|I]. For E=2000, gating and acquiescence bias are in the same direction, explaining why
in this case, the difference between P[Y<r E|II] and P[Y<r E|I] is particularly large.
       As we will show in Section 7, however, this explanation is likely to be incorrect.
The effect of acquiescence will automatically be increasing with the entry point, because
only those whose correct answer is “no” can make an acquiescence error. Few
respondents have monthly household consumption less than $500 and should answer
“no” if the entry point is $500, but many more have consumption level less than $2000
and should answer “no” if the entry point is $2000. If the acquiescence probability is the




                                              14
same for everyone, we can therefore expect more incorrect answers at $2000 than at
$500.

        A potential caveat of our analysis might be the way in which we treat the focal
points in the open-ended answers, particularly since the entry points are also focal points.
In the approach discussed above, we have taken the answers literally and have used a
mixed distribution for the open-ended answers. For the bracket answers, we have taken
“E or more” literally also, including those with consumption exactly equal to E. An
alternative would be to interpret the open-ended focal point reports as rounded values,
assuming that the underlying distribution of true consumption values is continuous. This
would mean that we would have to add about 0.5P[Y=E|O] to P[Y<E|O] before carrying
out the test. It would lead to even higher values of P[Y<r E|I] and would increase the
deviations between P[Y<r E|I] and P[Y<r E|II], thus further increasing the value of the



                                             15
test statistic. This would not change the qualitative conclusion of the test, but it would
make the case for an acquiescence bias even stronger.
       According to Hurd (1999), acquiescence bias and anchoring become more
important if respondents are more uncertain about the actual amounts. Hurd (1999)
analyzes experimental data on asset holdings, and finds that the answers of the financial
respondent – the person in the household who is more knowledgeable in financial matters
and answers most of the financial questions – are hardly subject to acquiescence bias,
while for others, acquiescence bias is quite prominent. We can check whether this also
applies to consumption by considering financial respondents (almost 75% of the sample)
and other respondents separately.

        The estimates of the unrestricted model and the restricted likelihood for both
groups are presented in Table 3. The underlying distributions are obviously different: all
nonfinancial respondents are married and therefore are in high consumption households,
on average, whereas some financial respondents are single and therefore more often in
low consumption households. The probability of a focal point answer is smaller for
financial respondents than for others, already suggesting that financial respondents are
less uncertain about their consumption levels than others. However, the null hypothesis of
neither gating nor acquiescence bias is rejected for both financial respondents and others.
The deviations between estimates of P[Y<r E|I] and P[Y<r E|II] are similar for the
smallest and largest entry points E=$500 and E=$2000. The t-statistics on these
differences are 0.1 and 0.8 at E=$500, and 3.3 and 2.0 at E=$2000, for financial
respondents and others, respectively. Only for the intermediate entry point E=$1000, it
seems that the (acquiescence) bias is smaller for financial respondents than for others.
Here the t-test does not reject equality for financial respondents (t-statistic 1.3), while it
does reject equality for others (t-statistic 2.8).


6. Relaxing the Assumptions about Full Non-response
Until now we have assumed that there is no selective complete non-response, i.e., the
respondents in sample I who neither give an open-ended nor a bracket answer have the
same consumption distribution as the respondents in sample II who do not give any
bracket answers. In this section we will investigate whether the result obtained above
could be due to that assumption instead of to acquiescence and/or gating.
        There are several types of non-response. First, the experimental module is given
to the respondents at the end of the interview, and before it starts, respondents are
explicitly asked whether they are willing to cooperate. About 19.2% of all respondents
are not willing to cooperate and thus do not answer any of the questions in the
experimental module. Since this selection takes place before respondents know which
experimental module they are assigned to (and do not know whether they will be in
sample I or sample II), it seems quite reasonable that this selection is not systematically
different for the two samples. It may mean that both samples are no longer representative




                                                17
of the population we would ultimately be interested in but will not invalidate the test
discussed in the previous sections.
       Of the remaining respondents, 0.87% stop somewhere during the experimental
module, before coming to the consumption questions (0.83% in sample I, 0.94% in
sample II). The samples are split into seven sub-samples (three in sample I, four in
sample II) that do not get exactly the same questions, but there seems to be no reason for
any systematic difference between samples I and II. It thus seems reasonable to treat
these non-respondents to the consumption questions in the same way as those who did
not want to participate in the modules. Since they stop before they know which
consumption questions they will get, we will assume that their consumption distributions
are not systematically different for the two samples.
       We can therefore condition on not opting out before the consumption questions
start and focus on the third type of full non-response. In sample I, 2.37% of all
respondents answer “don’t know” or “refuse” to the open-ended consumption question
and subsequently also answer “don’t know” or “refuse” to the first follow-up bracket
question. In sample II, 2.74% answer “don’t know” or “refuse” to the first bracket
question. Since the survey designs are systematically different here – an open-ended
question first versus forced brackets – selection into full non-response might be different
for the two samples. We will now check whether such differences could explain the test
results in the previous section.
       Without further assumptions, even under the null hypothesis of correct answers
only, the probability P[Y<E] is no longer identified if full non-respondents are included
in the population. The reason is that nothing is known about the values of Y for the full
non-respondents. We can, however, apply Manski (1989, 1995) to obtain upper and lower
bounds for the probabilities. In that way we can, under the null hypothesis, construct
intervals for P[Y<E] on the basis of I and II. Under the null hypothesis these intervals
should both contain the common value P[Y<E]. To take account of sampling uncertainty,
we will construct confidence bands for the lower and upper bounds of the intervals and
thus construct intervals that contain the Manski bounds with at least 95% confidence. The
test will then be based upon comparing the intervals based upon samples I and II.




                                             18
        To make this more precise some notation needs to be introduced. For sample I,
there are three types of response behavior, open-ended (O), bracket (B) or none at all (N),
with probabilities P[O|I], P[B|I] and P[N|I]=1-P[O|I]-P[B|I]. The probabilities that were
used in the previous section were conditional on giving some response, i.e., on not N.
Under the null hypothesis that all bracket answers are correct, Table 2 thus gives the
estimates (with standard errors in parentheses) 0.1783 (0.0186), 0.4901 (0.0253) and
0.7943 (0.0142) of P[Y<E|not N, I], for E=500, 1000 and 2000, respectively. The
probabilities that are not conditional upon some response are P[Y<E|I] = (1-
P[N|I])P[Y<E|not N,I] + P[N|I]P[Y<E|N,I]. Without further assumptions, nothing is
known about P[Y<E|N,I], except of course that it is between 0 and 1. Using this gives the
Manski bounds on P[Y<E|I]:


         (1-P[N|I])P[Y<E|not N,I] 3><(_,@ -P[N|I])P[Y<E|not N,I] +P[N|I]


Similarly, the following Manski bounds can be derived for sample II:


         (1-P[N|II])P[Y<E|not N,II] 3><(_,,@ -P[N|II])P[Y<E|not N,II] +P[N|II]


Applying this to the entry points E=500, 1000 and 2000 gives the following point
estimates of the Manski bounds:


               Sample I               sample II
E=500          [0.1741; 0.1978]       [0.1650; 0.1924]
E=1000         [0.4785; 0.5022]       [0.4053; 0.4327]
E=2000         [0.7755; 0.7992]       [0.6818; 0.7092]


First, consider E=500. The two intervals overlap. If all full non-respondents in sample I
have consumption below $500 and all full non-respondents in sample II have
consumption above $500, the sample I estimate is 0.1978 and the sample II estimate is
0.1650. If both assumptions are reversed, the estimates are 0.1741 and 0.1924. Many
intermediate cases can be thought of for which the two estimates are identical. We



                                            19
already concluded in Section 5 that the difference at $500 can also be explained from
sampling uncertainty – under the assumption that selection into full non-response was the
same, the point estimates are not significantly different. Thus at E=$500, the current
exercise does not add much.
          Now consider E=$1000. Here the two intervals do not overlap. Even if all full
non-respondents in sample II have low consumption and all full non-respondents in
sample I have high consumption, the estimate for sample II (0.4327) remains below that
for sample II (0.4785). If there were no sampling uncertainty, this would mean that the
null hypothesis should be rejected (at the zero significance level). Of course there is
sampling uncertainty, and the question thus becomes whether the upper bound for sample
II is significantly lower than the lower bound for sample I. The standard error on the
difference between these two can be derived along the same lines as in the previous
section and appears to be about 0.033, giving a t-value of about 1.4. In other words, if we
are willing to assume that full non-respondents in the two samples are completely
opposite groups (low consumption versus high consumption), and only consider entry
point E=$1000, then we cannot reject the null hypothesis that all reports are correct at the
5% (or even 10%) two-sided significance level.
          Similarly, considering the entry point E=$2000, the question becomes whether the
upper bound for sample II (0.7092) is significantly different from the lower bound for
sample I (0.7755). In this case, the standard deviation on the difference is about 0.025
and the t-value on the difference becomes 2.6. That is, the null hypothesis of correct
reports only can be rejected at the 5% level, even if we allow for opposite selection into
full non-response in samples I and II. Maintaining the assumption that the open-ended
answers are correct, this provides evidence of anchoring or acquiescence bias in the
bracket answers. The evidence is quite strong in the sense that any type of selection into
full non-response is allowed for, even the most extreme – and obviously not very
plausible – case that all non-respondents in one group are from low consumption (i.e.,
lower than $2000 per month) families while all non-respondents in the other group are
from high consumption families. Imposing more assumptions on response behavior (such
as monotonicity, see Manski 1989) will make the test more powerful and reinforce the
result.



                                             20
         We conclude that the non-respondents cannot explain the variation by entry point,
and that a role remains for gating and acquiescence bias.


7. Fixed Probability Gating and Acquiescence
To investigate more formally whether gating or acquiescence bias (or both) can indeed
explain why the null hypothesis is rejected, the model can be extended with a simple
form of gating and acquiescence bias, using fixed probabilities of acquiescence and
gating. We go back to the assumptions in sections 4 and 5 about full non-response and
consider the subpopulation of respondents who provide either open-ended or bracket
information. First, we assume that there is a fixed fraction of the population that will
automatically answer a bracket question with “yes,” irrespective of the true amount and
the entry point. Second, we assume that in the rest of the population there is a fixed

probability P(Gat) that people give the wrong answer (“yes” if Y<E or “no” if Y E).5

With these two additions to the nonparametric model, the probability that a random
person in the population answers “yes” if the true consumption amount is less than E, is
given by P(Acq) + (1-P(Acq))P(Gat) where P(Acq) is the probability the person is the
acquiescent type. The probability that someone answers “no” if the true amount is at
least E, is given by (1-P(Acq))P(Gat). For the symmetric case with P(Acq)=0, this model
is essentially the same as what Copas (1988, p.234) calls “a simple model for resistant
fitting.” The general case is similar to the misclassification models used by, for example,
Ekholm and Palmgren (1982), Lee and Porter (1984) or Hausman et al. (1998).6
         Adding these features to the unrestricted model gives a model with one parameter
less than the unrestricted model, thus imposing one restriction in the general model. This
restriction is not rejected by a likelihood ratio test: the log likelihood of the new model is
–5456.91, close to the log likelihood of the unrestricted model in Table 2. The results of


5
  With just one observation we cannot distinguish this model of heterogeneity from one in which everyone
in the population has a combination of gating and acquiescence errors such that
P(“yes”|Y<E)>P(“no”|Y>E)>0. For convenience of exposition we adopt the heterogeneity model.
6
  The current model is less general than the models in the literature in the sense that yea-saying works in
only one direction and makes the probability or reporting a “yes” where “no” would be correct larger than
the probability of reporting “no” where “yes” would be correct, but this inequality restriction appears not to
be binding.



                                                     21
this intermediate model are presented in Table 4. The estimates of P(Gat) and P(Acq)
suggest that the latter is much more important than the former: the estimate of the gating
probability is 0.018 with standard error 0.039, while the acquiescence probability is 0.170
with standard error 0.037.
        To explain why the fixed acquiescence probability works well in spite of the
seemingly different biases at the three entry points (revealed by Table 1), consider some
of the results of the model with fixed acquiescence probability but without gating. In this
model, the estimate of P(Acq) is 0.176 (with standard error 0.035) . The estimated
fraction of people with (true) consumption less than $500 is 0.196. The acquiescence bias
in the sample of forced bracket respondents is therefore estimated to be
0.196*0.176=0.034. In sample I, it is about one third as large (since one third goes to
brackets). This would therefore lead to a difference of about 2.3 % points between
samples I and II. At entry point $1000, the estimated acquiescence bias in sample II
would be 0.519*0.176=0.091, leading to a 6.0%-points difference between samples I and
II. At entry point $2000, the difference would be about two thirds of 0.847*0.176=0.149,
i.e., about 10.0%-points. These differences are so close to the observed differences in the
data that the null hypothesis that this simple model is correctly specified cannot be
rejected.
        The other panels of Table 4 present the models with either fixed probability
gating or fixed probability acquiescence. In the model without fixed probability
acquiescence, the gating probability is much larger than if acquiescence is also allowed
for. This model is misspecified, however. In the model without gating, the acquiescence
probability is close to its estimate if gating is also allowed for, as are all the other
parameters. All this suggests that acquiescence alone might explain the anomalies in the
data. In any case, it can explain the result of the nonparametric tests.
        Figure 2 compares the implications for the distribution of consumption of the
three models in Table 4 and the restricted “benchmark” model without gating or
acquiescence in the right hand panel of Table 2. Compared to the benchmark model, the
model allowing for gating only implies a smaller dispersion in the distribution of
consumption. This is because part of the “extreme” bracket answers (“no” at E=$500;
“yes” at E=$2000) are explained by gating rather than true low or high consumption



                                               22
values. While the benchmark model estimates just reflect the observed data, the gating
model recognizes that part of the large dispersion in the observed data is due to gating,
and produces a less dispersed picture of the true consumption values. The differences are
small, however.
       Larger differences arise when acquiescence is allowed for. In this case, allowing
for gating in addition makes no difference – the two curves are virtually the same. But
both imply lower true values of consumption than the models without acquiescence. The
explanation is clear: in the models allowing for yea-saying, some of the “yes” answers to
the bracket questions are explained as yea-saying instead of necessarily reflecting high
consumption values. Thus the model with yea-saying can explain the large number of
“yes” answers without high underlying consumption values.
       The difference can also be explained in terms of selection into open-ended
answers versus bracket response (full non-response is ignored). Although we have not
made the relation between consumption level and willingness to respond to the open-
ended answer explicit yet, the model certainly allows us to do so. Using Bayes rule, the
probability of giving an open-ended answer (in the survey design of sample I) given that
consumption is lower than the entry point level E can be written as:


       P[O|Y<E] = P[O]P[Y<E|O]/(P[O]P[Y<E|O] + {1-P[O]}P[Y<E|B])


All the probabilities on the right hand side can be computed directly from the estimates in
Table 2 or Table 4. For the benchmark (restricted) model in Table 2 we get, for example,
an estimate of 0.684 for P[O|Y<1000]. This is somewhat higher than the estimate of P[O]
which is 0.672. Thus the benchmark model would imply a small (and insignificant)
selection effect, which is positive in the sense that the higher consumption values have
higher probability of self-selection in the bracket
questions.
       According to the most general model in Table 4, however, we get an estimate of
0.638 for P[O|Y<1000], which is much lower than the estimate of 0.675 for P[O]. Thus
the model allowing for acquiescence implies negative selection: respondents with low
consumption more often become bracket respondents. The many “yes” responses in the



                                             23
(follow-up) bracket answers do not always reflect high consumption but can partly be
explained by yea-saying. The distinction between the two explanations is identified
because of the group of forced bracket respondents, which is not subject to selection
effects.

Prior findings in the literature suggest that acquiescence bias should vary with the amount
of uncertainty a subject has about the quantities being queried. Table 5, shows the results
of estimating the model of Table 4 but with acquiescence probabilities only. The
estimations are over a number of sub-samples. For example, we find an acquiescence
probability of 0.147 among financial respondents only. In almost all cases the estimated
acquiescence probability is substantial and its 95% confidence interval does not contain
the value zero. There is some variation across subgroups, but this variation is not very
large and usually insignificant, because of the smaller numbers of observations (and



                                            24
perhaps also the non-parametric nature of the approach). Still, most of the findings are in
line with the notion that people who are more uncertain have a larger probability of
acquiescence.

(including housing and IRAs).
b
  Self-rated memory: Answer to “How would you rate your memory at the present time?”
Possible answers: excellent, very good, good, fair or poor. High is defined as excellent or
very good.
c
  Memory test: number of words immediately recalled from a list of 40 words that are read
to the respondent. High is defined as at least 6 (the maximum was 10).

For example, financial respondents and respondents with high education level are less
subject to yea-saying than others. Using either a self-reported indicator or a test-based
indicator of memory quality, we find that people with better memory are less subject to
yea-saying. There is hardly any relation between age or gender and the tendency of yea-
saying. The income and wealth patterns seem somewhat surprising, with the higher



                                             25
income and higher wealth respondents more subject to yea-saying. As said before,
however, significance levels are low. Only the difference between those with low and
high self-rated memory skills is close to significant at the conventional two-sided 5%
level (t-value 1.91).7



7. Conclusions

In this study, we have investigated the importance of gating and acquiescence bias at the
entry point of an unfolding bracket design. Experimental data on consumption where
respondents are randomly either first given an open-ended question on household
consumption or immediately directed to bracket questions were used to test whether these
phenomena are present without making any model assumptions. The main finding is that
some bias is present even at the entry point. Further analysis – making additional
assumptions on the nature of acquiescence and gating – suggests that acquiescence bias is
the main problem, while gating is less important. For the consumption question at hand,
ignoring acquiescence leads to misleading conclusions on the selective nature of item
non-response and on the inference on the distribution of consumption when selective item
non-response is taken into account. It would lead to overestimation of consumption levels
and underestimation of poverty rates.
         Reducing acquiescence bias in data collection is easy: the bracket questions can
be formulated in a neutral way, asking people to choose a category rather than answering
“yes” or “no”. This has already been implemented in the most recent waves of, for
example, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and AHEAD. The results of this study
suggest that, with these improved questions, it seems at least safe to use the first bracket
question in an unfolding bracket design at face value. Given the evidence in the literature
that anchoring is a problem also in absence of acquiescence bias, this at the same time
means that anchoring at follow up bracket questions must be taken seriously. The fixed
point model for anchoring – or another model with Bayesian learning – in which answers
to the later bracket questions are affected by the entry point may then be a useful tool.

  Since the estimates are based upon two independent samples, the standard deviation of the difference is
the square root of the sum of the squared standard deviations of the two estimates.

Appendix A: Details on the Consumption Data and on Complete Non-Response

Table A1 explains how many respondents were willing and not willing to answer the
experimental modules. About 19.2% of all respondents did not participate.

Table A2 gives an overview of complete item non-response in the consumption question.
It concerns respondents who were willing to answer the questions in the experimental
module. Those who were not willing are excluded; there cannot be any difference in
selection between the groups there, since these respondents refused to do the
experimental module before they knew the questions.

        Groups 3,4,5 and 6 immediately go to the bracket questions. Those who do not
answer the first bracket question are coded as 98 (DK/RF); no distinction between DK
(don’t know) and RF (refuse) is made. There are also some people who have not given
any answer to the first (or other) bracket questions; their answer to the bracket question is
coded as missing, coded as –1 in Table A2. They dropped out during the module, before
coming to the consumption questions.
        Groups 1,2 and 7 first get an open-ended question. Those who answer DK and
then answer DK/RF at the first bracket question are given misc_b1=8; those who answer
RF to the continuous question and then answer DK/RF to the first bracket question get
misc_b1=9. Some people have a missing value for this question (as well as the first
bracket question); they get misc_b1=-1. (This might apply to people in nursing homes for
whom the consumption question is skipped.) All those for whom either continuous or
bracket information is available get misc_b1=0.
        The results show that complete item non-response varies between 2.8% in group 1
and 3.8% in group 6. The differences between the groups are small, and there seem to be
no systematic differences between the continuous groups (1,2,7) and the immediate
bracket respondents (3,4,5,6).
        In Tables A3 and A4, the same thing is done for financial respondents and non-
financial respondents separately. Complete non-response is somewhat more common for
non-financial respondents, but the differences are small. Neither for financial respondents
nor for non-financial respondents, it seems possible to detect any systematic pattern or a
relation between complete non-response and whether a continuous question is asked first.
