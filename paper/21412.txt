                                             ABSTRACT

We investigate the response of small businesses operating as sole proprietorships to Form 1099-K,
an information report released in 2011 which provides the Internal Revenue Service with information
about payment card sales. Theory and distributional analysis isolates affected taxpayers, who report
receipts equal to or slightly exceeding the receipts reported on 1099-K. Information reporting made
these taxpayers more likely to file a return declaring business income, and increased filers’ reported
receipts by up to 24 percent. Taxpayers largely offset increased reported receipts with increased reported
expenses, which do not face information reporting, diminishing the impact on reported net taxable
income.

     Data from randomized audits suggest that, in 2006, $385 billion in taxes
legally owed to the United States government were not remitted, amounting to
about 14.5 percent of total tax payments required by the law (Internal Revenue
Service 2012).          To combat tax evasion, Congress has historically subjected
various types of income to third-party information reporting, which dramatically
increases compliance for those income types. In 2006, for example, 99 percent of
wage and salary income subject to information reporting and withholding was,
according to the IRS, properly reported and taxed, compared to an estimated 44
percent compliance rate for taxable income subject to little or no information
reporting (Internal Revenue Service 2012). While subjecting individual wage and
salary income to information reporting by employers has proved successful at
sustaining very high rates of compliance, tax enforcement for small businesses is
more challenging. Small businesses often collect receipts in cash, keep poor or no
records, have no external financial reporting requirements, and are closely held—
all factors that can facilitate underreporting of tax liability.
     In this paper, we study a recent attempt to curb small-business tax evasion in
the United States. Beginning in 2011, electronic payments received by businesses
(for example, credit card payments) were reported to the IRS and businesses by
the firms processing these payments, via the new Form 1099-K.
     There is good reason to suspect the effect of the Form 1099-K might differ
from that of existing information reporting. Taxpayers can still be non-compliant
by under-reporting their cash receipts, and they can substitute expense over-
reporting for receipt under-reporting.1 Economic theory predicts that businesses
affected by Form 1099-K should report their receipts close to the amount reported
on Form 1099-K. These firms should have (1) a high propensity to under-report
receipts prior to the introduction of information reporting, and/or (2) a high share
of true receipts subjected to information reporting. These two firm-level
characteristics are likely to be closely linked in our setting, due to the paper trail

  Firms could also stop accepting credit cards, incent cash payments by offering discounts for using cash, or
take action to avoid certain thresholds that trigger 1099-K reporting. We are limited by our data in our ability
to detect these responses, but note that any such actions taken by firms would limit the impact of 1099-K.


                                                       1
created by electronic payments.
     We test these predictions using newly available confidential data from the
Internal Revenue Service, consisting of the universe of sole proprietors’ tax
returns (Form 1040, Schedule C) and the information reports received by these
sole proprietors from tax years 2004 to 2012.2 The empirical analysis fails to
uncover a significant effect of Form 1099-K in aggregate, but also confirms the
prediction of the theory: approximately 10 percent of Schedule C firms report
their gross receipts within 5 percent of the gross amount on the 1099-K’s they
receive. We estimate that Form 1099-K caused more than 20 percent of taxpayers
in this particular group to start filing Schedule C. For firms in this group that had
already been filing Schedule C, 1099-K caused increases in reported receipts of
up to 24 percent, although these firms also increased their reported expenses by as
much as 13 percent.
     We conduct additional analysis to deepen our understanding of the results.
First, we examine different reasons a firm might bunch where reported receipts
are equal to or just above the 1099-K amount. Bunching may occur because firms
believe that reporting receipts above the 1099-K amount avoids triggering an
audit by contradicting third-party information, or because all or virtually all of a
firm’s receipts are subjected to information reporting (as may be the case with
exclusively online businesses). Based on their reported sectors (which isolates
firms that are likely accepting some cash) and the types of entities issuing their
1099-K’s (which isolates firms that are likely online-only), we conclude that both
of these potential drivers of bunching in response to Form 1099-K are supported
by the data. Businesses that were previously subjected to information reporting
under Form 1099-MISC were less likely to bunch where receipts approximately
equal 1099-K amounts, but those that did bunch displayed similar increases in

  Note that a more complete analysis of the initiative’s impact would require a review of audit data, but such
audit data will not be available in the near future. Note also that many non-Schedule C entities also receive
the 1099-K, and these are absent from our analysis. In total, 34 percent of the 7.4 million valid, non-duplicate
1099-Ks (see Section 2.3) are matched to a Schedule C.


                                                       2
their reported receipts and expenses.3 We fail to find any substantive differences
based on whether the taxpayer used a paid preparer, and no evidence that the
Form 1099-K caused firms to begin using a paid preparer.
    Taxpayers also bunch where reported receipts are exactly equal to reported
expenses, and firms bunching at where receipts equal the gross 1099-K amount
are disproportionately likely to do so. We also find that the subset of taxpayers
that received Form 1099-K but did not file in previous years were much more
likely to report expenses exactly equal to receipts, consistent with our claim that
increased reporting of receipts (on the intensive and extensive margin) was
accompanied by offsetting increases in expenses. Finally, we examine the
composition of expenses to see precisely where taxpayers increased expense
reporting to offset increased receipts reporting, and find increases occurred
primarily in the “Other Expenses” line item.
    This     paper      contributes      to    the       academic    literature     examining        tax
administration, enforcement and compliance, as detailed in Slemrod and Gillitzer
(2013), and expands this literature to investigate the effects of information
reporting on sole proprietors. The paper also contributes to a nascent but rapidly,
growing empirical literature on tax systems (e.g., Pomeranz 2013; Almunia et al.
2014; Carrillo et al. 2014; Naritomi 2014). Second, policymakers are likely to
find these results useful when considering a further expansion of information
reports or changing the requirements around existing returns. Finally, the results
can be used by the IRS to better target audits toward taxpayers receiving 1099-K
who are relatively unlikely to be reporting truthfully.
II. Background and Institutional Details
    The tax authority’s lack of information is a ubiquitous problem in tax
enforcement, and one that is especially pervasive for smaller businesses where
formal records of financial transactions are often not well maintained. They also
frequently accept payments in difficult-to-monitor cash, exacerbating the tax

  Form 1099-MISC requires that payments of $600 or more for services provided in a given year be reported
to the IRS by the entity purchasing the service.




                                                     3
enforcement problem (Gordon and Li 2009). Indeed, Morse et al. (2009, 39)
assert, based on extensive interviews with small business owners and their
accountants, that income source is “by far the most important determinant of tax
compliance…Taxpayers report cash income less accurately than income subject
to third party reporting.”
          The introduction of Form 1099-K is part of a recent trend in the United
States and elsewhere towards expanding third-party information reporting,
providing tax authorities with relatively objective information from a third party,
thereby the likelihood of detecting evasion and therefore, through a deterrence
effect, increasing compliance at low cost to tax authorities (Lederman 2010).
There is a strong association between the amount of information reporting
associated with a type of income or deduction and the reporting compliance for
that item (Internal Revenue Service 2012; Kleven et al. 2011). Past increases in
information reporting requirements caused dramatic improvements in compliance:
the introduction of the requirement that dependent exemption claims be
accompanied by a Social Security number of the dependent was followed by a
decline of 7 million (mostly fraudulent) claims (Szilagyi 1991).
     The Housing Assistance Act of 2008 required that payment settlement entities
(PSEs) who make payments in settlement of payment card transactions (e.g. Visa)
and third-party-settlement entities (TPSEs, e.g. PayPal) file a Form 1099-K on
behalf of their customers, effective for payments made beginning on January 1,
2011.4 The first information returns for tax year 2011 were provided in early
2012.5 The law mandates that the taxpayer, the IRS, and, in some cases, the state


4
  The introduction of Form 1099-K led to some initial confusion regarding how payers and payees should
comply with the new reporting requirements. In response, in November 2011 the IRS notified taxpayers that
for 2011, taxpayers who demonstrated a “good faith effort” to comply would receive penalty relief for failure
to accurately report information required by the new form. To the extent this was widely known, it might
explain a delayed response until 2012 to the 1099-K initiative.
5
  Throughout the paper, we assume that taxpayer’s behavioral response to the 1099-K occurred, at the
earliest, in 2011. It is possible that taxpayers may have anticipated the 1099-K and increased receipts in 2010.
Such action by taxpayers would work against our finding a response to the 1099-K in 2011. Given the
taxpayers we are examining (relatively unsophisticated Schedule C taxpayers), we consider it most likely that
any response was a reporting response starting in 2011. Incidentally, Google-related 1099-K searches and
searches on IRS.gov for the 1099-K increased dramatically starting in January of 2012. This attention to the
1099-K is mirrored in page view data provided by the IRS—indeed, there were over 850,000 page views on
IRS.gov of 1099-K related web pages during the time period January-April, 2012 (see Hoopes, Reck and


                                                       4
tax agency, receive a 1099-K containing the gross value of transactions, the value
of transactions for each month of the tax year, the gross number of payment
transactions as well as any federal or state income tax withheld.
     Table 1, Panel A provides statistics on taxpayers that file Schedule C and the
gross receipts from Form 1099-K. We provide summary statistics for the year
before and the year after the introduction of Form 1099-K. Of the 23 million
Schedule C filers, about 1 million, or 5.1 percent, received at least one 1099-K.
Those that received a Form 1099-K reported being roughly three times larger than
those that did not, both before and after the introduction of the form. Between 60
and 84 percent of Schedule C filers e-file their return and about 70 percent of
these taxpayers engage a paid preparer to assist with the filing of their return.
     About 10.3 million 1099-Ks were filed in tax year 2011.6 We limit our
analysis to 7.4 million 1099-Ks, due to duplicate filings and other issues.7 Of
these 7.4 million information returns, 2.5 million (34 percent) were matched to
Schedule C taxpayers appearing in our data, representing $160 billion (3 percent)
of the total $5.3 trillion of receipts reported to the IRS on all 10.3 million 1099-Ks
through this new information reporting program. Unmatched 1099-Ks report
information for other types of business entities, such as partnerships. Table 1,
Panel A, also provides summary data for the group of taxpayers receiving 1099-K
who filed in every year from 2004 to 2012. These taxpayers form the balanced
panel used throughout in the paper to study intensive margin effects, and they
tend to report slightly higher receipts than the typical 1099-K recipient. There are
6.6 million taxpayers in the balanced panel, 644,000 of whom received a 1099-K.

IRS.gov data).

  With some exceptions, any entity accepting payment via payment cards or TPSEs should receive a 1099-K.
Some transactions are exempt from the 1099-K filing requirement, including payments to parties outside the
United States. Payments made through third-party settlement organizations such as PayPal are only required
to file Form 1099-K when the annual gross amount of transactions of a business is greater than $20,000 and
the total number of transactions is greater than 200.
7
  The 7.4 million figure excludes 1099-Ks with the same payer TIN-payee TIN combination, which usually
occurs due to the presence of corrected or amended 1099s, but can also be due to a payee filing multiple
Schedule Cs for different businesses. It also excludes returns filed with invalid payee TINs, which cannot be
matched to Schedule Cs, as well as returns filed with an employer identification number (EIN) as the payee
TIN for a non-sole proprietorship business, which should not be matched to Schedule C returns that are
intended for sole proprietorships only. We apply these filters to the full population of 1099-Ks as part of the
Schedule C matching process. Refer to the Online Appendix of this paper for further detail.

      Table 1, Panel B provides details on the different sectors represented by
Schedule C taxpayers. The first column lists the percentage of all Schedule C
taxpayers in a sector that receive a 1099-K at any time (i.e., in 2011 or 2012)
during our sample period. For example, 3.2 percent of independent artists and
38.8 percent of grocery stores in our sample received a 1099-K sometime during
our sample period. The second column tabulates the percentage of all taxpayers in
the sector that receive the much more common 1099-MISC any time in our
sample period. The final column tabulates the percentage of all Schedule C
taxpayers in each sector. In this table, the first 10 sectors (those above the bold
line) represent the 10 highest populated NAICS codes among all Schedule C
taxpayers. The second 10 sectors represent those sectors with the highest
percentage of 1099-K recipients, conditional upon having at least 0.10 percent of
all Schedule C taxpayers in the sector.
III. Conceptual Framework
      In this section we describe a model of the firm’s decision to report receipts
and deductible expenses to a tax authority, based on the seminal theoretical work
of Allingham and Sandmo (1972) and Srinivasan (1973). We only briefly
summarize the theory to motivate our empirical analysis; the Online Appendix
contains more nuanced discussion and exposition. Several of these results are
similar to those of Carrillo et al. (2014), who use a related model to motivate their
analysis of the effects of expanded information reporting in Ecuador.8
      Consider the reporting of receipts and deductible expenses by a risk-neutral
business.9 Firm 𝑖 chooses the level of receipts 𝑅𝑖 and expenses 𝐸𝑖 to report to the
tax authority, given true receipts 𝑄𝑖 , true expenses 𝐷𝑖 and the amount of receipts
reported to the tax authority by third parties, 𝐾𝑖 . The firm’s problem is:
maxRi≥0,𝐸𝑖≥0 𝑄𝑖 − 𝐷𝑖 − 𝑡(𝑅𝑖 − 𝐸𝑖 ) − 𝑝𝑖 (𝑅𝑖 , 𝑄𝑖 , 𝐸𝑖 , 𝐷𝑖 , 𝐾𝑖 )𝑠[(𝑄𝑖 − 𝐷𝑖 ) − (𝑅𝑖 − 𝐸𝑖 )]
(1)

8
  The two approaches were developed independently of one another.
9
  The important predictions of the model discussed here would all obtain if we assumed the firm were risk-
averse rather than risk-neutral. We will not consider real but unobservable decisions, such as output
responses or firms’ attempts to influence the share of receipts subject to information reporting by, for
example, offering discounts for cash payments. While interesting, our data do not provide us a means of
examining them.


                                                    6
where 𝑡 is the income tax rate, assumed to be constant for simplicity, and 𝑝𝑖 (. ) is
the probability of detection and punishment of evasion. In the event that the firm
reports 𝑅𝑖 − 𝐸𝑖 < 𝑄𝑖 − 𝐷𝑖 and is detected, it is subject to a fine equal to the
fraction 𝑠 > 𝑡 on its unreported income.
       We will focus on the case where the firm has positive true profits for
simplicity, so 𝑄𝑖 ≥ 𝐷𝑖 . Using an approach similar to Phillips (2014), we specify a
probability of detection as follows:
                                                    1,            if 𝑅𝑖 < 𝐾𝑖
                    𝑝𝑖 (𝑅𝑖 , 𝐸𝑖 , 𝐾𝑖 ) = {                                   .                     (2)
                                          𝑞𝑖 (𝑅𝑖 , 𝐸𝑖 ),          if 𝑅𝑖 ≥ 𝐾𝑖
where 𝑞𝑖 𝑅 < 0 and 𝑞𝑖 𝐸 > 0. In words, contradicting third-party information
results in immediate detection of any evasion, and otherwise reporting greater
receipts and/or less expenses decreases the probability of detection.
       We will assume the existence of an interior solution with positive receipts and
expenses reported to the tax authority. Solving the firm’s problem and considering
an increase in 𝐾𝑖 yields the following three predictions:
           All firms affected by an increase in third-party reported receipts 𝐾𝑖 , along
       the intensive or extensive margin, report 𝑅𝑖 = 𝐾𝑖 after the increase.
           A firm’s propensity to report 𝑅𝑖 = 𝐾𝑖 is increasing in 𝑄𝑖 /𝐾𝑖 and 𝑞𝑖 𝑅 .
           When 𝑞𝑖 𝐸𝑅 ≤ 0, increases in receipts due to increases in 𝐾𝑖 will be at least
       partially offset by increases in 𝐸𝑖 .10
       These are the three main empirical predictions we test in Section 6. Further
analysis within this conceptual framework suggests that the impact of Form 1099-
K is likely to be heterogeneous, depending on two key factors: a firm’s tendency
to comply prior to the policy change, and the fraction of a firm’s receipts
subjected to information reporting. Factors causing firm-specific variation in prior

10
     The assumption that 𝑞𝑖 𝐸𝑅 ≤ 0 is satisfied when, for example, the probability of detection depends on the
                                         𝑅𝑖 −𝐸𝑖
reported rate of profit, i.e. 𝑞𝑖 = 𝑞 (            ) , with 𝑞′ < 0, 𝑞′′ > 0, as in Carrillo et al (2014), or when the
                                          𝑅𝑖
probability of detection depends only on reported profits i.e. 𝑞𝑖 𝐸𝑅 = 𝑞(𝑅𝑖 − 𝐸𝑖 ) with 𝑞′ < 0, 𝑞′′ > 0. In the
latter case, receipts increases are offset by expense increases exactly one-for-one, a prediction we are unable
to test in our data because we do not observe offsetting behavior cleanly at the individual level: fully
compliant firms that have true receipts increases will also tend to have expense increases. Even if 𝑞𝑖 𝐸𝑅 > 0 ,
the model predicts that some offsetting will occur so long as 𝑞𝑖 𝐸𝑅 is sufficiently small. See the Online
Appendix for further discussion.


                                                              7
compliance include the size of the business, how much income the business
owner has from other sources, the salience of tax enforcement, intrinsic
preferences for compliance (Erard and Feinstein 1994), and, importantly, the
share of transactions conducted in cash, which are more easily hidden from the
tax authority than credit card transactions. The last of these is important because it
can cause prior non-compliance to be correlated with the other key determinant of
the impact of Form 1099-K, the fraction of receipts subjected to information
reporting, in a way that limits the overall impact of Form 1099-K on compliance.
The fraction of receipts subjected to information reporting may also vary by how
much business the firm conducts online and/or with individual consumers (rather
than businesses). Notably for our empirical analysis, online-only businesses will
have all of their receipts subjected to information reporting, and they are likely to
receive 1099-K’s from TPSE’s (such as PayPal) only, rather than payment card
entities. In Section 6 we shed some empirical light on heterogeneous responses to
1099-K using the sectoral composition of the 1099-K recipients that bunch where
reported receipts are close to the gross 1099-K amount, and whether 1099-Ks
came from payment card entities or TPSEs.
     The predictions described above do not rely heavily on the sharp features of
the model. For example, allowing for the possibility that firms in sectors with
high rates of cash use may not wish to report receipts too close to the 1099-K
amount would lead to the prediction that firms affected by 1099-K report receipts
slightly in excess of the 1099-K amount but not exactly equal to it. We could also
allow for the possibility that firms could decrease 𝐾𝑖 at some cost, either by
incentivizing cash payments or by declining to accept some payment methods
subject to information reporting. Our data do not provide a credible means of
examining whether firms respond to the Form 1099-K in this way. If they do,
however, its effect would be smaller than predicted in the model presented here,
but qualitatively similar.11 Finally, we could incorporate into the model the notion


11
   We find no “hole” in the distribution of 1099-K amounts around the de minimis restrictions applying to
third-party network vendors. This fact suggests that firms are not willing and/or able to decrease their receipts
from third-party network transactions to avoid information reporting from third-party network vendors, at

that a firm that does not submit a Schedule C may face a lower probability of
detection than a firm filing a Schedule C and declaring arbitrarily small receipts
and expenses.12
     Several possible additions could yield the prediction that some firms report
𝑅𝑖 = 𝐸𝑖 when they would otherwise report 𝑅𝑖 < 𝐸𝑖 . For example, we could
include in the model aspects of the tax code that limit businesses’ ability to claim
losses (such as hobby loss rules or which expenses are “above-the-line”), an
increase in the perceived detection probability where reported net income
becomes negative in the presence of true profits, or reference dependence in
income reporting, as in Rees-Jones (2014). In every case, these alterations would
yield the prediction that an increase in information reporting increases firms’
propensity to report receipts exactly equal to expenses.
IV. Data
     We examine data from the universe of tax returns and information reports
filed with the Internal Revenue Service, accessed via the Compliance Data
Warehouse (CDW), the IRS’s research repository of tax return data. Specifically,
we use data from taxpayers’ Form 1040 Schedule C from 2004 to 2012, as well as
Form 1099-K and Form 1099-MISC. All identifying information is masked to the
researchers to protect taxpayer privacy. The information reports from the credit
card and other payment processing companies can be matched to the businesses
whose income details are on the Schedule C. Details on the matching and data
gathering process are in the Online Appendix.13
     The implementation of the Form 1099-K program was not randomized, so that
there is not an immediately available control group against which to compare the
behavior of those affected. In our analyses, we construct comparison groups from
(1) taxpayers filing Schedule C but not receiving Form 1099-K, (2) taxpayers

least along the intensive margin. This finding is consistent with the findings of Arango and Taylor (2008) and
Jonker (2011), whose work suggests that many firms have limited capacity to manipulate the share of receipts
from various transactions types.
12
   This extension does weaken the result that every firm affected by Form 1099-K will report receipts equal to
the 1099-K amount. Instead, only some fraction of affected firms will do this.
13
   Note that the dollar figure on the 1099-K does not necessarily exactly match what should be reported as
receipts, due to such item as fees, sales taxes, and merchandise returns; in some cases, the difference could be
substantial. Therefore, it is possible that some firms truthfully report receipts below their 1099-K amount.


                                                       9
receiving Form 1099-MISC in years prior to receiving 1099-K, and (3) in our
preferred analysis, firms with a low fraction of reported receipts reported on Form
1099-K. The comparison of 1099-K recipients and non-recipients is
straightforward; we make no claim however that non-recipients form a valid
control group. The 1099-MISC comparison group is motivated by the notion that
firms already subject to some information reporting may be less affected by
additional information reporting.14 To construct a comparison group based on this
idea, we compare firms receiving 1099-MISC consistently from 2004-2010 to
firms who never received a Form 1099-MISC.
     Motivated by the theory in Section 3, our central research design compares
firms whose reported receipts are well above the gross amount from all Form
1099-Ks to those whose reported receipts are close to the 1099-K. Specifically,
we examine the distribution of the ratio of the 1099-K receipts amount to total
receipts reported on Schedule C, denoted K/R, and we use firms with low values
of K/R as a control group for the estimation of the treatment effect of Form 1099-
K on firms with high values of K/R. In this context, we examine trends in
reporting of receipts, expenses, and net income, as well as filing rates for
Schedule C. Because constructing these groups conditions on firms’ behavior in
2011, we report the results of placebo tests in Section 6.3, using pre-2011
behavior to validate the design. These placebo tests cannot ensure that our
estimates using this design are entirely free of bias, but they do provide a sense of
the magnitude of the bias, suggesting it is quite small relative to the estimated
effects.
     We also analyze extensive margin effects, to see if Form 1099-K caused
individuals to start declaring their small-business receipts and expenses on
Schedule C. Given that we cannot observe any business information for taxpayers
who should have filed Schedule C but did not, we take the approach of
comparing, for firms filing Schedule C in a given year, how likely that firm was

14
   In fact, some payments previously subjected to reporting under Form 1099-MISC—namely those
transacted via payment card or TPSE—were subsumed by Form 1099-K, so that the payer was no longer
required to file a 1099-MISC. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many people may not have understood this
change in filing requirements, at least at first, so we do not attempt to use it directly to aid in identification.


                                                       10
to have filed in prior years, which sheds some light on how many would have
filed in the absence of information reporting.
       To facilitate interpretation of our results, it is useful to employ at least coarse
proxies for the share of a firm’s true receipts subject to information reporting.
Doing so helps us distinguish between the possibility that (1) firms report close to
the 1099-K amount because their true receipts are close to the amount reported to
the tax authority from the possibility that (2) firms report close to the 1099-K
amount in response to a perceived audit threat of reporting less receipts than
receipts reported to the IRS. Because exact measures of the share of true receipts
subject to information reporting are not available in the data, we take two indirect
approaches, one based on the firm’s self-reported sector and the other based on
the nature of the entity issuing the 1099-K. First, we select firms in sectors that
are likely to have a substantial fraction of receipts in cash. In one specification we
restrict our analysis to firms that prior work by Frisch (2005) suggests have either
an especially high or especially low rate of payment-card acceptance.15 In another
specification, we focus on firms in sectors where the overall share of firms
receiving Form 1099-K is especially high or low. Second, we utilize additional
information captured from 1099-Ks in 2012 only, which tells us whether the
reporting entity was a payment card entity or a TPSE. We use this to compare
firms receiving 1099-Ks from payment card entities only with those receiving
1099-K from TPSEs only. The latter in particular are much more likely to be an
electronic business with a high share of sales, perhaps 100 percent of sales, done
via transactions subject to 1099-K reporting.
V. Aggregated Time-Series Analyses
A. Overall aggregates
       As a first pass we examine the population micro-data in order to focus on the
firms actually subject to 1099-K reporting. Figure 1 Panel A demonstrates that the
aggregate reporting of net income by Schedule C taxpayers did not increase
suddenly with the introduction of the form. Next we focus on receipts growth in


15
     We thank Fumiko Hayashi for providing us this data.


                                                     11
more detail. We restrict our attention to taxpayers filing a Schedule C in each year
of 2004-2012, and focus on receipts growth. We use the logarithmic
transformation for receipts and expenses because these variables are distributed
approximately log-normally in the data, and because it provides a simple way of
calculating the mean growth rate, which equals the first difference of the mean of
the log of receipts. We graph the mean growth rates over time in Figure 1 Panel
B. Those receiving a Form 1099-K in either 2011 or 2012, but not in both years,
are excluded from this graph.16 It is evident that the reported receipts of firms that
received a 1099-K grew more quickly from 2010 to 2011 one average than non-
recipients. However, they also grew at a comparable rate between each pair of
years from 2004 to 2010. In order to interpret any change in aggregates over time
causally, we require a comparison group whose behavior yields a valid
counterfactual for growth in the absence of 1099-K—Figure 1 Panel B indicates
that Schedule C filers not receiving a 1099-K do not convincingly qualify. Given
that the most obvious comparison group does not qualify, below we pursue
alternative strategies for constructing a control group.
B. Graphical examination of subsets of firms
     We next look at aggregate time-series data for subsets of firms relatively more
or less likely to be affected by the 1099-K, to see if a diverging trend begins in
2011. Theory suggests that if Form 1099-K has an effect in the aggregate, we
should expect reported receipts to increase by more in the group subjected to
information reporting for the first time than in the group subjected to information
reporting in prior years. To test this hypothesis, we use as a control group only
those who received a 1099-MISC, an alternative information report historically
received by many Schedule C filers, in every year of 2004-2010, and compare to
those who received a 1099-MISC in none of those years.17 Panel C of Figure 1


16
   There is a large negative growth rate from 2011 to 2012 for the 2011-only 1099-K recipients that is
attributable to selection out of the 1099-K population. This negative growth rate obscures the more important
patterns in Figure 1 when we include these firms in the analysis.
17
   Many firms file Schedule C in every year but only receive 1099-MISC in some years. If we select on
receiving a 1099-MISC continuously from some year t to 2010, we observe nearly identical trends after t, but,
unsurprisingly, these firms tend to be much smaller on average prior to t. For simplicity we report results only
for the group receiving a Form 1099-MISC in every year prior to 2011.


                                                      12
depicts receipts growth rates based on whether the firm did or did not receive a
1099-MISC prior to 2011, and whether the firm received a 1099-K. The growth
rates for 1099-MISC recipients and non-1099-MISC recipients co-move closely
prior to the introduction of Form 1099-K especially for firms receiving 1099-K,
so that growth rates are nearly identical.
     Given that the common-trend assumption is satisfied, we can more
confidently interpret any divergence in trends occurring in or after 2011 as rising
from the differential impact of 1099-K on the two groups. However, no such
divergence occurs: post-1099-K receipts growth is very similar between the two
groups. The high levels of growth observed in Figure 1 Panel C occur in both
groups, and the very high growth from 2010 to 2011 also occurs in both groups—
as well as the low growth rates in 2012 for both groups. The group of taxpayers
subjected to information reporting for the first time under 1099-K behave no
differently, on average, than the group of taxpayers subject to information
reporting prior to 1099-K due to 1099-MISC, suggesting that the overall initial
deterrence effect of the new form on reporting was minimal. In untabulated
analysis, we observe very similar trends in expense and net income reporting.
VI. Bunching in the Reporting of Receipts and Expenses
     The model we developed earlier predicts that the 1099-K initiative should
create an additional audit threat that causes affected firms to report receipts near
the 1099-K amount. In this section, we take this prediction to data by analyzing
taxpayers’ tendency to report receipts exactly or nearly equal to the amount
reported by Form 1099-K.18 For taxpayers that bunch or report receipts near the
bunching threshold, we examine changes in receipts, expenses, and Schedule C
filing behavior to examine the differential impact of 1099-K on these specific
groups. A secondary bunching analysis concerns taxpayers’ tendency to report


18
   Some credit-card charges reported on 1099-K may not actually be taxable receipts. For example, if a
customer returns an item purchased with a credit card, the charge-back is not deducted from the 1099-K
receipt amount. One unexamined possibility is that while taxpayers understand that having 1099-K receipts
equal to or less than total receipts is important, their total receipts may be less than 1099-K receipts for the
reason stated above. Rather than truthfully allow 1099-K receipts to be more than total receipts, they may
report total receipts exactly equal to 1099-K receipts, and then increase an expense line item, resulting in an
equivalent net income as if receipts had been accurately reported.


                                                      13
receipts exactly or nearly equal to expenses. Next, we examine how bunching for
the same taxpayer changed from 2011 to 2012. Finally, we examine which
specific expense line items increased as a result of the 1099-K initiative.
A. The cross-sectional relationship between receipts and 1099-K amounts
   Figure 2 depicts the distribution of the ratio of 1099-K amounts scaled by
reported receipts, in the top panel among all 1099-K recipients and then in Panel
B zooming in around where the ratio is equal to 1. About 8 percent of the overall
population bunches at a K/R value between 0.9975 and 1.0025 (the bin width in
the Panel B is 0.005). The amount of bunching increased from 2011 to 2012: 9
percent of firms have a ratio between 0.95 and 1.05 in 2011, while in 2012 the
corresponding figure is 11 percent. That this type of bunching increased from
2011 to 2012 is notable because the IRS was presumed to be more heavily relying
on 1099-K reporting for audit allocation decisions in 2012 than in 2011, and
therefore we might expect to see the behavioral responses to 1099-K reporting
increase in 2012.
   Given that we will use the value of K/R in 2011 to construct comparison
groups for estimating the heterogeneous effect of Form 1099-K, it is useful to
know whether firms’ K/R moved significantly from year to year. Table 2 reports a
transition matrix for several bins of K/R between 2011 and 2012. Examining the
entries on and around the diagonal of the table, we can see that among firms filing
Schedule C and receiving a Form 1099-K in 2011 and 2012, most firms had
similar values of K/R in both years. Note, however, that there is substantial
movement into and out of filing a Schedule C and receiving a 1099-K, and that
the rate of churn is especially high for firms reporting their receipts just above or
exactly equal to their 1099-K amount in 2011. We use this last fact in our
interpretation of our extensive margin analysis in Section 6.2.
   Recall that bunching may occur for two distinct reasons—firms may
manipulate receipts to line up with 1099-K receipts, or, they may actually receive
all—or nearly all—of their receipts in forms reported on the 1099-K. To shed
some light on the relative likelihood of these possibilities, we examine the rate of
bunching in several subpopulations. Table 3 tabulates the rate of sharp bunching

                                         14
(bunching exactly at R=K) and diffuse bunching (reporting receipts within 5
percent of the 1099-K amount) for 2011 and 2012 in these subpopulations.
    Column 1 of Table 3 indicates that 3 to 4 percent of firms report receipts
exactly equal to the 1099-K amount, and 9 to 11 percent report receipts very close
to the 1099-K amount. Columns 2 and 3 show that both types of bunching are
significantly more pronounced for new Schedule C filers than for firms filing
Schedule C in every year. About 10 to 12 percent of Schedule C filers who did
not file in the previous year report receipts exactly equal to their 1099-K amount,
compared to just 1 percent of firms who filed in each year covered by our data.
This finding foreshadows the results on extensive margin effects in the next
section. In Columns 4 to 6 of Table 3, we select on whether firms are in sectors
that have high or low rates of cash use according to Frisch’s (2005) data. A high
degree of sharp bunching persists near where receipts equal the gross 1099-K
amount. For firms in sectors that have lower-than-average credit card acceptance
rates (Column 6), we observe slightly less sharp bunching (2-3 percent) and about
the same amount of diffuse bunching (12-14 percent) compared to the population.
Relatedly, the two most common sectors (according to the 6-digit NAICS
classification system) in the bunching population are nail salons (5,756 sharp
bunchers, 8,564 diffuse bunchers), and beauty salons (3,555 sharp bunchers,
6,296 diffuse bunchers). Firms in these sectors likely receive a substantial fraction
of their receipts in cash.
    Columns 7 and 8 present rates of bunching for firms receiving 1099-Ks from
payment cards only or TPSEs only, respectively. Bunching is slightly less
common for firms receiving 1099-K from payment-card-only firms. Strikingly,
bunching is extremely common for firms receiving 1099-K from TPSEs only,
with 17 percent reporting receipts exactly equal to the 1099-K amount and 42
percent reporting receipts very close to the 1099-K amount. We observe nearly
identical results if we perform multivariate probit or logit regression on a binary
dependent variable indicating whether a firm was a sharp or diffuse buncher.
    Theory suggests that firms should bunch if (1) the fraction of true receipts
subjected to information reporting is very high, or (2) the propensity to report

                                         15
truthfully in absence of information reporting is low. The results in Table 3
suggest that both factors matter. Seeing TPSE’s bunch at very high rates implies
that the first channel matters; seeing firms in sectors with high rates of cash use
bunch at high rates suggests the second channel also matters.
     It thus appears that Form 1099-K induces some firms to change their reported
receipts, although the effect we can detect is limited to the roughly 10 percent of
Schedule C filers who receive Form 1099-K and report receipts very close to the
amount reported on the 1099-K. Summary statistics for bunching firms are
provided in Table 4. These firms tend to be significantly smaller than the typical
1099-K recipient. In the next section we reconcile the observation that these
firms’ reporting behavior was affected by Form 1099-K with a difficult-to-detect
aggregate effect.
B. Trends based on percent of reported receipts subject to 1099-K reporting
     In the previous section, we documented a large amount of firms bunching at
or near where reported receipts exactly equal the gross dollar amount of receipts
reported on Form 1099-K. This section analyzes differential post-2010 trends
among 1099-K recipients based on the value of the ratio of the gross amount from
a taxpayer’s 1099-Ks and reported receipts, denoted K/R. If the observed
bunching is an indication that firms respond to Form 1099-K by increasing their
reported receipts, as suggested by the theoretical model in Section 3 and the
evidence in the previous section, then firms with K/R close to one should be the
most likely to have been affected by Form 1099-K.
     Figure 3 depicts annual growth trends of reported receipts, expenses, and net
income, as well as Schedule C filing behavior, based on the value of K/R in 2011.
Note that for firms not receiving a 1099-K, K/R equals zero. The first three panels
analyze trends in reporting for taxpayers filing Schedule C in all years 2004-2012,
and Panel D analyzes the extensive margin of Schedule C filing behavior. 19


19
   As we should expect given Table 2, we obtain nearly identical results for the intensive margin analysis in
here and in Section 6.3 if we condition on K/R in 2012 instead of K/R in 2011. We also obtain nearly
identical intensive margin results if we restrict our analysis to firms filing Schedule C in 2004-2011 instead
of 2004-2012, so we conclude that the potential endogeneity of filing Schedule C in 2012 is not confounding
the results.


                                                     16
     For firms with a total 1099-K amount less than 75 percent of reported receipts
we observe similar growth in receipts in Panels A to those documented above:
growth rates of 3 to 7 percent both before and after the introduction of 1099-K. In
stark contrast, firms with K/R close to 1 report large increases in their receipts and
expenses from 2010 to 2011. In Panel A, we observe 10 to 18 percent growth in
reported receipts for firms with K/R between 0.8 and 1, and almost 30 percent
receipts growth for firms with K=R exactly. These increases are not plausibly
attributable to differing pre-trends, which we should observe if, for example, the
patterns in the 2010-2011 line in the figure were driven by the rapid growth of
(compliant) credit-card only or TPSE-only firms. We plotted receipts growth rates
prior to 2010-2011 for comparison; firms with K/R close to but less than 1 were
growing slightly faster (about 7-11 percent) before the introduction of 1099-K,
but the changes from 2010 to 2011 still represent an enormous deviation from
trend. Firms with K=R exactly actually had a lower growth rate than other firms
prior to the introduction of Form 1099-K.
     Thus, the introduction of the Form 1099-K appears to have had a sizable
impact on the subset of firms that reported receipts close to the amount reported
on the new form. However, this finding is not the end of the story. While rapid
growth in receipts among these firms suggests the possibility that the Form 1099-
K increased reported sole proprietorship income, Panel B of Figure 3 documents a
markedly similar pattern in growth rates of reported expenses. Putting receipts
and expenses together, in Panel C we observe little to no growth in median
incomes attributable to Form 1099-K for firms with K/R close to 1.20 We interpret
these findings as support for the predictions of the theoretical model suggesting
that, when induced to increase their reported receipts in response to new
information reporting, many taxpayers also increased their reported expenses,



20
   We report median rather than average income in Panel C because large outliers frequently occur in the
level of net income. The logarithmic transformation largely eliminates this concern for receipts and expenses
on their own, but we cannot use the logarithmic transformation for net income due to the presence of negative
values of the variable. We observe a qualitatively similar pattern to the one in Panel C of Figure 3 if we
instead plot the change in median income instead of the percent change.


                                                    17
leaving net income largely unaffected.21 In large part because of the increase in
reported expenses, the percent change in median net income was only about 2.5
percent higher than the percent change from the previous year for firms with K/R
close to one, and this is difficult to distinguish from idiosyncratic variation in
median incomes.
     We also find evidence of a large extensive response among the same class of
firms—those with K/R close to one—that is consistent with the theoretical model.
Panel D of Figure 3 shows that firms with K/R close to one in 2011 were
substantially less likely to have filed a Schedule C in prior years. For most values
of K/R significantly below 1, 90 percent of 1099-K recipients in 2011 filed in
2010, while only half of firms reporting K=R filed in the earlier year. The exact
fraction of firms reporting K=R who were caused to file by Form 1099-K is
difficult to pin down. Table 2 suggested that the rate of churn into and out of the
Schedule C filing population was significantly higher for firms reporting K=R
than for firms with low K/R. We perform a conservative calculation of the effect
of 1099-K on Schedule C filing using a rate of entry of 30 percent,22 concluding
that at least 20 percent of firms reporting K=R in 2011 were induced to file
Schedule C by Form 1099-K. Among those with receipts within 5 percent of the
1099-K amount, only 66 percent filed in the previous year. A similar conservative
calculation suggests that at least 23 percent of firms with receipts within 5 percent
of the 1099-K amount were induced to file Schedule C in response to the
introduction of Form 1099-K.23
     We next explore differences in these trends among subgroups of interest.
Figure 4 reports patterns in receipts growth, as in Panel A of the previous figure,



21
   This behavior was also found by Pomeranz (2013) in a very different setting.
22
   We obtain this number by assuming the rate of entry and the rate of exit are roughly the same in absence of
a 1099-K effect (which is suggested by the fact that the rates of entry and exit were both about 10 percent for
the low K/R firms), using the rate of exit of 25 percent for 2011 K=R firms, and adding an extra 5 percent to
make the calculation conservative.
23
   In an untabulated figure, we recreate this graph using predicted Schedule C filing in the previous year
based on a probit estimation of whether the firm is predicted to file in the previous year. The pattern is the
same: even controlling for other factors by including covariates in the prediction regression, K/R=1 firms are
much less likely to have filed in the previous year.


                                                     18
based on characteristics of interest.24 First, motivated by the reasoning in Section
5, we examine firms receiving 1099-MISC from 2004 to 2010 and compare them
to firms never receiving a 1099-MISC. Firms receiving 1099-MISC were far less
likely to report K=R (the second graph in Panel A), but the few hundred firms that
did report K=R after receiving a 1099-MISC actually reported higher receipts
growth from 2010 to 2011 than the firms that did not receive a 1099-MISC. These
are likely firms for whom the 1099-MISC previously only reported some small
fraction of their receipts, while 1099-K reports a larger fraction. Receipts growth
for firms with K/R significantly less than one are very similar for 1099-MISC and
non-1099-MISC firms, which we should expect given the results shown in Figure
1, Panel C.
     Panels B and C of Figure 4 report the same estimates for payment-card-only
and TPSE-only recipients of 1099-K, respectively. We plot these patterns using a
coarser binning of K/R because the latter groups are smaller in the sample of
firms filing Schedule C in all years. The qualitative pattern is the same as before
for both groups: firms with K/R=1 (in 2012, when we have data on entities
issuing 1099-K) experience large receipts growth when 1099-K is introduced in
2011. Other firms grow only very slightly faster from 2010-2011. Perhaps
unsurprisingly given the stark differences in bunching rates between these groups,
however, TPSE-only firms appear much more strongly affected by Form 1099-K
than payment-card only firms.
     We also examine the role of paid preparers in the response to Form 1099-K.
In untabulated analysis, we examine receipts growth by K/R bin separately for
firms that do and do not use a paid preparer in 2011. We observe little difference
in the impact of 1099-K by preparer use. We might expect differences along these
lines if taxpayers with paid preparers were more or less likely to be compliant, but
we find no evidence of this. We also examine whether the increased complexity
of preparing a tax return caused affected taxpayers to seek out a tax preparer; once
again we obtain a null result, suggesting that Form 1099-K had little effect on

24
    In all cases, the patterns in expenses resemble the pattern for receipts, and median income changes very
little with the introduction of 1099-K, even for firms with K/R close to 1.

C. Firms with reported receipts far above 1099-K amount as a control group
     The results in the previous section suggest that firms with low values of K/R
behaved similarly to firms with high K/R prior to 1099-K, but were unaffected by
the introduction of 1099-K. Here we report the results from analysis that
explicitly uses firms with K/R below 0.5 as a control group. We divide “treated
firms”—those Schedule C filers with K/R>0.5—further into bins based on K/R to
reflect that treatment intensity should be expected to be weaker for firms with
K/R just above 0.5 than for firms with K/R equal to or very close to one.
Performing the analysis this way allows us to estimate explicitly the magnitudes
of the causal effect of 1099-K on firms with high K/R, as suggested by Figures 2
through 4. We use a random growth model to estimate the impact of Form 1099-
K (Heckman and Hotz 1989), and estimate the parameters of the following
regression equation:
                                     𝐾
                  𝑦𝑖𝑡 = ∑𝑏∈𝐵 1 {𝑅𝑖2011 ∈ 𝑏} 𝛼𝑏𝑡 + 𝜂𝑡 + 𝛾𝑖 + 𝜖𝑖𝑡 ,                            (3)
                                       𝑖2011

where 𝑦𝑖𝑡 is one of three outcome variables (either logged receipts, logged
expenses,25 or (the level of) net income), 𝑏 is a set of binned values of K/R and 𝐵
is the set of bins with K/R>0.5. This model implies that we can estimate the effect
of Form 1099-K on firms in group 𝑏 on 𝑦𝑖𝑡 as
                  ̂𝑏 = [(𝛼𝑏𝑡 − 𝛼𝑏𝑡 ′ ) − (𝑡 − 𝑡 ′ )(𝛼𝑏𝑡 ′ − 𝛼𝑏𝑡 ′ −1 )],
                  𝐷                                                                          (4)
where 𝑡 is a post-treatment year (2011 or 2012) and 𝑡 ′ is a pre-treatment year,
which will be 2010 in our preferred specification. The first term of Equation (4)
captures how receipts grew for firms in a given K/R bin before and after
treatment, and the second term compares this growth to how much faster these
firms were growing relative to the control group prior to treatment. The
identifying assumption is that the counterfactual deviations from the group-
specific trend—those occurring if 1099-K had not been introduced—were the
same in the treatment and control group. To validate this assumption, we also

25
   Cases in which a firm filed in every year but did not report positive expenses in a given year were dropped
from the estimation of Equation (4) when examining log expenses. This restriction eliminates just under 1
percent of the observations for the expenses specification of Equation (4).


                                                     20
report the results of several placebo tests, in which 𝑡 is some pre-treatment year
and 𝑡 ′ = 𝑡 − 1.26 Importantly, this identification strategy does not require that
firms in treatment and control groups grow at the same rate prior to the policy
change—indeed, Figure 3 shows that they did not. Differing prior trends could
arise, for example, due to Internet-based firms growing faster than others. They
could also arise out of anticipation of 1099-K, as firms anticipating the policy
might have increased their reported receipts (and expenses) in 2009 and/or 2010
to avoid a large (and suspicious) increase in 2011. If this anticipatory response
occurred, our specification under-estimates the total effect of Form 1099-K.
     Figure 5 illustrates the results of this analysis, reporting for several K/R bins
the log deviation from trend relative to the control group in 2007 to 2012.27 In
Panel A we see that the effect of 1099-K on receipts is rapidly increasing as K/R
moves close to 1, reaching 0.239 (i.e., a 23.9 percent increase in receipts) for
firms with K=R in 2011. The increase in receipts due to 1099-K for diffuse
bunchers (those with 0.95<K/R<1) was 13.2 percent in 2011. Panel B of Figure 5
depicts a very similar pattern for expenses, with slightly smaller effect sizes of
13.8 percent for the sharp bunchers and 12.7 percent for the diffuse bunchers. All
of these effects are statistically significant at well beyond the conventional 5
percent level. The placebo tests all result in a small estimated effect relative to the
estimated effect of the policy change, as we should expect if the identifying
assumption is satisfied to a reasonable approximation. In Panel C, we see there is
little discernible effect on net income. None of the estimated effects in Panel C,
placebo or otherwise, is statistically significant at the 5 percent level.
     We perform several robustness checks for this analysis. First, this analysis
was limited to firms filing Schedule C in every year from 2004 to 2012 to
alleviate concerns about firms endogenously selecting into and out of the
population of Schedule C filers during the sample period. If we ignore the
selection issue and estimate Equation (3) on all firms filing Schedule C at least

26
   It is the results of these placebo tests that led us to prefer the random growth model specification to a
differences-in-differences design (Heckman and Hotz 1989).
27
   We omit some bins with K/R only slightly above 0.5 for clarity; the estimated effect on these bins is very
small. We also omit the results for firms with K/R>1.


                                                    21
once in 2004-2012, we obtain similar results. Second, our estimate of Equation
(3) included firms filing Schedule C and receiving 1099-K in 2011. A few firms
receive 1099-K in 2011 but not 2012, and removing them from the analysis
changes very little. Third, although our preferred specification includes all firms
with K/R<0.5 in the control group, we obtain very similar results when
designating firms with K/R<0.3 or K/R<0.7 as the control group. Finally, we
obtain similar results if for 2011 and the placebo years we let 𝑡 ′ = 𝑡 − 2 in
Equation (4), instead of 𝑡 ′ = 𝑡 − 1.
D. Receipts and expenses
     Schedule C filers have a tendency to report receipts exactly equal to expenses,
compared to having reported receipts just above or below expenses. There are two
potential reasons this may occur. First, taxpayers may target zero business tax
liability when underreporting receipts and/or overstating expenses.28 Second, for
various reasons, taxpayers may not claim legitimate expenses in excess of
receipts, resulting in reported expenses exactly equal receipts.29 If taxpayers fail
to report all valid expenses, preferring instead to merely report no (as opposed to
negative) business income, then an increase in reported receipts induced by 1099-
K may merely be met with an increase in the reporting of valid expenses.
     Figure 6 shows that firms receiving a Form 1099-K in 2011 became
substantially more likely to report receipts almost exactly equal to expenses
(R/E=1) in 2011 than in 2010. Of all 1099-K recipients in 2011, 0.47 percent
report receipts exactly equal to expenses in 2010, and 1 percent do so in 2011. Of
1099-K recipients in 2012, 0.45 percent report receipts exactly equal to expenses
in 2010, 0.64 percent do so in 2011, and 1 percent do so in 2012. This finding
corroborates the evidence in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 suggesting that those taxpayers

28
   Overstating expenses may result in some expenses getting disallowed under audit. As a result, the response
of net income we document may represent a lower bound given that, under audit, some improperly claimed
expenses may be disallowed. Some taxpayers may also accelerate real expenses into a year with otherwise
positive profits in order to zero out tax liability from the business.
29
   For example, taxpayers may not deduct expenses in order to meet the presumptive rule of IRC §183(d),
under which firms that show profit three out of five years are deemed not to be subject to the hobby loss rules
(they can still deduct business losses against ordinary income). Further, some expenses, such as for a home
office, may not be deducted in excess of gross income (IRC §280A(c)(5)). Other expenses, such as the
carrying forward or back of net operating losses, may also simply be too complex for unassisted taxpayers to
understand and claim (Mahon and Zwick 2014).


                                                     22
whose reported receipts rose due to Form 1099-K also increased expense
reporting, substantially diminishing its effect on overall tax revenues, and
possibly diminishing the effect on reporting compliance by offsetting more
accurate receipts reporting with less accurate expense reporting. It also
corroborates the findings of Carrillo et al. (2014), who uncover evidence of a
similar kind of evasion substitution in response to expanded information reporting
in Ecuador (see also Pomeranz 2013; Morse et al. 2009).
     Table 5 reports rates of expenses-equal-to-receipts bunching in several
subpopulations.30 Of particular interest are the results related to new Schedule C
filers. Overall, new Schedule C filers are not disproportionately likely to report
receipts equal to expenses: Column 1 indicates that about 1 percent of these
Schedule C filers report receipts equal to expenses. This proportion is similar to
the value for all 1099-K firms—in 2011, 1 percent of 1099-K recipients have
R=E. This is not markedly different from the proportion of new Schedule C filers
with R=E, 1.4 percent, in Column 3. However, in Column 4, we see that about 4.3
percent—four times as high—of new Schedule C filers receiving a Form 1099-K
in 2011 report receipts equal to expenses. In contrast, firms filing Schedule C in
every year of 2004-2012 were unlikely to report receipts equal to expenses, even
if they got a 1099-K (Columns 4 and 5). This finding suggests that new Schedule
C filers induced to file by 1099-K were disproportionately likely to offset their
receipts with expenses.
     In the final two columns of Table 5, we focus specifically on firms reporting
receipts exactly near the 1099-K amount, as we have seen in earlier sections that
these firms appear especially likely to have been affected by increased
information reporting. These firms are much more likely to bunch than any others
we observe: about 7 percent of firms reporting receipts equal to the 1099-K
amount also report expenses equal to receipts, while 4 percent of firms with
receipts within 5 percent of the 1099-K amount report receipts equal to expenses.


30
  For selection criteria appearing in Table 3 but not Table 5, such as whether the firm is in a high-cash sector
or received 1099-K from TPSEs only, we do not observe any stark differences in the rate of bunching where
receipts equal expenses between groups.


                                                      23
Much of this is driven by payment-card-only firms: 9 percent of payment-card-
only 1099-K recipients with receipts equal to the 1099-K amount also report
receipts equal to expenses, while only 4 percent of TPSE-only 1099-K recipients
with receipts equal to the 1099-K amount do so. To summarize, when we focus on
firms we believe to have been especially strongly affected by 1099-K, we see
more bunching at where receipts equal expenses, which suggests that expense
offsetting did occur in response to the form.
E. Which expenses increased?
     Our analysis suggests that firms that increased their reported receipts as a
result of 1099-K reporting may have simultaneously increased reported expenses.
31
     There are several reasons a taxpayer might increase reported expenses upon
receiving a Form 1099-K. First, taxpayers may want to minimize their tax liability
through any means necessary, and take expenses to which they are not legally
entitled. As tax liabilities and marginal tax rates increase as a result of 1099-K,
the marginal benefit of overstating expenses increases. Second, taxpayers may
have previously not reported all valid expenses.32 The logic described in Section
3.2 suggests that higher reported receipts make reporting those expenses more
desirable on the margin. Third, for certain expenses, such as Section 179
depreciation and home office expenses, expense deductions statutorily cannot be
so large as to create negative net business income. Fourth, and finally, there is
anecdotal evidence that in some instances inconsistencies between true receipts
and what is reported on 1099-K may induced increased expenses.33 The first two
explanations are consistent with our theoretical model explaining expense
offsetting; the others are institutional nuances not present in our model.
     In this section we examine which expenses increased as a result of 1099-K


31
   Given that the burden of proof for suspected expense misreporting is on the taxpayer, who must typically
provide receipts justifying expenses on audit, a shift from receipts under-reporting to expense over-reporting
may actually result the detection of more noncompliance on audit for affected 1099-K recipients.
32
   For example, the firm may wish to avoid reporting a suspiciously low rate of profit (Carrillo et al. 2014).
33
   For example, an app developer may be compensated for sales on an app store net of a commission. Before
the 1099-K program, she may have merely reported the net payment as part of receipts and deducted any
other valid business expenses. Upon receiving a 1099-K for the gross amount, she may report total receipts
(without netting commissions), leading her to report higher receipts and now claiming commission expenses
that were previously netted out of receipts.


                                                     24
reporting. In doing so, we are able to reject that the third explanation discussed
above contributed substantially to the increase in expense reporting. Specifically,
we examine the average ratio of particular expense line items on the Schedule C,
as a fraction of total expenses, for firms in different binned values of K/R. We do
this by year, and look for specific expenses that increased in 2011 and 2012 for
K/R-close-to-one firms. We began by examining all expense line items available
to us—wage expense, cost of goods sold, home office deduction, other expenses
(line 27a on Form 1040 Schedule C), depreciation expense, insurance expense,
legal expenses, meals and entertainment, mortgage expenses, office expenses,
repairs and maintenance, travel expense, utilities, automobile expense, and the
aggregate of all other expenses not individually examined. Of these, only “other
expenses,” (Line 27a on Form 1040 Schedule C) increased as a percentage of total
expenses in 2011 and 2012 for K/R-close-to-one firms.
   Figure 7, Panel A, illustrates the share of income devoted to other expenses,
averaged by K/R bin, and then differenced by year. Panel B depicts the share of
taxpayers with reporting at least some other expenses. Panel C depicts the change
over time in the ratio of expenses devoted to other expenses, from Panel A. In the
graph, for K/R=1 firms, it is clear that the change in 2010-2011 was the most
dramatic of all the other years. Panel B suggests that an increase in other expense
reporting happened not only at the intensive margin, but, also at the extensive
margin. For K/R=1 firms, the percentage of firms claiming other expenses
increases dramatically in 2011 and 2012. In Panel D, we show that taxpayers’ use
of the home office deduction, the most likely candidate for the third explanation
above, reveals no discernible trend from 2010-2011 for K/R=1 firms that is
different from other years.
   This analysis suggests that as taxpayers reported additional revenue in
response to 1099-K reporting, they increased expenses to offset some of the
increase, specifically opting to increase “Other Expenses.” We cannot rule out
that some of the expense increases occur because some taxpayers are now forced
to declare new expenses such as commissions to reconcile their receipts with the
Form 1099-K—the fourth explanation above. Commissions could be claimed in

                                        25
the “other” category where the increases occurred. However, the pattern of
reported sectors of bunching firms, discussed in Section 6.1, suggests that
explanations involving commissions and the like are unlikely to account for most
of the observed offsetting behavior: many bunching firms exist in sectors where
commissions and the like should not be common. The remaining explanations for
expense offsetting are consistent with our theory, so we conclude that much of the
observed expense offsetting results from taxpayers’ taking calculated risks in tax
compliance.
VII.Conclusions
   U.S. tax policy has made expanded third-party information reporting a
centerpiece of its enforcement policy, with a prime example being the new Form
1099-K that applies to business receipts processed through credit cards and third-
party payments. At first blush this would seem to increase compliance, as the IRS
would more easily learn when the reported receipts of a business fell short of
now-known receipts. However, both because Form 1099-K does not apply to cash
transactions and because business expenses are not currently subject to third-party
information reporting, there could be leakage in the impact on tax revenue.
   Because only a small share of the total net income of sole proprietors is
reported by those that received a Form 1099-K, aggregate trends in receipts and
expense reporting or Schedule C filing behavior do not reveal a sharp break in
2011. We then focus on the type of firms that theory suggests are most likely to
be affected by Form 1099-K: those reporting receipts close to the amount reported
on 1099-Ks. The analysis shows clearly that taxpayers were disproportionately
likely to self-report receipts very close to the amount reported to the IRS on 1099-
K forms, even in sectors where substantial cash use should be typical. We
estimate that the introduction of the Form 1099-K prompted a 24 percent increase
in reported receipts on average for firms reporting receipts exactly equal to the
1099-K amount. Strikingly, this group of firms also increased reported expenses
of 13 percent. This offsetting moderated the impact of 1099-K on total tax
liability, even in groups strongly affected by 1099-K. Finally, we document a
sizable extensive margin effect for bunching firms. Of firms reporting receipts

                                        26
within 5 percent of the 1099-K amount, 66 percent did not file in the previous
year, while half of firms reporting exactly the 1099-K amount did not file a
Schedule C in the previous year. In sum, we find evidence suggesting that this
group of firms increased their reporting of revenues dramatically, along both
intensive (reporting compliance) and extensive margins (Schedule C filing
compliance), in response to the introduction of Form 1099-K.
   For information reporting to have a strong effect on tax compliance, it must
target a noncompliant group of taxpayers and it must subject a large share of their
income to information reporting. The subset of firms we identify as being affected
by 1099-K constitutes at most 15 percent of all sole proprietorships receiving
1099-K. After all, much noncompliance among small businesses is related to cash
use, which the 1099-K initiative does not address. Even for affected firms,
expenses are subject to no information reporting. As a result, the overall change in
reported tax liability through this channel is small. Future research should
examine the impact of the 1099-K initiative on small partnerships and
corporations, and consider what other initiatives could consolidate its compliance
gains. Further, as audit data from the National Research Program become
available, the net effects from the 1099-K may be better understood.

Notes: Panel A provides some descriptive statistics on Schedule C filers in our sample. In Panel
B, the first column lists the percentage of all Schedule C taxpayers in a sector that ever receive a
1099-K at any time during our sample period. The second column tabulates the percentage of all
taxpayers in the sector that receive the 1099-MISC any time in our sample period. The final
column tabulates the percentage of all Schedule C taxpayers in each sector. The first 10 sectors
(above the bold line) represent the 10 highest populated NAICS codes among all Schedule C
taxpayers. The second 10 sectors represent the 10 sectors with the highest percentage of 1099-K
recipients, conditional upon having at least 0.10 percent of all Schedule C taxpayers in the sector.

Notes: This table shows the relative frequencies with which firms had particular values of K/R (the ratio of 1099-K amounts to
reported receipts) in 2011, relative to their value of K/R in 2012. The sample is all taxpayers filing Schedule C in either 2011 or 2012.
The value in the top right corner of each cell is the number of taxpayers with a given value of K/R in 2012 as a fraction of total
taxpayers with a given value of K/R in 2011. The value in the bottom left corner of each cell is the number of taxpayers with a given
value of K/R in 2011 as a fraction of total taxpayers with a given value of K/R in 2012. The diagonal of the table highlights that
conditional on filing Schedule C and receiving a Form 1099-K in both years, values of K/R were relatively stable over the two years.

Notes: Rates of bunching where reported receipts equal the 1099-K amount, as a fraction of all Schedule C filers in the given tax year,
are provided in the first four rows of the table. We denote reported receipts by R and the gross amount from 1099-Ks by K. By R=K in
the first row, we mean firms reporting a dollar amount of receipts exactly equal to the gross amount from Form 1099-K’s. In column
(2), “new filers” refers to firms not filing Schedule C in the previous tax year. Columns (4) through (6) are constructed with data on
Visa acceptance rates by sector from Frisch (2005).

Notes: We denote receipts by R, expenses by E, and receipts by K. By R=E in the first row, we mean the fraction of firms reporting
receipts exactly equal to expenses. The selection criteria in columns (6) and (7) are exactly the same as those used to calculate the
percentages in Table 3. *Number of taxpayers here refers to taxpayers reporting either positive expenses or positive receipts. A small
number of Schedule C filers report either zero expenses or zero receipts. If we limit the study of R=E bunching to firms reporting both
positive receipts and positive expenses, the percentages in the top half of the table all increase mechanically, but the qualitative
patterns are unaffected.

Notes. This figure presents aggregate comparisons suggesting that the aggregate impact of the Form
1099-K on sole proprietors was limited. Panel A depicts total income reported on Schedule C, using
aggregate data from the IRS Statistics of Income Division. Panel B depicts the trends in receipts growth
reported on Schedule C by whether the taxpayer received 1099-K in 2011 and 2012. We restrict our
analysis in Panels B and C to firms filing Schedule C in every year from 2004 to 2012, and we exclude
firms receiving a 1099-K in 2011 but not 2012, or in 2012 but not 2011. Growth rates of a variable are
calculated as the first difference of the mean of logged receipts within a group. Panel C shows trends in
receipts growth for firms that did, or did not, receive a Form 1099-MISC prior to 2011. We restrict the
comparison in Panel C to firms that received 1099-MISC continuously from 2004 to 2010 and firms that
never received 1099-MISC in that period.

Notes. This figure provides evidence that firms were disproportionately likely to report their
receipts exactly equal to their gross 1099-K receipts. Panel A depicts the ratio of 1099-K receipts
to reported receipts, in 2011. The shape of this distribution in 2012 is very similar. Panel B
focuses on bunching in this distribution around the point where receipts exactly equal the 1099-K
amount, for both 2011 and 2012.

Notes: This panel depicts the large effects of Form 1099-K for firms reporting receipts equal to
their 1099-K amount. Vertical red lines in all figures highlights the bin where receipts exactly
equal the 1099-K amount. The sample for Panels A-C is those filing Schedule C in every year of
2004-2012; the sample for Panel D is all Schedule C filers in 2011. Growth rates of a variable
are calculated as the first difference of the mean of logged receipts within a group.

Notes: This figure presents estimates of the impact of Form 1099-K on reporting using a random growth model
specification (see Equations 3 and 4), as well as placebo tests of the identification strategy. The control group for
this analysis consists of firms receiving 1099-K but with K/R<0.5. We estimate a differential impact for binned
values of K/R. The sample for this analysis consists of businesses filing Schedule C in every year of 2004-2012.
Plotted is the estimated effect in 2011 and 2012 of Form 1099-K on firms with a given set of values of K/R in 2011,
along with placebo results for pre-2011. The 2011 effect and placebo effects are calculated using Equation (4) with

calculated using the two- and three-year lags of the variable. See Section 6.3 of the paper for further details.

Appendix A. Data Construction
This Appendix details the construction of the dataset we use to study the Form 109-K. We rely
on data from the Compliance Data Warehouse (CDW), the IRS’s primary research database, and
in particular on two CDW databases: the Individual Returns Transaction File (IRTF) and the
Information Returns Master File (IRMF), which contain transcribed tax return data from key IRS
forms, including Form 1040, Form 1040 Schedule C, Form 1099-MISC, and Form 1099-K.
Because our analysis requires taxpayer level data and most CDW information is provided at the
tax form level, a major part of constructing our analysis dataset involves converting form-level
data to taxpayer-level data and addressing related problems, such as choosing which filing to use
when a taxpayer has multiple filings of the same form for a single tax year. These duplicate
filings are usually the result of a taxpayer filing an amended or corrected return, but they can also
be caused by errors, for example by a taxpayer mistakenly mailing multiple copies of the same
return to the IRS. In general, when duplicates exist, we attempt to select the most recently posted
return for a given tax year, or the one that appears to reflect the greatest amount of business
activity in the case of multiple returns processed in the same time period.

Schedule C data
Our dataset begins with all Form 1040 Schedule C filings from tax year 2004 through tax year
2012 from the CDW IRTF_SCHEDULE_C table. Most Schedule C filers only need to file one
Schedule C for their primary business, but those running multiple businesses are required to file
a separate Schedule C for each one. In order to simplify our analysis and allow for the use of
return information that cannot easily be aggregated, such as industry codes, we target only the
one primary Schedule C for each taxpayer identification number (TIN) for inclusion in our
analysis dataset, rather than attempting to combine all Schedule C activity for each TIN by
summing fields across primary, secondary, and any additional Schedule C filings. To select only
the primary Schedule C for each taxpayer, we start by restricting the initial pool of Schedule C
filings to include only those returns with the most recent posting date for each TIN in each tax
year, since more recent postings are likely to reflect amended or corrected returns that are more
accurate than the original, earlier filings. If multiple Schedule Cs remain after restricting the data
to only the most recent filings, we select only the form with the highest reported gross receipts
from line 1 of the Schedule C for each TIN and tax year as a method to identify the taxpayer’s
primary Schedule C business activity. At this point, any additional duplicates represent Schedule
C filings for the same TIN in the same tax year posted at the same time with the same gross
receipts, and with no further basis to prefer one duplicate over another, we aim for consistency,
in most cases selecting the largest value available on any of the duplicates on a field-by-field
basis (the exceptions are the categorical fields for accounting method and TIN type, for which
we take the minimum value).

Form 1040 data
Once we have constructed observations for a single Schedule C for each TIN-tax year
combination, we add additional taxpayer-level data from the IRTF_ENTITY table, which is
already structured this way, with one observation per taxpayer per tax year. This table allows us
to bring in fields for the TIN of the taxpayer’s spouse in cases where the filing status of the
taxpayer’s Form 1040 is married filing jointly and the spouse’s TIN is derived from a Social

                                                 41
Security Number (SSN), rather than an Employer Identification Number (EIN), which can help
match the taxpayer’s primary returns to the relevant information returns. We also rely on the
IRTF_ENTITY table for some filing information from the taxpayer’s Form 1040 which can be
assumed to also be true of the Schedule C, including whether or not the return was electronically
filed and whether or not a professional tax preparer was involved in the preparation of the return,
which we infer by the presence of a preparer TIN and/or a preparer EIN on the Form 1040.

Information returns, Form 1099-K and Form 1099-MISC
With primary return data in place, we follow a similar process with information returns, using
data from both the IRMF_F1099MISC and IRMF_F1099K tables. Since we can only use
information return records that can be matched to Schedule C filers, we eliminate all information
returns with invalid payee TINs. Because some payee TINs represent SSNs and some represent
EINs, information returns must be matched to the primary returns in stages, and we ensure we
capture all of a payee’s returns whether the filer used an SSN or an EIN for the payee TIN by
aggregating all payees’ information returns across payers separately for returns with payee SSNs
and payee EINs, only calculating the total across all information returns once each piece is
matched to the primary returns. To help reduce the number of potential mismatches, we also take
advantage of another CDW field, the TIN Association Key Code, to restrict the pool of
information returns with an EIN payee TIN to those with the EIN of a sole proprietorship. Errors
are common on the payee TINs of information returns, but, while common, they are also difficult
to detect. However, since Schedule C is filed only by sole proprietorships, eliminating EINs
associated with non-sole proprietorship businesses can prevent cases in which an information
return that belongs to a large business but is incorrectly filed with the TIN of a small Schedule C
business results in a large discrepancy between reported Schedule C income and information
return income.

In aggregating Form 1099-K and 1099-MISC income, we allow one of each return for each
payee TIN-tax year-payer TIN combination. As CDW IRMF tables code whether a return was
filed as original, corrected, or amended, if we have multiple filings by the same payer for the
same payee in the same tax year, we prioritize the amended return if available, then the
corrected, then the original, assuming amended returns are more accurate than the original
filings. If duplicates remain, we usually select the largest value available on a field-by-field
basis, as we do with Schedule C, with the exception being the type of transaction reported field
from Form 1099-K, for which we use the minimum value. For Form 1099-K, we calculate total
1099-K receipts from the gross payment amount in box 1, splitting payment card income and
third-party-network payment income where possible. Form 1099-MISC income is calculated as
the sum of rents (box 1), royalties (box 2), other income (box 3), fishing boat proceeds (box 5),
medical and health care payments (box 6), nonemployee compensation (box 7), substitute
payments in lieu of dividends or interest (box 8), crop insurance proceeds (box 10), and gross
proceeds paid to an attorney (box 14).

Merging primary returns and information returns
Having calculated total 1099-MISC and 1099-K income for each taxpayer by TIN type (SSN or
EIN), we use a multi-stage process to match the information return data to Schedule C data.
Information returns with EIN payee TINs have these payee TINs matched to the EIN reported on
the Schedule C if one is available. Schedule C EINs are reported in a separate field from the

                                                42
Schedule C TIN, which is always an SSN. For returns with an SSN payee TIN, we start with the
full population of Schedule C returns and SSN TIN information returns, and match as many as
possible with the primary TIN. Any returns that were matched are then removed from the pool of
Schedule C returns and Forms 1099-K/1099-MISC, and an additional match is conducted on the
remaining returns using the TIN of the spouse of the primary filer of the Schedule C, when
available (from the taxpayer’s Form 1040). This process allows us to match as many information
returns as possible to each taxpayer’s Schedule C, whether they are filed with an EIN, primary
SSN, or spouse SSN as the payee TIN. Once all possible matches are made, we sum income
fields derived from all payee TIN types for each TIN to calculate total 1099-K and 1099-MISC
income for each Schedule C filer. Due to errors with filing, transcription, or incorrect TINs, we
observe numerous cases where total income reported on information returns greatly exceeds that
reported on the Schedule C, with extreme cases reporting over $1 billion in receipts, which are
unlikely to reflect the true income of a sole proprietorship filing a Schedule C. We attempt to
reduce the impact of these extreme observations on our analysis by removing observations with
dollar values over $1 billion, applying this restriction not only to income reported on information
returns, but also key variables from the Schedule C, such as receipts and expenses, for
consistency.

Appendix B. Discussion of Conceptual Framework

This Appendix contains a more detailed theoretical discussion of firm’s reporting decisions, to
deepen the intuition behind the main theoretical predictions described and taken to data in the
body of the paper. (2) when expenses are not subject to information reporting, any increases in
receipts from an increase in information reporting will be offset by increases in expenses As
mentioned in the body of the paper, our theoretical work is based on the work of Allingham and
Sandmo (1972) and Srinivasan (1973), and contains similar insights to that in independent work
by Carrillo et al. (2014). As in the body of the paper, we consider only reporting decisions,
taking as given real decisions such as how much output to produce and sell and whether to
accept credit card.

A simple model of receipts reporting
We begin with a model of a risk-neutral business that has no deductible expenses. This model is
far simpler than necessary to derive the interesting predictions of the model, but it illustrates the
reasoning behind the first major prediction of the model, that taxpayers most affected by an
increase in information reporting will report receipts approximately equal to the gross amount
reported by third parties. In the next section, we introduce expenses into the model.
Firm 𝑖 chooses the level of receipts 𝑅𝑖 to report to the tax authority, given true receipts 𝑄𝑖 and
the amount of receipts reported to the tax authority by third parties, 𝐾𝑖 . The firm’s problem is:

                     maxRi 𝑄𝑖 − 𝑡𝑅𝑖 − 𝑝𝑖 (𝑅𝑖 , 𝑄𝑖 , 𝐾𝑖 )𝑠(𝑄𝑖 − 𝑅𝑖 ),       (A1)

where 𝑡 is the income tax rate, assumed to be constant for simplicity, and 𝑝𝑖 (. ) is the probability
of detection and punishment of evasion. In the event that the firm reports 𝑅𝑖 < 𝑄𝑖 and is
detected, it must remit the fraction 𝑠 > 𝑡 on its unreported receipts.
    We specify a probability of detection with two intuitive properties: first, the probability of
detection is decreasing in the fraction of true receipts the firm reports to the IRS, and, second, the
probability of detection increases discontinuously to one when the taxpayer reports receipts
below the amount reported to the tax authority. In other words, we suppose taxpayers believe
that more compliant firms are less likely to be audited, and that reporting information that
directly contradicts third-party information results in a certain audit.

Using a similar approach to Phillips (2014), we write the probability of detection as
                                              1,         if 𝑅𝑖 < 𝐾𝑖
                       𝑝𝑖 (𝑅𝑖 , 𝑄𝑖 , 𝐾𝑖 ) = {𝛼𝑖 𝑄𝑖 −𝑅𝑖              , (A2)
                                                       , if 𝑅𝑖 ≥ 𝐾𝑖
                                           2   𝑄𝑖
where 𝛼𝑖 ≤ 1 summarizes firm 𝑖’s audit threat from enforcement efforts other than information
reporting. For example, a firm experiences a low audit threat if it believes that increasing its
under-reporting is (1) unlikely to result in an audit in the absence of information reporting, or
even (2) unlikely to be detected in the event of an audit. The specific functional form we use here
is an expository tool, allowing us to capture all variation in audit threat in a single firm-specific
parameter—in the more general model in the paper (see Equation 2) the role of 𝛼𝑖 is replaced by
the first derivative of a function 𝑞𝑖 (𝑅, 𝐸) with respect to 𝑅.

                                                    44
Factors causing firm-specific variation in audit threat could include the size of the business, how
much income the business owner has from other sources, the salience of tax enforcement to the
taxpayer and, importantly, the share of transactions conducted in cash, which is more easily
hidden from the tax authority than those received through credit cards. One could also add to this
model a second parameter summarizing idiosyncratic preferences for tax compliance, which
would multiply the last term in Equation (1). This parameter would have effects on compliance
identical to the effects of 𝛼𝑖 , so in an informal sense one can think of 𝛼𝑖 as summarizing the
taxpayers’ propensity to report truthfully in the absence of information reporting, which could
vary due to enforcement efforts targeting different kinds of taxpayers or varying taxpayer
preferences for compliance (Erard and Feinstein 1994). Another key parameter for the solution to
                     𝐾
the problem is 𝛾𝑖 ≡ 𝑄𝑖 ≤ 1, the fraction of the firm’s receipts subject to information reporting.
                        𝑖


The solution to the firm’s problem is given by the following:
                                            𝑡                                    𝑡
                                     (1 − 𝑠𝛼 ) 𝑄𝑖 , if 𝑡 ≤ 𝑠𝛼𝑖 and         (1 − 𝑠𝛼 ) > 𝛾𝑖
                                              𝑖                                      𝑖
     𝑅(𝛼𝑖 , 𝛾𝑖 , 𝐾𝑖 , 𝑠, 𝑡, 𝑄𝑖 ) = {                                             𝑡
                                                                                            .       (A3)
                                         𝐾𝑖 ,       if 𝑡 > 𝑠𝛼𝑖 or          (1 − 𝑠𝛼 ) ≤ 𝛾𝑖
                                                                                     𝑖


Using Equation (A3), we can calculate the effect on reported receipts of an increase in
information reporting (i.e., the introduction of the Form 1099-K) from zero to some level 𝐾𝑖 ,
casewise. That effect is summarized by the following:
                                                                            𝑡
                                                     0,        if     (1 − 𝑠𝛼 ) > 𝛾𝑖
                                                                                            𝑖
                                                                 𝑡                          𝑡
𝑅(𝛼𝑖 , 𝛾𝑖 , 𝐾𝑖 , 𝑠, 𝑡, 𝑄𝑖 ) − 𝑅(𝛼𝑖 , 0,0, 𝑠, 𝑡, 𝑄𝑖 ) = 𝐾𝑖 − (1 − 𝑠𝛼 ) 𝑄,   if 0 ≤ (1 − 𝑠𝛼 ) ≤ 𝛾𝑖 (A4)
                                                                     𝑖                          𝑖
                                                                                                𝑡
                                             {         𝐾𝑖 ,        if       (1 − 𝑠𝛼 ) ≤ 0
                                                                                    𝑖
There are three distinct possibilities suggested by the three rows of Equation (A4), which we can
characterize in terms of the two key parameters that vary across firms, the audit threat 𝛼𝑖 and the
share of true receipts reported to the tax authority, 𝛾𝑖 . Panel A of Figure A1 depicts these
possibilities.
     Case 1: if 𝛼𝑖 is large and 𝛾𝑖 is small, firms report some constant fraction of income that
        depends negatively on the tax rate and positively on the penalty rate and the propensity to
        report truthfully. These firms are unaffected by information reporting.
     Case 2: if 𝛼𝑖 is small (but not so small so as to result in Case 3) and 𝛾𝑖 is large, the firm
        reports receipts exactly equal to the amount reported by third parties. These firms
        increase reported receipts on the intensive margin in response to information reporting.
     Case 3: if 𝛼𝑖 is sufficiently small, the firm reports only receipts about which third parties
        inform the tax authority, regardless of the level of information reporting. These firms are
        affected on the extensive margin of receipts reporting by 1099-K.

Case 3 firms would not report anything in the absence of information reporting. For both Case 2
and Case 3 firms, the incentive to avoid the audit threat causes bunching where 𝑅𝑖 = 𝐾𝑖 , that is,
where 𝐾𝑖 /𝑅𝑖 = 1. Panel B of Figure A1 plots the firm’s receipts with and without information
reporting as a function of the fraction of receipts subject to information reporting, 𝛾𝑖 , for Cases 1
and 2. Note that when all a firm’s receipts are subject to information reporting, so that 𝛾𝑖 = 1,

                                                      45
the firm reports truthfully. Panel C of Figure 2 shows the predicted value of 𝐾𝑖 /𝑅𝑖 , as a function
of 𝛾𝑖 . It illustrates a key insight from the model used in the paper: any firm that responds to the
1099-K, either intensively or extensively, will report exactly the amount on the information
reports: Ri = Ki.

This simple model illustrates that the effect of Form 1099-K is likely heterogeneous, depending
especially on (1) the fraction of true receipts subject to information reporting, and (2) the firm’s
propensity to report truthfully in the absence of information reporting. These two factors matter
because they can cause the firm’s counterfactual report—the report made in absence of Form
1099-K—to be well above the amount of receipts reported to the IRS, so much so that the audit
threat introduced by 1099-K is negligible. The firms most likely to be affected have a large
fraction of receipts subject to information reporting and/or a large degree of noncompliance in
the absence of the form. The first criterion would apply primarily to businesses like online
merchants who accept payment mostly though credit cards or third-party networks (such as
PayPal), in sharp contrast with individuals receiving large amounts of cash, such as taxi drivers
or convenience stores. Notably, these two criteria (whose importance was summarized in the
model by 𝛼𝑖 and 𝛾𝑖 ) may be positively correlated: even without the Form 1099-K, the paper trail
associated with payment card use increases audit threat. Tax underreporting by small businesses
is empirically found to be correlated with cash use (Morse et al., 2009). However, firms with
high rates of cash use could still be affected by 1099-K provided they had high rates of
noncompliance prior to the form (i.e., very low 𝛼𝑖 in the model). In Section 6 of the paper we
shed some empirical light on the possible causes of a response to 1099-K using the sectoral
composition of the 1099-K recipients that bunch where reported receipts are close to the gross
1099-K amount, and whether 1099-Ks came from payment card entities or TPSEs.

Expenses
Many small businesses have costs of doing business that are deductible from receipts in the
calculation of income subject to tax (Internal Revenue Code (IRC) §162). We can introduce
deductible expenses into the model by allowing the firm to choose not only reported receipts, but
reported expenses. Expenses are not subject to information reporting in the model or in reality,
though the Affordable Care Act included a provision incorporating some expense reporting into
new 1099 forms, which was later eliminated.

The firm’s problem with expense reporting becomes Equation (1) in the body of the paper, and
the probability of detection with expense reporting, the generalization of Equation (A2), is
contained in Equation (2) in the body of the paper. We will not discuss the results described in
that section further here, except to note that the insights from the above simplified version of the
model still obtain in the general case, and that when 𝐸𝑖 is fixed this model nests the model in the
previous section. We also note that the point made by Carrillo et al. (2014) that reported
expenses can in general be greater or less than true expenses (before and/or after an increase in
information reporting of receipts) obtains in our version of the model, but does not affect the
prediction that increased receipts reporting will be offset by increased expense reporting.

Other Extensions and Discussion
Here we discuss how a few variations of the model would affect its predictions.


                                                46
We can incorporate into the model the notion that a firm that does not submit a Schedule C may
face a lower probability of detection than a firm filing a Schedule C and declaring arbitrarily
small receipts and expenses. To examine how this changes the model, we can add an extensive
margin filing choice variable 𝐹 ∈ {0, 1}, such that 𝐹 = 0 indicates non-filing, and write the
probability of detection as
                                                          1, if 𝑅𝑖 < 𝐾𝑖
             𝑝𝑖 (𝑅𝑖 , 𝐸𝑖 , 𝐾𝑖 ) = {                                     ,        (A5)
                                   𝑞(𝑅𝑖 , 𝐸𝑖 ) − 𝛽𝑖 (1 − 𝐹), if 𝑅𝑖 ≥ 𝐾𝑖
where 𝛽𝑖 > 0 summarizes how the firm’s detection probability declines discretely when, in
addition to reporting no receipts or expenses, it declines to file a Schedule C.

    This addition changes the predictions of the model in two ways. First, information reporting
intensifies the predicted extensive margin response. The receipts-only model in Section 3.1
predicted an extensive margin response to increased information reporting (due to the non-
negativity constraint on 𝑅𝑖 ), but this possibility adds to the reasons a firm may not file a
Schedule C. Second, this addition breaks the prediction that every firm affected by information
reporting will end up reporting 𝑅𝑖 = 𝐾𝑖 , although the model does predict that some affected
firms—and virtually all affected firms when 𝛽𝑖 is small—will report 𝑅𝑖 = 𝐾𝑖 , so long as some
firms have sufficiently low 𝛼𝑖 . This reasoning highlights that some firms caused to file Schedule
C by 1099-K may not be visible in the analysis in Section 6, which focuses on firms reporting 𝑅𝑖
near 𝐾𝑖 .

In our theoretical discussion, we have ignored the possibility that 𝛾𝑖 may be influenced by the
firm at some cost. Were the cost of doing so low enough, noncompliant firms would want to
decrease 𝛾𝑖 , either by incentivizing cash payments or by declining to accept some payment
methods subject to information reporting. Our data do not provide a credible means of examining
whether firms respond to the Form 1099-K in this way. If they do, however, its effect would be
smaller than predicted in the model presented here, but qualitatively similar: many firms affected
by 1099-K should still bunch near the point where reported receipts equal the 1099-K amount,
and firms reporting substantially below the 1099-K amount would have had little change in their
reported receipts (but possibly some change in their payment methods) in response to 1099-K.
Relatedly, we find no “hole” in the distribution of 1099-K amounts around the de minimis
restrictions applying to third-party network vendors ($20,000 dollars and 200 transactions). This
fact suggests that firms are not willing and/or able to decrease their receipts from third-party
network transactions to avoid information reporting from third-party network vendors, at least
along the intensive margin. This finding is consistent with the findings of Arango and Taylor
(2008) and Jonker (2011), whose work suggests that many firms have limited capacity to
manipulate the share of receipts from various transactions types.

          Panel C. Predicted ratio of information report amounts and receipts amounts




Note: This figure depicts the theoretical predictions for how firms’ response to Form 1099-K is
affected by its propensity to report truthfully in absence of information reporting and the share of
its receipts subjected to information reporting, derived using the simple receipts-only model
discussed above. Panels B and C are drawn for the case where the firm underreports in the
absence of information reporting, rather than not reporting any receipts at all.
