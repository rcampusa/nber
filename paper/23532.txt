                                            ABSTRACT

This paper evaluates the wage, employment, and hours effects of the first and second phase-in of the
Seattle Minimum Wage Ordinance, which raised the minimum wage from $9.47 to as much as $11
in 2015 and to as much as $13 in 2016. Using a variety of methods to analyze employment in all sectors
paying below a specified real hourly wage rate, we conclude that the second wage increase to $13
reduced hours worked in low-wage jobs by 6-7 percent, while hourly wages in such jobs increased
by 3 percent. Consequently, total payroll for such jobs decreased, implying that the Ordinance lowered
the amount paid to workers in low-wage jobs by an average of $74 per month per job in 2016. Evidence
attributes more modest effects to the first wage increase. We estimate an effect of zero when analyzing
employment in the restaurant industry at all wage levels, comparable to many prior studies.

  Minimum Wage Increases, Wages, and Low-Wage Employment:
                                 Evidence from Seattle


   1. Introduction
       Neoclassical economic theory suggests that binding price floor policies, including
minimum wages, should lead to a non-market equilibrium marked by excess supply and
diminished demand. Some previous empirical studies have questioned the extent to which this
prediction holds in the low wage labor market, with many estimates suggesting a negligible
impact of higher minimum wages on employment. This paper uses rich administrative data on
employment, earnings, and hours in Washington State to re-examine this prediction in the
context of Seattle’s minimum wage increases from $9.47 to as much as $11 in April 2015 and as
much as $13 in January 2016. Seattle is among a set of localities that have instituted large local
minimum wage increases in recent years as part of the “Fight for $15” movement (Greenhouse
2012; Rolf 2016). Our data allow us to examine the impacts of this large local increase on both
the extensive and intensive margins. Employment losses associated with Seattle’s mandated
wage increases are large enough to have resulted in net reductions in payroll expenses – and total
employee earnings – in the city’s low-wage job market. Moreover, we find evidence of non-
linear effects, as the rise to $11 per hour had an insignificant effect on employment, whereas the
rise to $13 per hour resulted in a large drop in employment.
       Basic models drastically oversimplify the low-skilled labor market, often supposing that
all participants possess homogeneous skill levels generating equivalent productivity on the job.
In reality, minimum wages might be binding for the least-skilled, least-productive workers, but
not for more experienced workers at the same firm. Empirically, it becomes challenging to
identify the relevant market for which the prediction of reduced employment should apply,
particularly when data do not permit direct observation of wages. Previous literature, discussed
below, has often defined the relevant market by focusing on lower-wage industries, such as the
restaurant sector, or on lower-productivity employees such as teenagers. Results of such studies
cannot be generalized to the entire low-wage labor market and may yield attenuated estimates of
the effect as they blend workers for whom the minimum wage is binding with workers for whom
it is not. Moreover, prior studies commonly analyze only measures of “headcount” employment,


                                                 3
ignoring the reality that most low-wage jobs are part-time in nature and the intensive margin may
be a significant dimension of adjustment.
        This paper examines the impact of a minimum wage increase for employment across all
categories of low-wage employees, spanning all industries and worker demographics, examining
both headcount and hours-based measures of the quantity of labor. We do so by utilizing data
collected for purposes of administering unemployment insurance by Washington’s Employment
Security Department (ESD). Washington is one of four states that collect quarterly hours data in
addition to earnings, enabling the computation of realized hourly wages for the entire workforce.
        As we have the capacity to replicate earlier studies’ focus on the restaurant industry, we
can examine the extent to which use of a proxy variable for low-wage status, rather than actual
low-wage jobs, biases estimates. Our analysis of restaurant employment at all wage levels,
analogous to many prior studies, yields minimum wage employment impact estimates near zero.
Point estimates are higher, though imprecisely estimated, when examining only low-wage jobs in
the restaurant industry, and when examining total hours worked rather than employee headcount.
        We further examine the impact of other methodological choices on our estimates. Some
prior studies have drawn “control” cases from geographic regions immediately adjoining the
“treatment” region (e.g., Dube, Lester, and Reich 2010). This could yield biased effect estimates
to the extent that wages in adjacent regions adjust to the policy change in the treatment region.
Indeed, cross border difference-in-differences estimators fail a simple falsification test. We
report results from synthetic control and interactive fixed effects methods that fare better on this
test. We also compare estimated employment effects to estimated wage effects, more accurately
pinpointing the elasticity of employment with regard to wage increases occasioned by a rising
price floor.
        Many prior studies estimate employment elasticities by comparing the magnitude of
estimated employment losses with the statutory increase in the minimum wage. Applying this
method to our results yields elasticity estimates in line with earlier studies, if somewhat on the
high side. We show, however, that the impact of Seattle’s minimum wage increase on wage
levels is much smaller than the statutory increase because most affected low-wage workers were
already earning more than the statutory minimum at baseline. Our estimates imply, then, that
elasticities calculated using the statutory wage increase as a denominator are substantially
underestimated. Our preferred estimates suggest that the rise from $9.47 to $11 produced



                                                  4
disemployment effects that approximately offset wage effects, with elasticity point estimates
around -0.9. The subsequent increase to as much as $13 yielded more substantial disemployment
effects, with net elasticity point estimates closer to -2.6. 1
        While these findings imply that Seattle’s minimum wage policy decreased total payroll
expenses on low-wage employees, and by extension those employees’ earnings, several caveats
are in order. These estimates pertain to a minimum wage increase from what had been the
nation’s highest state minimum wage to an even higher level, and might not indicate the effects
of more modest changes from lower initial levels. In fact, our finding of larger impacts of the
rise from $11 to $13 than the rise from $9.47 to $11 suggests non-linearity in the response.
Second, our data do not capture earnings in the informal sector, or by contractors, and minimum
wage policies could conceivably lead employers and workers to shift towards these labor market
arrangements. Some employers may have shifted jobs out of Seattle but kept them within the
metropolitan area, in which case the job losses in Seattle overstate losses in the local labor
market. Even without mobility responses by firms, reductions in payroll per employee may
exceed reductions in worker income to the extent that workers were able to find alternate
employment in Seattle’s rapidly growing suburbs.
        Our analysis focuses on the subset of Washington State employers that definitively report
workplace location for each of their employees. Because of this restriction, smaller single-site
employers are over-represented in our sample; we include 90% of all business entities employing
63% of Washington’s workforce. We discuss the ramifications of this restriction extensively
below. While there may be concerns that larger businesses exhibit significantly different
responses to the minimum wage, survey evidence indicates no differential response. Moreover,
when we track workers longitudinally we find no evidence of an exodus from the employers
included in our analysis to the excluded employers.
        Finally, the mechanisms activated by a local minimum wage ordinance might differ from
those associated with a state or federal increase. It is reasonable to expect that policies
implemented at a broader geographic scale offer fewer opportunities to reallocate employment in
response.

 Our results are similar to those in Mastracci and Persky (2008) who evaluate an increase in Illinois’ minimum
wage. They find that while the state’s minimum wage rose $1.35, “hourly pay for low-wage workers rose by only
15 cents on average” and “hours worked by low-wage workers fell by about two hours per week, resulting in lower
weekly earnings,” with the implied demand elasticity being in the range of “two to three” (p. 268).


                                                       5
         We emphasize that any analysis of the welfare implications of a minimum wage increase
must consider how income gains and losses distribute across the low-wage workforce. Some
low-wage workers are household heads responsible for maintaining a family’s standard of living.
Others are secondary or tertiary earners whose income is less necessary for basic living
expenses. Our study does not address which workers are better or worse off as a consequence of
the minimum wage ordinance. Future analysis will combine employment records with other
administrative data from Washington State to more fully address critical distributional questions.


    2. Challenges in estimating the impact of minimum wage increases
         Traditional competitive models of the labor market suggest that an increase in a binding
minimum wage will cause reductions in employment. Any number of modifications to the
standard model can raise doubts about this prediction. These include the presence of monopsony
power (Bhaskar and To 1999; Manning 2003), the possibility that higher wages intensify job
search and thus improve employer-employee match quality (Flinn 2006), “efficiency wage”
models that endogenize worker productivity (Rebitzer and Taylor 1995), and the possibility that
some low-wage workers exhibit symptoms of a “backward-bending” supply curve associated
with a need to earn a subsistence income (Dessing 2002). Even in the absence of these
theoretical modifications, there has long been debate regarding the empirical magnitude of the
theorized effect.
         Over the course of the past 25 years, a robust literature has developed with researchers
using a variety of strategies to estimate the effect of minimum wages on employment and other
outcomes. While this literature has often generated significant debate over econometric
specifications and data sources, the heavy reliance on proxies for low-wage employment in the
absence of actual wage data, along with a reliance of headcount-based measures of employment
rather than hours-based measures, has figured less prominently. 2




2
  One notable exception is the work of Belman, Wolfson, and Nawakitphaitoon (2015). They note: “Focusing on
low-wage/low-income groups offers the advantage of providing more focused estimates of the effect of changes in
minimum wage policies; employment and wage effects are less likely to be difficult to detect due to the inclusion of
individuals unlikely to be affected by the minimum wage. Use of proxies for low wage/low income such as age,
gender, and education are a step in this direction, but still potentially dilute the impact by the inclusion of unaffected
individuals” (p. 608).


                                                            6
2.1 What is the relevant labor market?
        Previous literature has generally not examined the entire low-wage labor market but has
focused instead on lower-wage industries such as the restaurant sector, or on stereotypically
lower-productivity employees such as teenagers. 3 Studies of the restaurant industry harken back
to Card and Krueger (1994), which utilized a case study approach to estimate the employment
effects of New Jersey’s increase in its state minimum wage. The authors argued that fast-food
restaurants are not just a leading employer of low-wage workers, but also display high rates of
compliance with minimum wage regulations. Many authors have subsequently chosen the
restaurant and fast food industry to study federal and state level minimum wages (Dube, Lester
and Reich 2010, 2016; Addison, Blackburn and Cotti 2012, 2014; Neumark, Salas, and Wascher
2014; Allegretto, Dube, Reich, and Zipperer 2016; Totty 2017). Other authors have focused on
retail (Kim and Taylor 1995; Addison, Blackburn, and Cotti 2008).
        Another strand of studies estimates the effect of minimum wages on teenagers. These
studies argue that teenagers are typically at the bottom of the wage and earnings distribution and
make up a large share of the low-wage workforce. Studies of minimum wage effects on
teenagers have focused both on the federal and state level minimum wage hikes (Card 1992;
Neumark and Wascher 1994, 1995, 2004, 2008, 2011; Allegretto, Dube, and Reich 2011;
Neumark et al. 2014).
        Using restaurant or retail employees or teenagers as proxies for the entire low-wage labor
market might lead to biased minimum wage effects. Intuitively, a sample mixing jobs directly
affected by the minimum wage with others for which the price floor is irrelevant would generally
skew estimated impacts towards zero. Isolating one industry, such as the fast food industry, may
lead to downwardly biased wage and employment effects due to heterogeneity in wages in the
industry (i.e., some workers whose wages are above the minimum wage will be misclassified as
belonging to the “treatment” group). The estimates capture the minimum wage’s net effects on
all restaurant employees, not the effects on low-wage employees, which would likely be
stronger. Similarly, using teenagers may lead to larger employment estimates as this group omits
other low-wage workers, particularly those that have a stronger attachment to the labor force and
are full-time full-year workers, for whom the wage-elasticity of demand may be smaller. On the

Kalda, and Sovich 2017.


                                                    7
other hand, since some teens earn wages well above the minimum, including them in the sample
would bias estimates of the impacts for that demographic group toward zero.
        This discussion begs the question of what, exactly, should count as a low-wage job. An
intuitive approach – and the one pursued in this analysis – focuses on jobs that pay below a
certain (inflation-adjusted) hourly wage. 4 Analysis of employment at or below a specified wage
threshold may overstate disemployment effects to the extent that minimum wage policy may
cause some employers to raise wages of workers from below to above the threshold, or if
simultaneous economic shocks shift wages in a similar manner. A more purist approach would
focus on jobs that entail any of a variety of tasks for which there are no specialized skill
requirements, which any able-bodied person might perform. Practically, few if any employment
datasets contain such information.
        In theory, so long as minimum wage increases are not coincident with economic shocks
that apply only to the implementing region, analysis of employment at or below a specific real
wage level will be unproblematic if the wage distribution can be effectively partitioned into a
component affected by minimum wage policy and an unaffected counterpart. Imagining a
reaction function relating pre-policy to post-policy wages, the partition would be associated with
a fixed point. It is not clear that any such fixed point exists. Our analyses below are informed by
efforts to estimate reaction functions, which reveal little evidence of significant responses to the
minimum wage above relatively low thresholds. We also report the results of sensitivity
analyses that vary the threshold substantially.


2.2 Debates over methodology
        While much of the previous literature has elided the difficult problem of identifying the
relevant labor market by using simple industry or demographic proxies, there has been no
shortage of debate over causal estimation strategy. The traditional approach uses variation in
state-based minimum wages and estimates minimum wage-employment elasticities using a two-
way fixed effect OLS regression (Neumark and Wascher 2008). This approach assumes parallel
pre-trends across treatment and control states and estimates the overall impact on wages and


4
 This approach bears a strong resemblance to Cengiz, Dube, Lindner, and Zipperer (2017) who use pooled Current
Population Survey data to study the impact of state-level minimum wage increases on employment at wages just
above and below the newly imposed minimum between 1979 and 2016. Their analysis focuses only on self-reported
employment, not hours, and thus focuses only on the extensive and not the intensive margin.


                                                      8
employment of multiple minimum wages over time. The two-way fixed effect approach has
come under criticism in recent years because of the geographic distribution of minimum wage
adoption (Allegretto et al. 2016). States with higher minimum wages are concentrated in the
Northeast and West coast, regions that have different employment patterns from states in the
South and parts of the Midwest. If this underlying regional pattern affects state employment
trends differentially, then the parallel trends assumption of the two-way fixed effects model does
not hold. Subsequently, difference-in-differences estimation strategies that weight all states
without a higher minimum wage equally as their control region may negatively bias employment
elasticity estimations.
         To account for this issue, researchers have argued for a variety of specifications. These
include: the use of local area controls, such as division-period fixed effects or a border
discontinuity approach, (Dube et al. 2010, 2016; Allegretto et al. 2011), the use and order of
region-specific time trends (Addison et al. 2012, 2014), the use of a synthetic control to identify
control regions with pre-trend employment levels similar to the treatment region (Neumark et al.
2014), and linear factor estimation (Totty 2017). 5
         Local area control designs assume that neighboring counties or states within a census
division region are more similar in trends and levels than regions further away. Researchers
using local-area controls (Dube et al. 2010, 2016; Allegretto et al. 2011) show strong and
significant earnings elasticity estimates but insignificant employment elasticities near zero.
While it is reasonable to think that nearby regions share many background characteristics with
the treated region, a local area control design will yield biased estimates when policies have
spillover effects in nearby areas, such as when businesses raise wages in response to a minimum
wage increase in a nearby jurisdiction.
         The notion that nearby regions offer the best match on background characteristics is itself
a matter of debate. Using a synthetic matching estimator approach, Neumark et al. (2014) show
that local areas are not picked as donors in the synthetic estimator of panel national data, and
thus should not be used as the control region. Dube et al. (2016) rebut this claim, noting
statistically significant larger mean absolute differences in covariates not related to the minimum



5
  In this study we do not replicate region-specific time trends due to the limited time-frame of our data. However,
this specification has become popular; see Dube et al. (2010, 2016) and Addison et al. (2014) for use of linear and
polynomial time trends in minimum wage estimation strategies.


                                                          9
wage for noncontiguous counties compared to contiguous counties.
         A final strand of estimation has used linear factor estimation and interactive fixed effects,
which relaxes the assumption of parallel trends in control and treatment regions by explicitly
modelling unobserved regional trends. Totty (2017) utilizes Pesaran’s (2006) common correlated
effects estimators as a linear factor estimation. Pesaran’s common correlated effects estimators
do not estimate common factor and common factor loadings, like the interactive fixed effects
estimator, but rather use cross-sectional averages of the dependent and independent variables as a
proxy for factors. Totty also uses an interactive fixed effects estimator, similar to ours, which
involves estimating the common factors and factor loadings across space and over time and finds
insignificant and null employment effects of minimum wages.


    3. Policy Context
         In June 2014, the City of Seattle passed a minimum wage ordinance, which gradually
increased the minimum wage within Seattle’s city boundaries to $15. 6 The phase-in rate differed
by employer size, and offered some differentiation for employers who pay tips or health benefits.
The minimum wage rose from the state’s $9.47 minimum to as high as $11 on April 1, 2015. The
second phase-in period started on January 1, 2016, when the minimum wage reached $13 for
large employers (see Table 1 for details). In this paper, we study the first and second phase-in
periods of the Seattle Minimum Wage Ordinance (hereafter, the Ordinance) during which the
minimum wage rose from $9.47 to $13 for large businesses – a 37.3% increase. 7 This ordinance,
which at the time would have raised Seattle’s minimum wage to the highest in the country, came
toward the beginning of a wave of state and local minimum wage laws passed in 2012-2016. 8
         Most prior research has, by necessity, focused on increases at the federal (Card 1992;
Katz and Krueger 1992; Belman and Wolfson 2010) or state (Card and Krueger 1994; Neumark
and Wascher 1995; Dube et al. 2010, 2016; Meer and West 2016) level. Seattle’s Ordinance

6
  $15 is high in the distribution of hourly wages in the U.S.; during 2012-14, 42.4% of U.S. workers earned less than
this amount (Tung, Lathrop, and Sonn 2015).
7
  As of 2016, employers with fewer than 501 employees worldwide that provide health benefits or pay tips could
pay a minimum wage of $10.50 if they contribute at least $1.50 towards tips and health benefits. Our data do not
allow us to observe if a worker gets health benefits, but we do observe total compensation, which includes tips. We
come back to this issue in greater detail when we discuss the data.
8
  During the years we study (2005 to 2016), the State of Washington had a state-specific minimum wage that was
indexed to CPI-W (growing at an average annual rate of 2%) and was, on average, 30% higher than the federal
minimum wage. As a result, none of the increases in the federal minimum wage over this time period were binding
in Washington.

provides an opportunity to study the minimum wage on a smaller geographic area with an
integrated labor market that could allow businesses and workers flexibility to relocate. Prior
research on local minimum wage policies found small or no employment effects, results
consistent with the bulk of the minimum wage literature (Potter 2006; Dube, Naidu, Reich 2007;
Schmitt and Rosnick 2011).
        For most of the phase-in period, the Ordinance mandates higher wages for larger
businesses, defined as those with more than 500 employees worldwide. For purposes of the
Ordinance, a franchised business – independently owned, but operated under contract with a
parent company and reflecting the parent company brand – is considered a large business so long
as the sum of employment at all franchises worldwide exceeds 500.
        Seattle implemented its groundbreaking minimum wage in the context of a robust local
economic boom. As the figures in Table 3 below indicate, overall employment expanded rapidly
in Seattle over the two years following the Ordinance’s passage. Our methods endeavor to
separate this background trend from the impact of the Ordinance itself.


    4. Data
4.1 Basic description
        We study the impact of the 2015 and 2016 minimum wage increases in Seattle using
administrative employment data from Washington State covering the period of 2005 through the
third quarter of 2016. Washington’s Employment Security Department collects quarterly payroll
records for all workers who received wages in Washington and are covered by Unemployment
Insurance (UI). 9 Employers are required to report actual hours worked for employees paid by the




9
  Most studies that analyze employment responses to minimum wage hikes in the US rely on data from the Quarterly
Census of Employment and Wages, which in turn relies on information from the same data source as we do –
payroll data on jobs covered by the UI program. As a result, our estimates will be comparable to many results in the
literature.


                                                        11
hour, and either actual hours worked or 40 times the number of weeks worked for salaried
employees. 10, 11
        This unique dataset allows us to measure the average hourly wage paid to each worker in
each quarter by dividing total quarterly earnings by quarterly hours worked. 12, 13, 14 As such, we
can identify jobs more likely affected by an increase in the minimum wage, and track trends in
employment counts, hours worked, and calculated average hourly wages. 15 Unlike the prior
literature, we can plausibly identify low-wage jobs across industries and in all demographic
groups, obviating the need for proxies based on those factors. 16 As a result, we can estimate
effects solely for low-wage jobs within all industries. 17




10
   ESD collects this information because eligibility for unemployment benefits in Washington is determined in part
by an hours worked test. Comparison of the distribution of hours worked in the ESD data with the distribution of
self-reported hours worked in the past week among Washington respondents to the CPS reveals some points of
departure. In particular, self-reported data show more pronounced “spikes” at even numbers such as 40 hours per
week – a pattern consistent with respondent rounding and consequently measurement error in CPS data. In general,
given the statutory reporting requirement driven by benefits determination provisions, ESD considers the hours data
reliable.
11
   Minnesota, Oregon, and Rhode Island are the other three states that collect data on hours.
12
   We convert nominal quarterly earnings into real quarterly earnings by dividing by the Consumer Price Index for
Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). All wage rates and earnings are expressed in second quarter of
2015 dollars.
13
   The average wage may differ from the actual wage rate for workers who earn overtime pay, or have other forms of
nonlinear compensation including commissions or tips. Workers may occasionally be paid in one quarter for work
performed in another. In analysis below, we exclude observations with calculated wages below $9 in 2015 dollars
and observations with calculated wages above $500 if reported hours were below 10 in a calendar quarter. We also
exclude observations reporting over 1,000 hours worked in a calendar quarter. These restrictions exclude 6.7% of
all job/quarter observations.
14
   ESD requires employers to include all forms of monetary compensation paid to a worker, including tips, bonuses
and severance payments. As such, for tipped employees we will observe total hourly compensation after adding tips,
as long as employers have reported tipped income in full.
15
   The average hourly wage construct used here is not directly comparable to, say, the self-reported hourly wage in
the CPS – in which respondents are instructed to exclude overtime, commissions, or tips. Results obtained through
analysis of this average hourly wage measure may differ from those gleaned from self-reported wage studies to the
extent that employers alter the use of overtime, tips, or commissions in response to the wage increase. Nonetheless,
Cengiz et al. (2017) find that “wage distributions in the CPS and in the administrative data”…“on hourly wages
from three U.S. states that collect this information (Minnesota, Washington, Oregon)”…“are quite similar both in
the cross section as well over time” (p. 3).
16
   While the CPS merged outgoing rotation group data include self-reported hourly wage rates, as noted above
respondent measurement error in hours would make analysis of the intensive margin problematic. Cengiz et al.
(2017) use CPS data to study employment only, not hours.
17
   We exclude from the analysis services provided to private households, such as cooks, maids, nannies, gardeners
etc. (NAICS code 814000) and services for the elderly and persons with disabilities (NAICS code 624120), because
in both of these industries private households rather than businesses serve as employers. As a result, the data for
these industries are often inconsistently reported, particularly for home caregivers reimbursed by Medicaid who are
technically employed by the individual they care for but report their hours to a state agency.


                                                        12
        The ESD data contain industry (NAICS) codes, which permit us to estimate results using
the restaurant industry proxy used in much of the prior literature (Dube et al. 2010, 2016;
Addison et al. 2012, 2014; Neumark et al. 2014; Allegretto et al. 2016; Totty 2017). 18
        We measure employment both as the number of jobs (headcount) and the number of
hours worked during the quarter. Because the data provide information on all jobs that were on
payroll during a quarter, including jobs which lasted only for a few weeks or even days, we
follow prior studies in focusing on the number of beginning-of-quarter jobs, defined as a person-
employer match which existed both in the current and previous quarter. 19 The hours worked
measure includes all employment, regardless of whether a person-employer match persists for
more than one quarter. Because the hours measure captures shifts in staffing on both the
intensive and extensive margins, we focus on this outcome in our preferred specifications.
        The ESD data exclude jobs not covered by the UI program, such as contract employment
generating IRS 1099 forms instead of W-2s, or jobs in the informal economy paid with cash. Our
estimates may overstate actual reductions in employment opportunities if employers respond to
the minimum wage by shifting some jobs under the table or outsourcing workers on payroll to
contractor positions.


4.2 Limitation to geographically locatable employment
        The data identify business entities as UI account holders. To determine the exact location
of each business, we geocode mailing addresses to exact latitude and longitude coordinates. We
then use these data to determine if a business is located within Seattle, and to place businesses
into Public Use Microdata Areas within Washington State.
        Firms with multiple locations have the option of establishing a separate UI account for
each location, or having a common account for several locations. Geographic identification in
the data is at the account level. As such, we can uniquely identify business location only for
single-site firms and those multi-site firms opting for separate accounts by location. 20 We

18
   Specifically, we examine employment and wages in the 3-digit NAICS code 722 “Food and Drinking Places”.
19
   This definition is used by the Quarterly Workforce Indicators, based on the Longitudinal Employer Household
Data (LEHD), and produces the total number of jobs comparable to the employment counts in the Quarterly Census
of Employment and Wages.
20
   Note that our analysis sample includes both independently-owned businesses and franchises where the owner
owns a single location, but excludes corporations and restaurant and retail chains which own their branches and
franchises whose owner owns multiple locations, unless these entities opt to establish separate UI accounts by
location.


                                                      13
therefore exclude multi-site single-account businesses, which employed 29% of employees state-
wide, from the analysis. Additionally, we are unable to geocode businesses with invalid
addresses or those whose address is listed only as “statewide” or “unknown”; 9% of employees
were employed by these businesses. The remaining firms included in the analysis are henceforth
referred to as “locatable” businesses. As shown in Table 2, in Washington State as a whole,
locatable businesses comprise 90% of firms, employ 62% of the entire workforce (which
includes 2.7 million employees in an average quarter) and 63% of all employees paid under $19
per hour. 21
         Multi-site single-account or “non-locatable” firms may respond differently to local
minimum wage laws for several reasons. These larger employers may be more likely to face
higher mandated minimum wages under the Ordinance. It is not possible to precisely determine
which employers are subject to the large business phase-in schedule, as Washington data identify
global employment only for those firms with no operations outside the state, do not identify
which entities have operations outside the state, and do not indicate whether a business operates
under a franchise agreement let alone the number of employees at all same-branded franchises.
While it is reasonable to assume that multi-site employers are more likely to be large and thus
subject to the higher wage mandate, it is by no means a perfect indicator. 22
         If it were a perfect indicator, basic economic theory suggests that excluded businesses
should reduce employment faster than included businesses, as they face a higher mandated wage
increase. Individual employees may exhibit some incentive to switch into employment at an
excluded firm, but these job changes will be tempered by any adverse impact on labor demand.
         This basic prediction could be altered to the extent that excluded businesses exhibit a
different labor demand elasticity relative to included businesses. On the one hand, firms with
establishments inside and outside of the affected jurisdiction might more easily absorb the added
labor costs from their affected locations, implying a less elastic response to a local wage
mandate. On the other hand, such firms might have an easier time relocating work to their
existing sites outside of the affected jurisdiction, implying a greater elasticity.

21
   Appendix Table 1 shows that the proportion of low-paid (under $19 per hour) employees included in the analysis
falls close to the 63% benchmark in the accommodation and food service industry and the health care and social
assistance industry. It exceeds the benchmark in manufacturing, educational services, and arts, entertainment and
recreation. It falls short of the benchmark in the retail industry.
22
   In addition, larger firms are more likely to provide health benefits to their workers, and the Ordinance establishes
a lower minimum wage for employers who contribute towards health benefits.


                                                          14
        Survey evidence collected by our research team in Seattle at the time of the first
minimum wage increase, and again one year later, suggests that multi-location firms were in fact
more likely to plan and implement staff reductions. 23 Moreover, the ESD data can be used to
track workers longitudinally, to check whether minimum wage increases are associated with an
increased flow of workers from locatable jobs to non-locatable jobs. If the Ordinance were to
cause an expansion of labor demand in the non-locatable sector, we might expect increased
worker flows into this sector. As Figure 1 illustrates, the rate of transition from locatable to non-
locatable employment – tracking individual workers from one year to the next – shows no
significant change in either Seattle or surrounding counties (described below) as the city’s
minimum wage increased. This result suggests that the Ordinance had no impact on gross flows
into the non-locatable sector. 24 Our best inference, in summary, is that our data restriction to
employment in locatable establishments is not likely to cause upward bias and, if anything, likely
biases our employment results towards zero.


4.3 Preliminary visual analysis to identify a wage threshold
        As indicated in section 2 above, we focus our analysis on jobs with calculated hourly
wages below a fixed (inflation-adjusted) threshold. This proxy for low-skilled employment will
produce accurate estimates of the impact of minimum wage increases to the extent that a wage
threshold accurately partitions the labor market into affected and unaffected components. It will
overstate employment reductions if the threshold is set low enough that the minimum wage
increase causes pay for some work to rise above it. This concern is particularly relevant given
previous evidence of “cascading” impacts of minimum wage increases on slightly higher-paying
jobs (Neumark et al. 2004; Autor, Manning, and Smith 2016; Brochu, Green, Lemieux, and
Townsend 2018). These cascading impacts may be caused by employers seeking to maintain
differentiation between the wages paid to their least-skilled workers and those paid to workers

23
   The Seattle Minimum Wage Study conducted a stratified random-sample survey of over 500 Seattle business
owners immediately before and a year after the Ordinance went into effect. In April 2015, multi-site employers were
more likely to report intentions to reduce hours of their minimum wage employees (34% versus 24%) and more
likely to report intentions to reduce employment (33% versus 26%). A one-year follow-up survey revealed that
multi-location employers were more likely to report an actual reduction in full-time and part-time employees, with
over half of multi-site respondents reporting a reduction in full-time employment (52%, against 45% for single-site
firms). See Romich et al. (2017) for details on employer survey methodology.
24
   The basic impression conveyed by this figure is confirmed by synthetic control regression analysis, which finds
no significant impact of the Ordinance on the probability that a low-wage individual employed at a locatable Seattle
business in a baseline quarter is employed in the non-locatable sector anywhere in Washington State one year later.


                                                        15
with higher skill or experience. 25 Our proxy for low-skilled employment may understate
proportional employment and wage effects if set too high, as effects on relevant jobs will be
diluted by the inclusion of irrelevant positions in the analysis. Imagining a reaction function
linking initial wages to post-increase wages, we aim to identify a fixed point above which there
does not appear to be any impact.
           Figure 2 presents plots of the wage distribution intended to identify potential fixed points.
Panel A of Figure 2 shows the histogram of quarterly hours worked across ten-cent-wide wage
bins, up to the $24.90-25.00 per hour level. Panel B shows the corresponding cumulative hours
histogram. We begin with something of a falsification test, showing comparisons of these
histograms for: the second quarter of 2012 versus the second quarter of 2013 (left column),
which was a full year before the passage of the Ordinance. We then introduce identical plots
comparing 2014.2 versus 2015.2 (center column), showing the changes concurrent with the $11
minimum wage; and 2015.2 versus 2016.2 (right column), showing the changes concurrent with
the $13 minimum wage.
           The left side of Panel A shows that the histogram of hours by wage for low-wage workers
was roughly steady during the year prior to the passage of the Ordinance. Were this panel to
reveal significant increases in real wages over time, when there was no increase in the real
minimum wage, we might doubt the ability of this exercise to identify minimum wage impacts.
In fact, these histograms are remarkably similar, with spikes generally corresponding to whole
numbers (e.g. at $10, $11, and $12 per hour) and with the slight leftward shift of the spikes
indicating nominal wage rigidity in the face of slight inflation. As shown in the left side of Panel
B, the number of hours worked for wages under $15 was roughly the same in 2012.2 and 2013.2.
By contrast, there is some evidence of growth in work paying moderately higher wage rates
between $15 and $25. This pattern is consistent either with selective growth in employment
opportunities for workers commanding moderately higher wages, or an upgrading of existing
positions to higher wage levels.
           The plots in the middle and right side of Panel A show clear direct impacts of Seattle’s
two minimum wage increases, with large spikes in the histogram of hours worked exactly at the
levels specified by the minimum wage schedule (presented in Table 1 and shown in Figure 2 by
the dotted vertical lines). In the right hand panel, the largest spike is observed at a wage of $12,

25
     For a detailed analysis of the effect of the Ordinance on firm behavior, see Jardim and van Inwegen (2018).


                                                           16
indicating that in our sample a larger number of hours were worked at the small-business
minimum than the $13 minimum for larger businesses. Additionally, we see strong declines in
the number of hours worked in Seattle for wages below these minimum wage thresholds. These
results suggest that the Ordinance affected the distribution and that our data are of high quality.
        These figures provide little evidence of cascading wage impacts beyond the range of $16-
$19. Moreover, we do not see strong increases in hours worked for wages just above the
statutory minimum wage levels. There are possible exceptions in the right hand panels,
particularly a spike in hours worked at $15 per hour. Although the $15 minimum wage was not
introduced for any business until 2017, both business owners and workers commonly
misperceived that Seattle’s law mandated a $15 minimum upon adoption (Romich et al. 2017).
Nonetheless, the figures suggest no abnormal increases in the number of hours worked in the
high teens or low 20s. If anything, growth in the number of positions paying between any wage
rate under $25 looks anemic compared to the 2012-13 time period.
        In our subsequent analysis, we select a preliminary, conservative threshold of $19 per
hour (almost exactly twice the baseline minimum) as a starting point for our analysis, and $6
above the top statutory minimum wage rate in the period under study. Beyond this $19 per hour
threshold, cascading effects are less likely to occur (Neumark et al. 2004). 26 We test sensitivity
to this choice by evaluating impacts up to a $25 per hour threshold. As shown below, we do not
find evidence of gains in hours between $19 and $25 per hour caused by the Ordinance. Thus,
the evidence suggests that a low-wage threshold $6 above the top statutory minimum poses little
risk of miscoding jobs as lost when they have really been promoted to higher wage levels.
        The use of any fixed threshold to define the low-wage labor market is a problematic
strategy to the extent that unrelated labor market trends are shifting equilibrium wages relative to
the threshold, or causing overall growth or decline. The left-hand panels of Figure 2 suggest that
such a pattern may have been underway before the minimum wage increased. Our analysis
below rests on two strategies for addressing this threat. First, the City of Seattle will be
compared to other geographic regions exhibiting similar labor market trends in the period
leading up to the minimum wage increase. Appendix Figure 1 previews this strategy by plotting
variants of Figure 2 for outlying areas of King County and the three urbanized counties


26
 Brochu et al. (2018) find a smaller range of cascading wages, with “spillover effects that go to about $2 above the
minimum wage” (p. 27).


                                                         17
surrounding King County. 27 The second strategy emphasizes timing: minimum wage increases
occur as discrete events rather than long-term trends.


      5. Methodology: Causal identification strategy
         We estimate the effect of the Ordinance on changes in employment and wages in Seattle
relative to the second quarter of 2014, when the Ordinance was passed. From this baseline
period, we analyze effects over the next nine calendar quarters. The first three correspond to the
period after the Ordinance was passed but before the first phase-in; this period is considered
“post-treatment” in our analysis to assess the possibility of anticipatory effects. 28 The minimum
wage reached as high as $11 in the fourth through sixth quarters after baseline and as high as $13
in the remaining quarters.
         We analyze variation in year-over-year changes in each outcome, and then combine these
estimates to derive the cumulative effect of the minimum wage. This approach differences out
seasonal fluctuations, and conforms to a standard time-series approach used in the prior
literature. We define the year-over-year change in outcome 𝑌𝑌 as follows:
(1)                                           Δ𝑌𝑌𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 = 𝑌𝑌𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 / 𝑌𝑌𝑟𝑟,𝑡𝑡−4 − 1

where     denotes region (e.g. Seattle or comparison region), and                 denotes quarter (with        ranging
from -33 to 9, and 𝑡𝑡 = 0 corresponding to the quarter during which the Ordinance was
passed). 29,30,31
         𝑌𝑌𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 is alternatively defined as low-wage workers’ average wage (computed as the average
hourly wages paid to low-wage workers weighted by their hours worked in a quarter), the sum of
hours worked by low-wage workers, the total number of beginning-of-quarter jobs held by low-

27
   Outlying King County is defined as the area of King County excluding the cities of Seattle and SeaTac. SeaTac
lies between Seattle and Tacoma with an area of 10 square miles mostly containing the Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport. In 2013, SeaTac passed a law raising its minimum wage to $15. We therefore exclude it from our analysis.
28
   Alternatively, if one assumes that anticipatory effects are unlikely, then these three months can be considered
policy leads and used to evaluate whether there is divergence in pre-implementation trends. As we show below, we
do not find significant evidence of anticipation effects, which could, alternatively, be interpreted as lack of
divergence in pre-implementation trends.
29
   Below we demonstrate that similar results are found using specifications that evaluate impacts on levels (𝑌𝑌𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 ) and
standardized levels.
30
   𝑡𝑡 = −33 corresponds to 2006.1, which is the earliest quarter for which our data permits computation of Δ𝑌𝑌𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 , and
thus the “pre-treatment” period that is evaluated includes quarterly observations beginning in 2006.1.
31
   In this paper, we use a repeated cross-sectional design. However, our data allow other methods to evaluate the
impact of the minimum wage in Seattle. For example Jardim et al. (2018a) exploits the longitudinal links to
evaluate the impact of the Ordinance on low-wage Seattle workers’ earnings and job spell durations.


                                                            18
wage workers, or the total earnings paid to low-wage workers during the quarter, in region r and
quarter t. 32
         We begin with three candidate causal identification strategies. We will subject these
strategies to a basic falsification test utilizing pre-treatment data before proceeding to the main
analysis.
         First, we consider a simple difference-in-differences specification, in which the outcomes
of the treated region (Seattle in our case) are compared to the outcomes of a neighboring control
region. We consider two different control regions. Comparison of Seattle to immediately
surrounding King County can be thought of as equivalent to the contiguous county specification
used by Dube et al. (2010). Next, we compare growth rates in employment in Seattle to
Snohomish, Kitsap, and Pierce Counties (SKP), which surround King County but do not share a
border with Seattle (see Figure 3). Since a higher minimum wage might have a spillover effect
on the parts of King County immediately adjacent to Seattle, we chose the counties which have
similar local economic climates to Seattle’s, but are not immediately adjacent to Seattle, as a
candidate control region. We expect SKP to experience a smaller (if any) spillover effect of the
Ordinance compared to King County, and thus yield a less biased estimate of its impact. 33
         In both cases, we estimate the following difference-in-differences specification:
(2)                                 Δ𝑌𝑌𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 = 𝛼𝛼𝑟𝑟 + 𝜓𝜓𝑡𝑡 + ∑9𝑞𝑞=1 𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞 𝑇𝑇𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 + 𝜀𝜀𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 ,

where 𝛼𝛼𝑟𝑟 is a region fixed effect, 𝜓𝜓𝑡𝑡 is a period fixed effect,                 is the treatment effect of the
Ordinance in quarter 𝑡𝑡 = 𝑞𝑞 (corresponding to the nine quarters after the Ordinance was passed),
𝑇𝑇𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 is an indicator that equals one for the treated region during which 𝑡𝑡 = 𝑞𝑞, and 𝜀𝜀𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 is an
idiosyncratic shock.
         In equation (2), 𝑞𝑞 = 1 corresponds to the third quarter of 2014, the first quarter after the
Ordinance had been passed; 𝑞𝑞 = 4 corresponds to the second quarter of 2015, when the first
phase-in of the Ordinance occurred; 𝑞𝑞 = 7 corresponds to the first quarter of 2016, when the


32
   Beginning-of-quarter jobs are defined as employer-employee spells which had non-zero earnings in two
consecutive spells, and correspond to jobs spells which started before the current quarter and ended either in the
current quarter or later. Beginning-of-quarter jobs is the best measure of the point-in-time employment which can be
derived based on payroll data, and the resulting job counts are very close to those reported in Quarterly Census of
Employment and Wage (QCEW).
33
   Our companion paper (Jardim et al., 2018b) examines this possibility of spillover and mechanisms for estimating
spillovers in greater detail. In that paper, we empirically estimate the extent of labor market integration by
evaluating the prevalence of pre-policy movements of low-wage workers between regions.


                                                            19
second phase-in occurred; and 𝑞𝑞 = 9 corresponds to the third quarter of 2016, the last period
included in our analysis. Since our interest is in the cumulative effect of the Ordinance on each
outcome, we convert these coefficients into cumulative changes using the following rules: for
quarters one to four 𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞 ; for quarters five to eight, 𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = (1 + 𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞 )�1 + 𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞−4 � − 1; and
for quarter nine 𝛽𝛽9𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = (1 + 𝛽𝛽9 )(1 + 𝛽𝛽5 )(1 + 𝛽𝛽1 ) − 1. 34 We present all results in terms of
cumulative changes, and adjust the standard errors accordingly using the delta method.
          The model in Equation 2 is a standard two-way fixed effect specification used in the
literature (Neumark and Wascher 2008). As pointed out in Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan
(2004), local economic outcomes in this model are not independent from each other, because
they come from the same region. We account for this correlation by calculating two-way
clustered standard errors at the region and year level.
          Difference-in-differences specifications assume that the treated and control region have
the same trends in the absence of the policy (parallel trends assumption), and will generally fail
to produce consistent treatment effect estimates if this assumption is not true. It is prudent to be
especially cautious about the parallel trends assumption given that the greater Seattle region
experienced rapid economic growth coming out of the Great Recession, and the pace of recovery
could have varied in different sub-regions. As we show below, our two difference-in-differences
specifications fail a falsification test, which suggests divergent trends between Seattle and
Outlying King County and between Seattle and SKP.
          To overcome this concern, we estimate the impact of the minimum wage using two
methods which allow for flexible pre-policy trends in control and treated regions: the synthetic
control method (Abadie and Gardeazabal 2003) and the interactive fixed effects method (Bai,
2009). Both methods have been used in the regional policy evaluation literature and applied to
the minimum wage as well (see Allegretto, Dube, Reich, and Zipperer (2013) for an application
of synthetic control, and Totty (2017) for an application of interactive fixed effects).
          Both methods assume that changes in employment in each region can be represented as a
function of 𝐾𝐾 unobserved linear factors plus the treatment effect:
(3)                                     Δ𝑌𝑌𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 = ∑𝐾𝐾                    9
                                                   𝑘𝑘=1 𝜆𝜆𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 + ∑𝑞𝑞=1 𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞 𝑇𝑇𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 + 𝜀𝜀𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 ,

  Note that since our estimate of 𝛽𝛽9𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is composed of a product containing three estimated coefficients (i.e., 𝛽𝛽1 , 𝛽𝛽5 ,
and 𝛽𝛽9 ), it is likely to have a larger standard error than other cumulative change estimates (i.e., 𝛽𝛽1𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ,…, 𝛽𝛽8𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ), and
this contention is confirmed in the results shown below.


                                                                 20
where 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 is an unobserved factor, common across all regions in each year-quarter, and 𝜆𝜆𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 is a
region-specific factor loading, constant across time.
         The unobserved factors can be thought of as common economic shocks which affect all
regions at the same time, such as an exchange rate shock, common demand shock, or changes in
weather. Because the regions are allowed to have different sensitivity in response to these
shocks, the treated and control regions are no longer required to have parallel trends.
         Though both the synthetic control and interactive fixed effects estimators have the same
underlying model, their implementation is quite different. The synthetic control estimator does
not explicitly estimate the factors or factor loading, and uses pre-policy observations to find an
optimal set of (weighted) control regions, which collectively match the pre-policy trend in the
treated region. Denote Seattle by 𝑟𝑟 = 1 and denote 𝑟𝑟 = 2, … , 𝑅𝑅 all potential control regions.
Then the weights for synthetic control can be found by minimizing forecasting error in the pre-
policy period:

                                                                                          2

         We allow weights across regions to be different for each outcome to improve the quality
of the match in 2006-2014. Appendix Figure 2 shows that the set of regions in Washington,
which receive a positive weight in synthetic control estimator is very similar for employment
outcomes and payroll, but somewhat different for wage rates. 36
         The interactive fixed effects approach estimates the factors and factor loadings in
Equation 3 explicitly, by imposing normalization on the sum of the factors. Since the number of
unobserved factors is not known, we estimate the model allowing for up to 30 unobserved
factors, and pick the model with the optimal number of factors using the criterion developed in

35
  We implement synthetic control estimator using the R programs provided by Gobillon and Magnac (2016).
36
  Pairwise correlations between synthetic control weights chosen for hours worked, number of jobs, and payroll are
each larger than 0.75, while the correlations of the synthetic control weights chosen for wages with weights chosen
for the other three outcomes is positive, but smaller (0.22, 0.24, and 0.12). Examination of the weights, depicted in
Appendix Figure 2, suggest a basic intuitive story: the strong growth in employment in Seattle finds its closest
parallels in outer suburban or exurban portions of the state, where rapid population growth drives expansion of local
economies. The strongest resemblance to Seattle in terms of wages, by contrast, tends to be in closer-in suburban
areas, including the satellite centers of Tacoma and Everett.


                                                                  21
Bai and Ng (2002). 37 We implement the interactive fixed effects estimator following Gobillon
and Magnac (2016) who developed a publicly-available program to estimate the treatment effects
in the regional policy evaluation context. Appendix Figure 3 shows the sensitivity of the
interactive fixed effects estimates as a function of the number of factors used, as well as showing
the choice of the optimal number of factors.
         We implement the synthetic control and interactive fixed effects estimators by
approximating Seattle’s economy using data on employment trends across Public Use Microdata
Areas (PUMAs) in Washington State. A PUMA is a geographic unit defined by the U.S. Census
Bureau with a population of approximately 100,000 people, designed to stay within county
boundaries when possible. 38 In principle, we could use different geographic units, such as
counties, which are larger than PUMAs, or census tracts, which are much smaller than PUMAs.
We have chosen PUMAs because they provide a good compromise in terms of geographic
aggregation. On the one hand, PUMAs are generally smaller than counties and allow donors to
come from areas of the state affected by similar economic trends in Seattle. On the other hand,
PUMAs are quite large and less likely to be affected by idiosyncratic shocks.
         We exclude King County PUMAs from the analysis because of potential spillover
effects. The remainder of Washington includes 40 PUMAs (see Figure 4), while Seattle is
composed of five PUMAs. 39 In the interactive fixed effects estimation we allow each Seattle
PUMA to be a separate unit of observation, and estimate a common coefficient for the Seattle
PUMAs in each treated period (i.e. nine coefficients in total). In the synthetic control estimation,
we first calculate a weighted average of the growth rates of the five Seattle PUMAs, weighted by
hours worked in each PUMA four quarters ago, and then estimate the effect of the minimum
wage on this weighted average growth rate, treating it as one unit. Though the coefficients which


37
   The coefficients, 𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞 , can be identified if the number of factors is smaller than the number of periods in the data
minus the number of coefficients to be estimated minus one. In our case, we cannot have more than 32 factors in the
model (43 periods – 9 coefficients – 1). We choose the optimal number of factors using criterion IC2 suggested in
Bai and Ng (2002), as it was shown to have good performance in small samples. In our application, the optimal
number of factors is always smaller than the maximum number of factors allowed by the model.
38
   Twenty-seven of Washington’s thirty-nine counties have fewer than 100,000 inhabitants, implying that they must
share a PUMA with territory in at least one other county.
39
   Given Seattle’s unique status as a city experiencing a tech-driven economic boom, there may be some concern
that our restriction to Washington State forces us to use comparison regions that match poorly to the City’s labor
market dynamics. We present evidence on the high quality of fit between treatment and control region below.
Intuitively, we seek regions that match Seattle’s dynamics in the low-wage labor market. Appendix Figure 2 reveals
that the high quality matches tend to be found in suburban or exurban regions of the state that are themselves
experiencing growth, often associated with new construction and expansion of the residential population.

we estimate by both methods correspond to the effect on the year-over-year growth rate in each
outcome, we report the estimates of the cumulative effect of the minimum wage since the
passage of the Ordinance, which we calculate in the same way as in the case of the difference-in-
differences method.
         We calculate the standard errors for the interactive fixed effects coefficients based on the
assumption of the independent and identically distributed idiosyncratic shocks 𝜀𝜀𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 , i.e. we
assume that any correlation in shocks across regions has been captured by the common factors.
We report p-values for the null hypothesis that each cumulative effect equals zero based on
standard errors calculated using the delta method.
         Inference for the synthetic control method is based on placebo-in-space permutations, as
is customary in the literature (Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller 2014; Firpo and Possebom
2017). 40 We estimate the effect of placebo treatments introduced in the second quarter of 2014,
i.e. in the quarter when Ordinance was passed, in all possible combinations of five contiguous
PUMAs in Washington State excluding King County. 41 This allows us to locate the coefficients
estimated in our main analysis within a distribution of coefficients obtained in settings where we
expect no actual treatment effect. For the cumulative effect in each period, we report the p-value
for the null hypothesis of no effect, calculated as the share of placebo estimates which were
                                                                                           1

are 2,994 possible combinations of five contiguous PUMAs in WA outside of King County, so
the smallest possible p-value for each coefficient is 1/2,994 = 0.0003. 42
         Finally, we also calculate confidence intervals for the estimates of the effect of the
minimum wage on employment, which we obtain by inverting the test statistic (Imbens and



40
   The synthetic control method does not yield conventional standard error estimates.
41
   Note that Seattle spans 5 PUMAs, thus our placebo treatment region replicates Seattle’s size. Further, we require
that the 5 PUMAs randomly selected as placebo “treated” be contiguous. By making the placebo-treated region
contiguous, we replicate the contiguous nature of Seattle, and thus account for the possibility of common regional
shocks.
42
   Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010) report the p-value based on the same procedure which we use, while
Abadie et al. (2014) and Firpo and Possebom (2017) recommend dividing the estimate by the pre-policy MSPE for
each region, and calculating the p-value based on the rank of this statistic. We have calculated the p-values using
their method as well. Conclusions about the statistical significance based on these two procedures are very similar.

the results, we present 𝛽𝛽̂𝑞𝑞𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 and 𝑝𝑝�𝛽𝛽̂𝑞𝑞𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 � in tables and show confidence intervals in figures.


     6. Results
6.1 Simple first-difference analysis
         Table 3 presents summary statistics on the number of jobs, total hours worked, average
wages, and total payroll in Seattle’s locatable establishments for all industries and for food and
drinking places by wage level for the quarter the Ordinance was passed (t = 0, including June
2014), the first three quarters after the law was passed (t = 1, 2, or 3, July 2014-March 2015), and
the first six quarters after the law was in force (t = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, April 2015-September
2016). These statistics portray a general image of the Seattle labor force over this time period
and should not be interpreted as estimates of the causal impact of the Ordinance.
         As shown in Panel A of Table 3, comparing the baseline second quarter of 2014 to the
second quarter of 2016, the number of jobs paying less than $13 per hour in all industries
declined from 38,013 to 25,053 (a decline of 12,960 or 34%). 44 The decline is consistent with
legislative intent, while the persistence of employment at wages below $13 reflects the lower
minima applied to small businesses and those offering health benefits. 45
         The reduction in employment at wages under $13 could reflect either movement of wage
rates above this threshold or the elimination of jobs. Table 3 panel A shows that over the same
two-year time period, the number of jobs paying less than $19 per hour fell from 90,757 to




43
   Because we have 2,994 possible combinations of the contiguous PUMAs, we are able to use 95.02338%
confidence level for our estimates (149/2,944*100% = 95.02338%).
44
   Note that we are using the second quarter of 2016 to avoid issues with seasonality. Seattle’s low-wage labor force
tends to peak in the third quarter of each year during the summertime tourist season, and exhibits a trough in the
winter months.
45
   Low-wage employment could also reflect overestimation of hours by the employer, underreporting of tips, hours
worked for wages paid in a different calendar quarter, a subminimum wage set equal to 85 percent of the minimum
for workers under 16 years old, situations where Seattle-based employers hire employees to work outside the city
limits, or noncompliance with the ordinance.

89,188 (a decline of 1,569 or 1.7%). 46 Measuring hours worked at low wages rather than
employee headcount shows a 5.1 million hour reduction at wages under $13, and a 1.0 million
hour (2.7%) reduction at wages under $19.
         Over this same period, overall employment in Seattle expanded dramatically, by over
14.6% in headcount and 15.8% in hours. Table 3 makes clear that the entirety of this
employment growth occurred in jobs paying over $19 per hour. 47 The impression of skewed
growth – driven in part by rapid growth in the technology sector – extends to wage data. 48
Average hourly wages at jobs paying less than $19 per hour rose from $14.19 to $15.00 (a 6.4%
increase), while average hourly wages at all jobs surged from $38.48 to $47.09 (a 22.4%
increase). 49, 50
         Table 3 documents that payroll reductions attributable to declines in hours worked
substantially cut into the observed wage increases for jobs paying under $19 per hour; the sum
total of earnings paid at wages under $19 increased only slightly (2.9%) from 517 to 532 million
dollars between second quarter of 2014 and the second quarter of 2016, and the gain is even
smaller (0.4%) when comparing “peak” third quarter statistics in 2014 and 2016. 51
         Panel B of Table 3 restricts attention to Food and Drinking Places (NAICS industry 722),
which, respectively, comprised 32%, 24%, and 11% of jobs in Seattle’s locatable establishments
paying less than $13 per hour, less than $19 per hour, and overall during the quarter when the




46
   Appendix Table 2 breaks down the changes in employment into more wage categories. The largest gains in
employment occurred for jobs paying more than $40 per hour, which grew 32% between second quarter of 2014 and
the second quarter of 2016.
47
   The more detailed statistics in Appendix Table 2 show that net job growth in Seattle was 25% for jobs paying over
$25 per hour but only 3% for jobs paying under $25. About 66% of net job growth can be attributed to jobs paying
over $40 per hour, and 81% to jobs paying over $30 per hour.
48
   QCEW data for King County indicate that between 2014 and the third quarter of 2016, the county added 94,000
jobs. The majority of these job gains can be attributed to four industries: non-store retail, information,
professional/technical services, and construction. The food service industry added more than 10,000 jobs
countywide over this same time period.
49
   The average hourly wage statistic for all jobs includes a large number of salaried jobs in which hours may be
imputed at 40 per week rather than tracked.
50
   The median hourly wage, weighted by hours, which is not shown in Table 3, was $25.81 in the second quarter of
2014. Note that the ratio of the $13 minimum wage and this median wage (what is known as the “Kaitz Index,”
Kaitz (1970)) is 0.504. Given the high wages in Seattle, this level of the Kaitz Index is not particularly high. For
comparison, the Kaitz Index for the US federal minimum wage was 0.371 in 2014 (Cooper, Mishel, and Schmitt
2015).
51
   In contrast, between the second quarter of 2014 and the second quarter of 2016, total quarterly earnings paid at
wage rates above $19 increased by $2.1 billion (46.2%) – implying a dramatic increase in inequality of earnings
between low- and high-wage workers in Seattle.

Ordinance was passed. Although this industry accounts for a minority of all low-wage
employment, we highlight it for purposes of comparison with existing literature.
        As in the full economy, growth in hours at restaurant jobs paying above $19 per hour
exceeded growth in lower-paying restaurant jobs. At all wages, hours within this industry
expanded by 12.6% while hours worked by low-wage employees in the restaurant industry was
nearly unchanged, up 0.8% between the second quarter of 2014 and the second quarter of 2016.
Wages in the restaurant sector grew comparably in the low-wage market and the full market:
11.6% growth in wages in jobs paying less than $19 per hour, and 12.5% growth in wages in all
jobs.


6.2 Falsification tests
        Previous analyses have raised concerns regarding the applicability of the parallel trends
assumption in minimum wage evaluation (e.g., Allegretto et al. 2016). For this reason, and to
assess the performance of our proposed estimators, we conduct a simple falsification test by
estimating the effects of a “placebo” law as if it were passed two years earlier (second quarter of
2012). We restrict this analysis to data spanning from the first quarter of 2005 to the third
quarter of 2014. Table 4 presents the results.
        We find strong evidence that total hours worked in jobs paying less than $19 per hour in
Seattle diverged from both surrounding King County and SKP after second quarter 2012, as
shown in columns 2 and 4. In both columns, all of the estimated pseudo-effects on hours are
negative and significant, and would falsely suggest the placebo law caused a reduction in hours
of 4.4% or 5.6%, respectively, in the average quarter following the second quarter of 2012.
Given this divergent trend, we consider the two difference-in-differences estimators to have
failed the falsification test and dispense with them henceforth.
        In contrast, the synthetic control and interactive fixed effects results shown in columns 5-
8 behave well, with only 2 of the 36 estimated coefficients being significant at the two-tailed 90-
percent confidence level, and none being significant at the 95-percent level. Thus, these methods
“pass” the falsification test. 52 Given the general lack of significance of these estimated pseudo


52
  Across both methods, all but one of the estimated pseudo-effects on hours are negative and average -1.7% and -
1.6%, respectively. If these same negative pseudo-effects on hours persist into the period that we study, we would
moderately overstate the negative effect of Seattle’s minimum wage on hours. As will be seen below, these negative
coefficients are not consistently observed in the first three quarters of “post” data, between adoption of the


                                                       26
effects, we consider the synthetic control and interactive fixed effects to be reliable means of
estimating causal impacts. In the tables below, we show estimates from both methods.


6.3 Examining the synthetic control match
         Before turning to the estimates of the effect of the Ordinance, we examine the quality of
the match for our preferred method, synthetic control, between Seattle and synthetic Seattle in
2006.1 – 2014.2, i.e. during the periods used to select the synthetic weights.
         Figure 5 plots the time series of year-over-year percentage changes in average wages,
jobs, hours worked, and payroll for low-wage jobs in Seattle and the weighted average of
PUMAs outside King County identified using the synthetic control algorithm. 53 In each panel,
trends in Seattle and the control region track closely through 2014. As shown in Panel A, wage
growth patterns match to within a 0.5 percentage point tolerance except around 2009, where
wage trends in the control region appear to anticipate those in the city.
         Employment trends (panels B and C for jobs and hours, respectively) likewise match
closely, with discrepancies below a 2-percentage point threshold except in the period around the
Great Recession, where the control region appears to enter the slump slightly before Seattle, and
during the recovery in 2011, during which Seattle’s growth in low-wage jobs briefly exceeded
the control region. Total payroll growth also matches closely throughout the pre-policy period.
Previewing our main results, each of these time series shows a stark divergence between Seattle
and the synthetic control region once the minimum wage begins to rise.
         Figure 6 repeats this analysis with separate trend lines for each PUMA in Washington
outside King County. This figure shows that Seattle’s pre-Ordinance year-over-year percentage
changes in wages, hours, jobs, and payroll lie within the convex hull of these other PUMAs.
Further, this figure shows that while wages rose faster in Seattle than most of the other PUMAs
post-Ordinance, Seattle experienced nearly the largest declines in hours, jobs, and payroll. 54

Ordinance and the first wage phase-in. For wages, there is less cause for concern as in the average quarter following
the placebo law, estimated pseudo-effects are much smaller, +0.5% and -0.2%, respectively.
53
   Appendix Figure 4 shows a parallel analysis of the time series for Seattle compared to Outlying King County and
SKP.
54
   Appendix Figures 5 and 6 compares Seattle to these same PUMAs, but shows levels of each outcome rather than
year-over-year percentage changes. Note that since Seattle contains five PUMAs, we have divided Seattle’s jobs,
hours, and payroll by five to ensure comparability of magnitudes. Seattle’s average wage paid to workers earning
less than $19 per hour is generally near or at the top of the distribution of other PUMAs, while its jobs, hours, and
payroll are well within the convex hull of the other PUMAs. In Appendix Figures 7 and 8, we repeat the analysis
with standardized levels as well to make Seattle more comparable to other PUMAs. For this analysis, we

         These graphs anticipate our causal effect estimates: in all cases, the post-Ordinance
period is marked by treatment-control divergences well outside the range observed in the pre-
treatment period.


6.4 Causal effect estimates
         Table 5 presents our first estimates of the causal impact of the Ordinance for workers
earning less than $19 per hour. 55 Looking at both sets of results, we associate the first minimum
wage increase, to $11, with wage effects of 1.1% to 2.2% (averaging 1.7%). The second
increase, to $13, associates with a larger 3.0% to 3.4% wage effect (averaging 3.2%). A 3.2%
increase in the wage of these workers corresponds to $0.45 per hour relative to the base average
wage of $14.19. 56 We do not find evidence that wages rose or fell in anticipation of enforcement
during the three quarters following passage of the law using the synthetic control method, with
coefficients ranging from 0.2% to 0.3%, while the interactive fixed effects specification shows
some evidence of wages rising post-passage, but pre-enforcement, ranging from 0.5% to 0.9%,
and significant for the second and third quarters after passage.
         These wage effect estimates appear modest in comparison to much of the existing
literature. We note that the first-difference results presented in Table 3 themselves indicate
modest increases in wages at the low end of the scale (under $19 per hour), about 3.2% during
the first phase-in and 5.8% during the second. These estimates suggest that wages increased in
the control region as well – a pattern clearly observed in Figure 5 panel A. 57 We further note
that Table 3 indicates that the majority of jobs (58%) and hours (63%) paying less than $19/hour


standardize each time series by first computing the difference between the region’s outcome level in year-quarter 𝑡𝑡
and the region’s mean level of the outcome and then dividing this difference by the region’s standard deviation of
the level of the outcome. The patterns we observe in both levels and standardized levels are similar to those we
observe in year-over-year percentage changes, with Seattle’s wages rising faster than Synthetic Seattle’s wages, and
with hours, jobs, and payroll in Seattle lagging behind Synthetic Seattle. These conclusions are further
demonstrated in Appendix Table 3 which compares the results from our growth rates specification (which will be
discussed in Tables 5 and 6) to specifications using levels and standardized levels and shows that the results are
generally robust.
55
   We have chosen $19 per hour as a conservative threshold for our estimates. We discuss sensitivity of the estimates
to the choice of the wage threshold below in detail.
56
   Estimated wage impacts are larger when the low-wage threshold is lowered from $19 per hour (see Figure 7 for
estimated effect on wages using lower thresholds). This result is consistent with the Ordinance having sizable
effects on the lowest-paid workers and smaller cascading impacts on workers with initial wages closer to $19.
Alternatively, a smaller wage effect for larger wage thresholds is consistent with an attenuation bias when we pool
affected and unaffected workers.

   Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Employment Statistics indicate that seasonally adjusted average
hourly earnings for all employees increased about 5.5% nationwide from June 2014 to September 2016.

at baseline were not directly impacted by the minimum wage increase to $13. Any impacts on
wages for jobs paying between $13 and $19 per hour at baseline would be “cascading” effects
expected to be much smaller than the impact on lowest earners. If we were to presume that our
estimate reflects some sizable impact on jobs directly impacted by the increase and no cascading
effects on other jobs under $19 per hour, the impact works out to an 11.0% wage increase, a
level in line with existing literature. 58 Finally, we note that the measure of wages used here –
average hourly wages – would by construction capture employer responses such as a reduction in
the use of overtime. These would not be captured in, for example, self-reported CPS wage data.
        Table 6 shows employment impacts for jobs paying less than $19 per hour. As shown in
columns 1 and 2, relative to the baseline quarter (2014.2), we estimate statistically insignificant
effects on hours ranging between +0.8% and -2.7% (averaging -0.8%) during the three quarters
when the minimum wage was $11. By contrast, the subsequent minimum wage increase to $13
associates with larger, significant hours reductions between 4.6% and 9.2% (averaging 6.9%).
Columns 3 and 4 present a parallel analysis for jobs, with similar results: statistically weak
evidence of reductions in the first phase-in period (averaging -2.5%) followed by larger generally
significant impacts in the second (averaging -5.9%). 59 The adverse effects on hours in the final
three quarters are greater than the effects on jobs, suggesting that employers are not only
reducing the number of low-wage jobs, but also reducing the hours of retained employees.
Multiplying the -5.9% average job estimate by the 90,757 jobs paying less than $19 per hour at
baseline suggests that the Ordinance caused the elimination of 5,340 low-wage jobs at locatable
establishments compared to the scenario in which the minimum wage does not increase. Since
Seattle’s locatable establishments lost about 3,000 low-wage jobs between the second quarter of
2014 and the third quarter of 2016 (Table 3), our estimates suggest that in the absence of the
policy change locatable establishments in Seattle would have added 2,350 low-wage jobs. Scaled


58
   Belman and Wolfson (2014) point to elasticities of wages paid to statutory minimum wage increases in the range
of 0.2 to 0.5. An effect of 11% on a minimum wage increase of 37% would imply an elasticity 0.29. We note,
moreover, that the highest $13 minimum did not apply to small business or businesses providing health benefits. In
particular, the histogram of hours worked at different wage levels in Seattle in the second quarter of 2016
demonstrated the largest spike at $12 rather than at $13 per hour (see Figure 2, Panel A).
59
   Note that we measure jobs as person-employer matches which existed both in the previous and the current quarter,
which corresponds to the number of jobs at the beginning of each quarter, but we measure hours worked in any jobs
during the whole quarter. Due to this discrepancy in definitions, there is likely to be a one-quarter lag in the
detection of an effect if the employment effect occurs through reduced hiring rates, which would be reasonable to
expect in high-turnover industries. This might explain why we see a jump in the estimated effects on jobs between
2016.1 and 2016.2


                                                        29
up linearly to account for multi-site single-account firms, job losses would amount to roughly
8,400. 60
          As noted above, there is some concern that our methodology might yield negative
estimates in scenarios where increasing labor demand is leading to a rightward shift in the
overall wage distribution, pushing a growing number of jobs above any given threshold. We
note that the results in Table 6 would be consistent with this “rightward shift” hypothesis only
under a specific and unusual set of circumstances. In the synthetic control estimates for hours,
for example, we observe no significant negative coefficients through the end of 2015. The point
estimates exhibit a sudden change in the first quarter of 2016 and then remain at this more
negative level. A confounding rightward shift would have had to occur precisely at the
beginning of 2016 – in the winter, the trough period of Seattle’s seasonal economy, which is less
likely.
          To probe this issue further, Figures 7-9 illustrate the sensitivity of the estimated effects
on wages and hours (based on the synthetic control method) using different thresholds ranging
from jobs paying less than $12 per hour to jobs paying less than $25 per hour. 61 In Figure 7, we
show the effect on wage growth. Not surprisingly, as we raise the threshold towards $25 per
hour, the estimated effect on wage growth diminishes. This pattern is what we would expect
since, as we raise the threshold, the jobs that are added into the sample are less affected, or even
unaffected, by cascading effects. That is, the estimated effect is attenuated as we add in more
unaffected jobs.
          Figure 8 shows the estimated effects on hours given different thresholds, and Figure 9
illustrates these same results, but multiplies the estimated coefficients by the baseline number of
hours worked in jobs paying below the threshold. For the effects of raising the minimum wage to
$11, shown in the top-3 panels, the estimated impacts become insignificant once the threshold
rises to around $16-17 per hour. It appears that any “loss” in hours at lower thresholds likely
reflects a cascade of workers to higher wage levels. In contrast, as shown in the bottom panel,
the negative estimated effects of the second phase-in to $13 are significant at the 5-percent level


60
   We cannot ascertain whether the effect on locatable establishments should extrapolate to multi-site single-account
firms. As noted above, survey evidence suggests that multi-location firms were more likely to have reported
reducing staffing in the wake of minimum wage increases.
61
   More specifically, we evaluate jobs paying the highest minimum wage in Seattle in that quarter plus $1 (i.e., $12
for 2015.2-2015.4 and $14 for 2016.1 to 2016.3) up to $25 per hour.


                                                         30
as we raise the threshold all of the way to $25 per hour for 2016.1, and close to significant at all
thresholds for 2016.2 and 2016.3. 62 These results suggest that estimated employment effects do
not completely converge to zero, and rather reflect an actual reduction in low-wage employment
that cannot be explained by workers upgrading their wage above $19. 63 As shown in Figure 9,
the estimated absolute change in total hours concurrent with the increase in the minimum wage
to $13 is 3.0 million hours per quarter when the threshold is set at $19 per hour, and this point
estimate varies little as we increase the threshold to $25 per hour. Confidence intervals widen as
we increase the threshold – we are, in essence, looking for the same needle (i.e., the same 3.0-
million-hour decline) in a larger haystack as we increase the threshold. Nonetheless, note that 3.0
million fewer hours worked is within the 50-percent confidence interval for each quarter 2016.1
to 2016.3 given a threshold of $19 per hour or a threshold of $25 per hour. Thus, we conclude
that the estimated employment losses associated with the second phase-in reflect an actual
reduction in hours worked by low-wage workers, rather than a jump of wages over the selected
wage threshold. We return to this issue in Section 6.6.
          Because the estimated magnitude of employment losses exceeds the magnitude of wage
gains in the second phase-in period, we would expect a decline in total payroll for jobs paying
under $13 per hour relative to baseline. Table 7 confirms this expectation using regression
specifications examining the impact on payroll for jobs paying less than $19 per hour. Although
results are not statistically significant, point estimates suggest payroll declines of 1.3% to 3.9%
(averaging 3.0%) during the second phase-in period. This implies that the minimum wage
increase to $13 from the baseline level of $9.47 reduced income paid to low-wage employees of
locatable Seattle businesses by roughly $62 million on an annual basis. 64


6.5 Elasticity estimates




62
   Recall, as previously noted, that confidence intervals for the final quarter, 2016.3, are wider than for 2016.1 and
2016.2 as 𝛽𝛽9𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is composed of a product containing three estimated coefficients (i.e., 𝛽𝛽1 , 𝛽𝛽5 , and 𝛽𝛽9 ), whereas 𝛽𝛽7𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐
and 𝛽𝛽8𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 are each only composed of a product containing two estimated coefficients.
63
   If there is an absolute loss in hours worked in low-wage jobs, then the estimated effect would not converge to
zero, no matter how high we raised the threshold.
64
   Simple calculations based on preceding results suggest an effect of comparable magnitude. Hours results suggest
a 6.9% decline in hours, which on a base of $517 million paid in the baseline quarter amounts to a $142 million less
in annual payroll. Wage results suggest a 3.2% boost to earnings, which amounts to a $70 million increase in annual
payroll (again assuming 6.9% fewer hours). Combining these results yields a net annual loss of $72 million.


                                                                31
          Column 1 of Table 8 shows our estimate of the elasticity of labor demand with respect to
changes in wages computed as the ratio of our estimated effect on hours to our estimated effect
on wages, using the synthetic control method, for the six quarters after the Ordinance was
enforced. 65 We also compute measures of statistical uncertainty for these elasticities since they
are the ratio of two estimates. 66, 67 During the first phase-in, when the minimum wage was $11,
estimated elasticities range from -0.32 to -1.74 (averaging -0.88). Notably, we cannot reject
elasticity = -1 with 95-percent confidence, which is consistent with our finding in Table 7 that
we could not reject zero effect on payroll. Additionally, we cannot reject elasticity = 0, which is
consistent with our finding in Table 6 that we could not reject zero effect on hours. The relatively
modest estimated wage and hours impacts of the first phase-in create considerable statistical
uncertainty regarding the associated elasticity estimate.
          Estimated elasticities for the period after the minimum wage increased to $13 range from
-2.15 to -2.94 (averaging -2.63). Point estimates of elasticities imply that, within Seattle, low-
wage workers lost more than $2 in forgone employment opportunities for every $1 gained from
higher hourly wages. While the estimates of these elasticities are still noisy, we can reject the
hypothesis that the elasticity equals zero (consistent with Table 6) for 2016.1 and 2016.2 and
nearly for 2016.3. We cannot reject the hypothesis that the elasticity equals -1 with 95-percent
confidence. In Figure 10, we show the sensitivity of these estimated elasticities using different
thresholds. These very large elasticities do not appear to be artifacts of setting the threshold at
$19 per hour. The upper panels of Figure 10 show the conventional 95-percent confidence


65
   One might think that the decline in hours worked was due to a voluntary cut in hours, and thus interpret our
findings as showing a labor supply elasticity in the region where the labor supply curve is “backwards bending.”
While there may be some voluntary reductions in hours by some workers, it would be unreasonable to expect such
workers to reduce their hours so far that their total earnings declined. Given that hours fall more than wages rise, the
results more likely reflect a decline in labor demand. Worker interview data collected by members of our research
team suggest that the proportion of low-wage workers opting to voluntarily reduce hours as a result of wage
increases is nonzero, but small.
66
   We compute the 95-percent confidence interval for the estimated elasticities based on the permutation inference,
taking into account the correlation between estimated effect of the minimum wage on employment and wages within
PUMAs. We include a pair of estimates (𝛽𝛽 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 , 𝛽𝛽 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑠𝑠 ) into the 95-percent confidence set if after subtracting
these estimates from the observed outcomes in Seattle we cannot reject a zero effect on both outcomes in Seattle
after the passage of the minimum wage at the 5-percent significance level based on the permutation inference. After
that, we estimate the confidence interval for employment elasticity by calculating elasticity as 𝛽𝛽 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 /𝛽𝛽 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑒𝑒𝑠𝑠 for all
pairs of (𝛽𝛽 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 , 𝛽𝛽 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 ) which belong to the confidence set.
67
   Note that our estimates of the “demand elasticity” might not map onto any particular labor demand curve as we
are blending workers at the lowest wage levels with workers at more modest wage levels (e.g., those with wages
below $15 compared to those between $18 and $19). As such, it is best to think our estimates as weighted average
elasticity for workers with wages below $19.


                                                                32
intervals (which get quite wide for higher thresholds due to lower estimated effects on wages at
higher wage thresholds), whereas the bottom panels zoom-in on the 50-percent confidence
intervals (which, arguably, might be more valuable information for policymakers). As shown
more clearly in the lower part of Figure 10, the estimated elasticities are very close to -3 when
the threshold is set anywhere between $16 and $25 per hour. 68 At most thresholds, an elasticity
of -1 is not within the 50-percent confidence intervals – the preponderance of the evidence
suggests that hours fell more than wages rose in Seattle’s low-wage jobs.
         The larger elasticities in the second phase-in period relative to the first suggest that total
earnings paid to low-wage workers in Seattle might be maximized with a statutory minimum
wage somewhere in the range of $9.47 to $11. By contrast, increases beyond $11 per hour
appear to have resulted in net earnings losses in Seattle for these workers.


6.6 A final assessment of “rightward shift”
         As noted above, our analytical strategy may be confounded by contemporaneous trends
or shocks that shift the wage distribution to the right, reducing the number of hours worked
below any fixed threshold even when there is no actual reduction in hours worked overall.
Evidence to this point – the cumulative density functions in Figure 2, the coefficient estimates
indicating immediate impacts in a time period marked by slack labor demand – does not
generally support the “rightward shift” hypothesis. Nonetheless, we can examine the issue more
closely, decomposing the year-over-year growth rates of hours worked as follows:
                  ℎ𝑡𝑡 −ℎ𝑡𝑡−4        ℎ𝑡𝑡 (ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖)       ℎ𝑡𝑡−4 (𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠)       Δℎ𝑡𝑡,𝑡𝑡−4 (𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠)

                    ℎ𝑡𝑡−4               ℎ𝑡𝑡−4                        ℎ𝑡𝑡−4                                 ℎ𝑡𝑡−4
                   ℎ𝑡𝑡 (𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 $19 𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟ℎ𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠)       ℎ𝑡𝑡 (𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 $19 𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜)
                                                                             −                                                             +
                                          ℎ𝑡𝑡−4                                                            ℎ𝑡𝑡−4
                     ℎ𝑡𝑡 (𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑡𝑡−4)       ℎ𝑡𝑡−4 (𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑒𝑒 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑡𝑡)
                                                               −
                                     ℎ𝑡𝑡−4                                          ℎ𝑡𝑡−4

We denote by ℎ𝑡𝑡 quarterly hours worked in jobs paying less than $19 per hour in the period 𝑡𝑡.
We define as ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 those jobs which started between 𝑡𝑡 − 4 and 𝑡𝑡 and paid less than $19 in
period 𝑡𝑡. Similarly, we define as 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 those jobs which ceased to exist between 𝑡𝑡 − 4



68
  While it may be argued that our wage effects combine a large effect on the lowest-paid workers with near-zero
impacts on those paid above $13 per hour at baseline, this only implies an overestimated elasticity for the least-paid
workers if the employment effects are somehow concentrated among higher-paid workers. Our evidence does not
support this conjecture.


                                                                               33
and 𝑡𝑡 and paid less than $19 per hour in period 𝑡𝑡 − 4. We define 𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 as those jobs
which existed in both 𝑡𝑡 − 4 and 𝑡𝑡, and which paid less than $19 in both 𝑡𝑡 − 4 and 𝑡𝑡.
𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 $19 𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟ℎ𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is defined as those jobs which existed in both 𝑡𝑡 − 4 and 𝑡𝑡, but
received a wage cut from $19 and above in 𝑡𝑡 − 4 to below $19 in 𝑡𝑡. Similarly,
𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 $19 𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 are defined as jobs which existed in both 𝑡𝑡 − 4 and 𝑡𝑡, but
received a wage raise from below $19 in 𝑡𝑡 − 4 to $19 and above in 𝑡𝑡. Finally, the last two terms
capture hours changes by those with missing wages in one of the two periods. 69 If the Ordinance
                                                               ℎ𝑡𝑡 (𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 $19 𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜)
caused an increase in the fifth term of Equation 6,                                                                  , then we would
                                                                                      ℎ𝑡𝑡−4

be overestimating the adverse effects on hours by not considering the hours worked by
individuals whose wages rose above the threshold.
         To conduct a decomposition of the total estimated effect, and to specifically evaluate the
fifth term, we compute each term for Seattle, and we apply the same weights used by the
synthetic control method estimates to produce the results in the first column of Table 6 to
compute a control group estimate. The results for the fifth term are shown in Appendix Figure 9.
This figure shows that Seattle had a higher rate of wages rising above the $19 threshold than
Synthetic Seattle in every quarter during and after the end of the Great Recession. 70 In the
quarters prior to passage of the Ordinance, this gap between Seattle and Synthetic Seattle was a
relatively steady amount of roughly 2.0%. That is to say, the likelihood of a low-wage worker
receiving an increase to a rate above $19 was consistently 2 percentage points higher in Seattle
than in Synthetic Seattle. It would be reasonable to expect this persistent gap to have continued
in the absence of the Ordinance. Indeed, this 2.0% gap continued for the first six quarters after
passage, but appears to have widened to 3.0% once the minimum wage rose to $13. 71 These


69
   We set to missing wages of any jobs which reported more than 1,000 hours worked in a quarter, reported 0 hours
worked, wages higher than $500 and fewer than 10 hours worked, or wages less than $9 in 2015.2 dollars.
70
   Seattle also had persistently higher rates of hires of workers earning less than $19 per hour than Synthetic Seattle
(i.e., the first term in Equation 6 was persistently positive) during the entire pre-Ordinance period, averaging about
5%, and had a persistently higher rate of separations (i.e., the second term) of about 2%-3%. The offsetting
combination of the first, second, and sixth terms of Equation 6 produced the tight fit of growth in hours worked in
Seattle and Synthetic Seattle shown in Panel B of Figure 5.
71
   The vast majority of the overall change in growth of hours worked for wages under $19 came from a large decline
in the first term of Equation 6 (i.e., growth rate of hours worked from newly hired workers earning less than $19 per
hour), which dropped from a pre-Ordinance average of about +5% to about -2% in the quarters following the
increase of the minimum wage to $13. While a more gradual trend in this difference might suggest a phenomenon
where jobs in Seattle were gradually transitioning to higher wages at the point of hire, the sudden difference
coincident with the minimum wage increase suggests a simple reduction in hiring.


                                                          34
point estimates suggest that we might be overestimating the adverse effects on hours worked by
around 1.0 percentage point. Making this adjustment, we would conclude that the second phase-
in of the Ordinance to $13 per hour caused an average of a 5.9% decline in hours (rather than
6.9%). Even accepting this adjustment results in an estimate of the decline in hours that is of
larger magnitude than the estimated positive effect on wages (i.e., 3.2%), suggesting that the
amount paid to low-wage workers fell.


6.7 Reconciling these estimates with prior methods
        Most prior studies compute employment elasticities by dividing regression-estimated
percentage changes in employment by the percentage change in the statutory minimum wage
(e.g., Sabia 2009; Belman and Wolfson 2010; Allegretto et al. 2011). Applied in this case, this
method would use a denominator of 16.2% (i.e., ($11-$9.47)/$9.47) for the first phase-in period,
and 37.3% ($13-$9.47)/$9.47) for the second. The conventional method clearly overstates the
actual impact on wages given that many affected workers’ wages are above the old minimum but
below the new. This method is also unsuitable for evaluating the impacts on workers who began
over the new minimum wage but are nonetheless affected by cascading wage increases (defined
as the range of either $11 or $13 to $19 per hour). In the second-to-last column of Table 8, we
use the conventional approach for computing employment elasticities and find estimates in the
range of -0.04 to -0.25 (averaging -0.15). This range is high but not outside of the envelope of
estimates found in prior literature (Belman and Wolfson 2014). 72 Thus, computing the elasticity
based on the Ordinance’s impact on actual average wages suggests that the conventional method
yields substantial underestimates.
        We conclude our analysis by attempting to reconcile our results with prior studies that
focused on restaurant industry employment (e.g., Card and Krueger’s (1994) seminal
examination of fast food employment in New Jersey and Pennsylvania in response to New
Jersey’s increase in its minimum wage). As previously noted when discussing Table 3, only
32% of all jobs paid less than $13 per hour at baseline in Seattle were in NAICS industry 722
(Food Services and Drinking Places). Moreover, only 37% of jobs within NAICS 722 were paid
less than $13 per hour at baseline; most were not directly affected by either wage increase. This


72
   Estimates on the high end are plausible because theory suggests that labor demand elasticity would generally be
larger for a small, open economy such as Seattle than for a state or the nation.


                                                         35
raises concerns that analyses of restaurant employment at all wage levels suffer from attenuation
bias.
        The first three columns of Table 9 repeat the main synthetic control results findings from
Table 5 and Table 6, and are included as a point of reference. The middle three columns of
Table 9 evaluate impacts on all jobs in the restaurant industry, which is a common form of
analysis in the prior literature (e.g., Reich, Allegretto, and Godoey 2017). Wages paid to
Seattle’s restaurant workers increased substantially and significantly relative to Synthetic Seattle
after passage of the law. Estimates of employment effects, whether measured in hours or
beginning-of-quarter jobs, are statistically insignificant. These findings, which confirm Reich et
al.’s (2017) analysis of the Seattle restaurant industry and many prior studies, demonstrate the
severity of attenuation bias using this methodology. In this case at least, industry-based proxies
for low wage employment yield unreliable estimates of minimum wage impacts.
        The last three columns of Table 9 restrict the analysis to restaurant employment in jobs
that pay less than $19 per hour, and thus are more directly comparable to the estimates in the first
three columns. Here, employment impacts in particular are imprecisely estimated, reflective of a
relatively poor pre-policy fit between Seattle and the synthetic control region. Wage effects are
fairly precise and substantial, with the $13 wage associated with a 6.6% boost. Point estimates
indicate that the same minimum wage increase reduced hours by 10-11%. An analysis of low-
wage jobs in the restaurant industry, rather than all jobs in the restaurant industry, yields
conclusions comparable to analysis of the entire low-wage job market.
        Analysis of the Seattle restaurant industry must be tempered by a caution regarding pre-
policy trends. First, note that it is suspicious that estimated effects of the Ordinance on wages
for the entire restaurant industry are larger than those for the low-wage restaurant industry. This
result suggests that wages were rising faster for jobs paying over $19 per hour than for low-wage
restaurant jobs, and suggests that there may be a secular trend underlying these results. Indeed,
compared to the low-wage labor market results, which show wage effect increases timed
precisely with phase-in points, wages in Seattle’s restaurant industry appear to accelerate more
smoothly away from the synthetic control region. 73 A falsification test examining the nine-



73
  A Seattle restaurant owner, in private communication, suggested that trends toward increased wages in UI system
data may reflect changes in reporting patterns by employers. To comply with the Ordinance, employers may be
requiring tipped workers to report – and pay taxes on – a higher proportion of their tip income.

quarter period beginning in 2012 reveals additional acceleration of wages in Seattle relative to
the control region.
       In summary, utilizing methods more consistent with some prominent prior studies allows
us to replicate their findings of no, or minor, employment effects. These methods reflect data
limitations, however, that our analysis can circumvent. These methods also appear to be
particularly unreliable in Seattle given pre-policy trends specific to the restaurant industry. We
conclude that the stark differences between our findings and these studies reflect in no small part
the impact of data limitations on prior work.


   7. Conclusion
       There is widespread interest in understanding the effects of large minimum wage
increases, particularly given efforts in the US to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 and the
adoption of high minimum wages in several states, cities, and countries in the past few years.
There is good reason to believe that increasing the minimum wage above some level is likely to
cause greater employment losses than increases at lower levels. Wolfers (2016) argues that labor
economists need to “get closer to understanding the optimal level of the minimum wage” (p.
108) and that “(i)t would be best if analysts could estimate the marginal treatment effect at each
level of the minimum wage” (p. 110). This paper extends the literature in a number of ways, one
of which evaluates effects of two consecutive large local minimum wage increases.
       Beyond basic causal inference challenges, many prior studies have analyzed minimum
wage effects using data resources that do not permit the direct observation of hourly wages. In
those situations, researchers resort to using proxies for low-wage workers by examining
particular industries that employ higher concentrations of low-wage labor or by restricting the
analysis to teenagers. Prior work also focuses on binary measures of employment as an
outcome, a crude metric given the overwhelmingly part-time nature of low-wage work. This
paper demonstrates that such strategies likely misstate the true impact of minimum wage policies
on opportunities for low-skilled workers. Our finding of zero impact on headcount employment
in the restaurant industry echoes many prior studies. Our findings also demonstrate, however,
that this estimation strategy yields results starkly different from methods based on direct analysis
of low-wage employment.




                                                 37
         Our preferred estimates suggest that the Seattle Minimum Wage Ordinance caused hours
worked by low-skilled workers (i.e., those earning under $19 per hour) to fall by 6.9% during the
three quarters when the minimum wage was $13, resulting in a loss of around 3 million hours
worked per calendar quarter and more than 5,000 jobs. These estimates are robust to cutoffs
other than $19 per hour. 74 A 3.2% increase in wages in jobs that paid less than $19 per hour
coupled with a 6.9% loss in hours yields a labor demand elasticity of roughly -2.6, and this large
elasticity estimate is robust to other cutoffs.
         These results suggest a fundamental rethinking of the nature of low-wage work. Prior
elasticity estimates in the range of zero to -0.2 suggest there are few suitable substitutes for low-
wage employees, that firms faced with labor cost increases have little option but to raise their
wage bill. Seattle data show – even in simple first differences – that payroll expenses on workers
earning under $19 per hour either rose minimally or fell as the minimum wage increased from
$9.47 to $13 in just over nine months. An elasticity of -2.6 suggests that low-wage labor is a
more substitutable, expendable factor of production. The work of least-paid workers might be
performed more efficiently by more skilled and experienced workers commanding a higher
wage. This work could, in some circumstances, be automated or delegated to consumers. In
other circumstances, employers may conclude that the work of least-paid workers need not be
done at all.
         Importantly, the lost income associated with the hours reductions exceeds the gain
associated with the net wage increase of 3.2%. Using data in Table 3, we compute that the
average low-wage employee was paid $1,900 per month. The reduction in hours would cost the
average employee $130 per month, while the wage increase would recoup only $56 of this loss,
leaving a net loss of $74 per month, which is sizable for a low-wage worker.


74
  The finding of significant employment losses, particularly after the second minimum wage increase in 2016, may
seem incongruent with unemployment statistics for the City of Seattle, which suggest very low numbers of
unemployed individuals seeking work. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' Local Area Unemployment Statistics
program estimates city-level unemployment statistics on the basis of UI claims, data from other government surveys
such as the Current Population Survey, and statistical modeling. The unemployment statistics pertain to the residents
of a city, not individuals employed in a city (indeed, unemployed workers are employed in no city). Our analysis
pertains instead to individuals employed in Seattle.
          In Washington State, workers are eligible for UI benefits only after they have accumulated 680 hours of
work. In low-wage, high-turnover businesses, the proportion of separated workers who reach this threshold may be
low. Further, longitudinal analysis of ESD data suggest that reduced employment largely impacts new entrants to the
labor force, rather than experienced workers. New entrants are not eligible for UI benefits and thus cannot generate
claims. These unemployed new entrants might be captured in the CPS, but with a relatively small sample size these
estimates are subject to significant noise and are smoothed considerably.


                                                         38
         The estimates may be much larger than those reported in prior minimum wages studies
for three reasons. First, it is reasonable to expect that labor demand elasticity would generally be
larger for a small, open economy such as Seattle than for a state or the nation – although it
should be noted that analysis of Seattle’s experience using methods conventional in the literature
yield elasticity estimates comparable to that literature.
         Second, rather than using the statutory change in the minimum wage as the denominator
in an elasticity computation, we use the change in actual wage rates for low-skill workers, which
we can estimate from the Washington data. Because the actual change is necessarily smaller
than the statutory change, the arithmetic of elasticity computation leads to larger estimated
elasticities than those derived using conventional methods of computing the elasticity of demand
for low-skill workers with respect to the statutory change in minimum wage.
         Third, we analyze the impact of raising the minimum wage to a significantly higher level
than what has been analyzed in most prior work. Deflating by the Personal Consumption
Expenditures price index, the real value of the federal minimum wage has never reached the $13
level studied in our analysis. Theory suggests that the impact of raising the minimum wage
depends critically on the starting point; Seattle started from the nation’s highest state minimum
wage, and our own evidence indicates that the effects differed dramatically from the first phase-
in period to the second.
         A few cautions should be noted. Our analysis includes only firms reporting employment
at specific locations, as we cannot properly locate employment for multi-location firms that do
not report employment separately by location. It may be the case that the labor demand elasticity
of locatable establishments is larger than that of multi-site firms who do not report employment
at specific locations. Yet, as discussed above, multi-site firms that we surveyed were more likely
to self-report cuts in employment than smaller firms. 75
         Further, we lack data on contractor jobs with income reported on 1099 forms instead of
W-2s and on jobs in the informal economy paid with cash. If the Ordinance prompted an
increase in low-wage workers being paid as contractors or under the table, our results would
overstate the effect on jobs and hours worked. However, such a move would not be without



75
  If we ignore our survey evidence and suppose that non-locatable firms’ wage impact was the same as reported
here but their hours impact was zero, the elasticity would still be high compared to earlier work, – 1.67, as locatable
businesses employ 63% of the low-wage workforce.


                                                          39
consequence for the workers, who would lose protections from the Unemployment Insurance and
Worker’s Compensation systems and not receive credit toward future Social Security benefits for
such earnings (though they would not have to pay the full amount of taxes for Social Security
and Medicare).
       In addition, some employers may have shifted jobs out of Seattle but kept them within the
metropolitan area, in which case the job losses in Seattle overstate losses in the local labor
market. Reductions in payroll attributable to the minimum wage may exceed reductions in
income for the affected workers, to the extent they were able to take advantage of relocated
opportunities in the metropolitan area. Finally, the long-run effects of Seattle’s minimum wage
increases may be substantially greater, particularly since subsequent changes beyond a final
increase to $15 will be indexed to inflation, unlike most of the minimum wage increases that
have been studied in the literature, which have quickly eroded in real terms (Wolfers, 2016).
       One cannot assume our specific findings generalize to minimum wage policies set by
other localities or at the federal or state level. The impacts of minimum wage policies
established by other local governments likely depend on the industrial structure, characteristics
of the local labor force, and other features of the local and regional economy.
       Last, there may be important forms of effect heterogeneity across workers. Some
workers may well have experienced significant wage increases with no reduction in hours; others
may have encountered significantly greater difficulty in securing any work at all. From a welfare
perspective, it is critical to understand how this heterogeneity plays out across low-skilled
workers in varying life circumstances. Such an exploration is beyond the scope of this paper,
which uses a data resource that identifies no pertinent information about individual workers.
Future work will take advantage of linkages across administrative data resources within
Washington State to understand how the minimum wage affects workers in varying demographic
categories, or with a history of reliance on means-tested transfer programs.

Notes: Estimates for all jobs paying < $19 in all industries.
Cumulative effect since 2014.2 is reported. Dependent
variable in all regressions is year-over-year growth rate in
quarterly payroll. P-value for a two-tailed test of the
hypothesis that the coefficient equals to zero are reported
in square brackets. P-values are calculated based on
permutation inference for synthetic control, and based on
i.i.d. standard errors for interactive fixed effects. RMSPE
shows the root mean squared prediction error for the
Synthetic Controls’ pre-policy predictions of year-over-
year growth. The number of observations used in the
synthetic control and interactive fixed effects
specifications equals the number of PUMAs (45) times the
number of quarters included in this analysis (34).
However, note that some of these PUMAs receive zero
weight in the synthetic control results. ***, **, and *
denote statistically significance using a two-tailed test with
p ≤ 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10, respectively.

Notes: Estimates for all jobs paying < $19 in all industries. Estimates using Synthetic Control reported. Cumulative effect since 2014.2 is reported. Dependent
variable in growth rates specification is year-over-year growth rate in each outcome. Dependent variable in levels specifications is the level of each outcome
divided by five, except for mean wages. Dependent variable in standardized levels specification is the level of each outcome minus its pre-policy mean divided
by its per-policy standard deviation. P-value for a two-tailed test of the hypothesis that the coefficient equals to zero are reported in square brackets. P-values
are calculated based on permutation. RMSPE shows the root mean squared prediction error for the Synthetic Controls’ pre-policy predictions. The number of
observations used in the synthetic control specification equals the number of PUMAs (45) times the number of quarters included in this analysis (34).
However, note that some of these PUMAs receive zero weight in the synthetic control results. ***, **, and * denote statistically significance using a two-tailed
test with p ≤ 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10, respectively
