             The Dividend—Price Ratio and Expectations

              of Future Dividends and Discount Factors




                             ABSTRACT




  A linearization of a rational expectations present value model for
  corporate stock prices produces a simple relation between the log
  dividend-price ratio and mathematical expectations of future log real
  dividend changes and future real discount rates. This relation can
  be tested using vector autoregressive methods. Three versions of the
  linearized model, differing in the measure of discount rates, are
  tested for U. S. time series 1871-1986: versions using real interest
  rate data, aggregate real consumption data, and return variance data.
  The results yield a metric to judge the relative importance of real
  dividend growth, measured real discount rates and unexplained factors
  in determining the dividend-price ratio.

  What accounts for the variation through time in the dividend-price ratio

on corporate stocks? In the context of rational expectations models, the

ratio is often interpreted as reflecting changes in the outlook for

dividends: when dividends can be forecasted to decrease, the dividend-

price ratio should be high. Alternatively, also in the context of a

rational expectations model, the ratio is interpreted as reflecting the

rate at which future dividends are discounted to today's price: when

discount rates are high, the dividend-price ratio is high. In principle,

the dividend-price ratio ought to have both of these interpretations at

once. Yet their relative importance has never been established, and it is

not clear whether the two interpretations together can account for time

variation in the dividend-price ratio. We attempt to answer this here

using U. S. time series data 1871 to 1986. (For data sources, see the

Appendix.)

   A simple present value model for stock prices has the following form:



                       k
         a Et E exp(- E r+.)D+k                               (1)
             k—O      j—O


where P is the real price per share,          is the real dividend per share,

and Et denotes expectation conditional on information publicly available at

time t. The discount rate r satisfies exp(r) a E[(Pt+1+D)/P] and may

have several interpretations. In what we will call version I of the model,

exp(r) is the ex-ante gross real interest rate on one-period debt, times a

constant reflecting a risk premium. In version II of the model, exp(-r) —

kEfi(Ct/C+l)a where         is per capita real consumption at time t, a is the

coefficient of relative risk aversion and k is a constant risk premium. In

                                          1
version III of the model, exp(r) —                    where   is a constant
                                        flexp(+aV),
riskiess real interest rate, a is the coefficient of relative risk aversion

and Vt is the variance, conditional on information available in year t, of

the monthly stock returns in that year.

   All three versions of the model can be derived, at least approximately,

from equilibrium foundations. (See the Appendix for details). Inversions

I and II, the discount rate for corporate stocks moves through time because

the riskiess real interest rate changes while the risk premium on stocks is

constant; in version III, by contrast, the riskiess real rate is constant

and the risk premium is time-varying.

   The different versions of the model have been studied before, but the

present study adds some new perspectives. With regard to version I, Shiller

[1981] ,   Mankiw, Romer and Shapiro 119851 and West [1986a] , [1986b] have

asked whether the volatility of short-term interest rates might help

explain the volatility of stock market prices. Version II of the model has

been analyzed extensively, following the original theoretical work of Lucas

[1978] and Breeden [1979] ,    by Grossman and SMiler [1981] , Grossman, Melino
and Shiller [19851, Hansen and Singleton [1983], Hall [1985), Mankiw,

Rotemberg and Summers [1985] and Mehra and Prescott [19851, among others.

The goal of much of this research has been to estimate the coefficient of

relative risk aversion a, either from the cross-sectional relation between

means and covariances with consumption of different asset returns, or from

the time-series relation between forecastable returns and forecastable

consumption    growth,   or from both of these simultaneously. Estimated risk

aversion is often implausibly large, especially when cross-sectional

information is used. Version III of the model has been proposed, following


                                          2
an exploratory analysis by Merton [1980], by Pindyck [1984], [19861 who

argues that much of the variability in stock prices can be explained by the

variability of V. Against this, Poterba and Summers [1985] have argued

that V is not persistent enough to account for much variation in stock

prices. French, Schwert and Stambaugh 11986] and Campbell [1987] examine

the relation between V and expected stock returns, but do not develop

implications for the dividend-price ratio.

   The emphasis of this paper differs from that of much previous work in

the area. We are less interested in testing the model and estimating the

coefficient of risk aversion, and more interested in accounting for time

variation in the dividend price ratio. Our econometric methods reflect

this emphasis.



   Linearization of the Model

   Equation (1) involves an expectation of a complicated nonlinear relation

among P, D. j—0,1,... and r+ j0,l            Some form of linearization

will be necessary to pursue the implications of the model that we wish to

study. The linearization will introduce an approximation error that could

lead to a rejection of the model (1) even if it is true. However, our

purpose here is not merely to test the model (1) but to characterize in

broad terms how it succeeds and fails; for such a purpose the linearization

is useful.

   One may divide both sides of (1) by Di which is in the information set

at time t, and hence can be passed through the expectations operator.

Taking logs of both sides of the equation, and using lower case letters to

denote natural logs of the corresponding upper case variables, we have:


                                      3
       Pt -   d1 — logES                                             (2)


          — exp(Adr) +                               l +

               exP(Ad.fLdti+td2rr1r2)                +   .   .   .   (3)

Since we will linearize the expression, we can pass the log function inside

the expectations operator, and defining the log of the dividend price ratio
   a d1 -          we can write:
              Pt

          —
              E6                                                     (4)




where 5 a -logS. Taking a Taylor expansion of 5 around tdt+. — g

j—O,l,..., and r+. —      r,   j—O,l,..., we find:



          = S p-                      +   h                          (5)
              J —o




where p a exp(-(r-g)) and h — log(exp(r-g)-l)-(r-g)/(l-exp(g..r))j Thus,

the log dividend-price ratio is approximately equal to a constant plus the

"present value" of expected current and future values of the one-period

discount rate minus the one-period growth in dividends. Note that tsd+. and

rt. enter symmetrically in (5); all that matters for the dividend price

ratio is their difference. Equation (5) represents the combined effect on

the dividend-price ratio of expectations both of changes in future divi-

dends and of future interest rates that was noted in the opening paragraph

of this paper.


     1For finite price Pt r must be greater than g and p less thar. one.

                                              4
  The final step in deriving the linearized model is to pass the log

function through the expectations operator in the definition of r. For

example, in version II of the model r —                                   we use the

approximation rt —                        Since the model is now linear, and since
                          k4aEttct+1.
the rational expectation of future ex-ante discount rates equals the

rational expectation of future ex-post rates, we can use ex-post measures

of real rates in our tests. In what follows, rt will refer to the ex-post

real rate.

   It's instructive to note that the linearized model (5) can also be

derived in a different way. Calling R the return to holding stock for one

period, Rt            '+1 -       + Dt)/P   then log(l+R) —
                                                                  log(exp(Ad+S-&÷1)              +

                                                      around td — g and        —              —
exp(S+hd)). Linearizing this expression                                                6t+l
log(exp(r-g)-l), we get an approximation               to log(l+R),       —
                                                                              6t
                                                                                   -
                                                                                        p6t+i.
                                                                                                  +

    -       (l-p)h.   If we set       —
                                          Er we get a rational expectations model
which, if solved forward, yields (5).

   In Tables la and lb we display several measures of the approximation

error for the linearized model (5). In carrying out the approximation, the

point of linearization was taken to be the log of one plus the sample

average real return on stocks, less the sample average change in log

dividends. Table la compares e            with       and log(l+R). Table lb compares

an approximate "perfect foresight log dividend-price ratio" 8, constructed

using equation (5) and a terminal condition 6T —                  with an exact
                                                            6T'
constructed using equation (1) and the same terminal condition2. The

approximation error is quite small in both tables.

        2
       This terminal condition is used only for evaluating the
approximation in equation (5), and not in the empirical work reported
below.

                                                 5
   Time Series Representations

   We will study two representations of each version of the model. In

representation (a) real dividends must be differenced to induce

stationarity and in representation (b) the dividends are assumed to be

stationary around a trend. The reason for including two representations is

that evidence is mixed as regards which simple model of the processes is

most appropriate for our analysis. A Phillips-Perron [1986] test that the

dt process has a unit root rejects at the 5% level with our full sample

period in favor of an alternative that it is stationary around a trend

(Table 2). This would suggest that representation (b) is appropriate.

However, since we strongly reject the unit root hypothesis for the log

dividend-price ratio, this stationarity implies stationarity around a trend

for real price as well; yet we do not reject the unit root assumption for

price (Table 2).

   These internally inconsistent test results are hard to interpret. It's

possible that the test lacks power to reject the unit root hypothesis for

stock prices because of their smoothness; it's also possible that the test

falsely rejects that hypothesis for the dividend series. The Phillips-

Perron significance levels are asymptotically correct, but in any finite

sample one can add sufficient noise to a process with a unit root to obtain

a false rejection.

   Time series models involving deterministic trends are currently in

disfavor; many people seem to think that they are inherently implausible.

But of course in using a deterministic trend in a model we are not

asserting that such a trend really will be followed forever. Parsimony


                                      6
dictates that with modest data sets we keep our models simple. An AR(p)

model with a deterministic trend might be regarded as an approximation to

an ARIMA(p,1,l) model with a moving average component whose root is close

to the unit circle, a model in which distant past values are useful in

forecasting the distant future.

   There is in fact a very concrete reason to consider representation (b)

or something like it as well as (a). Unless we incorporate very long lags

in the autoregressive representation for the time series, a univariate

model that represents dividends in integrated form does not allow

forecasted dividends to tend to revert back to their long-run historical

values. A short univariate autoregressive forecasting equation in the

first-difference of dividends makes forecasts of dividends in the distant

future necessarily a function of only the most recent changes of dividends.

In fact, distant dividends appear historically to be forecastable fairly

well in terms of a long average of past dividends (Shiller [1984]). Of

course, we estimate multivariate models but we want to specify these in

such a way that an adequate univariate model of dividends is contained as a
               3
special case

       Note that in representation (a) if Mt and r are jointly stationary

s:ochastic processes, it follows from the linearized model (4) and (5) that

   -
       Pt   is stationary, or equivalently, dt and Pt are cointegrated

processes. Econometric techniques have been developed for them by Phillips

and Durlauf [1985], Granger and Engle [19861 and Stock [1984]. Our model is


       When we tried adding long lags to representation (a) of the models,
we got results somewhat resembling those for representation (b). This
tends to confirm our view that representation (b) may be a parsimonious way
to model "long memory" in the dividend process.



                                         7
particularly straightforward to deal with since the cointegrating vector is

specified in the model and does not require estimation. Ordinary theory of

estimation of stationary vector autoregressions is applicable here.



   VAR Test MethodoloEy

   For each version and representation of the model we define a vector

in such a way that all its elements are known to the public at time t. For

version I representation (a) we define x' —
                                                                 (d1       Adtl r1], where
all variables are demeaned, and in representation (b) the vector                        x' —
[dt1-    1 d1, r1), where all variables are demeaned and dtl has been
detrended. We write C(L)xt —
                                           u where the elements of C(L) are p'th-order
polynomials in the lag operator L, i.e., we assume that a p'th order vector

autoregressive representation for x exists. We rewrite the vector

autoregressive representation in companion form
                                                 Mtl + v. so that     —

Eztk — Akz. We define the vector el such that el'z — dtl Pt                         -


(demeaned), the vector e2 such that e2z —
                                          Mtl (demeaned) in
representation (a) and d1 (detrended) in representation (b), and the

vector e3 such that e3'z —
                                         r1.
   To state the restrictions of the model in terms of the vector

autoregression, we substitute (5) into (4) (disregarding the constant h)

and then replace r            .   with   e3A3+lz
                                                   t
                                                       .   Moreover we replace M .      with
                          ti-i                                                    t+J
e2IAJ+lz for representation (a) and with e2(A3Ai)z for representation

(b). It follows, evaluating the infinite series, that                       should equal 8

given   by:

              —   ((e3'   -
                              e2t)A+e2'B)(I_pA)z                            (6)




                                                           8
where B—O in representation (a) and B — 1 in representation (b). Since the

actual dividend-price ratio is in the information set on which we are

conditioning, Sshould equal 6 exactly, except for sampling error. That

is, we do not have the usual difficulties in rational expectations models

caused by the fact that market participants may have more information than

econometricians. We can compare the history of                 and S as a way of

evaluating the "fit" of the model. Equivalently, we can compare the

elements of the matrix ((e3'-e2')A+e2'B)(I-pA) on the right hand side of

(6) with el' .   Both comparisons are made in the tables below.

   To write the restriction          — S in terms of model parameters, we can

replace     in (6) with el'z1 cancel                  from both sides of the equation,

and postmultiply by (I-pA) to obtain:


       el(I-pA) a (e3' -        e2')A   +   eVE                         (7)



Tests of these restrictions on the autoregressive coefficient matrix A

using a Wald procedure are reported in the tables below. The restrictions

(7) can be interpreted as asserting that a regression of the approximate

excess return       -
                        rt   on information z gives z a zero coefficient, and

the Wald test in fact corresponds in the sample to a standard regression F

test of the restrictions.

   It is also possible to decompose the behavior of S into two components:

a component 5 due to forecasts of change in dividends and a component

due to forecasts of real interest rates:


            a
                 (e2'A4-e2'B)(IpA)z                                   (8)


            a
                 e3'A(IpAY'z                                          (9)


                                                  9
   To study version II of the model, we define in representation (a) the

vector x'— [d1 -        p,   Ad1. Aci] where all variables are demeaned and

in representation (b) the vector x— [dt1 -
                                                   t   d1, Ac11 where dtl is
also detrended4. We assume that there is a vector autoregressive

representation for x and as above write C(L)x —             where the elements of

C(L) are p'th order polynomials in the lag operator L. Rewriting the vector

autoregressive representation in companion form         —
                                                            t-i
                  as above. Then the model (4) and (5) implies:
                                                                  +    then

Etzt+k —   Akz,


           a   ((ae3'   -
                            e2')A+e2'B)(I-pA)z                (10)


       el'(I-pA) — (ae3'       -
                                   e2')A+   e2'B              (11)



Here &, as before, is the theoretical log dividend price ratio, the

optimal forecast of the present value of future dividend changes and

discount factors. As with version I, we can decompose 5 into a component

    due to rational expectations of future dividend changes and a component

    due to rational expectations of future discount factors.            is

defined as in equation (8), and 6' is defined as a times the right hand

side of equation (9).



       Ac is lagged in the same way as Ad or d. The implicit assumption
here is that the consumption data for each year represent consumption on
December 31 of the year. Thus, in January of each year (the month in which
our price data are drawn) Ac     is known but Ac is not. There is no fully
                              -l
satisfactory way to handle te unit-averaged consumption data in the
context of a theoretical model involving point-of-time consumption data,
without going to the continuous time econometrics format, as in Grossman,
Melino and Shiller [1985] We did experiment with including current rather
than lagged Ac in the vector, and did not find qualitatively different
results.

      We can estimate a, the coefficient of relative risk aversion, using the

restriction (11). One might at first think that a unique value for a could

be found by post-multiplying (11) by A1e3 and solving the resulting

expression for a in terms of estimated coefficients. However, the

restrictions (11) imply that A is singular. Defining e4 as the vector which

is zero except for the second element, which is one, then (pel' +                       ae3'    -



e2'    -
           e4')A   —   0. Our approach was instead to use a method-of-moments

estimator for a. Defining A as the vector of deviations from the

restriction (11), A —          el   -
                                        (pA)'el   -
                                                      A'(ae3   -
                                                                   e2),   a two-step procedure was

used. Defining the vector of parameters of the model besides a as -y,                          we

minimize A(a,y)A(a,'y). The matrix C is taken as (aA/a-,eaA/a7 where a

is    the variance matrix of the parameter vector y. In step one,                      was

evaluated at a —          1. In step 2, ) was evaluated at the first round estimate
of a.

      The resulting estimate of a has the following interpretation. Equation

(11) asserts that the prediction at time t of the linearized return

equals (a constant plus) a times the predicted change in log consumption.

Our estimate of a is thus analogous to other estimates in the literature

that rely on making forecasted returns correspond to forecasted changes in

consumption. In Grossman and Shiller [1981] estimation of a along these

lines was suggested (in the context of a plot of stock prices and their ex-

post rational counterpart) but the discussion was couched in levels; the

simple method used here of dealing with nonstationarity (dividing by lagged

dividend) was not used and formal estimation in such terms was not

attempted.

      To study version III of the model, we define the vector x— [d1 -

Results

      For all versions of the model, the point of linearization r-g was formed

by taking the log of one plus the sample average real return on stocks and

then subtracting the sample average change in log dividends. The point of

linearization differs slightly across the versions only because the data

and/or sample period differed slightly.

      Estimates of version I, representation (a) (using first-differenced

dividends) appear in Table 3a. The model is rejected at the 6.9% level.

Despite this evidence against the model,        does Granger-cause future

dividend changes and there is substantial correlation of 0.773 between the

theoretical log dividend price ratio 6 and the actual dividend price ratio

S .    Most of this correlation comes from 5'         and not 5' .    While
 t                                           dt   ,
                                                               rt
                                                                              the

correlation is substantial, the standard deviation of 6 is only 0.417

times that of        This suggests that there is an element of truth to the

model, but that the actual dividend price ratio "overreacts" to the news

about future dividends.

      For comparison with results in our earlier paper (Campbell and Shiller

[1986]) which assumed constant discount factors and studied levels rather

than logs of variables, we present also a Wald test of the model in which

the time-varying discount factors are suppressed. Now the Wald test rejects

a the 0.1% level. Thus it would appear that incorporating
                                                                     time-varying
discount rates helps to "save" the efficient markets model. But,

apparently it does so largely by bringing in a noisy extraneous variable to


                                        12
destroy the power of the test. The evidence that 6 Granger causes future

real interest rates is very weak (significant at only the 15.6% level).

Allowing for time-varying interest rates greatly increases the standard

error on the correlation of     with     but actually reduces the point

estimate. By itself,      is negatively correlated with     at -0.139.

   We now turn to representation (b) of version I, which uses detrended

dividends (Table 3b). Some of the results are quite different. In this

representation, the optimal forecast of the present value of future

dividends discounted at a constant rate is close to a simple trend,

reflecting the apparent sharp trend-reverting pattern of real dividends.

This means that 5 is highly correlated with the detrended dividend; it is

somewhat more variable than in representation (a) (its standard deviation

is 0.634 times that of        and has a wuch lower correlation with

(0.063). This is the kind of excess volatility" discussed in an earlier

paper by one of the authors (Shiller [l98l)).

   Despite these differences, a number of results are common to

representations (a) and (b). Although the point estimates of summary

statistics look very bad in representation (b), the model is still rejected

only at the 6.0% level with the Wald test. It seems still to be the case

that the inclusion of ex-post real discount rates helps the model by adding

noise to the system; the weak relationship between the dividend-price ratio

and future real interest rates is not affected by the specification of the

dividend process.



       That paper argued that the stock price displays excess volatility;
this does not necessarily imply excess volatility of the dividend-price
ratio, but it does imply a low correlation between the theoretical and
actual dividend-price ratios.

                                        13
   Plots following the tables show the actual dividend-price ratio and a

band from 2 standard errors below the theoretical dividend-price ratio to 2

standard errors above. The theoretical bands differ across representations

(a) and (b) as described above, but both representations identify the same

historical periods as unexplained by the model: the actual dividend-price

ratio was too low in the first decade of the century, too high at the end

of the First World War and at most of its subsequent peaks, and too low in

the 1960's.

   The general character of the results is fairly robust to the point of

linearization. In representation (a) when the linearization parameter p —

0.900, u(6)/i(&)     equals 0.410 and the correlation coefficient cor(6,6)
equals 0.761, while when p — 0.975, a(6)/a(6) — 0.426 and cor(8,8)             —


0.791. In representation (b) when p — 0.900,
                                             o(&)/o() — 0.601 and
cor(6,8) — 0.156, while when p — 0.975, a(8)/c(6) — 0.688 and
cor(6,8) — -0.062.
   Because the period around the 1960's look particularly bad for the

model, we estimated the model using data 1871-1950 only. The general

character of the results is not very different from those reported in Table

3. In representation (a) a(&)/a(6) — 0.556 and cor(6',8) — 0.830, while

in representation (b), o'(6')/c(6) — 0.777 and cor(6,6) —          0.192.
   We also made one more assessment of the approximation error of           as a

measure of log(l +
                     Re), this time in the context of our vector
autoregressive model. It was noted above that the Wald test of the

restrictions (7) is nothing more than a standard F test in a regresssion of

the approximate excess return      -
                                       rt   on the right hand side variables in

the model. In that regression, the          equals 0.C77,   and the standard

                                            14
deviation of the fitted value equals 0.0502. If instead the true excess

return log(l+R) -                is regressed on the same variables the
                     log(l-4r)
0.079 and the standard deviation of the fitted value is 0.0503. There is

virtually no difference between the results, and the correlation

coefficient between the fitted values is 0.9991.

   Results for version II of the model, reported in Tables 4a and 4b, are

similar in many ways to those for version I. There is perhaps a little

encouragement for the model in that the dividend-price ratio does Cranger

cause consumption growth in both representations. However the

forecastability of consumption growth does not seem to help explain the

behavior of the dividend-price ratio. The estimated coefficient of

relative risk aversion has the wrong sign in representation (a), and has

the right sign but is insignificantly different from zero in representation

(b). The model is rejected at about the 2% level in representation (a),

and the 0.2% level in representation (b), whether or not we allow time

variation in discount rates. The estimated 6'. has a very low standard

deviation, relative to the standard deviation of         and its correlation

with    is iNprecise].y estimated.

   The volatility of returns variable V, in version III of the model, does

not contribute much toward interpreting actual dividend price ratios. The

actual dividend-price ratio        does not Cranger-cause V. While the risk

parameter a has the right sign, it is insignificantly different from zero.

The correlation of       with      is 0.114 in representation (a) (Table 5a)

and -0.175 in representation (b) (Table 5b); in both representations the

standard deviation of     is negligible compared to that of

   Finally, plots for versions II and III of the model identify the same

problematic historical periods as did the plots for version I.

Conclusion

   In this paper we have tried to explain time variation in corporate stock

prices relative to dividends. Our main result is a negative one: there is

very little evidence that the dividend-price ratio is driven by rational

expectations of observed ex-post one-period discount rates.

   The negative conclusion holds whether we measure discount rates from

real returns on short debt, aggregate consumption growth, or the volatility

of stock returns themselves. Even the weakest implication of a time-

varying discount rate model, that the dividend-price ratio should Granger

cause future ex-post discount rates, is strongly confirmed only for

consumption growth. And however we measure discount rates, the present

value of rationally expected future rates moves far too little to explain

much variation in the dividend-price ratio.

   The tandard deviation of the 5, the component of the log dividend-

price ratio    attributable to discount rate movements, never exceeds about

17% of the standard deviation of    itself and is never very   correlated
with it. That 8' shows so little variability is not surprising since, as


     6Pindyck's analysis [1986] is in some ways similar to ours, and relies
on a linearization of the present value relation. His analysis differs from
ours in that: a. the first difference of log price rather than the log
dividend-price ratio is explained, b. pretax profits (and assumptions about
taxes and payout ratios) are employed where we used dividends, c.
univariate AR-l representations for discount factors and pretax earnings
are assumed to hold with no superior information, and d. postwar data are
employed. He provides estimates of a ranging from 3 to 5, roughly
consistent with our estimates for Version III. He does not provide measures
of the importance of V analogous to ours, except to say that V explained
about 1/3 of the market decline in 1974.

                                     16
the tables show, the one-period discount factor measures themselves are

always much less variable than the log dividend price ratio, and always

show little persistence through time.

   There is more support for the view that the dividend-price ratio

reflects rational expectations of future dividend growth. The results from

representation (a), in which the log dividend process has a unit root, are

particularly favorable to this view. In representation (a) we found subs-

tantial correlation between the log dividend-price ratio and the appropri-

ate optimal forecast of future dividends. This result is similar to one

reported in our earlier paper (Campbell and Shiller (1986]): there we found

that the spread between the long-term interest rate and the short-term

interest rate tends to be high when short rates can be forecast to

increase.

   A cynical view of both these results is that they reveal nothing more

than that long rates are smoother than short rates, and stock prices are

smoother than dividends. Given this smoothness, it's not surprising that

actual spreads or ratios correlate somewhat with optimal spreads or ratios.

In the present example, the actual dividend price ratio shares the same

numerator with the theoretical dividend price ratio, and if the numerator

shows some short-run noise not In the denominators, there will be a

correlation between actual and theoretical.

   However the cynical view cannot account for the finding that the

dividend-price ratio strongly Granger causes future dividends. This

finding is extremely robust to changes in lag length or time series

representation for dividends; in all models we estimated, we found Granger

causality at better than the 0.1% level. As one would expect from this


                                        17
result, in all representations the optimal forecast of future dividend

growth, 8dt' places statistically significant weight on the actual

dividend-price ratio

   Even if we reject the cynical view of our results, it is clear that

there is considerable variation in the dividend-price ratio which cannot be

accounted for by rational expectations of future dividend growth. In both

representations (a) and (b) a constant discount rate model is quite

strongly rejected, and summary statistics suggest that the actual dividend-

price ratio "moves too much". The ratio of the standard deviation of the

optimal forecast of dividend growth, to the standard deviation of the

actual dividend-price ratio, is significantly less than one at the 5% level

in all the models we estimate.

    ADpendix: Sources of Data and Equilibrium Foundations of the Model



   For estimation of version I of the model, the real stock price and real

dividend series are the same as in Campbell and Shiller [1986]. Pt is the

January Standard and Poor Composite Stock Price Index divided by the

Producer Price Index    (also for January starting in 1900, annual average

before that). D is the total dividends per share accruing to index for the

calendar year, divided by the annual average producer price index. The real

interest rate rt is                                       where ri is the

January value and r2 is the July value of the prime 4-6-month prime

commercial paper rate (6-month starting in 1979) in annual percent.

Interest rate data starting in 1938 are from the Board of Governors of the

Federal Reserve System, before 1938 from Macaulay [1938], Table 10, pp.

A142-60. The sample period for version I is 1871-1986.

   For estimation of version II of the model, P and D are the same as in

version I except that they are divided by the (annual average) consumption

deflator for nondurables and services rather than by the producer price

index. C is real per capita consumption of nondurables and services. The

consumption deflator and C are defined as described in Grossman and

Shiller [1981]. The sample period is 1889-1986.

   For estimation of version III of the model,    and D are the same as in

version I. We thank James Poterba and Lawrence Summers for providing us

with the same Vt series that they used in their paper [1985]; it is an

annual series with each observation consisting of the average of squared

monthly log gross returns on the Standard and Poor Composite Index for the


                                     19
12 months of the year. The sample period is 1871-1985.

      The model may be derived in general equilibrium as follows. Version

II holds in a representative agent economy when the representative

individual maximizes U —            I    +j'/(1-a) and when the conditional
covariance between real stock returns and the marginal utility ratio,

Cov((Pt+1+D)/Pfl(c/cp) is constant. The other versions of the

model can be obtained by adding assumptions to those of version II,

although they may also hold more generally. Version I holds if, in

addition to the assumptions above, the conditional covariance between the

real return on short-term debt and the marginal utility ratio is constant.

Version III is suggested by a constant relative risk aversion framework if

the expected marginal utility ratio is constant through time, generating a

constant riskless real rate p satisfying exp(-p) —                        and if we
                                                          Efl(Ct/C+i)),
have 1 -
           Cov((P+1.fD)/P,$(C /C l° — exp(aV).              Following Merton

[1973] ,   [19801   ,   one can show that this covariance restriction holds up to a

linear approximation (it holds exactly in continuous time) if the

conditional covariance and variance are constant through time and the stock

market return is equal to the return on total invested wealth. Of course,

Version III has time-varying covariances and variances, but is suggested by

the Merton framework if changes are sufficiently slow.

   Each figure shows the demeaned log dividend-price ratio S (solid line,

labelled XDP below the figures) and a band around the theoretical demeaned

log dividend-price ratio S (dashed lines, labelled FIT+2 and FIT-2 in the

figures). S is the optimal linear forecast with information available at

time t of 6, the weighted average of future dividend changes and future

real interest rates. The upper edge of the plotted band is 2 standard

errors above S, and the lower edge is 2 standard errors below.

   There are six figures, one for each version and time series

representation of the model. Representation (a) is labelled "cointegrated"

in the figures, and representation (b) is "trend-stationary".
