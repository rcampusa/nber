Induction and Evolution in the Origin of Inventions: Evidence from Smoking Cessation Products

                                              ABSTRACT

Neoclassical economic theory predicts that policies that discourage the consumption of a particular
good will induce innovation in a socially desirable substitute. Evolutionary theory emphasizes the
possibility of innovation waves associated with the identification of new dominant designs. We incorporate
both of these possibilities in a model of the invention of new smoking cessation products, based on
a new dataset of patents on such products from 1951-2004. We find that an increase in cigarette tax
levels and smoking bans had no discernible impact on the industry-wide rate of invention in smoking
cessation products. It does appear, however, that dominant designs did have substantial positive innovation
effects. More specifically, the introduction of the nicotine gum and patch are estimated to have increased
the rate of patenting activity in smoking cessation products by 60 and 79 percent, respectively, subject
to a 10 percent rate of decay. Finally, these products had larger innovation effects at the firm level
than among individual inventors.

1. Introduction
       Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States.
According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), smoking is responsible for approximately
one in five deaths annually, or about 443,000 deaths per year. In the last several decades,
technology has provided effective and affordable ways for heavily addicted smokers to “break
the habit.” Smoking cessation products, mainly comprised of nicotine replacement therapies,
have been at least partially responsible for a decrease in smoking rates from more than 42% to
less than 20% of American adults over the past forty years.
       More generally, there are numerous public policy problems for which we look to new
technology for solutions. The most prominent of these is global climate change, where it seems
clear that significant damage will be avoided at reasonable economic cost only if new low-
carbon or carbon-free technologies can be deployed at massive scale. There is currently an active
debate as to whether and how public policy might foster the desired innovation. The economic
literature on induced innovation provides an explicit framework to consider the mechanisms by
which specific policies might increase the rate of innovation in particular areas, and to estimate
the empirical magnitude of such inducement effects. We take the experience of the public health
problem of smoking, and the development of new technologies to deal with it, as a case study
that may inform this larger question of the factors that influence the development of new,
socially desirable technologies. The imposition of taxes on cigarettes and bans on smoking in
public places are loosely analogous to policies that have or might be implemented in other areas.
At the same time, we also explore the role that factors not apparently controlled by policy may
have played in the rate and direction of invention related to smoking cessation. We use an
evolutionary model of the technological change process to introduce explicitly the importance of
transformative inventions in spurring overall technological advance.
       The body of this paper will be organized as follows. Section II explores public policy as a
source for induced innovation. Section III introduces the neoclassical and evolutionary
hypotheses about the rate of innovation for smoking cessation products. Section IV discusses the
quantitative and qualitative data used in this empirical study. Section V describes our estimation
techniques and presents the results of our econometric analysis. Finally, Section VI concludes
our exploration of the causal link between the rules of the market and the marketplace of ideas.




                                                 1
2. Public Policy and Induced Innovation
       Public policies are designed to achieve multiple social goals. We can identify three main
types of policy aims that might alter the course of technological change. The first type of policy
aims to change the actual innovation system, but remains neutral with respect to the specific
types of innovation that it might encourage. Examples of this type of policy range from changes
in the patent system to R&D subsidies and tax credits, among others (Jaffe, 2000). In addition,
we can pinpoint specific pieces of legislation such as the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 which gave
research universities and small businesses the right to patent inventions that resulted from
government funding (Mowery et al, 2004), the establishment of the Court of Appeals of the
Federal Circuit by Congress in 1982 which presides over patenting activity (Kortum and Lerner,
1999), and a 1991 law that increased patent application fees and made the United States Patent
and Trademark Office (USPTO) an almost fully user-fee funded agency (Sanyal, 2003), which
have had various effects on the rate of innovation.
       A second type of public policy focuses on achieving a certain social goal by encouraging
a specific type of innovation. For example, the Orphan Drug Act (ODA) of 1983 was designed to
incentivize the development of pharmaceutical products used to treat rare diseases in small,
relatively unprofitable consumer markets. Yin (2008, 2009) found that the legislation mostly
induced innovation within ODA-qualifying subdivisions for non-rare diseases, which deviated
from the primary goals of the legislation. Furthermore, the author considered the counterfactual
and estimated that 10 percent of the induced innovation might have occurred in the absence of
the legislation. In either case, the study showed that firms did respond to incentives; however, the
resulting inventive output was only tangentially related to the social goal of the legislation.
       The third category of public policies are those that focus on achieving some social goal
other than innovation but which (perhaps unintentionally) induce innovative activity among
other responses. In the energy and environment sector, Jaffe and Palmer (1997) concluded that
environmental compliance standards increased R&D spending at the firm level, but did not
necessarily induce inventive output in the form of successful patent applications. In a related
study, Popp (2003) found that the Clean Air Act of 1990, which instituted a market for sulfur
dioxide (SO2) permits, enhanced the efficiency of “scrubbers,” or flue gas desulfurization units.
Most recently, Johnstone et al (2008) found that different types of environmental policy
instruments had a significant positive effect on patent counts for new sources of renewable


                                                  2
energy. Similarly, in the health sector, Finkelstein (2004) showed that policies designed to
increase the usage of preexisting vaccines induced a 2.5-fold increase in clinical trials for new
vaccines. In the most ambitious project of this nature, Acemoglu et al (2006) concluded that the
introduction of Medicare did not induce pharmaceutical innovation by showing that an increase
in drug consumption by the elderly did not correspond with an increase in FDA drug approvals
for treatments for diseases that affect the elderly. Finally, Acemoglu and Finkelstein (2008)
demonstrated that the shift from full labor cost to partial cost reimbursement for hospitals under
the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS) caused substantial increases in capital-labor
ratios and a corresponding decrease in labor inputs. This empirical finding perfectly supports the
induced innovation hypothesis – as the relative price of labor increased, hospitals economized
the use of this factor of production. In addition, the authors found that the PPS also encouraged
the adoption of a wide range of new medical technologies.
       Within this latter category, analysts have tried to determine whether different policy
approaches to a given substantive goal (e.g. cleaning up the air) are more or less likely to induce
innovative responses. There is both a theoretical and empirical literature, for example, on
“market-based” policies such as taxes or subsidies versus “command and control” policies such
as specific performance standards. Unfortunately, neither theory nor empirical analysis has been
conclusive in this debate. In this paper, we do not start from any particular presumption about
what policies may have been more effective, but merely analyze the policies that were enacted in
a framework that allows for all possible inducement effects.


3. Cigarette Taxes and Smoking Cessation Products
       In the previous section, we observed that policies that encourage the use of existing
products can also promote innovation in related technologies (Finkelstein, 2004). This paper
addresses the converse relationship as its main research question. Do policies that discourage the
use of existing technologies induce innovation in socially desirable substitutes? In particular,
does an increase in cigarette taxes induce innovation in the market for smoking cessation
products? Cigarette taxes have primarily been imposed to generate revenue, since they were first
levied prior to the health warnings regarding cigarette smoking. However, economists have
clearly demonstrated that an increase in cigarette taxes leads to a decrease in cigarette
consumption given several individual and location fixed effects (Baltagi and Levin, 1986;


                                                 3
Flewelling et al, 1992; Peterson et al, 1992; Lewit et al, 1997; Ringel and Evans, 2001; Tauras,
2004, 2006).
         Starting from the demonstrated responsiveness of cigarette consumption to cigarette
prices, and given the addictive nature of smoking, it seems reasonable to presume that an
increase in the price of cigarettes should increase the demand for smoking cessation products
(Tauras and Chaloupka, 2003; Tauras et al, 2005). If firms are choosing potential research
products based on profit-maximization, then an increase in the demand for smoking cessation
products should incentivize the development of new smoking-cessation products. Regulatory
policies such as restrictions on workplace smoking that make smoking less convenient should
have similar effects. In this paper, we do not measure or model explicitly the market demand for
smoking cessation products, but simply investigate empirically the possible impact on smoking-
cessation invention from economic forces that could push people toward smoking cessation.1
         Recent advances in evolutionary economics tell us a different story about the innovation
process. The general reasoning described above that connects cigarette taxes or bans with profit
potential from new smoking cessation products is rife with uncertainty. Firms will not know the
magnitude or timing of possible increases in demand for cessation products. In addition, they
will not even be able to estimate probabilities regarding the actual payoffs if they were to invest
resources in developing new cessation products. Thus, without denying the general tendency
described above, the evolutionary paradigm recognizes that markets are evolutionary and firms
are adaptive (Nelson and Winter, 1982). Therefore, we should consider the possibility that firms
do not necessarily respond in ways explicable through the profit-maximization mechanism, but
rather follow a set of routines and abide by certain decisions rules. In the context of our study, it
may be that firms continuously engage in a certain amount of research related to smoking
cessation, and adjust their investments in that research only occasionally and in response to
general environmental signals rather than specific predictions based on prices and markets.
         This paradigm suggests that perhaps innovation follows a path generated by its own
inertia. In addition, we might be able to observe certain predictable and repeating patterns in the
rate and direction of innovation in a particular industry. There are two main possibilities to


1
 At some point, policies or other forces that reduce the number of smokers would eliminate the demand for smoking
cessation products, since if there are no smokers then nobody needs to quit. Given that the number of smokers
worldwide is huge and still growing, we do not think that this ultimate possibility is relevant for our analysis of past
experience in the industry.


                                                           4
explore. First, we must consider that inventive output might respond to the quantity of existing
inventions. One important feature of technological change is path dependency (Arthur, 1994). In
other words, innovation is a cumulative process in which the outputs in time period t i also

function as the inputs in time period ti 1 . This model is driven by increasing returns to
innovation, which simply means that past invention begets future invention. Therefore, we might
expect the number of innovations per year to increase exponentially due to the increasing supply
of knowledge and a constantly expanding choice set of possible input combinations.
       Second, we must consider that the rate and direction of innovation responds to the quality
of previous technological change. Therefore, we might observe short explosions of innovative
activity, rather than gradual change over time. These periods of sharp increase might be triggered
by the introduction of a keystone technology by one firm, which then spurs a wave of imitation
by other firms. Eventually, innovation slows down once the market has selected a “dominant
design” and this trough continues until a new and improved design is developed. These observed
cycles follow an evolutionary algorithm of differentiation, imitation, and selection, which is
similar to the “windows of opportunity” described in the management literature (Anderson and
Tushman, 1990; Tyre and Orlikowski, 1994).
       These two paradigms are by no means mutually exclusive. It is possible that cigarette
taxes and other policies in the government’s anti-smoking agenda can explain broad trends in
innovation, but deviations from these neoclassical predictions might represent something other
than random noise around a static equilibrium. Evolutionary models in economics offer a unique
perspective from which to understand specific patterns in innovation as an endogenous
component of a complex adaptive system. The empirical goal of this study is to integrate both
models to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the innovation process.


4. Data and Methods
4.1. Patent Statistics
       Our dependent variable is the number of U.S. patents granted for smoking cessation
products, tabulated by the year in which the application was made. Economists have relied on
patent statistics as a measure of innovation for decades because they are detailed, precise, and
easily observed. Of course, patent statistics are far from perfect indicators of the rate of



                                                  5
invention. Not all inventions are patented, and the significance or importance of patents varies
enormously. In addition, when used as an indicator of the rate of invention over time, there are
irresolvable questions of timing—there will be a lag between some economic or institutional
stimulus and when a researcher begins a project; a lag between when the project begins and
when it ends; and a lag until the patent application is filed.
         For example, suppose that cigarette taxes increase substantially in a given year ti , which

triggers investment in R&D for smoking cessation technologies in year ti  j . The R&D process

might take as long as k years before firms can complete and submit their patent applications. In
this case, the magnitude of the invention lag in years equals j  k . And of course there is no
reason why either j or k would be the same for all firms. This means that any attempt to
determine the empirical significance of different causal factors through time series analysis of
patent statistics must not be interpreted too literally.2
         Patent statistics for this empirical study were collected by application date from the
USPTO website and the Google Patents database. When collecting patent data, the researcher
can filter search results by either sub-class or keyword. The former approach returns a surplus of
results that share a similar method of delivery but perform incongruous therapeutic purposes,
while the latter will inevitably underestimate patent counts due to omitted keyword bias.
Smoking cessation products in particular are difficult to locate because they exist in a variety of
different forms (such as liquids, solids, and even computer programs), which makes sub-class
searches extremely difficult. Therefore, we performed a series of keyword searches to maximize




2
 Theoretically, firms could anticipate changes in taxes or other inducers, creating the possibility of observed
negative lags.

our signal-noise ratio.3 This technique is generally recommended in the empirical literature
(Dekker et al, 2010).4
         The time series for this analysis extends from 1951-2004. While patent statistics are
available up to the present, we truncate the time series since patent applications can take up to six
years to be approved. Figure 1 displays the total number of patent counts for smoking cessation
products by application date. These patent counts range from 0 to 21 new applications per year,
with a total of 342 patent applications overall. We observe a steep decline in patent counts after
1997, which might represent market saturation due to the clinical success and commercial
domination of the nicotine gum and patch.5 Working with a relatively small number of
observations exposes our vulnerability to the confounding effects of random noise in the data.
However, since we were able to read through every patent application that was collected for this
study, we can assume greater accuracy in the dependent variable.
         We must also consider the likelihood that patent counts in a given industry will be
influenced by trends in overall patenting activity. Therefore, we constructed a second dependent
variable to represent the patent share of the smoking cessation industry. Patent shares are
calculated by dividing the total number of patent counts in a given industry by the total number
of patents in that year, which inherently controls for these general trends in inventive output.
Figure 2 shows the patent share for smoking cessation products by application date, which
follows a similar pattern as the patent counts data. The USPTO Patent Database is the only
source that provides aggregated patent statistics by application date from 1964 to the present.

3
  To ensure a representative (if not complete) sample of patents for smoking cessation products, we exploited an
exhaustive list of keywords by therapeutic purpose, material inputs, and product types. For each keyword, we
recorded the first 250 results in the Google Patent database and omitted any duplicates. For quality assurance, we
searched for the same keywords in the USPTO database and recorded any remaining unique results. This exercise
involved many judgment calls, and there is no perfect method for achieving a completely unbiased sample. In order
to preserve objectivity, our search criteria stated that the patent application must clearly demonstrate that smoking
cessation was one of the primary motivations for inventing the given technology, and one of the primary functions
and/or applications of the invention. Some patents described methods to reduce the incidence of several dangerous
activities with negative health effects, and these were recorded as long as smoking was listed as one of the primary
behaviors to be modified. This search excluded several products that reduced the harmful effects of smoking, or
potentially reduced exposure products (PREPS), which have become popular over the last decade but have not been
clinically proven to break the habit of cigarette smoking.
4
  Many of the patents fall into easily recognizable categories, but one described a tubular coin receptacle that was
designed to illustrate the potential monetary rewards of quitting the habit of smoking, otherwise known as a “ciggie
bank” (U.S. Patent Application No. 10/291,727 (2002)).
5
  In addition, a series of mergers among pharmaceutical companies might have led to a reassessment of new drug
development. Furthermore, companies started to produce potentially reduced exposure products (PREPS), such as
the electronic cigarette, which reduce nicotine and tar consumption but cannot claim smoking cessation benefits in
patent applications.


                                                          7
Although this generates fewer observations, we can see from Figure 1 that this shortened time
series still covers most of the patenting activity in the smoking cessation industry.


4.2. Cigarette Taxes
           Currently, the government levies both state and federal taxes on cigarettes, with more
frequent increases at the state level. We expect that firms will respond to total cigarette excise
taxes, which equals the sum of state and federal tax levels, because they are developing smoking
cessation aides for a national market. However, it is possible that marginal state and federal tax
increases can each have independent effects on innovative activity since they are associated with
different complementary effects, such as media coverage and advocacy campaigns.
           We collected cigarette tax data from 1951-2004 from The Tax Burden on Tobacco, which
is a historical compilation of data from the tobacco industry published by Orzechowski and
Walker, an economic consulting firm. This dataset reports annual federal tax levels along with
average state tax levels weighted by cigarette sales. Excise taxes are measured in a given
quantity of dollars and cents added on to the original retail price of a pack of cigarettes, as
opposed to a percentage of total retail prices. Since these cigarette tax levels are reported in
nominal terms, we construct this explanatory variable by calculating the real tax level for any
given year in 2009 dollars.6 Figure 3 displays the state, federal, and total cigarette tax levels in
real terms for the entire time series.
           Cigarette taxes are one part of a much larger public policy effort to reduce the level of
tobacco smoking (Warner, 1977; Chaloupka, 1995). For example, state and local governments
have passed several pieces of legislation that ban smoking in public places over the past few
decades. The primary goal of this legislation is to reduce nonsmoker exposure to second-hand
smoke; however, these policies also make smoking more inconvenient for existing smokers and
protect highly suggestible nonsmokers from adopting the dangerous habit. These important
unintended consequences have been found to have a significant negative effect on both adult and
teenage demand for cigarettes (Wasserman et al, 1991; Tauras, 2006).
           An online database maintained by Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights (ANR), an anti-
smoking advocacy group, contains a chronological list of these smoking bans from 1990-

present.7 Each observation provides the state or municipality associated with the smoke-free
provision, reports the corresponding population of this geographic area at the time the legislation
was passed, and indicates whether the provision guarantees 100% smoke-free air in workplaces,
restaurants, bars, or some combination of the three. Using this information, we calculate the
percentage of the total U.S. population protected by some type of 100% smoke-free law for any
given year t as follows:
                                                       2004

                                                               xt

                                                                                                             [1]
                                                         t
where t represents the percentage of the total U.S. population covered by smoke-free

provisions in year t, xt represents the total cumulative number of people protected by smoke-free

provisions in year t from 1990 to 2004, and t represents the Census estimate of the total US
population in year t from 1990 to 2004.8 The expected sign of this explanatory variable is
unclear. We can imagine a positive sign in the case that smoke-free provisions decrease the
demand for smoking, and thus increase the demand for smoking cessation products. However,
we can also imagine that firms might interpret smoke-free provisions as “substitute” methods for
quitting smoking that lower the residual demand for cessation products.
        In addition to cigarette taxes and smoking bans, we identified three structural breaks in
the policy environment that might have signaled significant changes in the demand for smoking
cessation products:
            The 1964 Report of the Surgeon General was the first public declaration of the
             adverse health effects of tobacco use, specifically estimating a 70 percent increase in
             the mortality rate of smokers over non-smokers.9 We should expect that this public
             health report significantly altered the direction of innovation (Warner, 1977).
            A 1996 ruling allowed smoking cessation products to be sold over-the-counter.
             Previously, these products were prescribed by physicians and supplemented with

           counseling, but we would expect that producers face greater incentives to innovate
           when there are fewer transaction costs associated with consuming their product.
          The 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement entitled 46 states to recover
           damages from the four largest tobacco companies for smoking-related Medicare and
           Medicaid expenditures by establishing tort liability. The settlement also established
           the American Legacy Fund, a tobacco control advocacy group, along with an anti-
           smoking advertising campaign. Theory and empirical evidence have demonstrated
           that targeted advertising campaigns have a significant negative effect on the demand
           for smoking (Hamilton, 1972; Hu et al, 1995; Saffer and Chaloupka, 2000).
       We should also consider two important endogenous changes in the market for smoking
cessation products. Nicotine replacement therapies are the most popular smoking cessation
products, and clinical studies suggest that they are also the most effective method for quitting.
The first nicotine replacement therapy, Nicorette Gum, was marketed in 1984 (Hu et al, 2000).
We recall from the previous section that evolutionary models assume that the rate of innovation
is a function of the quality of previous innovations. If this hypothesis is correct, then we should
expect to see an increase in patenting after the introduction of nicotine gum, which represents the
first dominant design in the market. By this logic, the sale of nicotine patches starting in 1992
should have a comparable stimulatory effect on patenting behavior.
       There were also many policy changes over this period that affected incentives to patent
generally (Kortum and Lerner, 1999). Rather than model these explicitly, we use the patent share
measure as the dependent variable in some regressions to sweep out any effects of policy
changes that relate to the patent system as a whole.

5.1. Patent Counts
       The first set of regressions attempts to explain changes in the rate and direction of patent
counts from 1951-2004. We begin with the following basic linear OLS model:

introduction of the nicotine gum in 1984 and nicotine patch in 1992. To reflect the temporary
boost to innovation that may be generated by the introduction of a transformative new
technology, we construct these evolutionary variables using a decay function. The given variable
takes a value of 0 before the technology was developed, 1 during the year of its introduction, and
then decreases at a constant rate thereafter:

where δ represents the rate of decay in percentage terms, τ represents the current year and ι
represents the year of introduction. Finally, X represents a vector of binary time dummy variables
that control for the Surgeon General Report of 1964, the sale of NRTs over-the-counter in 1996,
and the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement in 1998.10
         The inherently cumulative nature of the invention process suggests that invention in year
t, in addition to being affected by the drivers included in equation (2), is also affected by the rate
of invention in previous years. In principle, this process should be modeled explicitly,11 but it is
difficult to get very far with such modeling in a single time series. Hence we do not explicitly
introduce the effect of lagged invention rates into the model, but we do correct for the
autocorrelation of the error that is suggested by such a model using the Prais-Winsten
generalized least squares estimation technique.
         Another issue with equation (2) is that linear relationships are commonly seen as less
plausible than the constant-elasticity relationships that would be captured by a log-log
formulation. We cannot use a simple log-log formulation, because the dependent variable is
sometimes zero. Instead, we estimate the related non-linear model:
                                                                        n                      k

                                                                       i 1                   i 1




10
   There may well be lags of unknown duration in the effect of any of our regressors on the rate of invention. Given
our limited data, we are not in a position to estimate these lags, and so look simply for effects in year t related to
values in t-1.

   See, e.g., Caballero and Jaffe (1993)


                                                             11
Taking the log of both sides shows that the parameters of the exponential model can be
interpreted as elasticities just as if a log-log linear model had been estimated.12


5.2. Patent Shares
         The previous model only considers factors that are endogenous to the market for smoking
cessation products. However, it is possible that the dependent variable is being significantly
influenced by exogenous factors that affect overall patenting activity. Therefore, the second set
of regressions takes as its dependent variable the share of all patents represented by patents on
smoking cessation technologies, thereby eliminating the effects of factors that affect the overall
rate of patenting. For these regressions, we use the log of the logistic transformation of the share
data, thereby also providing estimates with a convenient parametric interpretation.


5.3. Results
         Table 1 displays the results of the regressions using patent counts as the dependent
variable. The first four columns show the linear model using Prais-Winsten standard errors to
control for autocorrelation; the last column presents the NLLS results for the exponential version
with Newey-West standard errors. We can see that cigarette taxes and smoking bans appear not
to have had a significant effect on patenting activity, even when we isolate them on the right-
hand side of the equation. Furthermore, the coefficients on both policy variables are surprisingly
negative when we include all relevant explanatory variables and time dummies. The evolutionary
variables had a positive effect on innovation, significant at the 10 percent level in the linear
model and highly significant in the exponential model.13 As expected, the Surgeon General
Report of 1964 had a highly significant positive impact on smoking cessation product
innovation, while the 1996 law allowing the sale of NRTs over-the-counter had a marginally
significant positive effect. However, the Tobacco Master Settlement had an unexpected negative
and insignificant effect on patenting behavior. Note that the magnitude of the coefficients from
the linear and non-linear models cannot be compared to each other, but the qualitative pattern of
12
   Estimation of equation (4) by NLLS also produces consistent parameter estimates for a wide range of assumptions
about the stochastic process that underlies the integer nature of the patent variable. See Hausman, Hall and Griliches
(1984).
13
   The reported results are based on using a 10% annual decay rate for the evolutionary effects as represented in
equation (3). We also experimented with using annual decay rates of 20% and 30%. The overall fit is poorer with
these higher decay rates, but the qualitative picture given by the results (including the negative but insignificant
effect of the tax and smoking ban variables) is the same.


                                                         12
effects is the same in both formulations. We return to interpretation of the magnitude of the
coefficients below.
        Table 2 presents the results from the estimation based on the share of smoking cessation
patents among all patents. We were able to identify consistent data for all patents beginning only
in 1964,14 so our time series is shortened slightly, but with little loss of meaningful variance
because the there were almost no smoking cessation patents before 1964. In general, the share
results are quite consistent with the results based on patent counts. Columns (1) and (2) show
that cigarette taxes and smoking bans once again have no significant impact on patenting
activity. The evolutionary variables remain the only regressors with real explanatory power and
were highly significant at the 1 percent level. The log-log interpretation suggests that the
introduction of the nicotine gum and patch each increased the rate of innovation in smoking
cessation products by 60 and 79 percent, respectively, subject to a 10 percent rate of decay. The
Surgeon General Report of 1964 drops out of the model because of the lack of observations
before its issuance.
        Table 2 also explores whether the inventive environment as modeled here affected
different kinds of potential inventors differently. We distinguish those patents assigned to
corporations and those retained by individuals. Column (3) shows that the evolutionary variables
had a significant positive innovation effects at the firm level. These results are consistent with
our previous results and evolutionary theory. However, Column (4) shows that dominant designs
did not induce innovation among individual inventors. Instead, smoking bans had a slightly
negative effect on individual patents, which is highly significant at the 1 percent level. One
possible explanation for this divergence is that individuals do not participate in industry-wide
cycles due to limited access. More generally, the evolutionary model attempts to explain decision
making within firms; we do not have a corresponding model of the decision behavior of
individuals acting outside of organized firms.
        The signs and statistical significance of the coefficients in the regressions gives a clear
qualitative picture of the relative importance of the effects. But they do not convey a clear sense
of the magnitude of the effects. This question is investigated in Figure 4, which presents counter-
factual simulations of the rate of smoking-cessation patenting based on the estimated model. In

  We are dating our smoking cessation patents by year of application, and we were not able to find PTO data on the
number of patents tabulated by date of application before 1964.

other words, we can examine what the dependent variable would have been in the absence of the
effects of interest using the coefficients from the patent counts model above. Each line in Figure
4 represents our fitted linear model with the value of one particular regressor equal to zero;
comparing these lines to the base case gives an indication of the quantitative importance of the
omitted variable. We observe that the counterfactual series in the absence of one or both of the
evolutionary variables represent the least patenting activity, which further suggests that they had
the largest innovation effects. Indeed, had the gum and patch not been introduced, the results
indicate that the cumulative total of smoking cessation patents over the time period would have
been reduced by 40%. Conversely, the fact that the counterfactual series without cigarette taxes
or smoking bans are so close to the actual fitted series suggests that these policy variables had no
significant impact on the rate of innovation in smoking cessation products.


6. Summary and Conclusions
       The purpose of this study was to explore the causal link between public policy and
induced innovation. Theory tells us that policies that discourage the use of existing technologies
should induce socially desirable innovation. However, our empirical evidence suggests that
cigarette taxes and smoking bans appear to have had no industry-wide impact on the rate of
innovation for new smoking cessation products. Given that inflation-adjusted taxes fell for much
of the period, this is perhaps not surprising, but the results certainly do not provide support for an
empirically large induced innovation effect from taxes.
       Our empirical results are more consistent with an evolutionary model of the pace of
invention. The recursive evolutionary algorithm of differentiation, selection, and amplification is
embedded in the decay model that we introduced. The development of the first nicotine gum and
patch were the only explanatory variables to remain highly significant and maintain the same
sign through the entire empirical analysis. As expected, the introduction of these dominant
technologies had a positive effect on the rate of innovation in the smoking cessation industry. Of
course, the impact of these two technologies is hardly conclusive with respect to the broader
significance of the evolutionary model, and the appearance of these transformative technologies
remains itself unexplained. Nonetheless, we hope that these findings will provide clues about
how to incorporate evolutionary models in empirical research.




                                                 14
       From a policy perspective, our empirical results suggest that the primary determinant of
smoking cessation product innovation was innovation itself. In order to successfully induce
future socially desirable innovation, the challenge will be to find a way to generate a new
dominant design. Further research can explore exactly what happened in 1984 and 1992 when
the nicotine gum and patch were developed and try to understand what role external factors,
including public policy, may have played in triggering these developments. Until such research
advances, it will be impossible to say much with respect to the public policy implications of the
evolutionary model. For example, current political discourse is centered on a potential excise tax
on soda and junk food, and on carbon taxes to address climate change. The innovation effects of
these policies cannot be derived from this analysis.
       The evolutionary model is, however, at least suggestive of a possible role for other
government policies to move the innovation process in socially desired directions. If it is true
that the invention rate is dependent on the occurrence of transformative inventions, and that the
normal economic signals of price and demand do not necessarily bring forth such transformative
inventions, then perhaps there is a role for government to jumpstart the evolutionary process by
funding research and creating a market for new products. For example, the development of
digital computing and communications technology was seeded in important ways by government
purchases of early computer and communications technology for military and space purposes;
current commercial applications would not likely have developed or developed as quickly
without this non-economic source of initial demand (Mowery, forthcoming). If society desires to
nudge innovation in particular directions, then technology evolution should be embraced, and
product lifecycles allow the government to play a key role at the origin of innovation.
