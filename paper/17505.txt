                                             ABSTRACT

This paper assesses the impact of variable investment-linked deferred annuities (VILDAs) on lifecycle
consumption, saving, and portfolio allocation patterns given stochastic and systematic mortality. Insurers
have taken two approaches to manage systematic mortality risks, namely self-insurance and risk transfer
to purchasers of the annuity products. We demonstrate that self-insurance leads to high loadings, so
that households offered a choice would favor the risk transfer scheme. Reservation loadings on the
actuarially fair VILDA price for non-participation are 0.5-8%; if insurers cannot hedge within this
range, they will transfer systematic longevity risks to the annuitants. Our findings have implications
for new payout products that may be attractive to older households seeking to protect against retirement
shortfalls.

               Lifecycle Portfolio Choice with Systematic Longevity Risk
                  and Variable Investment-Linked Deferred Annuities



1. Introduction

         Many defined contribution pension plans currently do not offer access to annuities during

the accumulation or the decumulation phase.1 Indeed, most product innovation in the last decade

has focused on the accumulation phase seeking to attract and diversify workers’ retirement

saving via target maturity date and balanced funds (c.f. Gomes, Kotlikoff and Viceira 2008). Yet

attention is now turning to the decumulation phase, so financial advisers can help their clients

manage their portfolio drawdown process during retirement. Previous research on dynamic

portfolio choice over the lifecycle suggests that payout annuities with immediate and life-contingent

benefit streams are key to protect the consumption needs of risk-averse households having uncertain

lifetimes.2 Yet despite the theoretical attractiveness of payout annuities, many consumers are reluctant

to annuitize their wealth voluntarily.3 Explanations for the divergence between theoretically-

predicted and actual behavior include incomplete annuity markets, bequest motives, high costs

charged by life annuity providers, and behavioral factors.4 Nevertheless, some advocates of

annuitization have proposed that annuities be used as a default option in tax-sheltered pension plans.




1
  Benartzi, Previtero, and Thaler (2011) note that only 21 percent of defined contribution plans in the U.S. even offer
annuities as an option.
2
  The seminal research by Yaari (1965) has been followed by a long list of authors; most recently see Davidoff, Brown, and
Diamond (2005) and Horneff, Maurer, Mitchell and Stamos (2009, 2010).
3
  In 2011 sales of fixed annuities stood at only $20 billion and of variable annuities $40 billion (LIMRA 2011), as
compared to over $18 trillion in retirement assets (ICI 2011).
4
  Schaus (2005) noted that fewer than one out of ten defined contribution participants opted for an annuity when it was
available. Recent reviews of the literature include Horneff, Maurer, Mitchell and Dus (2007); Hu and Scott (2007);
and Yagi and Nishigaki (1993).
                                                                                                                    2


For this reason, deferred life annuities are now attracting attention from policymakers, regulators,

and financial intermediaries.5

        As with immediate payout annuities, deferred annuities promise lifelong periodic

payments to the annuitant in exchange for a non-refundable premium. Whereas the immediate

annuity begins paying from the date of purchase, a deferred annuity starts paying benefits as of

some pre-specified future date. Due to discounting, as well as the possibility that the annuitant

might die before payouts start, the deferred payout annuity will be much less expensive than an

immediate annuity with identical payouts. Indeed the low price of deferred annuities may help

overcome psychological barriers to voluntary annuitization. Milevsky (2005), for example,

argues that most individuals will refrain from irreversibly annuitizing substantial lump sums at

retirement, independent of their understanding of individual longevity risk.

        Previous studies (e.g. Horneff, Maurer, and Rogalla 2010) focus on deferred annuities

that pay flat or fixed lifetime benefits. By contrast, here we examine variable investment-linked

deferred annuities (VILDAs) which offer both an investment element, in terms of a mutual fund-

style subaccount, and an insurance element, in terms of pooling longevity risks across the retiree

group. Payments begin when the deferring period is over and continue for life, while the benefit

paid depends on the performance of the underlying asset portfolio (stocks, bonds, or some

combination). Our goal is to assess theoretically how households might value these life-

contingent benefit streams over the lifecycle, under a range of different assumptions regarding

uncertain longevity risk. First we study how variable investment-linked deferred annuities

influence household optimal consumption patterns as well as portfolio allocations across stocks,

bonds, and VILDAs in a world with idiosyncratic yet without systematic longevity risk, i.e.

5
 For instance Gale, Iwry, John, and Walker (2008) propose automatic annuitization for 401(k) assets when US
employees retiree; in Singapore, the government has recently mandated deferred annuitization (Fong, Mitchell, and
Koh 2011).
                                                                                                                  3


unknown individual lifetimes but non-stochastic mortality tables. Second, we show how results

change once we also account for systematic longevity risk, i.e. stochastic variation of general

mortality patterns over time.

        A large literature has developed over the last two decades seeking to model the stochastic

development of human mortality patterns over time.6 In their foundational work, Lee and Carter

(1992) introduced a simple discrete-time one-factor model for the central death rate and

employed it to describe US mortality rates over time. While this model was able to trace the

(downward sloping) time trend in mortality, the one-factor approach implies perfect correlation

of mortality innovations over all ages, which contradicts empirical evidence. Subsequently

developed stochastic mortality models (e.g. Cairns, Blake, and Dowd, 2006b; Renshaw and

Haberman 2003), seek to remedy this by taking a multi-factor approach.

        Naturally the impact of systematic mortality risk on household welfare depends on how

insurers manage and, hence, price systematic longevity risk, and various strategies are available.

One approach, feasible only for large diversified providers, is to build up a ‘natural’ hedge

through a second business line reciprocally affected by general mortality developments (such as

life insurance; c.f. Milevsky and Promislow 2001, Gatzert and Wesker 2010). McCarthy and

Mitchell (2010), however, question the effectiveness of such a hedge in practice. Alternatively,

the insurer might seek to hedge this exposure using capital market instruments such as mortality

swaps, making fixed payments in exchange for variable payments linked to the development of

an underlying survival index. Currently, however, the market for mortality-linked products is

still underdeveloped (Blake and Burrows 2001; Cowley and Cummins 2005) so it is questionable




6
 For a detailed discussion of alternative approaches see Pitacco, Denuit, Haberman and Olivieri (2009), Cairns,
Blake, Dowd (2006a), as well as Cairns, Blake, Dowd, Coughlan, Epstein, and Khalaf-Allah (2010).
                                                                                                                        4


whether an insurer with a substantial exposure to systematic mortality risk would be able to

purchase an adequate amount of insurance against this sort of longevity risk.

         The present paper focuses on two risk management approaches that are independent of

firm size and capital market solutions: insurer self-insurance, and risk pool participation. Under

the self-insurance strategy, providers will set the VILDA price so that they run little chance that

benefits paid to annuitants will exceed provider reserves. Under the risk pool participation

approach, the VILDA provider can refrain from taking systematic mortality risks into its books

by only offering products which have annuitants participate in the development of general life-

expectancy by adjusting benefit payments to unanticipated mortality shocks.7

         The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the fundamental

characteristics of VILDAs. Section 3 draws out lifecycle implications of including VILDAs in

the household portfolio, assuming non-stochastic mortality tables. In the next Section, we

introduce systematic longevity risk and its effect on optimal lifecycle behavior. Section 5

concludes.



2. Variable Investment-Linked Deferred Payout Annuities

         An immediate investment-linked payout annuity is a financial contract between a retiree

and a life insurance company, whereby in exchange for paying an initial (non-refundable)

premium, the annuitant immediately begins to receive lifelong payments equal to the value of a

pre-specified number of units on a specific asset portfolio, usually represented by mutual funds.

As payments depend on the value of the annuity funds units (FUs), they can be stochastic when

7
  This is similar in spirit to the group self-annuitization model proposed by Piggott, Valdez, and Denzel (2005), and
the product on offer by the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association (TIAA) through its fellow life insurer, the
College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF). Here benefit payments evolve according to the mortality experience of
covered participants; see Weil and Fisher (1974) and Brown, Mitchell, Poterba, and Warshawsky (2001) for more
information on the TIAA-CREF model.
                                                                                                           5


the underlying assets are held in risky assets. The buyer of the variable annuity can influence (in

practice within some bounds) how the assets are invested in various asset categories (e.g.

equities, bonds, real estate) while bearing both the risk and reward of that portfolio.

          In the case of a (variable) investment-linked deferred annuity, the insurance premium

generates lifelong payments which begin at some future age , i.e. the end of the deferral period.

We denote the value of a FU at time          as       . For an annuity contract signed at age              )

which promises payment of             FUs at age       , the initial payout after the end of the deferral

period, subject to survival, is given by                         . Thereafter, the periodic payments

          from the VILDA evolve according to:

                                                       1
                                                                 .                                       (1)
                                                       1

The equation shows that an updating rule relates the annuity payouts                in future periods to

the previous payout        and the realized investment return            of the assets underlying

portfolio backing the annuity relative to the assumed interest rate (         ). The annuity payment

rise when               ; it falls when               ; and it is constant when               . If the

insurance pool is sufficiently large, the premium for the payout process can be calculated

according to the actuarial principle of equivalence:

                                                             ;                                           (2)

where          ;     is the deferred annuity factor given by

                                                                     ,
                                  ;               ,                                                      (3)
                                                             1

Here      is the loading factor charged by the insurer. Given a mortality table to price the annuity,

      ,    is the cumulative survival probability between purchase age           and the deferral age          ,

and        ,   is the cumulative survival probability between age         and . The retiree’s maximum
                                                                                                                      6


age is .

         In contrast to fixed immediate payout annuities, VILDA payouts depend on the asset

allocation in the underlying fund, as well as the deferral period. The classic immediate fixed

annuity is a special case, whereby the assets inside the annuity consist entirely of risk-free bonds,

the        is set equal to the riskless interest rate (i.e.                 ), and the deferral age        equals the

age of purchase. To illustrate the effects of deferral on VILDA annuity benefits, Figure 1 shows

for alternative deferral periods the range of payments (defined by the 5:95% quantiles). These

are derived by simulating 10,000,000 payment paths of an annuity with a constant 50/50

allocation over risk-free bonds and risky equities.8

Figure 1 here

         Here the payout possibility frontier for an immediate variable annuity is represented by

the dotted line from age 65, which begins at 6.9% of the initial premium paid. Thereafter, the

lower line (5% quantile) slopes down with age, and if the retiree survives to age 80, the payout

rate would only be 3.8%. This worsening risk over time results from the downside volatility of

equity returns. The 95% quantile curve gradually increases to about 11.3% for the retiree who is

still alive at age 80. The Figure illustrates two implications of deferring the annuity payouts.

First, the spread for the first payment (assuming survival to age 65) is increasing in the deferral

period. The range for a five-year deferral period is 6.2-11.6%; for the 10 year deferral, it is 6.5-

15.9%. Second, conditional on survival, both the up- and the downside payout profiles are

improved. We note that this comes at the cost of a larger chance of dying before the payments

start.

  Here the risk-free rate is set to 2% p.a. and the gross equity returns are log-normally distributed with a mean of 6%
percent and a standard deviation of 20%. Annuity premiums are based on the 2007 U.S. female population mortality
table as provided by the Human Mortality Database, incorporating a trend in mortality rates calibrated to the
changes in U.S. female mortality between years 1933 and 2007 (see Section 4.2 for details).The           is set to 4%.

3. VILDAs under Systematic Mortality Risk

3.1 Price and Benefit Dynamics

         VILDAs transfer investment risks to the annuitants. Longevity risks, however, still

remain with the insurer. While pooling a sufficient number of annuitants allows the insurer to

manage the idiosyncratic part of longevity risk, it does not provide a hedge against the systematic

longevity risk, for which other means are required. In this paper we focus on two approaches

VILDA providers have at hand for managing systematic mortality risks: insurer self-insurance,

and risk pool participation.

         Following the self-insurance strategy, the provider retains the systematic longevity risk

and sets the VILDA price (measured in FUs) to ensure a sufficiently high probability that the

number of FUs paid to the annuitants does not exceed the number of FUs in the provider’s

reserves. We define the adequately high level as α. Formally, the price Π for the risk quantile α

is the number of FUs that satisfies the following condition:

                                            1
                ℙ      ,           ,                     Π            ,           .           (4)
                                        1

Again,      ,   is the cumulative survival rate between age x and age y, K is the deferral age, T is

the assumed maximum possible survival age, AIR is the assumed interest rate, and              is the

information set at time t. By contrast to the assumptions in Section 2, survival rates          are

stochastic and depend on the state of the mortality process at time t as well as its future

development. Accordingly the annuity prices also depend on the state of the mortality process.

Obviously, these prices are not actuarially fair but include premiums for insuring against adverse

mortality developments.
                                                                                                                   8


          When following the participation strategy, we assume that VILDA providers charge a fair

price based on the actuarial principle of equivalence for new annuity purchases. Hence, at time t

(t < K), the price of a VILDA Π , is given by

                                                             1
                      Π             ,             ,                              ,            .              (5)
                                                        1

At the same time, unanticipated future mortality developments will be passed through to the

annuitants by adjusting their stock of previously purchased claims to FU payments. Let

again denote the number of FUs payable at age               , which the annuitant accumulated until time .

At time         1, in order to still be able to cover the VILDA liability with the reserves built up at

the time the VILDA was sold, the provider must adjust the promised number of FUs due at age

     according to the following:

                                                                             Π
                                                                                     ,                       (6)
                                                                         Π

where         represents the realized one-period survival rate at age .9 If mortality develops as

anticipated, the adjustment factor                is equal to 1 and the number of FUs promised to the

annuitant does not change. By contrast, an unexpected decrease (increase) in mortality will result

in an adjustment factor below (above) 1 and, hence, decrease (increase) the promised number of

FUs. Once VILDA payouts commence, i.e.                      , the adjustment factor is given by

                                                         Π       1
                                                                     ,                                       (7)
                                                         Π

where Π is the price of an immediate variable annuity due. Here, in case mortality develops as

anticipated, the adjustment factor will collapse to                      1               , representing the regular

decay of the number of FUs paid to the annuitant.

    This can be shown based on a simple FU balance argument (see the Appendix).

3.2 Implied Loadings and Benefit Variation

          Next, we want to illustrate the quantitative impact of systematic mortality risk on the

prices and the benefit structures of the two alternative VILDA types presented in the previous

section. To this end, we have to first specify a model for stochastic mortality. Here, we adopt the

parsimonious two-factor model by Cairns, Blake, and Dowd (2006b) where the logits of the

conditional one-year mortality rates                  ,     for age        at time t are presumed to evolve according

to:

                                                                   ,
                                     logit   ,        log                        ,      ,   .                      (8)
                                                             1         ,


Here      ,       is a stochastic factor that influences mortality rates equally at all ages, and           ,   is a

stochastic factor that drives age-dependent shocks in mortality rates. Moreover, the vector

              ,   ,   ,   follows a two-dimensional random walk with drift:

                                                                                 ,                                     (9)

where is the drift of            ,     is the lower triangular Cholesky matrix of the covariance Σ of

(i.e. Σ               ), and     is a two-dimensional standard normal innovation. Using OLS

regression, we calibrate this model to the Human Mortality Database for US females age 20-109

over the period 1933-2007.10 This produces the following point estimates:11

       The implications of this stochastic mortality model may be observed in Figure 2, which

presents the simulated distribution of the -period survival probabilities for an individual initially

aged 20. The graph shows that the probabilities of living to advanced ages exhibit significant

dispersion. For example, the probability of attaining age 70 (i.e.    20,70 ) spans the range from

79-93%, with a median of 87%; the probability of surviving to age 100,           20,100 , spans the

range 0.02-45%, with a median of 9%. These results suggest that the expected lifetime remaining

from age 20 varies between 56.7 and 73.8 years, with a median of 64.5 years. This compares to

  20,70      80% and      20,100       4% with an expected lifetime remaining from age 20 of

59.7 years, if we were to neglect both the trend and the volatility of the mortality process and use

only    to derive a static life table as of age of 20. In other words, using this stochastic mortality

model, future survival rates and years of life remaining are likely to exceed those derived from

the deterministic scenario.

Figure 2 here

       With this model for stochastic mortality at hand, we first assess the impact of systematic

longevity risk on VILDA prices under the self-insurance strategy, where systematic longevity

risk is borne by the insurer. To this end, we calculate the age-dependent implied loadings for pre-

selected confidence levels α (see Equation 4). For each initial age, these are derived by sampling

10,000,000 realizations of the stochastic mortality process until the terminal age (120). For each

sample path we then calculate the expected number of FUs paid to an annuitant in order to derive

the distribution of VILDA prices. To get an estimate of the implied loading, we subsequently

relate the number of FUs paid at the quantile α to the average number of FUs paid.
                                                                                               11


       As shown in Figure 3, these price increases can be substantial, especially for younger

annuitants. At age 20, for example, VILDA providers must charge loadings on top of the

actuarially fair premium of around 32% to maintain a 99.99% confidence level (to be used in

what follows). At the 99.5% confidence level, loadings must amount to over 20% for this age

group. At later ages, the dispersion of possible future mortality outcomes decreases and so does

the implied loading. Nevertheless at age 66, just before VILDA payments commence, the

loadings required to meet the 99.99% (99.5%) confidence level still amount to around 14% (9%).

Figure 3 here

       Next we turn attention to participating VILDAs that transfer systematic longevity risk to

the annuitants. Figure 4 presents the mean as well as the 5:95% quantiles of the simulated

adjustment factors for ages 20-120. The mean periodic adjustment factor, as discussed, is 1 until

the deferral age 67 and then drops to 1                1   0.03       0.971 for the remainder of

the lifecycle (see Equations 6 and 7). Over almost the entire deferral period, the 5:95% quantiles

of the periodic adjustment factors span the range 0.98-1.02, meaning that (notional) claims to FU

payments may increase/decrease by around 2% per period. Later, during the payout phase, this

span widens to a maximum of 0.93-1.01 by age 105. Hence, while payments (measured in FUs)

are projected to decrease by the factor of 0.971 per period, unexpected decreases in mortality

might result in an additional periodic drop in FUs paid of 4%; in the case of mortality increases,

payments in FUs might actually rise by 1%.

Figure 4 here

       To assess the impact of accumulated adjustment factors on the benefits of participating

VILDAs, Figure 5 presents the simulated distribution of actual FU payments relative to the

expected number of FUs paid at a given age. Based on our simulations, at age 67, the initial
                                                                                                 12


number of FUs paid at the 5% quantile falls short of the expected value by around 11%. At the

95% quantile, on the other hand, the annuitant receives almost 14% more FUs. Over the

subsequent years, the dispersion increases slowly, spanning the range -18-25% at age 100 and -

23-30% just before the end of our projection at age 119.

4 Integrating VILDAs into a Lifecycle Consumption and Portfolio Choice Model

      Next we draw out the lifecycle implications of including VILDAs in the household

investment portfolio.

4.1 Model and Calibration

       To this end, we build a discrete-time lifecycle consumption and portfolio choice model

for a utility-maximizing household that draws time-separable CRRA utility from consumption

and has access to incomplete markets for risk-free bonds, risky stocks, and VILDAs. The

household’s decision period begins at the age of 20 and ends at the outside age (     of 120. Every

year the household has to decide how much to consume ( ), how much of both liquid and

annuitized wealth to invest in risk-free bonds (         and      respectively), and, prior to the

retirement and deferral age ( ), how much to spend buying new annuities (              . During the

worklife, the household earns an exogenously-determined level of risky labor income, consisting

of a deterministic trend (      as well as permanent (          and transitory        shocks. After

retirement, the household receives a constant fraction of the last (permanent) salary as in the

form of lifetime pension benefits. Throughout the lifecycle, the household is exposed to

idiosyncratic as well as systematic longevity risk in the form of stochastic mortality rates.
                                                                                                                      13


          After normalizing by permanent labor income, the household’s optimization problem can

be described by the following Bellman equation:


          ,   ,     ,       max                             ,                   ,    ,       ,        1         ,    (10)
                           ,   ,   ,       1


where             represents (normalized) liquid wealth,                    the accumulated (normalized) annuity

wealth,       the level of relative risk aversion, and                the time discount rate. The two-dimensional

variable          describes the state of the Cairns/Blake/Dowd mortality process, defined in Section

3.2, and which - through Equation 8 - determines the state-dependent one-period survival rate

   ,       . The state variables evolve according to:



                                                                                                            ,


                                                                                                                    (11)
                                                                                         ,
                                       ,


                                       ,


where             is the gross equity return and                is the gross risk-free rate of return.              is an

indicator variable that takes the value 1 for                        and 0 otherwise, and         ,       is the age- and

state-dependent price of a VILDA that starts paying benefits from age                            . When VILDAs are of

the participating type,                    is the benefit adjustment factor as defined in Equations 6 and 7.

For non-participating VILDAs,                       is equal to 1 prior to          , and 1                subsequently.

Finally,           is the multivariate innovation to the mortality process according to Equation 9. The

policies undertaken must satisfy the following constraints:

                                                    ,   ,       ,      0;                                           (12)
                                                                            ;
                                                                                                       14



                                                           ,        ;
                                                  ,
                                                   ,            ;
                                                 0,            .


       In our calibration of the lifecycle model, we posit a coefficient of the relative risk

aversion (    of 5, and a time discount rate (        of 0.96. Retirement age is set to       67 and the

replacement rate is set to 40%, i.e. the (normalized) retirement income is 0.4 ∙               1 for t ≥

K. Our calibration of the remaining financial market and labor income parameters draws on

Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout (2005). We assume an annual gross risk-free rate of return                 of

1.02 on bonds, and gross equity returns               are assumed to be independently log-normally

distributed with mean 1.06 and standard deviation of 0.20. The logs of transitory ( ) and

permanent (      labor earnings shocks are uncorrelated and normally distributed with zero mean

and standard deviations equal to 22.5% and 10%, respectively. The mortality process is

calibrated to the U.S. female population mortality tables over the period 1933-2007, as provided

by the Human Mortality Database (see Section 3.2). Moreover, we posit that the pairwise

correlations between shocks in mortality rates, labor income, and stock market return are all

equal to zero. Finally, we set the assumed interest rate (              to 3%, such that expected annuity

payments in retirement are constant each period.

       We solve the optimization problem using value function iteration as described in Carroll

(2011). To this end, we discretize the following subset of the state space (wealth W, annuity L,

mortality process A , mortality process A ):

                         0, 300     0, 10         0.5 , 0.5             0.01 , 0.01

using a double exponential grid with 64 points for the first (wealth) dimension, and equidistant

grids for other dimensions with 40, 8, and 4 points, correspondingly. To evaluate the value

function outside the supporting points, we employ linear tensor interpolation for the reason of

stability and computational speed. Based on the optimal policy controls, we then simulate

1,000,000 cross-sectional independent lifecycles.

4.2 Optimal Household Behavior with VILDAs

            Now, we describe optimal annuitization, asset allocation, and consumption profiles with

VILDA annuities, assuming a static life-table (though stochastic individual survival). To this

end, we set the covariance matrix of the mortality process (Σ) to zero.12 In each case, we present

the expected as well as the 5:95% quantiles of the simulated distributions.

            Table 1 reports annuity purchases (Panel A) as well as annuity payments (Panel B) at

various ages. On average, households will begin to buy VILDAs in their late 30s. At age 40,

27% of the initial labor income is invested on average in VILDAs. Over the next two decades,

the value of periodic annuity purchases rises to over half of the worker’s first year labor income.

At age 67, the last period when VILDAs can be purchased, these investments amount to slightly

more than one times first-year labor income. Age 67 is also the point at which deferred VILDA

payouts commence, and initially they amount to 1.84 times first labor income (on average). With

expected investment returns slightly exceeding the                          , average benefit payments slowly

increase during retirement – to 2.07 (2.33) times the initial labor income at age 80 (100),

conditional on survival. Looking at the tail of the annuity payment distribution, we find that even

at the 5% quantile, VILDA payments come to a substantial 60% of first year’s labor income.

Table 1 here

            Next we report optimal lifecycle asset allocation patterns within the VILDA annuity

portion of the portfolio. Table 2 indicates that, on average, households will hold most of VILDA

assets in stocks for most of their active working lives; only in their 50s will they start shifting

     In this setting,   is deterministic and, hence, the dimensionality of the state space reduces accordingly.
                                                                                                      16


more funds into bonds. This is a typical result for lifecycle asset allocation studies that account

for periodic labor income that is not highly correlated with stock returns.13 During the retirement

phase, the average allocation of VILDA assets to bonds remains at around 60%. Households do,

however, make use of the investment flexibility within the VILDAs. Looking at the 5% and the

95% quantile of the bond share, there is substantial lifecycle variation: for instance at age 45

(50), between 0-64% (0-61%) of VILDA assets are held in bonds. This band narrows later in life,

but bond fractions in retirement still range from 45 to 67%.

Table 2 here

           Table 3 summarizes the impact of having access to VILDAs on household consumption.

Being able to insure against unexpected individual longevity risk reduces the need to build up

financial reserves for financing retirement. Accordingly, households which can access VILDAs

during their worklives are able to maintain higher consumption levels over their entire lifetimes.

Compared to households that lack access to VILDAs, the rise in mean consumption is small

early on, but it increases measurably during the worklife – from around 1.5% at age 20, to over

5% in the late 50s and 60s. Subject to household survival, VILDAs prove to be of particular

value late in life. Households that do not buy longevity insurance tend to deplete their financial

assets, but VILDA purchasers continue to receive annuity payments. Consequently, the gap in

consumption opportunities increases even further toward the end of the lifecycle, on average

amounting to over 16% at age 80 and to more than 19% at age 100. These enhanced

consumption opportunities are rather stable over the whole distribution of possible consumption

outcomes, in that the 5:95% consumption quantiles are comparable in magnitude to the average

consumption increments.

4.3 The Impact of Systematic Mortality Risk on Household Behavior

       In this section, we examine the lifecycle implications of including VILDAs in the

household portfolio including systematic mortality table risk. We discuss the implications of

introducing either of the two previously-discussed VILDA types (with and without participation)

on households’ optimal profiles of consumption, annuitization, and asset allocation within

VILDA annuities, assuming the stochastic evolution process for mortality developed above. In

each case, we again present the expected as well as the 5:95% quantiles of the simulated

distributions.

       The pattern of variable annuity purchases and payouts at various ages is summarized in

Table 4. An average investor with access to participating VILDAs will begin buying these in his

late 30s; at age 40, periodic annuity purchases amount to 10% of his first-year’s labor income.

Purchases continue to rise to around 55% of initial labor income over the next period, and then

they remain almost constant over the following two decades. Only at age 67, the end of the

deferral period, will the investor boost investments to 1.2 times initial labor income (as this is the

last opportunity to purchase additional VILDAs). Average initial benefits amount to about 1.7

times first-year labor income. As expected investment returns slightly exceed the           , VILDA

benefits slowly increase to 1.96 (2.2) times initial labor income by age 80 (100).

Table 4 here

       If consumers are only able to purchase non-participating VILDAs calculated based on the

quantile pricing approach, they will postpone annuitization by an average of approximately 5

years. They begin buying the non-participating VILDAs in their early 40s, trading off relatively

higher prices resulting from the higher chance of being alive when benefits commence, versus

relatively lower prices due to lower exposure to systematic mortality risk. Wishing to make up
                                                                                               18


for delayed annuity purchases, investors in their late 40s must shift more financial assets into

nonparticipating annuities, compared to investors with access to participating VILDAs. Wishing

to make up for delayed annuity purchases, investors in their late 40’s must shift more financial

assets into annuities than would investors with access to participating VILDAs. At age 50 (60),

the average household invests a sum equivalent to around 89% (107%) of the first-year labor

income into new non-participating VILDA purchases, 60% (100%) more than consumers buying

participating VILDAs. Again, purchases peak at age 67 (1.39 times first-year labor income),

marking the last time investors can purchase additional VILDAs. Despite having spent

substantially more on new annuities over the last two decades of their working lives, the average

household’s initial non-participating VILDA benefits worth 1.6 times first-year labor income fall

short of those holding participating VILDAs, by almost 10%. This difference persists to the end

of the lifecycle.

        Participating VILDAs must, on average, outperform non-participating VILDAs due to the

lack of loading related to systematic mortality risks; nevertheless their lower price comes at the

cost of exposing annuitants to systematic mortality risk. As discussed in Section 3.2, this could

result in measurably lower VILDA benefits, especially later in the lifecycle. Hence, it is of

interest to see how the distributional tails of the benefit payments for both types of annuities

relate to each other. Panel B of Table 4 shows that participating VILDAs, despite exposing

annuitants to systematic mortality risk, provide benefits that exceed those of non-participating

annuities at the 5th as well as the 95th percentiles. Apparently, the lower price of participating

VILDAs allows households to buy enough additional longevity insurance to more than

compensate for possible benefit reductions caused by decreasing general mortality.
                                                                                               19


       The asset allocation patterns in Table 5 indicate that neither the introduction of

systematic mortality risks nor the specific VILDA design (participating vs. non-participating) has

a major impact on the distribution of VILDA funds over the alternative asset classes. Again,

average VILDA bond fractions increase toward the end of the worklife and remain stable during

retirement, while the bond share dispersion remains between 40-70% in retirement.

Table 5 here

       The welfare-enhancing effects of having access to VILDAs are represented in Table 6

where we summarize the consumption increases available to consumers in various scenarios.

Already by age 20, the household that purchases participating VILDAs are (on average) able to

afford about 1.3% more consumption, compared to their counterparts in a world without

VILDAs. This number rises to around 3.5% at age 40 and to over 4% by age 60. This can be

attributed to the lower need to build up (liquid) wealth to finance consumption at very high ages

when being insured against unexpected individual longevity. As in the last section without

systematic mortality risk, VILDAs prove to be particularly valuable for those who attain

advanced ages. Average consumption of households aged 80 that have VILDA income exceeds

consumption of equally aged households in a no-VILDA world by 12.5%, a number that

increases to above 25% for those who reach age 100. Again, we find these enhancements of

consumption opportunities to be rather stable over the whole distribution of possible

consumption outcomes.

Table 6 here

       Having access to non-participating VILDAs also enables households to afford higher

consumption over the whole lifecycle. As previously discussed, however, the substantial

loadings resulting from the VILDA provider’s need to self-insure against adverse systematic
                                                                                               20


mortality developments significantly drive up VILDA prices. While spending more of their

financial resources on VILDAs, households acquire lower benefits. This increases the need for

liquid wealth later in life. Both effects result in lower average excess consumption compared to

households with access to participating VILDAs. At age 20, average consumption is just less

than 1% above that of households in a world without VILDAs. At age 60, this difference only

comes to about 2.3% (and 18.4% at age 100); excess average consumption falls short by 7%

compared to households that own participating VILDAs. Looking at the tails, we again find

comparably stable rates of excess consumption over the whole distribution of consumption

outcomes.

       In our set-up, despite exposing individuals to systematic mortality risks, participating

VILDAs outperform non-participating VILDAs consumption-wise and hence should be

preferred by households seeking to maximize utility from consumption. This is undoubtedly

related to the substantial loadings that many providers charge in order to self-insure against the

systematic longevity risk in non-participating VILDAs. Against this background, it is of interest

to estimate the maximum premium that households would be willing to pay in order to be

relieved of systematic mortality risks. For various ages and wealth levels, these premiums are

presented in Table 7. To calculate these numbers, we solve for the loading charge in excess of

the actuarially fair price of a non-participating VILDA that equates the utility drawn from the

non-participating VILDA with the utility from a participating VILDA. Here we identify two

effects: break-even loadings are increasing in the household’s age, but decreasing in wealth. At

age 40, a household with wealth amounting to twice first-year labor income would be willing to

pay a premium of 1.52% on an actuarially fair (non-participating) VILDA price to insure against

systematic longevity risk. While systematic mortality risks are higher for younger households (as
                                                                                               21


per Section 3.2), they affect households financially only in the remote future. For this reason,

they are outweighed by more imminent financial risks including labor income shocks. As

retirement and deferral age near, the relative importance of systematic mortality risk increases

and so does the household’s willingness to pay for insurance. At age 65, for example, someone

with the same wealth level (twice first-year labor income) would pay a premium of 7.7%. With

increasing wealth, households are less dependent on VILDAs for financing consumption in

retirement and, hence, less willing to pay for stable VILDA payouts. Households with wealth of

five times first-year labor income at age 40 (65) would only accept a premium of 0.69% (4.79%)

over the actuarially fair (non-participating) VILDA price.

Table 7 here

       These results have an important implication for risk management by VILDA providers.

First, VILDAs are likely to be usefully targeted at younger households, since this group is most

likely to profit from the benefit of deferral. Second, this group may not be willing to pay for

insurance against systematic mortality risk. Unless insurers have access to inexpensive hedges

against systematic longevity risks, annuitants may be better off by bearing systematic mortality

risk themselves via participating VILDAs.



5. Conclusions

       This paper has discussed the key role of variable investment-linked deferred annuities

(VILDAs) in household portfolio and consumption choices over the lifecycle. Inasmuch as their

payments are deferred, VILDAs can be viewed as a privately-financed complement to

governmental social security schemes. Permitting investment choice within VILDAs gives

households greater flexibility to achieve their individually-optimal asset mixes, while permitting
                                                                                                 22


annuity providers to transfer investment risk back to the purchaser pool. Of special interest is the

performance of VILDAs under both deterministic and stochastic mortality processes, and we

explore two approaches to managing systematic mortality risks which do not rely on financial

markets or other hedging instruments. Consistent with what is empirically observed, some

annuity providers elect to self-insure their position by demanding higher than actuarially fair

premiums, while others can transfer systematic mortality risks to their buyers by adjusting

payouts as actual mortality developments unfold.

       Our results imply that households benefit from gaining access to VILDAs, as measured

by markedly higher consumption over the entire lifecycle. Moreover, households can use the

flexibility of VILDAs to invest significant portions of their annuity assets in equities. We also

show that the self-insurance approach to managing systematic mortality risks leads to substantial

annuity loadings that may exceed 30% for younger annuitants. Nevertheless, households are still

better off with than without VILDAs. Given the choice, however, many households will prefer to

participate in systematic mortality risk unless the insurer can hedge them at a significantly lower

price. Depending on their age and wealth, consumer reservation loadings on the actuarially fair

(non-participating) VILDA price vary between 0.5 and 8%. If financial markets are thin and do

not provide insurers with many hedging instruments in this price range, providers may seek to

concentrate on their core competence – pooling idiosyncratic longevity risk – and transfer

systematic mortality risk to annuitants.

Appendix

       When an annuity provider reacts to mortality changes by adjusting the benefits, we

assume that the pool will be fully funded at all times. Let us denote the number of individuals in

the pool that purchase a VILDA at time                    as   . Furthermore, let                       be the promised

number of fund units payable to each annuitant at time                     as of time , and        ,   the price (in fund

units) at time    of a VILDA that will pay an initial benefit of one fund unit at time                                  ,

subsequently falling according to the         . Then, the total number of fund units in the annuity

provider’s reserves is equal to

                                                      ,        .

       As the size of the pool and the annuity factor change, the annuity provider must change

promised benefits to keep the pool fully funded. Abstracting from additional annuity purchases

in the next period, we thus have the balance equation

                                          ,                                    ,           ,

                                                                               ,

which leads to the following evolution for the

                                                                           ,
                                                                                   .
                                                                       ,


During the payout phase               , we must account for current payments that reduce the fund

units stock by          . In this case, the balance equation takes the form

                                  ,               1                ,                           ,

                                                                   ,

and therefore

                                                                       ,           1

                                                                           ,
                                                                                                         24

Notes: The implied loading represents the additional premium relative to the average number of required FUs that
must be charged from US females for purchases at various ages to provide the VILDA at the specified confidence
level. VILDA payments commence at age 67 with one initial FU and decrease thereafter according to the AIR (3%).
Confidence levels are based on the distribution of required FUs calculated for each of 10,000,000 simulated
mortality paths using the Cairns et al. (2006) 2-factor stochastic mortality model fitted to US mortality tables from
1933-2007 (assumed maximum age is 120). Source: Authors’ calculations; see text.

Notes: Adjustment Factors representing the year-on-year changes in benefit claims/benefit payments from

Notes: Panel A: Money (as a multiple of initial labor income) invested in VILDAs at specified age. Panel B:
Benefits (as a multiple of initial labor income) paid by accumulated VILDAs at specified age. Non-participating
VILDA pays one initial FU at age 67 and decreasing thereafter according to the AIR (3%). Participating VILDA –
in expectation – pays one initial FU at age 67 and decreasing thereafter according to the AIR (3%). Actual benefits
vary with unexpected systematic mortality shocks. Stochastic mortality based on the Cairns et al. (2006) 2-factor

Notes: Excess consumption (in %) at specified age that household with access to VILDAs is able to afford compared
to household in non-VILDA world. Non-participating VILDA pays one initial FU at age 67 and decreasing
thereafter according to the AIR (3%). Participating VILDA – in expectation – pays one initial FU at age 67 and
decreasing thereafter according to the AIR (3%). Actual benefits vary with unexpected systematic mortality shocks.
