               The Federal Attack on Labor Market Discrimination:
                             The Mouse That Roared?


                                    ABSTRACT


     The purpose of this paper is to review available evidence on the impact
of federal equal employment opportunity programs. While Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 11246 have been in effect for
over 15 years, the lag in data collection and evaluation means that little
can be said regarding the last few years' experience. In particular, evi-
dence on the impact of recent administrative changes in the agencies re-
sponsible for enforcement is unavailable.
    In general, time series studies find   significant   improvements in the
relative labor market position of blacks compared with   whites since 1965.
While several arguments have been advanced that these    gains are illusory,
the most plausible interpretation is that much of the    apparent progress
is real.
     Cross—sectional studies of the impacts of the Office of Federal Contract
Compliance Programs (which enforces the nondiscrimination and affirmative
action requirements of the Executive Order) and the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (which enforces Title VII) have been much less
conclusive. Half of the major studies of the OFCCP find that the program
had the intended effects on the relative position of blacks —— or at least
black males. Unfortunately, variations in conclusions among studies are
not readily explained, even after a careful look at the competing data and
methods. Equally disturbing is the inability of studies producing positive
results to associate such impacts with the "levers" by which OFCCP might
exert influence. Studiesof EEOC impacts are more vulnerable to problems
of identifying the appropriate control group, since Title VII covers
contractor and noncontractor firms. Apart from evidence that relative
black employment grew considerably faster in firms which must report to
EEOC (firms with over 15 employees are subject to Title VII, but only those
with 100 or more must report to EEOC), available studies have not produced
consistent evidence of EEOC impact.
     Besides the lack of strong cross—sectional support for the time
series conclusions, three puzzles emerge: (1) What caused the decline in
black male labor force participation which began about the same time as the
federal antidiscrimination effort? (2) Why did black females advance more
rapidly than black males since the federal effort began? (3) Why did advantaged
blacks advance more rapidly than less advantaged blacks?

     While limited efforts were made earlier by state fair-employment com-

missions and federal executive orders, the major components of government

efforts to reduce labor market discrimination were created fifteen years ago.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination based on race,

sex, or national origin by private employers1 and created the Equal Employment

Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to investigate complaints. In 1972, the non-

discrimination provisions were extended to government employment, and the EEOC

was given the power to initiate suits on behalf of those injured by employment

discrimination. Executive Order 11246, issued in 1965, required that federal

contractors refrain from discrimination. The Office of Federal Contract

Compliance (OFCC, later Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs) was

created to oversee the compliance activities of federal agencies. Discrimination

on the basis of sex was not a part of the contract-compliance program until

1967, and affirmative action to eliminate sex discrimination was not required

until 1971.

     The definition of discrimination, the boundary between "non-discrimination"

and "affirmative action", and the limits of permissible affirmative action

have been sources of substantial public controversy. Apart from occasional

accounts of organization difficulties, the impact of EEOC and OFCC on discrim-

inatory employment practices has received less public discussion.

     The impact of the agencies charged with carrying out the federal equal

opportunity effort has, however, received a good deal of attention from

economists. Indeed, the literature has grown large enough to be the subject

of several reviews, usually in the form of extended prologues to the authors'

own work.




     1Unions and employment agencies were also covered. Firms with fewer

than 100 employees (later reduced to 25, and then 15) were not covered.

     This paper is not intended as a review of the reviews. It attempts to

provide a more detailed view of the literature than previous efforts, in

order to resolve or at least clarify some of the controversies. Where these

controversies remain unresolved and only slightly clarified, potential resolu-

tions are suggested. Finally, puzzles which are suggested by the literature,

but have received little direct attention, are noted.

     Postwar and post-1964 trends in relative earnings are discussed in

section 1. The records of EEOC and OFCC, viewed from an administrative or

procedural perspective, are considered in section 2. Time series evidence on

the effectiveness of the federal EEO effort is reviewed in section 3. Sections

4 and 5 are devoted to cross-section studies of OFCC and EEOC, respectively.

Concluding observations are presented in section 6.



l.   Postwar Trends in Black/White and Male/Female Earnings Ratios



     Median earnings of wage and salary workers have been published annually

by race (white-nonwhite2) and sex since 1947 by the Current Population Survey

(CPS). Accepting this widely studied series as a measure of labor market

status, the simplest way of summarizing the postwar and post-1964 trends in

relative position is to fit the equation



     (1)   ln (Ei t/E2t) = b0 +   b1t
                                        +
                                            b2t
                                                  +
                                                      e
where Et equals median earnings of race/sex group j in year t and t equals

max(t-l964,O). Thus b1 measures the postwar trend and b2 captures any

acceleration in the post-1964 period.




     2Because the vast majority of nonwhites are black, the two terms will be

used interchangeably.
                                 -3-

     Ordinary least squares estimates of b1 and b2 are presented in Table 1.

Relative to whites of the same sex, both black males and black females have

experienced increasing earnings, especially in the post-1964 period. By

1977, black male earnings were still considerably below those of white males,

while black and white females has essentially equal earnings. The white

female/white male comparison tells a different story: the positive post-1964

effect roguhly offsets the negative postwar trend, and females' earnings

are only one half of male earnings.3

     While the black female-white female comparison in line 2 is the most-often

encountered approach to measuring the relative earnings gains of black females,

it has been criticized as implicitly accepting white female earnings as the

"appropriate' base toward which black female earnings might be expected to

converge (Anderson and Wallace, 1975, p. 50). Line 4 presents the alternative

black female/white male comparison. As can be inferred from lines 2 and 3,

this comparison shows a smaller postwar trend, a larger post-1964 effect,

and much lower 1977 relative earnings for black females.

     Clearly, Table 1 can be read to emphasize either the considerable improvement

in the relative position of black males and females, or the substantial gap in

earnings between white males and other groups. Both emphases are relevant for

analyzing the impact of antidiscrimination programs.

     The evidence of post-1964 progress for blacks in Table 1 has been

challenged from a number of perspectives. Perhaps the most frequently cited

contrary evidence is the behavior of black/white family income ratios, which




     3Female hourly wages were only 67% of male wages in 1978 (unpublished CPS

tabulations).

 how smaller, less regular gains, especially in the 1970's (Brimmer, 1976,

 p. 5; Coleman, 1977, p. 6).     In part, this is due to the slower growth of

relative individual incomes than relative individual earnings (Smith and

Welch, 1979, p. 5). Moreover, the increases in single-parent families among

blacks and in two-earner families among whites have both lowered family

income ratios in the 1970's (Munnell, 1978, pp. 13-14). While relative family

incomes are a more appropriate focus in many contexts, they are clearly less

appropriate than relative individual earnings for studying relative labor

market position.

       A more subtle criticism of the evidence of improving black/white earnings

ratios is Lazear's (1979a) challenge to the use of wages (or earnings) to

measure the returns from working. In addition to earnings, workers' investments

in human capital are part of the compensation from working, and differences in

such investments would show up in later earnings differentials. Lazear estimates

the value of this investment per hour worked from wage growth, and this is

added to the observed wage to obtain an estimate of the true wage (i.e., true

wage     observed wage +   value of human capital acquired). He finds a large
increase in the black-white (male) disparity in the human capital component

(from $.55 to $2.70 per hour) between 1966 and 1974 (Lazear 1979a) but a large

reduction (virtually and elimination) of the (white) male-female human capital

disparity (Lazear, 1979b). This would suggest that trends in observed wage

ratios greatly overstate black male progress and greatly understate while

female progress.

    Lazear's   theoretical point -- that   one would   want to investigate the
consequences of present jobs    for future wages, as well as current wages, in

evaluating   the relative position   of minorities and women --   is an important
                                        -6-

one. Moreover, even if one doubts that the impact of experience on earnings

is due to 'skill" accumulation, Lazer's point remains. However, his evidence

that the narrowing of black/white wage differentials is "illusory" is not

convincing. Statistically, one could not reject the. hypothesis that the

difference in human capital investments (between black and white males, or

white males and females) had remained constant at any reasonable level of

significance.4

        Even granting Lazear's contention that, when correctly measured, relative

wages of black men have not increased -- because the relative impact of current

experience on future wages is declining --          it does not follow that the
improvement in their relative labor market position is "illusory." The reason

is that what is relevant in Lazear's wage re-calculation is "that wage growth

which occurs as a result of job experience per se ... Residual wage growth

that occurs as one 'ages' even in the absence of job experience, is not part

of work compensation and as such should not be counted .           .." However,   in

judging the relative labor market position of blacks, the "residual" wage

growth may be quite important, especially if this residual growth is changing

to blacks' relative advantage -- which is what one observes in Lazear's

equations.5 Consequently, further evidence on the behavior of relative black

earnings as individual cohorts age would be important.




        4me black—white difference is $.55 (St. error = .67) in 1968 and $2.70

(2.28) in 1974, so the change in this difference corrected for inflation is

.55 -    (.67)   2.70 =   -1.26   with a standard error of 1.41.   For white males and

females, the analogous figure is 1.98, with a standard error of 1.45.


        5Blacks' "passage of time" effect was 2.8 percent per year larger than whites'
in his 1966-69 equation, compared with 7.6 percent per year in 1972—74.
                                   —7—

     Available evidence does not suggest an erosion of black gains as cohorts

age. Smith and Welch (1979, P. 52) present weekly wage ratios (predicted

from equations utilizing 1967-74 CPS data) which allow one to follow various

male cohorts, defined according to years of schooling and 1967 experience,6

over the 1967-74 period. Relative black earnings rise in all experience --

education   cohorts (except the schooling = 8 years group) from 1967-72, but

are lower for all but the schooling = 16 years group in 1974 than in 1967

(presumably, a reflection of cyclical effects). Smith and Welch conclude

that black relative earnings do not seem to fall as individual cohorts grow

older (p. 53). Raisian and Donovan (1980) report that, among male household

heads, relative wages increased for those with up to five years' experience,

and remained roughly constant for others, after controlling for cyclical

factors.

     A third challenge to the evidence of improving relative black earnings

is Butler and Heckman's (1977) observation that published median earnings

rise when low earners withdraw from the labor market, because published medians

(and means) relate to those with earnings. Regressing black-white worker!

population ratios in each year on the postwar and post-1964 time trends

reveals a declining post-1964 trend for males (due to black male declines)

and females (due to white female increases and black female declines). If

the "marginal' participants in each group are low earners, one would expect

a rise in relative median earnings ratios for both males and females,

even if the distribution of offered wages or earnings in each group were

unchanged. Attempts to assess the magnitude of this effect, by "replacing"




    6The groups were: schooling = 16, 12, and 8 years; 1967 experience =       1,   5,

10, 15 years.
                               -8-

labor market dropouts in the lower tail of the distribution and estimating

'corrected" median suggest that the Butler-Heckman argument could explain part

of the post-1964 trend (Levy, 1981).

     A very different "correction" suggested by Darity and Myers (1980) leads

to very different conclusions. They calculated average earnings in the con-

ventional way (i.e., for those with earnings), and then by dividing total

earnings by total labor-force age populations. Over the 1968-78 period,

ratios of conventional means show substantial upward trends for both males

and females, but the corrected means show no trend for males and a greatly

reduced trend for females. This approach would be appropriate if it were known

that declining black participation was due to inability to find work at

prevailing wages (see Vroman, 1975, p. 297); the zeros which they assigns to

nonearners would then reflect the "offered" wage. While much too little is

known about the decline in relative black participation, inability to find

work does not appear to be the major reason for not participating in the

labor market at all during the year.7   Inability to find work undoubtedly

contributes significantly to part-year employment, but part-year employment

is reflected in the official, uncorrected series.




     lO.3 percent of nonwhite men who did not work in 1978 looked for work

during that year, and only 5.9 percent reported inability to find work was the major

reason for not working. For nonwhite females, the corresponding proportions

were 9.5 and 6.2 percent.

2.   Procedural Ana]yses


     If the post-1964 improvements in relative black earnings suggest that

federal equal opportunity programs were effective, analyses of the scale and

effectiveness of the agencies charged with enforcing federal regulations seems

to point in the opposite direction. Based on "procedural" analyses (which

adopt an administrative perspective) Butler and Heckman (1977, p. 247) conclude

that "first-hand observations suggest that the EEOC is unlikely to have had a

major impact" and that similar observations "foster suspicion of [OFCC's]

contribution to eliminating measured black/white wage differentials."

     Both EEOC and OFCC were hampered by lack of personnel , and by ques-

tionable allocation of available resources. In fiscal year 1973, for example,

EEOC received charges of discrimination from nearly 50,000 individuals, and

had an authorized professional staff of 1293. Actual staff levels were con-

siderably lower (U.S. Civil Rights Commission, 1975, pp. 496, 499, and 512).

These professionals must investigate complaints andattempt conciliation when

there is reasonable cause to believe the charge is true, before the litigation

stage is reached. Not surprisingly the "backlog" of charges grew steadily,

reaching 130,000 in 1977 (U.S. Civil Rights Commission, 1977, p. 211).

Meanwhile, OFCC faced similar resource limitations --   less   than one contractor

in five was the subject of a compliance review in the three-year period

1970-1972 (Goldstein and Smith, 1976, p. 524).

     The allocation of the resources of both agencies has been subjected to

frequent criticism. For EEOC, the recurring question has involved the

relative emphasis given to large- vs. small-payoff complaints. In general,

EEOC has been criticized for devoting too many resources to individual com-

plaints which are unlikely to have large impacts, and too few resources to
                               - 10   -




attacking   "systemmic discrimination (e.g., Bergmann, 1976, p. 133). Mean-

while, OFCC's activities received vastly differing levels of support in

different federal agencies, so that (unless gains per compliance review differed

greatly across agencies) the total of compliance personnel were allocated

inefficiently.8 Moreover, review-per-month standards sometimes encouraged

compliance personnel to focus on small contractors, which required less time

per review, in order to meet the standard (Ahart, 1976, p. 570).

     The ua1ity of EEOC and OFCC enforcement activities --   e.g.,   investigations

of complaints and conciliation efforts, and the adequacy of negotiated settlements

by EEOC, and the adequacy of     pre-award compliance reviews and approved

affirmative action plans by OFCC -- have also been challenged (U.S. Civil

Rights Commission, 1975; Wolkinson, 1973, pp. 59-97; U.S. Comptroller General,

1976; Ahart, 1976).

     The analysis of the penalties for those found not in compliance is more

complicated. EEOC does not have the power to fine a firm which discriminates,

or issue a legally binding order that it cease discriminatory policies. Indeed,

before 1972 it could not file lawsuits to enforce Title VII, though it could

refer cases to the Justice Department or file briefs as "friend of the court."

From 1972 to 1976, it filed roughly 15 suits per month (U.S. Civil Rights

Commission, 1977, p. 200), a relatively small number compared with the number

of charges which are not successfuly resolved by conciliation (U.S. Comptroller

General, 1976, pp. 30-31). Those who believe they have been discriminated



     91n fiscal year 1973, NASA, EPA, and the Department of Commerce reviewed

at least half of their contractors, while the Departments of Treasury and

Agriculture reviewed only 2% of their contractors (U.S. Civil Rights Commission,

 1975, p. 292).
                                    — 11   —



against    may file suit on their own behalf, sometimes with the assistance of

public advocacy groups, if EEOC chooses not to do so,

        OFCC's   ultimate enforcement power is "debarment" -- excluding     the firm

from government contract eligibility. However, this power was           very rarely

used.     No contractors were debarred from 1965 to 1970, and       an average   of about
two per year wasmaintained in 1971-77 (U.S. Civil Rights Commission, 1975,—

p. 298 and 1977, p. 139).

        Consequently, the penalties for noncomplicance consist primarily of

back pay awards and other remedial actions under pre-litigation agreements

and "consent decrees" negotiated by EEOC and OFCC with the firms in question,

and some court-awarded payments. Surprisingly, there appears to be no

published tabulation of back pay wards and workers affected. A very rough

guess for 1977 would be that EEOC litigation led to settlements of perhaps

$65 million in back pay and other immediate relief,9 plus an unspecified

gain from future consequences of these settlements, which is probably con-

siderable.



        9This rough guess is based on these statistics (from U.S. Civil Rights

Commission, 1977, pp. 204-209); (1)            In 1977, "section 706" litigation produced

$13 million in back pay and other specific relief; (2) "section 707" litigation

has produced $4.8 million in 8 settlements with 45 other cases pending settlement

negotiations, but these totals do not relate to 1977 alone, (3) litigation of

individual complaints had produced more than $100 million through January 1,

1977, and 70% of these settlements had been achieved in the preceeding 18 months.
                                  — 12 —


     Whether such sums -- or the more widely publicized settlements with AT&T

and major steel companies -- have a substantial deterent effect is hard to

assess. Often, the sums involved are simultaneously "large" and "small". The

steel settlement, for example, provided for $31 million in back pay. However,

the maximum payment was $1000 per worker (U.S. Civil Rights Commission, 1975,

pp. 556-7). Thus, a full-time worker adversely affected by company policies

for the entire 9-year period (1965 to settlement in 1974) would receive less

than $120 per year, or less than 6 per hour (before discounting). This is

less than any plausible estimate of the harm suffered.'° Back pay awards

which seem "large" in total dollars may be quite small when compared with the

number of workers and worker-hours involved.

     On the other hand, the firm's gain from discriminating (it any) may

be considerable less than the wages lost by the victims of discrimination.

Thus, even back pay awards which inadequately compensate victims may appreciably




     10lchniowski reports that, in 1973, the seniority-adjusted minority!

non—minority earnings ratio was 0.92. If we take this as a rough indication

of discrimination, weekly wage loss due to discrimination would be 18.40

per week (8 percentof average weekly earnings of $230)or over $950 per year.

An alternative perspective is that the $660 average payment would reflect

only 8 months discriminatory wage loss.


     11The firm's gain from discriminating is likely to take the form of "saving"

the resources necessary to monitor and enforce nondiscriminatory behavior

by its employees and the wage premia which might be required to secure

cooperative white workers. This "gain" must be reduced by any increases in

alter   the firm's incentives for non-discriminatory behavior. An additional

consideration is that potential back-pay awards cumulate, and EEOC's

"batting average" in court in cases it does choose to litigate is impressive'2

--   so that a firm which 'stonewails' a charge of discriminatory hiring and

promotion does so at some risk. Finally, as King and Marshall (1974; p. 470)

have argued, the Civil Rights Act may "[make] it possible for employers who

have economic motives for doing so to hire blacks and shift the blame for doing

so to "legal requirements," whether or not there is a serious threat of losses

from prosecution under the law.

       Thus, a review of the procedural analyses leave one v'ith the clear

impression that the federal enforcement effort could have been larger and

more    efficient. But the conclusion that the effort was so inept that it
could not have had an appreciable effect on earnings ratios seems to strong.
This    seems particularly true of EEOC, where the fear that "sooner or later,

we're gonna get you" would tend to counteract the low probability of enforcement

action against the firm in any one year.

        Nothing has been said thus far about the more recent reorganization of

the federal antidiscrimination effort. EEOC has adopted an expedited procedure

for dealing with individuals complaints, in order to reduce the complaint

backlog and to devote more attention to systemic discrimination. The contract

pp. 24-31. More recent evidence of litigation showed that "favorable settle-

ments" out numbered cases "dismissed .. no appeal" by a 3-to-i ratio (U.S.

Comptroller General, 1976, p. 31).

compliance program has also been reorganized, with more centralized authority.
Early indications are that these efforts have been successful,

The EEOC charge backlog has been greatly reduced,'3 and allocation of

compliance resources has been significantly improved. Moreover, back pay

awards per worker seem to have grown considerably.

     The neglect of these activities does not reflect a judgement that they

are unimportant, or predestined to fail. Rather, they are too recent to show

up in the trends discussed in section 1, or in the studies discussed in the next

three sections. In evaluating these studies, the difficulties of the enforcing

agencies must be kept in mind.



3    Time Series Analyses



     Time-series analyses of the impact of federal EEO activities seek to

determine whether the post-1964 improvement in relative black earnings can be

explained by other factors (which can be measured with annual data over the

postwar period). Implicitly, the 'survival" of the post—1964 trend as

additional control variables are added is taken as favoring the causal role of

EEO activities in improving relative earnings.

    The most influential time-series studies were those of Freeman (1973;

1977, Chapter 5) and Vroman (1974, 1975). Using 1947-71 data, Freeman

controlled for business—cycle influences by including the proportional deviation




     133y early 1981, the back log had been reduced to 32,000 cases, and the

resolution period for new cases was under four months (Washington Post,

February 20, 1981).
                                   — 15 —


of   real GNP from its trend as an independent variable. The statistically

significant post-1964 trends were one and two percentage points (i.e., two

and four per cent), per year for males and females, respectively.14 Adding

a measure of relative education --    to   control for the improvement in black

educational attainment which was seen by others as a major contributor to

improving relative earnings15 --    left   the estimated post-1964 trends almost

unaffected.16

      An updated version of Freeman's equations appears in Table 2. Despite

the considerable change in sample period (1950-1977), the post-1964 trend

estimates are quite close to Freeman's estimates.

      Freeman also tested the sensitivity of his results to alternative

measures of relative labor-market position. Replacing relative median wage

and salary earnings with relative mean income or relative occupational

position, or restricing the sample to year—around full-time workers produced

similar, though smaller, estimates.




      '4Freeman's actual equations used cumulated real per capita EEOC expenditures

rather than a simple post-1964 trend. The estimates in the text are based on

Freeman (1977, p. 130).

      15Freeman agrees that improving education has contributed to rising black

earnings, but places greater emphasis on education as a response to improved

opportunities.

      16These trends are statistically significant. A typographical error

created the erroneous impression that the male post-1964 coefficient was less

than its standard error.

     In   a subsequent paper, Freeman (l978b, pp. 39-41) argued that attributing

these gains to federal equal-opportunity pressures is reasonable in light of

evidence that firms have changed their personnel practices in response to such

pressures. Citing a Bureau of National Affairs (1976) study, he notes that

86 percent of surveyed firms have formal EEO programs, that 60 percent had

changed their selection procedures for EEO reasons, and one third include

EEO achievements in managers' performance appraisals. (There is a half

full, half empty --   or   more accurately, a two thirds empty --   issue here; two

thirds of the firms did not provide this incentive.)

     Vroman (1974) reported similar results - post-1964 trends of 1.8

and 3.7 percentage points for males and females, respectively -- from his

analysis of CPS earnings ratios which included postwar trend and cyclical

variables as controls. Analysis of Social Security earnings data produced

similar estimates for females, but (statistically insignificant) estimates of

0.5 percentage points for males. No explanation for this difference was

suggested. When changing age distributions were held constant (by using a

fixed-age—weighted dependent variable, rather than adding relative age as a

right-hand side variable) the male post-1964 trend rose to 1.2 percentage

points. This suggests that not controlling for changing age distributions

may have biased his (and Freeman's) estimates of post-1965 male trend from

CPS data.

     Vroman reported results of several further experiments. First, he

used the Social Security data to estimate separate equations for Northern

and Southern regions. Post-1964 gains in relative earnings were larger in

the South for females, and nearly absent outside the South for males (Vroman,
                                 - 18   -



 1974, pp. 183_186).17 Second, Vroman (1975, PP. 298-300) introduced (mean)

 education and a simple industrial composition variable (instead of postwar

 trend and cycle) as controls. Estimates of post-1964 trend'8 were essentially

 the same as those in the earlier paper. Third, Vroman noted falling employ-

ment-and labor force-population ratios for black males,19 and raised the

sample truncation problem emphasized by Butler-Heckman. However, this appeared

base on then-available data to be a post-war rather than post-1964 phenomenon

(Vroman, 1975, pp. 297-298). Fourth, Ginsberg and Vroman (1976) used pooled

time series -   cross section Social Security earnings data to estimate models

with a richer set of controls (education, industry mix, region, and black

share of employment). They found relative black earnings had increased

approximately 1.3 percent (or about .7 percentage points) per year2° in the

post-1964 period. While larger gains were found in the South, statistically

significant gains outside the South of about 1 percent per year were reported.




     17Vroman's finding of a post-1965 acceleration for males in the South

contradicts Knapp and Marshall l   (1974, pp. 464-465) finding of no acceleration,
based on 1959-65 and 1965-69 comparisons for craftsmen in husband-wife families.

     '8For males; female equations were not reported.


     19These ratios fell for both black and white males, but fell more rapidly

for blacks.


     20The percentage point figure is based on a 1964 earnings ratio of .528,

taken from Vroman, 1974, p. 186. Strictly speaking, this value applies to the

whole U.S. rather than the Gingberg-Vroman sample.
                               - 19   -



     Freeman's (and, with more qualifications, Vroman's) finding of accelerated

post-1964 progress in relative earnings has been challenged in three different

ways. First, the post-1964 acceleration was attributed to the unusually tight

labor markets21 of 1965-69, due to the Vietnam war (e.g., discussion following

Freeman, 1973; Flanagan, 1976, pp. 494-495). This objection no longer seems

tenable. As Freeman (1973, p. 128) noted in response to his critics, "The

experiment that tests my interpretation ... versus the cyclical explanation

will come in the next recession." Relative earnings continued to rise in (the

sharp recession) 1974-75. Thus, as Table 2 demonstrates, the post-1964 trend

did not depend on limiting the post-1964 observations to the tight labor

markets of 1965-71 (see also Butler and Heckman, 1977, p. 255).

     A second objection focuses on regional patterns in relative black

improvement. Butler-Heckman (1977, p. 256) argue that relative incomes22

show no post-1964 trend for Northeast or West, and only a "weak" effect

(for males) in the North Central region. Thus, like Vroman, they find that

the post-1964 effect is confined to the South. While greater progress in

the South would be expected, given Federal enforcement patterns, the absence

of effects outside the South is troubling.23 Moreover, they find that relative

incomes began a regular trend increase in the South in the late 1950's --   long
before federal EEO pressures became operative.




     21The unusually is important -- one must argue that there is something about

these tight labor markets not captured by the included cyclical variables.


           wage and salary            series by region are not published.

            is particularly true in light of the Supreme Court's holding that

employment selection policies which are apparently neutral but operate to

     More recent Social Security data suggest different conclusions. A

comparison of recently published 1974 earnings data with previously published

1969 data shows increases relative earnings for both regions4



     Region                Male Relative Earnings       Female Relative Earnings

                      1969                   1974         1969                1974

     U.S.              .587                  .624         .804                .882
     South             .540                  .579         .709                .806
     Non-South         .630                  .666         .882                .955

While these are simple averages rather than regression-standardized means, the

fact that unemployment rates were higher in 1974 than 1969 at least suggests that

these gains do not reflect cyclical factors.

     A final challenge to the time series evidence is Butler-Heckman's (1977)

argument that rising relative earnings reflect reductions in relative supply,

due to expansion of transfer programs and perhaps other factors rather than

increasing relative demand. Actually, the Butler-Heckman position involves

two related but separate effects. First, reductions in relative supplies

raise the ratio of offered wages or earnings. Second, changes in relative



the disadvantage of minorities (e.g., educational requirements) are illegal

unless they can be shown to be job related. Whatever the geographic incidence

of "explicit" discrimination, the broader notion of discrimination surely had

nationwide implications.

     24The data are for whites and nowhites, from U.S. Social Security

Administration (1975 and 1980).

supply are likely to be concentrated among low earners; witftdrawl of low
earners raises published earnings ratios because these are based on those

with earnings (a 'censoring' effect) •25

    The empirical importance of these observations has been the subject of

a series of papers by Butler-Heckman (1977, 1978) and Freeman (1978a, 1978b).

Thus far, four conclusions appear to be warranted. First, black labor force

participation rates have declined relative to white rates in the postwar,

and especially the post-1964 period; black male rates falling faster than

while males', and black female rates not increasing as rapidly as while

females'. If the marginal participants are drawn from the lower tail of the

earnings distributions, the truncation effect would work to produce post-1964

trends similar to those observed. Second, black population shares have

increased to almost exactly offset declining relative participation. Black!

white labor force and employment ratios have changed very little, casting

doubt on the notion that backward shifts in the relative suuply curve

ar responsible for observed trends. Third, separating anti-discrimination

(demand-curve), supply-curve, and truncation effects places extreme demands

on time series data, due to collinearity among the variables and the shortage




     2ctually, the published median wage and salary earnings series are

based on those with positive wage and salary earnings and are employed as

wage and salary workers in March at the following year.   The latter restriction

is the more important one (Brown, 1981).
                                  - 22   -



of   "strong' variables affecting only relative supplies to serve as instruments.26

Fourth, if truncation effects are estimated "independently11 from earnings

distributions, they are found to explain part of the post-1964 trend for

relative earnings -- up to half for males, and 20-50 percent for females

(Brown, 1981).




      26The transfer payment variables suggested by Butler-Heckman do not do

very well on this score    (Brown, 1981). Smith andWelch (1979, p. 23) note

that "the increase (in fraction of men receiving either welfare or unemployment

benefits) appears as large among whites as that observed for blacks" over the

1967—74 period they studied. This contradicts the 3utler-Heckman premise

that an increase in those programs would disproportionately affect blacks.

 4.     Cross-Sectional Studies of OFCC Impact


        Attempts to estimate the impact of Executive Order 11246 on the rela-

 tive labor market position of minorities and women have generally relied on

comparisons between firms or establishments which are government contractors

and others which are not contractors. The basic source of data is the "EEO-l"

file (which contains reports made by firms with government contracts and non-

contractors with 100 or more employees), augmented by information on whether

the firm is a contractor. The EEO-l form allows one to determine the number

of workers in each of nine broad occupational categories by race and sex, but

wages rates paid by race and sex are not available. Consequently, studies

using these data typically use measures of relative employment and earnings—

weighted27 occupational distributions as dependent variables. The latter in-

dex may understate minority gains by failing to reflect within-category ad-

vances (Goldstein-Smith, 1976, p. 525), or overstate them if promotions to a

new category tend to be concentrated in its lower rungs. (The EEO-l report-

ing format would seem to encourage the latter).

       Four studies have used the EEO-1 file to estimate the impact of OFCC on

the relative position of minorities (Burman, 1973; Ashenfelter-Heckman, 1976;

Goldstein-Smith, 1976; Heckman-Wolpin, 197728). Because OFCC concern about

sex discrimination was minimal in the periods studies in these papers, the

emphasis has been on race rather than sex comparisons.




      27The earnings weights are taken from other sources.

             is an expanded version of Heckman-Wolpin (1976).
                                      - 24   -




      Each paper attempts to estimate the impact of OFCC activities from the

partial-adjustment model:


        =        +        +   +
            cX       Gt
where Y is an index of the relative position of minorities,29 G is a dummy

variable for government contractors.3° X represents other variables, e is a

disturbance, and t indexes the year. The unit of observation, however, is

the establishment, and t is the same for all observations. The short-run

(one period) effect of G is ,     while   the long-run effect (if the establish-

ment were to remain a contractor indefinitely) is /(l--').

     Short-run and long-run effects of OFCC on relative employment and oc-

cupational position are presented in Table 3. All except Goldstein-Smith

find substantial effects on relative black male employment. Results for

black female relative employment are quite varied. Except for Burman, none

of the studies finds a substantial effect on relative occupational position.

     Burman, Ashenfelter-}-Ieckman, and Goldstein-Smith used similar estimation

strategies, so the differences among them do not have obvious explanations.

Indeed, Goldstein-Smith replicated the Ashenfelter-Heckman equations with

their own (1970-72) data and report small negative gains for male relative

employment using their specification.




     29Some studies use multiple-equation specifications, one equation for

each race-sex group, but this complication is largely notational:        becomes

a vector, and y a matrix (lagged Y's of all groups are included on the right-

hand of each equation).


     30Goldstein-Smith use Gti, but indicate that using Gt produced very sim-

ilar results.

     Goldstein-Smith   suggested two possible explanations for their smaller

estimated impacts. First, their sample period (1970-72) was a time of higher

unemployment than the late-sixties periods studied by Burman and Ashenfelter-

Heckman. Second, the effect of OFCC may have declined as contractors learned

how to "show 'good-faith efforts' without really making significant changes in

their personnel policies" (1976, p. 542).

     While relative employment of blacks is known to be higher in tight labor

markets than in periods of high unemployment, it does not follow that the

effect of OFCC policies must be appreciably smaller in loose labor markets.

Even in loose labor markets, new hires provide leeway for appreciable changes

in work force composition.     In manufacturing, new hires per 100 workers per

month averaged 2.9 in 1970-72, compared with 3.8 in 1966-69. Moreover, OFCC

regulations govern layoffs as well as new hires. In any case, whether

expanding establishments provide appreciably more leeway for OFCC influence

can be tested by interacting the government—contract dumy with employment

growth. The only study to do so found no support for this hypothesis (Heck-

man-Wolpin, 1977, Table 2, p. 87).31 Thus, the looser labor markets in the

period studied by Goldstein-Smith do not provide a wholly satisfactory ex-

planation for their results.

    The alternative explanation --      that   the OFCC impact declined for reasons

unrelated to the labor market --   is   difficult to verify or disprove directly.

Rather, it becomes the most plausible conclusion onece other explanations are




     31While employment expansion (among non-contractors) increased employment

shares of all other groups at the expense of white males, the interaction of

employment growth and contractor status favored white males.

discarded.      Unfortunately, even if we accept this view, its implications

are unclear. The declining OFCC impact could reflect relatively permanent

factors (contractors learning how to beat the system) or temporary, re-

versible considerations (declining urgency of enforcement efforts, or con-

tractors' realization that probabilities of sanctions are very small).

        Another possible explanation lies in differences in the treatment of

establishments which do not have government contracts, but are part of firms

which do. Though legally bound by the same rules as establishments actually

performing the government-paid work, these establishments were often reported

as noncontractors. Ashenfelter-Heckman (1976, p. 63) found that 28 percent

of all government       contractors were reported as noncontractors. They used
the    data as originally reported. Goldstein-Smith, however, treat all

establishments of contractor firms as "contractors." It seems reasonable to

assume that these "hard to classify" establishments experience some OFCC

impacts but less than "unambiguous" contractors. While this might lead to

lower estimated impacts by following Goldstein-Smith's approach, it would

explain only a fraction32 of the difference in results.33

     In general, estimated impacts on relative occupational position are quite

small. However, the finding that relative employment grows faster in contractor

establishments might lead one to anticipate a decline in relative occupational

position, since new entrants to the firm might be expected to start in the

lower occupational groups. From this perspective, the rough constancy of

relative occupational position would be interpreted as evidence of a positive

effect of OFCC on this index as well. (Lacking an estimate of how much a given

change in relative employment would affect relative occupational position,

there is no way to determine whether this 'positive OFCC impact" is quanti-

tatively important.) None of the studies "control for" changes in relative

employment in assessing OFCC impacts on occupational position.

     Heckman-Wolpin (1977) give more careful consideration to the econometric

problems of estimating the stock-adjustment model used in earlier papers.

In particular, they note that if e is serially correlated, et and t-l will

be correlated, and estimates of     and y will be biased. If the serial

correlation is positive, y will be over-estimated (so that the speed of

adjustment is underestimated) and      (the short-run OFCC impact) will be




as a function P1, P2, and R.    If P1 =   .5 and P2 = .14 (Ashenfelter-Heckman's
proportions) and 0 < R <   1, then the G-S estimate would be between 0.77 and
1.53 times the A-H estimate. Clearly, other factors are at work.


     33Butler-Heckman (1977, p. 204, n. 18) suggest that the small estimated

impact of being a contractor in Goldstein-Smith's paper is due to their in-

clusion of a compliance-review variable. However, the "impacts" in Table 3

reflect both variables (see note b).

underestimated.34     CThe sign of the bias in estimating the long run effect

/(l_y) is indeterminate a priori). A further problem arises if previous

minority hiring           is rewarded with contracts (Gt=l). If the latter

relationship is in fact positive (and serial correlation is positive), Gt and

et are positively related, and      is overestimated on this account. However,

if et =
           Pet_i + V., we can p-th difference the stock-adjustment equation to
obtain

which can be estimated straightforwardly.         Heckman-Wolpin estimate this

differenced form using data for establishments in the Chicago metropolitan

area.

long as Vt and the disturbance in the equation determining Gt are contemporaneously

uncorrelated. For a critical discussion of this aspect of the model, See Cain (1976,

p. 575). It is unclear why Heckman-Wolpin use instruments for Vt—i and

         since both are uncorrelated with V if the recursive model for Y and G

is correct. (If the recursive structure is relaxed, instruments for G would be

needed.)

     Their   estimate of p is quite large (.90), suggesting that the dangers

of ignoring serial correlation are real, and their estimates of y indicate

rapid adjustment. Their estimates of short-run 0FCC impacts are larger for

black males, relative to white males, than those in earlier papers, but are

smaller (indeed negative) for black females. Since firms hiring larger

proportions of black females are not rewarded with government contracts (Fleck-

man-Wolpin, 1977, p. 94), there was no reason to expect their method of

estimation to produce smaller gains for black females.

     Unfortunately, Heckmari-Wolgin did not present comparable estimates based

on their data but the estimation strategy of the earlier papers. Consequently,

it is not clear whether the differences between their estimates and those 0-F

the other studies in Table 3 reflect their treatment of serial correlation or

other differences (Ashenfelter, 1976, p. 579). Four such differences are

relevant.

     First, after finding residual variances were inversely related to total

employment, Heckman-Wolpin weighted by employment. None of the other studies

did so. If OFCC activities are more effective in larger firms, such weight-

ing would tend to increase the "contractor" effect. Adams (1973, p. 348)

reports (non-statistical) evidence of greater EEOC impact in larger firms; sim-

ilar differences in OFCC impacts are thus plausible (but conjectural).

     Second, only Heckman-Wolpin include dummy variables for (one-digit) in-

dustries among the control variables. Government contracts are concentrated

in industries with low levels of minority employment (Ashenfelter, 1976, p.

578) but it is not clear whether contractors are concentrated in industries

whose minority employment shares would otherwise have grown more slowly (or

more rapidly).
                                      - 30   -




     Third,   the Heckman-Wolpin sample was limited to the Chicago area. This

focus on a single labor market could remove a potential bias in the other studies'

estimates, if areas with disproportionate contract representation are usually

rich (or poor) in some unmeasured factors which determine minority employment

growth (Flanagan, 1976, pp. 499 -       500).    It is not clear, however, whether

this would be expected to lead to higher or lower estimates of OFCC effects.

Moreover, it is also possible that OFCC efforts are more (or less) effective

in Chicago than elsewhere.

     I\ final potential difference is the period studied -- 1972 — 73.         Heck-

man-Wolpin do not estimate their equations for earlier years, but they do

provide sample mean employment proportions for contractors and nonconctractors

for 1970 — 73.    This means that we can compare contractor-noncontractor

differences in relative minority employment growth for 1970 - 72 (Goldstein-

Smith's sample period) with those for 1972 - 73.         While such differences are a

very crude indicator of OFCC impact,36 the results of the comparison are

striking. The contractor-noncontractor differences in percent change in

relative employment were:

                   BM/WM      -1.2% (1970-72) vs.          7.0% (1972-73)

                   BF/WF      4.9%                 vs.    -9.1%

                   WF/WM      -6.0%                vs.     3.1%

These differences suggest that year to year fluctuations in contractor—non-

contractor relative employment are substantial. Moreover, they show more




              only are such comparisons not corrected for differences in other

variables, but the contractors in adjoining years are not (excactly) the same firms.
                                     — 31   -



 positive    effects for black/white males in 1972 - 73 than in 1970 —   72, and
the reverse for black/white females. Since this is the same pattern which

 is observed in the more careful estimates for 1970 - 72 (Goldstein-Smith)

and 1972 —    73 (Heckman-Wolpin), there are at least hints that "year" influ-

ences are a factor in explaining the differing results. The white female!

white male results do not fit this pattern, however.

     While considerable effort and ingenuity have been devoted to estimating

"the" difference between contractors and noncontractors in improving minority

labor-market status, this difference need not reflect the impact of OFCC

programs. Four such difficulties have been discussed in the literature. Each

argument challenges, in one way or another, the appropriateness of noncontractor

firms as a "control group" for the contractors.

     One possibility is that successful EEO programs in contractor firms have

favorable demonstration effects on noncontractor firms, as "erroneous

employer prejudments" are proven wrong by contractors'exper.iénce with minorities

(Flanagan, 1976, p. 502). This would mean that contractor-noncontrator

differences would understate OFCC impact. While such a tendency would hopefully

be at work in the long run, it seems unlikely that such erroneous judgements

would be qyickly overcome. Thus, evaluations of the early OFCC experience

(all studies in Table 3 deal with the first eight years of the program) are

unlikely to be seriously affected.

     A second possible source of error is the possibility that some non-contractor

firms would have improved their minority hiring in order to increase their chances

of becoming contractors. This "improvement" would legitimately be regarded

as a positive OFCC impact on minority position. However, because it shows up as

an improvement in noncontractor firms, it would reduce the estimated impact of
                                  - 32   -


 OFCC.   Heckmari-Wolpin (1977, P. 95) find some evidence that firms with higher

or growing black male employment are more likely to receive contracts, but

those with higher or growing black and white female and other (non-white, non-

black) employment are less likely to become contractors. However, none of

these coefficients is statistically significant. Whether firms believe that

such improvements will increase their prospects for contracts (strongly enough

to act on those beliefs) is even more uncertain. The magnitude of this bias

would depend on how often non-contractors become contractors: the smaller is

such a turnover, the fewer noncontractors who are likely to be improving for

this reason. Hecknian-Wolpin (1977, p. 94) report than in their Chicago data,

3.6% of those who did not have any contracts from 1970 - 72 became contractors

in 1973.

     The interaction of OFCC and EEOC impacts represents a third area of

concern. If EEOC activities are equally directed to contractors and non-

contractors, differences between the two groups would reflect OFCC (rather

than EEOC) efforts. However, EEOC activities could be weighted toward con-

tractors (if EEOC tended to become involved once inadequate EEO performance

was identified, or if "independent" enforcement happened to target certain

industries) or toward noncontractors (if attempts to avoid duplication of

effort led EEOC to focus on noncontractors). Flanagan (1976, P. 501)




     37OFCC efforts may also have impacts on non-contractors who were recent

contractors.
                                     - 33   -



suggested the former possibility was more likely, but the evidence on this
point is quite weak.38

     Finally, it has been suggested that contractor-noncontractor differences

in minority employment could reflect a reshuffling of minority workers from

noncontractor to contractor firms (Heckman-Wolpin, 1977, p. 74). The limit-

ing case --   in   which such transfers occur with no gain to minority workers --

seems implausible, since there must be some incentive for minority workers

to move to the contractor sector. The more general issue --     the relationship

between the contractor-noncontractor difference in minority employment and

the shift in the contractor-sector relative demand curve (and the wage in-

creases resulting from this shift) -- deserves careful attention. Discussion of

this issue has been obscured by a lack of formal models of the impact of OFCC

activities in a general equilibrium framework.

     The most fully worked-out approach is Freeman's (1978b, pp. 20 - 22) two

sector model. Freeman makes the standard assumption that inputs (in this case,

black and white labor) will move to the sector which pays the highest price

for that input. Thus, in equilibrium, black workers receive the same wage

in each sector; so do white workers. However, the wage paid black workers need

not equal the wage paid to white workers. Instead, the relative wage W is

determined by the interaction of supply and demand.




     38Flannagan reports most efforts to ucoordinatehl the activities of the two

agencies were unsuccessful, leading to duplication of effort. But some

duplication would be observed if EEOC activities were uncorrelated with those

of OFCC --    the condition for getting unbiased OFCC impacts. Goldstein-Smith
(1976, p. 537) argue that EEOC efforts were in fact unrelated.
                                            - 34   -



Freeman adopts three simplifying assumptions: in the absence of OFCC pressures,

relative employment in the two sectors would be equal; the elasticity of

relative employment, E, with respect to W is equal to the same value, ,       in
both sectors; total supplies of blacks and whites are fixed. Let c and n index

contractor and noncontractor sectors, respectively. Then the relative demand

curves, in the absence of OFCC pressure are


      lfl(Ec) =     ln(E)   —   r   ln(W)


      ln(En) =      ln(E)   —   r ln(W)

The purpose of the model is to determine the impact, on E,           and W of a

proportional outward shift on X in the relative demand curve in the contractor39

sector; i.e., the contractor demand curve becomes

                            + X - n ln(W).
      ln(Ec) =      ln(E)
      Letting a dot above a variable stand for the proportionate change in that

variable, and        be the contractor sector's initial share of total employment,

the change in relative employment, summed over contractor and non-contractor

sectors, is

                                                       = aX
      aE + (l_O)En      =
                            c(X-W)      -   (l-o)W            -




If   relative supplies are fixed, W must rise to exactly offset X, so that the

above expression is zero. Solving for W in terms of X gives


      w   = aX/ri




       39mus, it is assumed that OFCC has no effect on the relative demand
curve of the non-contractor sector.
                                   - 35   -




Finally,   the contractor-noncontractor difference in the change in relative

employment exactly measures the proportionate effect of OFCC on relative de-

mand in the contractor sector:

                = X
     E -    E
The intuition behind this result is that, once OFCC activities have shifted

contractors' relative demands, relative wages rise. The rise in relative

wages leads both contractors and noncontractors to move back along their rel-

ative demand curves.

     Thus, the model produces two conclusions: the OFCC "impact on employment

as conventionally measured corresponds to the shift in contractors' relative

demand, and illustrative parameter values (a      0.6, r =   1.0,   X =   .10) suggest

a nontrivial effect on relative wages (W =    .06).   However, if these illustrative

parameters are close to correct, long-run OFCC impact remain small compared with

the post-1964 increases reported in the time series studies.

     Obviously, the model makes a number of strong assumptions. Relaxing the

most basic assumption --   the long-run, market-clearing approach --        is   difficult,

because doing so would alter the whole character of the model.40 The three

empirical, simp1ifying' assumptions mentioned above are more easily relaxed,

at the cost of slightly more complicated notation.




     400ne simple alternative is to assume that relative wages in each sector

are fixed, by custom, minimum wage laws, or EEOC enforcement of equal-pay pro-

visions. In this case, °excess" supplies of black labor would be available,

and, so long as they were not exhausted, Ec = X,      E = 0,   and Wc = Wn = 0.
                                                    - 36   -



       Let          and       be the demand elasticities in the two sectors, c' be the

fraction of whites initially employed in the contractor sector, and                          be the

elasticity of relative supply with respect to W. The two key results then

become

       W =



       E     —       = X[l_a'(nc_rin)/(ri'+a)]
                          +
where n' =
                   c'nc       (l_c)n    the "average' demand elasticity. The conclusion

that       -         measures X can be seen to depend only on the assumption that
   =             and is only moderately sensitive to "moderately" unequal ri's.41

   —       overstates         X if      <
                                            ri,1.
                                                    Positive   supply elasticities reduce the

implied W (and moderate any disparity between E -                         and X).42

       A review of the OFCC studies thus seems to point to a positive, though

hardly revolutionary effect (probably no more than 10% in the "long run") of

OFCC activities on relative black male employment in contractor firms, and

very little effect on black females. Three of the four studies find such ef-

fects (for males), and they survive Heckman-Wol pin's more careful estimation

procedures. Using noncontractor firms as a control group, to estimate what

would have happened to contractors in the absence of the OFCC, is open to

challenge. However, there are potential biases in both directions, and none

seems uniquely persuasive.

       42Unequal initial relative employment ratios have no effect, beyond rein-

terpretation of c, only to a first-order approximation.
                                      - 37   -



          However, this positive reading of the OFCC studies is open to challenge

    for another reason: the 'lever" by which OFCC achieved these gains is not

apparent. Two such "levers" seem plausible a priori: either firms with

higher relative employment are rewarded with higher probabilities of receiving

government contracts, or contractors with lagging relative employment are

significantly affected by compliance reviews. To data, little evidence has

produced suggesting that either lever has been used successfully.

          As noted above, Heckman-Wolpin find very weak evidence that firms with

above-average shares of black male employment are more likely to receive

contracts. For example, a firm in which 10% of all employees were black males

(substantially above the average among noncontractors of 7.6%) would find

its probability of receiving a contract increased from .036 to .03604. This

is hardly surprising, given that "pre-award" reviews are not required for

contracts below $1 million (and requirements for large contracts are sometimes

not fulfilled (Ahart, 1976, p. 569)).

          Compliance reviews have not been associated with significant improvements

in relative black male employment in any of the studies which considered

them -— Burman (1973), Goldstein-Smith (1976), or Heckman-Wolpin (1977), who

once again corrected for potential biases from serially correlated disturbances.




          43me change in the probability of receiving a contract is equal to the

coefficient of the black male employment share in their logit regression

(     .052) times P (l-P), times the .024 change in the black male share. Thus,
      =   .052 (.036) (.964) (.024) = .00004, assuming the .024 change comes at

the expense of white males.

        A rather different approach to estimating OFCC impacts, taken by Smith and

Welch (1977 and 1979), strengthens one's reservations about OFCC effects. They

estimate an equation of the form

The independent variable for our purposes               is the fraction of industry product

purchased         by the federal government -- a measure of the leverage which             OFCC

can   exert over private-sector         hiring practices in different industries. Other

variables         held constant include schooling,       "experience," and region.

        In   their earlier paper, Smith and Welch (1977) consider the 1960 - 70
period. They report that b0 and b1 are positive, and imply that the mean
differences associated with the "main" and "race" effects are                     positive as

well.        The year coefficient was constrained to zero, after unconstrained
estimates were insignificant. The interaction term, however is negative, and
very large (b12 equaling 3 to 6 percent per year depending on the experience

group), and the overall effect of "indirect" government employment is negative,

though small.
                                     - 39   -



      In   a later paper (Smith and Welch, 1979) covering the 1967 - 74 period,

the effect of the federal purchase variable is allowed to differ by region

rather than by experience group. Their results for the North are similar to

their earlier findings. For the South, however, main and race effects are

positive, and year and interaction effects are constrained to zero, based on

results with unconstrained equations. Thus, the overall effects of indirect

federal employment is now positive, but tiny --    less than three tenths of a
percent over the period.

     In both studies, Smith and Welch included other government variables —-

direct   federal employment and employment in federally regulated industries44 --

and found no evidence that these made important contributions to increasing

black males' relative earnings. They conclude that government pressure re-

flected in the contract compliance program is an unlikely explanation of the

reduction of earnings differences between black and white males. Smith (1978)

and Beller (1980) reach similar conclusions for black/white female and male/

female earnings ratios, respectively.

     Before analyzing the Smith—Welch results in detail, it is useful to consider

what one might expect if the earlier-reported evidence of positive effects

of OFCC activities on relative employment (among males), and Freeman's

interpretation of those findings, was correct.    In the simplest version of

Freeman's model, wages paid to members of each race, and hence relative wages,

would be no different among contractors than among noncontractors either

before or after OFCC activities, so all four b's would be zero.




     441n the more recent paper, they include analogous variables for direct,

indirect, and regulated state employment.
                                      - 40   -


 Thus, a finding of 'no effect' in the Smith-Welch framework might be consistent

 with a positive "real" effect, if Freeman's model is correct.

      However, this attempt at reconciliation fails for two reasons. First,

 not only would be the "overall' effect as measured by Smith-Welch be zero, but

 each of the components would be zero.           In fact, as noted above, Smith-Welch

 consistently find a negative interaction effect reducing or reversing the other

 terms. Second, Freeman assumes that the supply of labor of either race to

 the contractor sector is infinitely elastic. While that may be a plausible

 long run assumption, some wage inducement must be postulated to attract

blacks to the contractor sector in the short run; that inducement should

show up as a negative value of b12 (relative wages rising in the contractor

sector compared with the noncontractor sector) and hence a positive interaction

effect. Again, Smith-Welch find precisely the reverse.

      It is, however, difficult to be sure how one should interpret the Smith-

Welch findings. The basic problem is their finding of immense premia to blacks

in the contractor sector, relative to blacks in the noncontractor sector, prior

to OFCC activities. Controlling for schooling, experience, and region, Smith-

Welch's equations say that in 1960, relative black earnings were between 42

and 159 percent higher earnings in the contractor sector than in the contractor

sector.45 Lacking a clear understanding of what led to this difference in

the first place, one doesn't know at what rate it would have been reduced absent

OFCC presures, or whether the implicit Smith-Welch assumption --          that   it would

have been maintained -.-   is   correct.




     45Based on Table A2, Smith-Welch, 1975 (a longer version of Smith-Welch,

1977). The range of estimates reflects differences in government contractor

coefficients by experience.

Cross-Section   Studies of EEOC Impact


     Because of the near-universal coverage of Title VII (all firms with 15

or more employees are now covered), cross-section studies of EEOC impact are

hampered by the lack of an obvious control group. Apart from very small firms,

there are no firms not affected by Title VII which would allow us to estimate

what would have happened to covered firms in the absence of Title VII.

     One potential basis for inference lies in the fact that only firms with

100 or more employees are required to report the race/sex composition of

their workforce to EEOC on a regular basis. One might plausibly expect EEOC

pressures to be concentrated on these reporting firms. Brimmer (1976, pp.

26-28) observed that while blacks' share of total employment rose by 0.9

percentage point (from 9.6 to 10.5 percent) from 1966-74, their share of EEOC-

reporting employment rose by 3.4 percentage points (8.2 to 11.6 percent) in the

same period.46 However, Brimmer stops short of labelling the differential

growth and EEOC "effect.1 Not only are many non-reporting firms still covered

by EEOC enforcement activities; the lack of controls for other factors (industry,

or firm size per se) makes the comparison suggestive at best. The difference is,

however, striking.

     An alternative approach is to compare firms or establishments which were

directly involved in EEOC enforcement procedures with other, otherwise similar

units. Adams (l972) compared 65 metropolitan firms which had reached




     46He notes, however, that these greater gains are concentrated in the

lower occupational groups.

    475ee also Adams (1973) and U.S. Comptroller General (1976).
                                    - 42   -



successful concil iation agreements48 with a comparison group (matched by industry
and metropolitan area) not involved in EEOC proceedings. Using changes in

black employment shares and relative occupational position as dependent varia-

bles, he found that, on average, black employment shares (and, less consistently,

relative occupation position) increased faster in the firms with conciliation

agreements, but the differences were small and never statistically significant

(Adams, 1972, p. 118).

        There are two problems with using these results as an indication of EEOC

activities. First, firms which are the subject of complaints to EEOC are

likely to be less 'progressive" than those which are not involved at all with

EEOC.     If less "progressive" is taken to mean low initial levels of minority

employment,Adams's focus on changes in minority employment situation would

control for this tendency. However, if firms with lagging rates of improvement

in minority employment are more likely to be the object of complaints, then

Adams's comparisons would underestimate the true EEOC impact.49

        Second, the sample size and other characteristics of the experimental

design led to standard errors which were large relative to plausible EEOC

effects. For example, black males' (females') share of total male (female) employment




        481n the periods covered by Adams's data (1966-69), EEOC lacked the legal

power to initiate court action.


        491t is possible that Adams's comparison overstates EEOC impact, if the

incidence of complaints is fairly random, and willingness to settle indicated

"progressive" attitudes of the firm. Using firms with unsettled complaints

as control group would have been likely to produce overstated EEOC impacts.

problem, and uses a two-state estimation procedure which treats enforcement
as endogenous. However, the two stage results are uniformly weaker than those

using ordinary least squares. The instruments for complaint are presence of

an EEOC regional office, the proprotion of nonwhite males with at least a high

school education, the proportion of nonwhite males who live in the state's

urban areas, and the unemployment rate for black males. Apparently, opening

a regional office did increase complaint volume (U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity

Commission, 1966, p. 58), but Belier's argument that the location of regional

(as opposed to district offices) was not sensitive to relative employment and

wages is unpersuasive.53 No attempt is made to justify the assumption that the

other instruments do not themselves "belong" in equations determining relative

employment and wage gains. Finally, use of the state as the unit of observation

is questionable. The deterrent effect of EEOC's activities seem more likely to

be felt by other firms in the same industry or industry group (whose employment

practices may mirror those of the challenged firm) than by the firm's geographic

neighbors in unrelated industries (Killingsworth, 1980 p.    )




For example, lchniowski (1980) noted that historically, aluminum industry
contracts follow the pattern set in basic steel. As a result, after the steel

industry agreed to a consent decree which revised the seniority system, "the

terms of the basic steel consent decree were incorporated practically verbatim




     53"We can take the locations of [regional] offices as exogeneous in modelling

the original compliance system; since they were chosen to enable EEOC to carry

out its field operations, they would be independent of Title Vii's enforcement.

But the location of district offices would be endogenous in modelling the current

system; because they are chosen on the basis of experience they would depend upon

Title Vii's enforcement." (Beller, 1980, p. 367).
                                    - 46   -



within   the framework of the aluminum industry's collective bargaining

agreement" without direct government or court involvement. None of these

objections, however, would lead one to expect the differing impacts of

employment and wage complaints which Belier reports.

     In two other papers, Belier extends her work to female earnings. Belier

(1977) relates female earnings in 1967 and 1974 to a set of personal character-

istics and measures of EEOC enforcement. The enforcement variables were

investigations of female compiaints compieted per employed woman, and the ratio

of successful to attempted settlements. Pre-and post-1972 values of these

variables are distinguished, as are charges of race discrimination (by black

females) and sex discrimination, making a total of eight enforcement variables.

(Only the sex discrimination variables are entered into the white female wage

equations.) Separate equations are estimated for each year, and differences in

coefficients between 1967 and 1974 for the enforcement variables are used to

measure their impact.54 The overall effect of the sex-discrimination enforcement

variables was to increase female earnings by 4.7 percent, and race-discrimination

enforcement on behalf of black females increased their earnings by an additional

1.2 percent. These differences are smaller, as one might expect, when industry

and occupation are held constant.

     Beller (1979) looks at the effect of EEOC sex-discrimination enforcement

on male and female earnings from 1967 to 1974. Her two basic enforcement

variables are distinguished by year (before/after 1972) and sector (government!

private) to account for changes in EEOC enforcement powers and coverage of




     54me coefficients of the enforcement variables in 1967 are interpreted

as capturing the relationship between enforcement and pre-existing wage differences.

government employment in 1972. She finds EEOC efforts reduced the female/male

earnings differential by seven percentage points. However, the difference is

not statistically significant, and six of the seven points come from lower

male wages.

     The two more recent papers are based on much more plausible enforcement

variables —-   investigations   and settlement ratios rather than complaints. The

simultaneity and unit-of-observation problems in the earlier paper remain.

Coefficients are often imprecisely estimated, and raise several unanswered

questions: Why should EEOC efforts impair black male relative position, but

help females? Why does enforcement of sex-discrimination complaints close the

male-female wage gap by reducing male wages rather than improving female wages?

Why do successful settlements of sex discrimination before 1972 "significantly"

reduce female wages, but post-72 settlements "significantly" increase them?

6.   Conclusion


     The majority of the evidence seems to point to the conclusion that the

labor market position of minorities improved more rapidly in the past 15 years

than might have been expected on the basis of prior trends, general business

conditions, or the relative educational attainment of minorities. Females'

earnings have not increased appreciably relative to males; whether such stability

in the face of rising female labor force participation would have been predicted

from pre-1964 experience has received little attention.55

     This reading of the time series evidence is not without its critics, and

further work could be most helpful in resolving remaining doubts. The claim

that the post-1964 acceleration of black relative position was confined to the

south (and there predates Federal anti-discrimination efforts) is based on

regional income data56 and early studies using Social Security earnings data.

Because CPS time series of regional earnings data by race and sex stretching

back before 1964 are unavailable, an updated study using Social Security

data by region and race-sex would be most helpful. The very simple 1969-74

changes in average Social Security earnings presented in section 3 does not

support the position that gains were confined to the south.

     The censoring argument --   that   rising relative median earnings reflect

greater labor—market withdrawal of (otherwise) low earning blacks is also of




     55me large body of work "explaining' male/female differentials is not

very helpful in attempting to detect trends.

     561fl some contexts, earnings and income data are thought to be relatively

interchangeable. However, national income data show appreciably slower post—1964

relative black improvement, compared with median wage-and salary earnings.
                                 - 49   -


considerable concern. Further work to isolate its importance is needed. Under-
standing the causes of the dramatic reduction in labor force participation of

black males is important, not only to help estimate the importance of censoring

but also, more directly, to get acompletepicture of changes in the labor-

market situation of blacks. To date, neither side of the censoring debate has

been successful in isolating these causes. The impact of censoring on the

regional trends discussed above would also be of interest, but is currently

unexplored.

    The distribution of the post—1964 gains is also in need of explanation.

Virtually every study finds greater relative gains for black females than black

males. However, this is not the pattern one would expect on the basis of the

government-pressure hypothesis. Belier (1975, p. 28) notes that roughly 60

percent of all EEOC complaints were filed by black males. Studies of OFCC

impact surveyed in section 4 point to smaller effects for black females than

black males. Four possible explanations for the greater relative progress of

black females have been suggested in the literature, two "real" and two "statis-

tical". Anderson (1976, p. 197) suggests that since female turnover rates are

higher than male rates, the continuing impact of prior disadvantages in firm-

specific skills and seniority would be smaller for females than males. (This

leaves the smaller OFCC impacts for females as a continuing puzzle). Smith

(1978) has suggested that black females benefited from employer perceptions that

they fulfill two "quotas", race and sex, at once. Smith (1978) has also noted

that the departure of black females from domestic service to other work may have

overstated their true earnings gains, if earnings of domestics are underreporteci7




    57Under-reporting would be beneficial for tax purposes, and easier for

domestics than for those in other employment due to lack of effective withholding.

Earnings not reported to IRS may also not be reported to Census interviewers.

Finally,   the censoring issue may be more important for females than males,

though in the case of females the significant trend would be the increasing

participation of white females. Brown (1981) reports larger post-1964 tends for

females than males after correcting for censoring however.

     A further puzzle that emerges from the study of post-1964 trends is the

concentration of the gains among the most educated and, at least for young men,

those from the most advantaged backgrounds (Freeman, 1978b). Johnson and

Welch's (1976, p. 520) theoretical model predicts the greatest gains from

their 'economy-wide affirmative action plan" would accrue to minority workers

in the middle of the skill distribution. Employee selection guidelines issued

by EEOC and OFCC prohibit use of educational requirements or standardized tests

if they disproportionately exclude minorities but cannot be shown to be "job-

related," and in practice employers have had considerable difficulty in

establishing job-relatedness of such hiring criteria.   In this sense, the greater

gains of more advantaged blacks run counter to such guidelines. There are

several possible explanations. First, federal enforcement efforts may have

been concentrated at the upper end of the skill distribution. Second, if

discrimination were initially greater against the most educated blacks --

as studies of the early 1960's often found--then reducing all discrimination

by, say, one half would lead to greater gains in relative black earnings at

the higher educational levels. A third possibility is that observed trends

represent a combination of federal efforts to help blacks in general and

other forces which most severely penalize disadvantaged blacks (the movement

of business activity from central cities comes to mind here). Finally, it is

possible that employers respond to the selection guidelines by establishing

different hiring standards for minorities, in order to keep the old, familiar
                                     - 51   -

 selection    criteria but avoid disproportionately excluding minorities. This

 hypothesis would explain the persistent business charges -- and persistent agency

 denials --   that   quotas are being imposed: firms impose quotas on themselves,

 to avoid abandoning selection criteria they cannot validate to the agencies'

 satisfaction.58 While this      conjecture explains why disadvantaged blacks

 haven't gained the most (the premise that the guidelines should have done so is

 wrong) it doesn't explain why they have gained the least.

      Studies of the impact of OFCC and EEOC activities, based on cross-

 sectional data, are not very conclusive for either agency. Most studies of OFCC

 show substantial employment gains for black males, but the exceptions raise serious

 doubts. None of the studies provides a "mechanism" by which OFCC secured these

 gains, since there is little evidence that minority hiring significantly increases

the probability of receiving a contract, or that compliance reviews actually

encouraged the hiring of minorities. Finally, the almost total reluctances to

debar firms not in compliance must contribute to skepticism about the OFCC

impact. One possibility is that contractors' employment practices were

affected by OFCC initially, before the weak sanction posture was appreciated,

but has had less impact subsequently. If this scenario is regarded as realistic,

the relatively recent (1970-72) negative findings of Goldstein-Smith (1976)

would suggest that the program had lost its punch by then. More recent evidence

would, therefore, have greater value than most simple replications.

     Results for EEOC have also been relatively inconclusive. In
                                                                       large part,
this stems from difficulties in finding the appropriate control group, and

probably from aggregating up to the state as unit of observation.



     58There is a crucial issue here which receives almost no attention even in

"informed" public discussions --    are   failures to validate selection criteria an

indication of inept selection or unreasonable application of standards on validation?
                                   - 52   -



     What is needed in "second-generation' studies of OFCC and EEOC impact is

more careful specification of the "treatment" which "experimental" establish—

ments or firms receive. Existing studies look only at numbers of complaints,

investigations, and settlements by EEOC, and contractor status and completion

of a compliance review by OFCC.   In addition to the possibility that the

"overall" impact of the agencies are not well measured by such crude measures

of agency efforts, the overall impacts are of very little use to policy makers.

     Differentiating among OFCC activities and impacts could include these

issues:   Is the size of the contract relative to the firm's total sales an

important aspect of OFCC leverage? As noted in section 2, the frequency of

compliance review varies widely among federal departments. Do contractors of

frequent-review departments have better minority employment records, even in

the absence of a review, because the threat of review is greater? Does the

minority hiring record of firms not initially found in compliance improve

faster than that of firms found in compliance, or than that of firms not

reviewed at all?

     In studying EEOC, greater detail in specifying what EEOC "does" would

also be desirable. For example, does the position of minorities improve during

the period between complaint and investigation, or during the period during

which the firm is being investigated? Do minority employment gains (if any)

following a conciliation agreement or court decree vary with the details of

the settlement? (For example, do settlements specifying goals and timetables

have a greater impact on minority position?) Does settlement by one firm lead to

to improvement by other firms in the same industry? Th.e endogeneity of almost

any EEOC "treatment" appreciably complicates the analysis.

    The above menu is restricted, in the sense that it is limited to

refinements that might, possibly, with considerable effort, be coded from
                                  - 53   -



existing   records and matched to the relevant firm's EEO-i records. Whether

such refinements are in fact feasible is a much harder question. Ashenfelter-.

Heckman (1976) reported considerable problems in simply matching establishments

from successive EEO-l files and determining contractor status. Belier (1979)

noted the difficulties of even computing EEOC investigation and settlement

frequencies by industry. The OFCC and EEOC efforts were not lavishly funded

or staffed, and keeping records of the sort which would permit investigating

these issues with a large-scale statistical approach may have been an unaffordable

luxury.
