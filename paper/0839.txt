          TO OIL PRICE INCREASES IN A THREE—COUNTRY MODEL



         by Nancy Peregrim Marion and Lars E. 0. Svensson



1.   Introduction

     In this paper a three—country model based on intertemporal

maximizing behavior is constructed in order to analyze the effects

of oil price increases on welfare levels and trade balance positions.

The model can also be used to assess the effects of oil price in-

creases on the world interest rate, on the final goods terms of trade

between oil importers (what is sometimes called the real (external)

exchange rate), and on output, investment and savings levels, oil

imports, wages, and consumption at each date.

     The theoretical interest in these effects is derived, of course,

from the substantial oil price increases that have occurred over the

last eight years, the resulting large surpluses in OPEC's trade

balances, the corresponding overall deficits in the rest of the world

vis—à—vis OPEC, and the differential macroeconomic adjustment among

oil importers.

     There is by now an extensive literature on the macroeconomic

effects of oil price increases. However, this literature mostly

relies on a static, small economy analysis that keeps world interest

rates and traded goods prices fixed following an oil price increase.

Such a partial—equilibrium and non—intertemporal approach is limiting
and could be misleading. Moreover, such a single—economy framework

cannot be used to study the differential responses of oil importers

to oil price increases.'

     Three—country world equilibrium models have recently been constructed

by Schrnid (1980) and Sachs (1980) ,   but they differ considerably from the
one developed here. Schmid's model of OPEC and two OECD oH importers

is within the monetary—approach—to—the—balance—of—payments tradition and

lacks an explicit treatment of the intertemporal choices involved in

saving and investment behavior that are so crucial to what we think is

a proper analysis of the current account response to oil price increases.

In fact, there is no capital accumulation in his model nor is there a

role for the world interest rate. In addition, he assumes that both

oil importers produce the same final goods, and so ignores the expendi-

ture—switching effects from relative price changes induced by oil price

increases.

    Sachs' model of OPEC and two industrial oil importers, on the

other hand, is intertemporal in nature and gives an important role

to capital accumulation and the world interest rate in the macro-

economic adjustment process. However, his model is not used to

examine changes iii welfare levels and relative trade positions that

result from oil price increases. Moreover, it is too complicated to

solve analytically, and is instead examined by simulation methods.

     The two—period three—country model developed below is

analytically tractable and easily manipulated and interpreted. It

relies on the dual approach, characterized by the use of expenditure

and GDP functions. Such an approach is formally equivalent to
traditional ones which use utility and production functions, but it

has some practical advantages, among them notational simplicity. Our

way of applying the dual approach has been very much inspired by

Dixit and Norman (1980).

     The model is used primarily to isolate the determinants of changes

in welfare levels and of changes in trade balance positions when there

are oil price increases. It shows that welfare levels are influenced

by direct oil terms of trade effects, final goods terms of trade effects

and intertemporal terms of trade effects. Relative trade balance

positions among oil importers are influenced by these same terms of

trade effects and also by a consumption—wealth effect and substitution

effects in consumption and investment.

     The model also highlights the role of structural asymmetries

between oil importers in accounting for differences in trade balance

responses. A number of structural differences are isolated in turn

in order to determine their influence on the final goods terms of

trade, which is the key factor in affecting relative trade balance

positions.

     it is shown that oil price increases can worsen the relative

trade position of the more oil dependent importer by deteriorating

its final goods terms of trade. Oil price increases also cause a

final goods terms of trade deterioration for the oil importer with

the larger net creditor or smaller net debtor position in the first

period, for the oil importer with more flexible wages in the first

period, and under plausible conditions, for the oil importer with

the smaller marginal propensity to save. Finally, oil price increases
deteriorate the final goods terms of trade of the oil importer with

the smaller degree of substitutability in oil and can hence worsen

its relative trade position.

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The three—country

model    is set out   in Section   2. in Section 3, world   equilibrium   is

defined.     The effects of an oil price increase on welfare levels,

trade balances, world interest rates, and the relative price of final

goods are derived. Section 4 analyzes in turn the role of five

structural asymmetries which influence the final goods terms of

trade and hence the relative trade balance response of oil importers.

These structural asymmetries are (1) the degree of oil dependence,

(2) the net creditor or debtor position, (3) the marginal propensity

to save, (4) the employment response and (5) the degree of substi-

tutability in oil. Section 5 provides some concluding remarks.



2.      The home country, the foreign couittiy and OPEC

        Consider   a world of three countries in an   intertemporal   framework.
Call the three countries the home country, the foreign country and
OPEC. There are two dates, indexed t = 1 and 2.

      At date 1 three goods are produced:       (1) home final goods, produced

exclusively in the home country, (2) foreign final goods, produced

exclusively in     the   foreign country, and (3) oil, produced exclusively

in O1'EC .   At cha te 2, two goods are roduced : a common f ma I good is

produced in the home and foreign countries,2and oil in OPEC. Imported

oil is used as an input in production in the home and foreign countries.

It is neither consumed nor stored.
        At date I the non—OPEC   countries   consume home and foreign goods

They can also use their own—produced good for investment purposes in

order to increase their capital stocks at date 2. To capture the lag

in OPEC consumption of its oil revenues, we invoke the extreme

assumption that there is no OPEC consumption at date              At date 2

all three countries consume final goods.

        All three countries can trade goods on the world market at each

date. They also have access to a coirnuon world credit market.

        OPEC   oxoqenousiy sets oil   prices in terms of borne goods at date

1 and in terms of final goods at date 2. The price of foreign goods

in terms of home goods and the home goods rate of interest are

endogenously determined.

        let   us now examine the behavior of th home country,      modeling first

its production side. Let x =          ft(ktit   zt) denote its well-behaved

concave production function at date L, where x is output of home goods,

kt the home country's capital stock, 2 its employment level, and z its

input (import) of oil. The representative firm operates competitively.

It is then convenient to represent the production side by means of

the revenue, or GDP, functions,5 yt(p, Qt kt, zt) defined as


(2.1)         yt(pt Qt kt, pt) = max tPxt — Qt1t:       X   =   ft(kt   jt x)},

where         and Q1 are the nominal spot prices of home goods and oil

at date 1, measured in some arbitrary unit of account, and P = P2

and Q2 are the nominal spot prices of final goods and oil at date 2.

    Throughout the rest of the paper we shall use home goods as the

numeraire at date 1 and final goods as the numeraire at date 2, and
                                              6




we shall hence normalize P                    P2 = 1.     We   let qt=   QI /P11 represent Liii        dite   1



oil    price         relative to home goods at date 1 and q2= Q2/P2 represent the date 2

oil price relative to final goods at date 2. Then, yt(1, qt, kt, t)

is GDP, or national value added, measured in home goods at date 1

and final goods at date 2.

       We use standard properties of GDP functions to express home goods

supply, the home country's import of oil and its demand price for

labor as


(2.2)               xt =Y,
                        t
                        1
                           zt =—Y,
                                 t
                                 q
                                   w               t      t




where Y, Y,                  and     denote the partials of the GDP function
                         Y
(Y denotes yt/p), and w represents the date t wage relative to

home goods at date 1 and relative to final goods at date 2.

        With respect to employment, We assume that labor is fixed in total

supply within the home country. Initially, flexible wages ensure a

given full employment level,                      at each date. The full—employment

assumption will be relaxed in Section 4.4.

                                                                       c   j
                                                                               i Lal   stock at date

1, k1, is predetermined and exogenously given. Its capital stock at

date 2, k2, can be augmented by investment of home goods at date 1, i.

Thus




(2.3)               k2 = k1 + i1



At date 2 there is rio investment.

        We can derive the home country's investment function in the following

manner. We denote the home goods                        discount factor by ó which is
                                                    7




identicnl to I / (1          + r)     , where   r I the home goods rrite of interest.
The home country's investment (demand) function, 11(1, , q2, k1, 9), is

then, under competitive conditions, given by the level of investment that

maximizes the difference between the present value of GDP at date 2 and

the cost of investment at date 1,                       i.e., the solution to the problem


(2.4)          max {Y2(l, q2, k1 + i,
               .1
               1
                                                        )   -   l}
The investment function hence fulfills the first—order condition


(2.5)          6Y(l, q2, k1 + I'(l,,q2, k', 2),2) = 1


which says that firms invest up to the point where                     the present
value     of   the marginal product of capital in date 2 production equals

the price of capital goods at date 1.

        To examine the properties of the investment function, we differentiate

(2.5) ,   which gives the derivatives


                     =   -           / kk       >




                 q—Ykq/Ykk       2        2

                     = —1, and



                 1           2        2
                                                >

   where Yq =2Y2/q2k2, kk = 2Y2/a(k2)2, and I =                                      etc.

   The derivative I is positive, since by the                           concavity of the

negative. The             partial I is negative         if capital and oil       are com-

plements. Similarly, the derivative I is positive if capital and                             labor
are complements. Throughout we shall assume that capital and oil, and

capital and labor, are indeed complements. This is so if the production

function fulfills the non—restrictive condition that all its cross

partials f, f, and f are positive.6
        Let    us next         consider the   home country's Ucrnand side.         We   assume
that    the home country can be represented by a well—behaved utility

function U(c1, 4,                c2), where c, 4, c2        are the home country's

consumption of home goods and foreign goods at date 1 and of final

goods at date 2. Households seek to maximize utility subject to the

constraint that present—value expenditures do not exceed present—value

income. Define the corresponding (present value) expenditure function7
as

(2.7)     E(P1, P, DP, u)


                          2
                                   c +    P4    +   DP2c2

                                                                             >    u},
              c1   Cf c


where 4        is   the nominal spot price of foreign goods at date I,

and D is the nominal discount factor, equal to one over one plus

the nominal rate of interest. The expenditure function                       gives
the minimum present value of expenditure on consumption required

to reach a target utility level, u, at given prices.

     Choosing date 1 home goods as numeraire, letting the relative

price of foreign goods in terms of home goods be denoted by p,

where p =
                   P/P        (the real exchange rate), and recalling that the
    home goods discount factor 6 is equal to DP2/P, we can use

    the linear homogeneity property of the expenditure functioii to

    write (2.7) as E(l, p, 6, u), the present—value of expenditure

    on consumption measured in date 1 home goods.

        A    standard property of the expenditure function is that its partial
 with respect to the price of a good equals the Hicksian compensated
    demand function for that good. Hence

where we have suppressed the given capital stock k                                              at date 1.

       The      budget constraints tates that tb                                   105(5 L    va I u   of expenditure

u   as an implicit function of oil prices, the price of foreign goods,
the discount factor, and the employment levels.                                              Given this
welfare level,                       output of final goods, oil imports and wages

investment            is q.Lven by the investment funct ion.
         The budget constraint can alternatively be written as equating the
present value of expenditure on consumption to the borne country's
wealth,    W, defined as



(2.10) w       = (ii -.11)                +




which    is the sum of GDP at date 1, net of investment, and the present

value of GDP at date 2.

      The home country's trade balances at dates 1 and 2, b1 and b2,

are   defined as


                                                                   2        2 —

                                                             and b =    Y
                                                                                  E.


From (2.9) and the homogeneity of the expenditure function it follows

that the trade balances fulfill



(2.12) b1 + ób2 =                   0,

i.e •,    trade is balanced                    in presetit—value        terms over time but not
necessarily at                 each      date.
         As can be seen from inspection of (2.11), the home country's

trade surplus at date 1 is equal to GDP (Y1) minus domestic absorption

(E1 +    pE       +    Ii)         at date 1. Alternatively, the trade surplus represents

the excess of domestic saving (Y' -                                    - pE)      over investment (Ii)
                                                       11




Since there is no initial debt and hence rio interust jayments at
date 1,       the   trade surplus at date 1                     is   also equal to the current-
account       surplus        and represents the net accumulation of foreign assets.
Finally, since              GDP at date 1 equals output, x', minus the value of oil

input, q1z1, the trade surplus can be written as exports (x1 — C1' — 1)

minus the value of imports (pc +                            q'z').     In summary, (2.11) incorporates all

the basic definitions of the trade (current—account) balance, and each

of these measures is based on intertemporal maximizing behavior and is

determined by the same set of factors.

         Let us now examine the foreign country, which behaves much like

         Finally, let us examine OPEC.                    We       assume that OPEC exogenously
                          2
sets   oil rices q and
                    1
                       q and supplies the quanLity nf oil in each
period which will satisfy world (home and foreign) demand at the
announced oil prices. OPEC production of oil requires negligible
resources.     No final goods production takes place in OPEC.                                   All OPEC

consumption    is confined to date 2. Denoting OPEC variables with an

uofl superscript, we can write OPEC's intertcmporal budget constraint

as


                   o2 = lot +   202 =                          0
(2.21)                  q x   óq x                         W




where c2 is OPEC's consumption of final goods at date 2, and x1 and
x2 are the outputs of OPEC oil at the two dates, which are equivalent

to the oil imports of the home and foreign countries at the two dates.

Hence, the present value of OPEC's consumption equals the present value

of its oil production, i.e. OPEC's wealth, W°.

3.      World Equilibrium                   and         Oil Prices Increases

        In a world equilibrium, the oil market and final goods markets

are in equilibrium at each date. The complete model is described by

equations (3.l)—(3.8):

                    E(1, p, 6, u) +                          11(1, 6, q2) =

         The   model consists of the budget constraints,                      (3.1) —(3.3)

 oil market equilibrium at dates 1 and 2, (3.4) dud (3.5), market
 equilibrium      for date 1 home goods, (3.6), date 1 foreign goods, (3.7),

and date 2 final goods, (3.8)

         For exogenous oil prices q1 and q2, the eight equations (3.1)-

 (3.8) determine seven endogenous variables, u, u, c2, x1, x02, p

and 5.         By Wairas' Law, one of the equations is redundant .                           We


shall disregard (3.8), the market for date 2 final goods.

         The solution to (3l)—(3.8) can be substituted into (2.11), (2.19)

and (2.22) to determine the trade balances for each country. In

equilibrium, the date 1 trade balances will of course sum                            to zero.
For   easy reference, we restate those trade balance sccifications:

The expressions E and E in (3.11) and (3.12) are the partials of

the expenditure functions with respect to the welfare levels; they

equal the inverse of the marginal utilities of wealth and are positive.

        Let us first look at the home country's change in welfare.

We see that the change in welfare, du, is proportional to the sum

of the present value of the static oil terms of trade effects,

_ztdqt, the static final goods term of trade effect, —cdp, and

an intertemporal terms of trade effect, b do. An increase in

 today's oil price has a direct negative effect on welfare. An in-

crease in future oil prices also reduces welfare. In addition, an

 increase in present or future oil prices alters the relative price

of foreign goods and affects the interest rate. If foreign

 goods prices should rise, the home country suffers a static terms—

 of trade deterioration which reduces welfare.                              If the interest

 rate should fail (dO > 0)              ,    the home country experiences a welfare

 gain (loss) if it is a net borrower (lender) in date 1. Thus the

 net impict on the home country's welfare depends in part on how oil

 price increases affect foreign goods prices and interest
                                   17




rates and whether or not the country is a net borrower or lender

in date 1 .   We   also see that the degree of substitutability in

production between oil, capital, and labor has no direct (first—order)

effect on the home country's welfare.

      The   expression   for the foreign country's change in welfare
is analogous, except that the final goods terms of trade effect

is of opposite sign.

     Differentiating (3.3) gives the change in OPEC's date 2 con-

sumption (and welfare)



(3.13) 6dc02 =     (xOldql + 6x02dq2) + (qIdxOl + q2dx02) + b°2dó




OPEC's change in welfare is proportional to the sum of the static

oil terms of trade effects and an intertemporal terms of trade

effect, although with signs opposite to the sum of those for

the home and foreign countries. In addition there is an oil

quantity effect, qldxOl + 6q2dx°2, consisting of a change in the

present value of oil revenues due to the change in the home and

foreign countries' oil imports, evaluated at constant oil prices.

This oil quantity effect depends on the degree of substitutability

in production between oil, capital, and labor, which hence direct-

ly influences the change in OPEC welfare. The static oil terms

of trade effects are positive, the intertemporal terms of trade

effect may be of any sign, and the oil quantity effects are likely

to be negative.

      Let us, somewhat loosely, speak of the sum of the left hand
 sides of (3.11) — (3.13) as expressing the (wealth equivalent)
 change   in world welfare. It is given by



 (3.14) Edu + E*du*                 +   dc02       =
                                                        qIdxOl    +   oq2dx02,



and consists of the oil quantity effect only. The terms of trade

effects are like transfers between the three countries, and they

cancel from tile world point of view. Thus world welfare falls to

the extent that the present value of the home and foreign countries'

oil imports decrease when evaluated at constant oil prices.

    To determine the effect of oil price increases on tile trade

balances, we differentiate (3.9), which after some manipulations

yields

are its Hicksian static substitution effects on date 1 consumption

of home and foreign goods given a change in the foreign goods

price, and               and E6 are the Hicksian intertemporal consumption

substitution effects, etc.

       Let us first look at the change in the home country's trade

balance      at date 1 .           There       are six determinants of the trade balance
response. The first term on the right—hand side of (3.15) is a
direct oil terms              of   trade       effect   on date 1   GDP   caused by an increase
in    date 1 oil prices. An increase in today's oil prices has a

negative effect on date 1 GDP and thus worsens the trade balance.

       The second term in (3.15) is the final goods terms of trade

effect; any increase in p causes a terms of trade deterioration at

home vis             vis the foreign oil importer and worsens the home country's

trade balance.

       The third term is a consumption wealth effect caused by the change

in welfare that accompanies oil price increases, If the home country

suffers a welfare loss as a result of oil price increases, household

expenditures will fall. This drop in absorption improves the trade

balance. The bracketed expression in the second term is the wealth

equivalent of the change in the home country's welfare, given by

(3.11).
                               20




    The fourth term on the right—hand side of (3.15) represents a

date I final goods consumption substitution effect. If oil price in—

creases should raise foreign goods prices, households will

shift their expenditures away from foreign goods and toward home

goods. If own—substitution effects dominate cross—substitution

effects, then net expenditures will fall, improving the trade

balance.

       The fifth term in (3.15) is an intertemporal consumption substitution

effect. An inc rease in the discount factor boosts house—

hold   absorption   of date 1 goods and worsens the trade balance.

       The last term consists of investment substitution effects.

If the increase in oil prices lowers interest rates, invest-

ment demand is stimulated. This increase in absorption hurts

the trade balance. An increase in date 2 oil prices also alters

the marginal profitability of investment. If capital and oil are

complements in date 2 production, an increase in future oil prices

will lower the marginal product of capital. This leads to a drop

in investment demand which improves the trade balance.

       It is readily seen from (3.16) that the same six determinants

affect the foreign country's date 1 trade balance. There are two

important differences in the direction of effect, however. First,

any increase in p causes a final goods terms of trade gain for the

foreign country (c dp > 0) while causing a loss for the home

country. Second, an increase in p also has an effect on investment

behavior in the foreign country that is absent in the home country.
                                       21




This latter difference appears because the two countries use country—
specific capital, and it would disappear if the two countries employed
the   same capital goods in date 2.

      Let us now study the endogenous changes in the

discount factor and the price of foreign goods caused by oil

price increases. Differentiating (3.6) and (3.7), making use

of (3.11) and (3.12) and manipulating, we get




(3.20)     dh dhl d          =

           df   dfpj   dPj       [Sf



where on the left hand side dhó is the partial of the world excess

demand for home goods with respect to the discount factor, dh is the

partial with respect to the price of foreign goods, and df5 and

df denote the corresponding partials of the world excess demand

for foreign goods. On the right hand side, s1 is the change in the

world excess supply of borne       goods following the oil price increase,
given constant discount factor and price of foreign goods, and
                                                                      Sf

    We assume gross substitutability, which is sufficient for stability.

We also assume that oil price increases lead to excess supply (at

constant discount factor and foreign goods price) of both home and

foreign goods. The latter assumption holds if the negative substitu-

tion effects on output, x1dqand x*1dq1, are dominated by the other

effects, which are all positive.

and   foreign goods at date 1 brought about by higher oil prices

implies by Wairas' Law an excess demand for final goods at date 2.

Hence the price of final goods at date 2, the discount factor, must

rise. Put differently, excess supply of both home and foreign goods

at date 1 implies excess saving at date 1, which bids down the interest

rate.


        The   change in the price of foreign goods is in general of                                        ambiguous

sign.     By rewriting (3.23) we get

This expression can be nicely interpreted. The ratio (dfo/dho)

gives the relative world excess demand for foreign goods from the

change in the discount factor, at constant foreign goods prices.

The ratio (s/s1) gives the relative world excess supply of foreign

goods from the oil price increases, at constant discount factor and

foreign goods price. If this relative world excess demand for

foreign goods exceeds this relative world excess supply, the price of

foreign goods must rise.


4.    Differences in structure, the price of foreign goods, and

      the relative trade balance response

      Clearly, if the home and foreign countries are alike in every

respect, there will be no change in the foreign goods price, and the

two oil importers will have identical trade balance responses to

exogenous oil price increases. In this section we look at how

structural differences between the home and foreign countries

influence the foreign goods price response to oil price increases.

We also examine how structural asymmetries can account for differences

in the relative trade balance response.

      A number of structural asymmetries can be examined in order

to assess their impact on the final goods terms of trade (p) when

there are oil price increases. We choose to focus on five which are

widely thought to be important and/or which are amenable to future

empirical testing. The five structural characteristics are (1) the

degree of oil dependence, (2) the net creditor or debtor position,

(3) the marginal propensity to save, (4) the employment response,

and (5) the degree of substitutability in production. We shall

examine the implications of each structural asymmetry in turn.

      Our method will be to assume that the home and foreign countries

are identical except in one respect atatime. Let the initial
                                               25




 situation            be one where the relative price of foreign   goods   equals

 unity,

 (4.1) p = 1.

 We start by assuming that the home and foreign countries have the

 same bias towards their own good, in the sense that their

 marginal propensities to consume home and foreign goods at date 1

 fulfill

It follows from (4.1) and (4.2) that their aggregate propensities

to consume aL dat:e I are the same,

4.1       'flie       degree    of oil dependence

          The conventional view is that oil price increases cause larger

trade balance deteriorations in those economies that are heavily

dependent on oil imports. This view has been challenged recently

by Sachs (1981), who argues that differential dependence on oil

imports has little effect on relative trade positions if the oil

price shock is perceived as permanent, but does matter if the shock

is temporary. The analysis below suggests that the degree of oil

dependence does influence the trade—balance response to all types

of oil price increases, whether temporary, permanent or future, but

that oil dependence is just part of the story.
                                                          26



         Suppose that the home country is more oil dependent in each
period than the foreign country, in the sense that

 (4.4) z >               z*           for t = 1,          2.



The two countries are alike in all other relevant respects. That

is, we assume that

and from (3.26) it follows that the foreign goods price rises.

The country with the higher degree of oil dependence suffers a final

goods terms-of—trade deterioration. The intuitive reason is straight-

forward. The country with the higher degree of oil dependence faces

a greater welfare loss when oil prices rise. Consequently at date 1

the drop in demand for home goods is greater than the drop in demand

for foreign goods. The relative excess supply of home goods that

results put upward pressure on p.

      Since    the home country is more oil dependent, it faces a higher
 value of oil imports when oil prices increase. This causes a negative
 direct effect on the relative trade balance, represented by the first
 term on the right hand side of (4.8). But the home country also

experiences a greater welfare loss when oil prices rise and hence a

greater drop in absorption. This causes a positive consumption wealth

effect on the relative trade balance, represented by the second term

on the right hand side of (4.8). The net of these two effects is

ambiguous.

     Consider for a moment the effect of a temporary oil price

increase. This disturbance has a negative direct effect on the relative

trade balance and a smaller positive consumption wealth effect. Hence

the temporary oil price increase worsens the relative trade balance

for constant p.

     A future oil Price increase has only a positive consumption wealth

effect and hence improves the relative trade balance for constant p. Finally,

a permanent oil price increase has both a negative direct effect and a

positive consumption wealth effect, with an ambiguous impact on the

relative trade balance for constant p.

         Now   SUPOSC     that oil imports and oil price increases are the same
 in both periods for each country, hut oil imports still differ across
 countries.        That is,


 (4.9)         =   z2     z,     z*1 =         = z,   dq1   dq2 = dq,   and z >   z.
 Substituting (4.9) into (4.8) we see that at constant p the relative

 trade balance response to permanent oil price increases is



 (4.10) db' - db*1          =
                                 (C
                                      —         - z*)Sdq

where C = (1 —                        If the home country's aggregate marginal
               C)/cS.
propensity to consume is the same at both dates, i.e. C =

then permanent oil price increases will have no effect on relative

trade positions, regardless of the asymmetry in oil dependence. This

is Sachs' (1981) story. But as soon as we relax the restrictive

assumptions in (4.9) and as soon as we allow for the endogenous

change in the foreign goods price, this strong result fails to hold.

     Returning to (4.8), we see that the increase in the foreign

goods price generated by higher oil prices has three additional effects

on the relative trade balance. It has a negative direct effect, a

smaller positive consumption wealth effect (both represented by the

third term on       the   right hand side of (4 .8)) and a negative investment

effect. The        latter      effect is due to the country-specific capital

used at home and abroad; an increase in p raises the cost of invest-

ment goods in the foreign country and hence reduces foreign absorption

at the first date. This investment effect worsens the relative trade

balance; however, it would disappear if both countries used the same

capital goods in production.
                              29



      We conclude that temporary and permanent oil price increases

which worsen importers' trade balances will have graver consequences

for the relatively oil—dependent importers.

      Of course, oil importers are apt to diffr in a number of

structural characteristics which influence p, so the correlation

between oil dependence and the relative trade balance response is

likely to be missed unless these other asymmetries are also taken

into account.




4.2   The net creditor or debtor position
      Now suppose the two oil importers are similar in all relevant
respects   except for their net lending positions. Specifically, we
assume

 (4.11) b1 > b*1,


which by (2.12) and (2.20) implies


(4.12) b2 < b*2.


It follows that



(4.13) dh < df6      and 5h =
                                Sf.

From (3.26) and (4.13) it follows that the foreign goods price increases.

The home country, with the larger net creditor position or smaller

net debtor position in date 1, faces an additional final goods terms

of trade deterioration in response to oil price increases.

      The rationale is intuitive. Oil price increases raise the

discount factor, and the drop in the real interest rate causes a
                                 30



   lrger welfare loss for the home country with its larger net creditor

  position in date 1.     It experiences the greater negative consumption

  wealth effect, so on net there will be a greater excess supply of home

  goods relative to foreign goods in date 1. This puts upward pressure

  on p.

          The relative trade balance response is given by


   (4.14) db1 -
                  db*'=_C(b2
                                —    b*2)d    -   (1 -   C)2cdp
                                                                   +   pI*1dp.
                               (—)      (+)                  (+)        (—)(+)




     Since the endogenous increase in the discount factor causes a

larger welfare loss for the home country in date 1, it has a positive

consumption wealth effect on the relative trade balance, represented by

the first term on the right hand side of (4.14).            The endogenous

increase in the foreign goods price, i.e. the deterioration of the home

country's final goods terms of trade, has a negative direct effect on

the relative trade balance and a smaller positive consumption wealth

effect, both of which are represented by the second term in (4.14),

and a negative investment effect.       Hence when

two oil importers are identical in all relevant respects except for

their net lending positions, the relative trade balance response to

oil price increases cannot be determined without knowledge of specific

parameter values.



4.3 The marginal propensity to save

     Suppose that at date 1 the home country has a smaller marginal
propensity to save, and hence a large propensity to consume, than the

foreign country. Assume that the two countries still have the same

since c >                       From (3.26) and (4.16), it follows that the effect

on the foreign goods price is ambiguous.

        The effect of a temporary oil price increase on the foreign goods

price can be determined, however. Let Shi and s represent the change

in world excess supply of home goods and foreign goods, respectively,

given an increase in date 1 oil price alone, where from (3.21) we can

write


                                                                         >   0

i.e., the   foreign   goods price increases. The home country, with the

smaller marginal propensity to save, faces a final goods terms of

trade deterioration when there is a temporary oil price increase.

This is because for a given loss in welfare caused by the oil price

increase, the drop in demand for home goods will exceed the drop in

demand for foreign goods. The relative excess supply of home goods

that results puts upward pressure on the foreign goods price.

     The    effect   of a future oil price increase on the foreign goods

price is indeterminate. As before, if the               home country has the          smaller

marginal propensity to save at date 1, a given welfare loss will cause

a drop in demand for home goods that exceeds the drop in demand for

foreign goods. This tends to put upward pressure on p. However, the

expected increase in future oil prices also reduces investment demand

for date 1 goods, releasing more of them for date 1 consumption. With

the smaller marginal propensity to save, the home country will

experience the smaller excess supply of domestic goods when investment

demand is curtailed. This puts downward pressure on p. Only if this

investment effect is dominated can we say the oil importer with the

smaller marginal propensity to save date 1 goods will suffer a final

goods terms of trade loss when there are future oil price increases

or current oil price increases of a permanent nature.

     When the two oil importers differ only in their marginal propen-

sities to save at date 1, the relative trade balance response is given

by

     Oil   price increases have a direct negative effect on welfare

(— z1dq1 — óz2dq2   <   0) in both countries. Since the home country
has the smaller marginal propensity to save, it will respond with a

greater cut in absorption and this will have a positive effect on the

relative trade balance, represented by the first term on the right

hand side of (4.19). The endogenous increase in the discount factor

will have a positive effect on welfare in hoth countries since both

have the same trade deficit in date 1. But the home country, with

its larger marginal propensity to consume, will respond with a

greater increase in absorption, and this will have a negative effect

on the relative trade balance, represented by the second term in

(4.19). If the net welfare effect is negative, oil price increases will

have a positive effect on the relative trade balance for constant p.

Since the change in the foreign goods price can be in either direction,

we cannot determine its effect on the relative trade balance. Con-

sequently, when two oil importers are alike in all relevant respects

except for their marginal propensities to save, we cannot calculate

the relative trade balance response to oil price increases without

knowing specific parameter values.


4.4 The employment response

     So far we have assumed flexible wages and full employment at each

date in the home and foreign countries. In this section we shall

examine the consequences of rigid wages and variable employment at

the first date in the home country. We maintain the assumption of

flexible wages and full employment at the first date in the foreign

country, and in both countries at the second date.
                                                          14




     Lc   t us now I uok at                    employment      in   the   home count ry at date   1



First,    suppose that the wage                          is fixed in terms of home goods at the
first date, i.e., wages are indexed to the GDP deflator. The level

of employment is then given by the condition that the demand price

for labor, Y, equals the wage. Hence, the date 1 employment function,

L (w , q    ,   k   ),       is       defined by


(4.20) Y(l, q', k1, L1(1, q1, k1)) = w1,



where w1 is the wage in terms of date                                home goods.

     Differentiating (4.20), we get the derivatives


           L1 =     iiy1U             <   0,       L' =   - Y1 IY' < 0,        and
            w                                       q        9q U

                                               >    0,

where the second order derivative Y is negative by the concavity

of the GDP function. Hence employment at date 1 is always a decreasing

function of the real wage, a decreasing function of the oil price at

date 1 by the assumption of complementarity between oil and labor,

and an increasing function of the capital stock by the assumption of

complementary between capital and labor. With real wages fixed in

terms of home goods at date 1, the change in the home country's date 1

employment level in response to an oil price increase will hence be

given by


(4.22) d = L1dq1                          0,


ie employment at date 1 decreases.
                                                          35




     With the endogenous change in the home country's employment given

by (4.22), its welfare change in (3.11) is modified to


(4.23) Edu w1 d -                           z1dq1 — 6z2dq2 —           cdp     + b2d

negative employment effect, w'd2J, the change in GDP due to the change

in employment.

     The changes in excess supplies of home and foreign goods are now

given by


(4.25) s =           xd9           + x1dq1           I1dq2 + c(— w1dZ1 + z1dq1 ÷ óz2dq2)

 which says that the        foreign         goods price falls.

      Since    oil   price increases cause a drop in the home country's

 employment level at date 1, there is a greater drop in the production

of home goods relative to the production of foreign goods. The

 relative excess supply of foreign goods which results puts downward

pressure on p. Consequently, the oil importer with rigid real wages

experiences a final goods terms of trade gain when there are oil price

increases. This effect is counter to the negative employment effect.

Which effects dominates depends, of course, on the specific parameters.

where (4.28) is the difference between (4.24) and (3.16).

     When wages are rigid in the home country, oil price increases

reduce employment and cause a bigger drop in home GDP relative to

foreign GDP. This causes a negative direct plus consumption—wealth

effect on the relative trade balance, represented by the first term

on the right hand side of (4.28). The improvement in the home country's

final goods terms of trade causes a positive direct plus consumption—

wealth effect on the relative trade balance, given by the second term

in (4.28), and a positive investment effect. Consequently there is no

direct correlation between the degree of wage rigidity and the response

of the relative trade balance to oil price increases.
       Consider next         a case     where the    dale   i wage in the home country
is fixed in        terms   of a      consumer   price index (CPI) rather than in
home goods. Let               denote this given real wage, in terms of the

CPI. Let the price index u1(l, p) denote the date 1 CPI, in terms

of   home goods. [t           is    a function of the price of home goods (normalized to

unity) and the price of foreign goods (p). Then the wage in
terms of home goods will be a function, w1(l, p. w1), defined by
(4.29) w1(i, p, w1) = ir'(l,                 p)w1.

It has the         obvious    properties

             w1p =ir11>0 and
                      p
(4.30)
             wI = it I > 0.
              (U




The   wage in terms          of home goods is an increasing function of the price

of    foreign goods and the CPI wage rate.9
        In   this case,       the home country's employment level at date 1          will

simply    be given by L1(w1(l, p, Wi), q', k'), i.e. by substituting the

wage function (4.29) into the employment function defined in (4.20).

It follows that the change in employment will be given by


(4.31) d2             L1dq1 + L1w1dp            0.
                     (—)           (—) (+)
In   addition to the direct effect of an oil price increase, there is

now an effect through the change in the wage rate. Should the foreign

price    fall, ilie wage           in home goods falls, and this      increases employment.

Hence,       the overall effect of an oil price increase on employment

is now ambiguous.

       By the same argument as above it can indeed be shown that the
foreign goods price does unambiguously fall. (di1 in (4.25)                    and   (4.26)
                                           38




is simply replaced by L1dq1.) If Ihen the overall change in employment

is positive, we see that both the employment effect and the fiiial

goods terms of trade effects on home welfare are positive in (4.23).

Also, the relative trade balance in (4.28) is unambiguously positive.

     Does it follow that it is always better for the home country to

have the wage fixed in terms of a CPI rather than in home goods? No,

since with wages fixed according to a CPI, the supply of home goods

is more elastic with respect to the price of foreign goods. Uence

the fall in the foreign goods price is smaller with given CPI wages

than with given home goods wages. Thus the final goods terms of trade

gain is smaller with CPI wages, although the employment effect is

less negative or even positive.


4.5 The degree of substitution

     Suppose that the two oil importers are identical in every relevant

respect except for the degree of substitutability in production betweeti

oil and domestic capital and labor. We assume that the home country has

less such substitutability at date 1 so that it experiences a smaller

absolute response in the full employment level of output of home

goods to an oil price increase. That is, we assume


(4.32) x*1 < x1
         q
                        <   0,
                    q

                                                   10
recalling that both responses are negative.

     It follows that


(4.33) d16 = d16        >   0    and

                            1
        Sh —   Sf       (Xq —     x* 1 )dq1 > 0.
 By (3.23) and (4.33) we can write


 (4.34) dp      dho(sf —                >   O
                (+)    (—)     (—)


which says that the foreign goods price increases. With a given level

of employment and capital stock utilization in each country at date 1,

the home country, with the smaller degree of substitutability in oil,

faces a smaller decline in production at date 1.                             The relative excess

supply of home goods that results puts upward pressure on p.                             hence,

the country with less substitutability in production suffers a final

goods terms of trade loss.



     The relative trade balance response is


(4.35) db1 —    db*'    —
                             2(1    -                 +   pI*1dp    <   0.
                                         C1)cdp
                                   (÷)          (+)        (—)(+)


     The deterioration in the home countryts final goods terms of trade

has a negative direct plus consumption—wealth effect on the relative

trade balance, represented by the first term on the right hand side of

(4.35), and a negative investment effect. Hence oil price increases

worsen the relative trade balance response; the oil importer with the

smaller degree of substitutability in oil suffers a greater negative

effect on its trade balance.




5. Conclusion

   This paper represents the first attempt in the literature to

construct an explicitly intertemporal three—country model in order

to analyze the effects of oil price increases on countries' welfare
                               40




levels and relative trade balance positions. The model uses aggregates

which are consistent with maximizing behavior and yields a rich array

of analytically tractable results.

     For instance, the determinants of changes in welfare levels

and of changes in trade balance positions when there are oil price

increases are readily isolated. Changes in output levels, oil

imports, investment, employment, wages, saving and consumption can

also be calculated for individual oil importing countries. The

three—country world equilibrium model also takes account of the

feedback effects of higher oil prices on the world interest rate and

the final goods terms of trade between oil importers (the real exchange

rate).

     One important finding is that structural asymmetries between

oil importers cause oil price increases to alter the final goods

terms of trade in systemmatic ways, and these movements in the final

goods terms of trade play a crucial role in determining an oil

importer's relative trade balance position in the face of oil price

increases. Despite some recent thought to the contrary, the degree

of oil dependence does influence a country's relative trade balance

position. So does a country's degree of substitutability in oil.

Other structural characteristics, such as a country's relative

international lending position, its relative marginal propensity to

save, and is degree of wage flexibility in the short run also

alter the final goods terms of trade in predictable ways and influence

an oil importer's relative trade balance position.

     In short, the model presented here allows us to analyze some
                                41




important general equilibrium interrelationships in detail and to

study the differential macroeconomic adjustment of oil importers

to oil price increases.

I.     For partid. equilibrium analyses of effects of oil price increases

that emphasize intertemporal aspects, see Bruno (1981), Marion (1981),

Obstfeld (1980), Sachs (1981), and Svensson (1981). Dixit (1981) presents

a very neat intertemporal general equilibrium model of trade in goods,

capital,     and oil hut
                     ,     concentrates on   othe r Issues than those of   the

present     paper.

2.    The assumption of a common final good at date 2 greatly        simplifies
the   analysis and makes possible intuitive explanations of the results

to follow. It is also warranted since we are mainly interested in

the date 1 final goods price and relative trade balance responses.

Precise conditions on the countries' preferences and/or technologies

can also be found under which home and foreign goods at date 2 could

be rigorously aggregated into one aggregate final good at date 2.

See Svensson and Razin (1981) and Svensson (1981) for such analyses

applied to the study of trade balance responses.


3.    What is necessary for the results below is the reasonable assumption

that OPEC's marginal propensity to consume at the first date is smaller

than that of the home and foreign countries. Assuming that there is
                                   4




 zero OPEC consumption at the first date however greatly simplifies

 the analysis.


4.     For the implications of an endogenous OPEC policy that maximizes

OPEC welfare, or of an OPEC policy which sets oil prices at each date

 in terms of date 2 final goods, see Marion and Svensson (1981, in progress).


5.     The GDP function is also called the value—added, the restricted

profit, the variable profit, the GNP, or the revenue function. A compre-

hensive reference is Bruno (1978) or Diewert (1974) .      See Varian (1978)

for a micro—textbook using this and similar dual functions, and Bruno

(1973), Chipman (1972), Dixit and Norman (1980), Khang (1971), and

Woodland (1981) for their use in international trade theory.


6.     Note that complements in this sense is not a very restrictive

assumption. This definition of complements/substitutes is different

from the ones usually employed in the literature. Complements!

substitutes are mostly defined, in analogy with the definition of Hicksian

complements/substitutes in consumption, from the sign of the partial

of the demand for a factor with respect to the price of another factor,

at constant output level. See Berndt and Wood (1979) for a thorough

discussion of such Hicksian complementarity/substitutability between

oil and other factors. Factors can be Hicksian substitutes and yet

complements in our sense. This is indeed the case with the specific

separable technologies discussed by Berndt and Wood, when

x =   f(g(k,   e), h(9., m)), f(•), g(•) and h(.) are linearly homogenous,

e is energy input, and m is input of non—energy materials.
                                            44




        A    frequently assumed technology is one that is weakly separable in
oil and a capital—labor composite factor. Then we                  have      x      f(v(k, ),       z),
where     f(.) and v(.) are linearly Iioruogcnous.            it   is   readily checked that
for these technologies, capital, labor and oil are complements in our
sciisc.

(1980),       Varian    (1978),      or Woodland   (1981) for properties and uses of the
expenditure          function.

8.      The assumption of gross substitutability imp ics that dIi                          > 0
                                                                                      j)



and d         < 0,    that is, an increase in the price of foreign goods raises
        fp
the world excess demand for home goods and reduces the world excess
demand       for foreign goods. Similarly, it implies dhó                >   0    and (I     > 0.



9.      By standard properties of a price index, p/ equals the share

of final goods in date 1 consumption expenditure.


10. Assume that date 1 production of home goods is separable between

an aggregate of domestic capital and labor, v(k, 2), and oil input, z.

That is, the production function fulfills x =                 f(k,      ,,   z)      g(v(k, Z), z).

Note that if g(•) and v(•) are constant returns tø scale, so is f(•).

In particular, with this technology, frequently assumed in the literature,

capital, labor and oil are all complements in the sense of having positive

cross partials.

        With full employment of labor, only x and z vary. By standard
                                 A
results       we have x = Oz and z           —
                                                 yq, where x denotes the rate of change
dx/x, etc., 0 is the cost share of oil in the value of output of home

goods, and -y (defined positive) is the elasticity of demand for oil
                                  45




with respect to the relative oil price. Furthermore, y equals o/(l —         0),
where o is the elasticity of substitution between oil and the domestic

                                        —   [01(1   —
aggregate factor v. Hence, we have x                    O)]crq, and it follows

that for a given oil price increase and a given output level, the

absolute response in output is smaller the smaller the elasticity of

substitution.
