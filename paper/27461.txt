The Determinants of Fiscal and Monetary Policies During the Covid-19 Crisis

                                           ABSTRACT

As countries around the world grapple with Covid-19, their economies are grinding to a halt. For
the first time since the Great Depression both advanced economies and developing economies are
in recession. Governments and central banks have responded to the pandemic and the economic
crisis using both fiscal and monetary tools on a scale that the world has not witnessed before.
This paper analyzes the determinants of fiscal and monetary policies during the Covid-19 crisis.
We find that high-income countries announced larger fiscal policies than lower-income countries.
We also find that a country’s credit rating is the most important determinant of its fiscal spending
during the pandemic. High-income countries entered the crisis with historically low interest rates
and as a result were more likely to use nonconventional monetary policy tools. These findings
raise the concern that countries with poor credit histories – those with lower credit ratings and, in
particular, lower-income countries – will not be able to deploy fiscal policy tools effectively
during economic crises.

1. Introduction

As countries around the world grapple with the novel coronavirus pandemic by using
various public health measures to contain the spread of the virus, they also struggle with
the economic consequences of Covid-19. For the first time since the Great Depression,
both advanced economies and developing economies are in recession (Gopinath, 2020).
Indeed, as of April 2020 the global economy is projected to contract sharply by -3% in
2020, a decline of 6.3% from a pre-Covid-19 projection.1 Governments and central
banks have responded to the pandemic and the ensuing economic crisis using both fiscal
and monetary tools on a scale that the world has not witnessed before. These policies
have been advocated by such global economics institutions as the International
Monetary Fund (IMF):

    Because the economic fallout reflects particularly acute shocks in specific
    sectors, policymakers will need to implement substantial targeted fiscal,
    monetary, and financial market measures to support affected households and
    businesses. Such actions will help maintain economic relationships
    throughout the shutdown and are essential to enable activity to gradually
    normalize once the pandemic abates and containment measures are lifted.2

However, countries are limited in their use of monetary and fiscal tools. Many high-
income countries entered this crisis with historically low interest rates, averaging
0.78%. Similarly, their public debt levels were very high. According to the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), at the end of 2019,
central government gross marketable debt was estimated at 72.6% of GDP for OECD
countries overall. This paper calculates the magnitudes of fiscal and monetary tools
deployed by 85 countries around the world and analyzes the determinants of their policy
responses and levels.

        We find that on average Covid-19 fiscal spending is 4.97% of GDP. When we
include government guarantees in fiscal spending, the average increases to 7.71%.
Furthermore, high-income countries – those with GDP per capita above the median in
our sample – announced fiscal policies that amount on average to 6.8% of GDP, as

compared to only 3.1% in low-income countries. Similarly, government guarantees are
much higher in high-income countries compared to low-income countries.

        The mean change in central bank interest rates due to the Covid-19 crisis is -
0.63%, with only one country (Denmark) increasing its key base rate and all other
countries lowering their rates. Because high-income countries entered the crisis with
historically low interest rates – some, such as Switzerland, had negative rates – they
lowered their rates less than did low-income countries. The mean interest rate change
in high-income countries was -0.43% as compared to -0.84% in low-income countries.
Although high-income countries were limited in their ability to use conventional
monetary policy, they deployed more nonconventional monetary policy tools, such as
central bank guarantees, asset purchases, relaxation of macroprudential rules, and
restrictions of dividend payments and share repurchases by financial institutions.

        In our regression analysis we run a “horse race” between a number of
macroeconomic variables to understand the determinants of fiscal and monetary
policies during the Covid-19 crisis. Our regression analysis shows that richer countries
are extending larger fiscal programs. One concern with this result is that it is driven by
the fact that richer countries experienced more cases of Covid-19. Indeed, in our sample
of 85 countries the log number of Covid-19 cases in the high-income countries is 6.99
as compared to 4.35 in low-income countries. However, when we control for the
number of Covid-19 cases in our regression, we still find that higher-income countries
deploy larger fiscal programs.

        We find that perhaps the most important factor affecting a country’s fiscal
policy is its pre-crisis sovereign credit rating. Of all of the macro variables we include
in our empirical models, credit rating is the only variable to show up consistently as the
strongest determinant of fiscal policy during the Covid-19 crisis. Although high-income
countries have better a credit rating than low-income countries, our results also hold
when we control for GDP per capita in our regressions. That is, even among high-
income, advanced economies, a country’s credit rating affects its ability to pursue
expansionary fiscal policies. Similar evidence is documented in Bianchi et al. (2019),
who show that countercyclical fiscal policies are not common in countries with high
credit risk.




                                            3
Surprisingly, we do not find a negative correlation between the debt-to-GDP ratio and
the size of a country’s fiscal programs relative to its GDP. The effect of debt-to-GDP
on fiscal spending is either positive or close to zero – a result that contrasts the
traditional view that countries with lower debt-to-GDP use fiscal policy more
aggressively during crises (Romer and Romer, 2018, and 2019). For example,
according to Romer and Romer, 2018: “We find that countries with [fiscal] space use
policy – particularly fiscal policy – much more aggressively.”3 We conduct a battery of
robustness tests and find that much of the positive association between debt-to-GDP
and fiscal spending during the Covid-19 crisis is driven by outlier countries such as
Greece and Japan. Nevertheless, even after removing these outlier observations the
relation between debt-to-GDP and fiscal spending remains positive although
insignificant in some specifications.

         When we evaluate the determinants of monetary policy, we find that the
strongest determinant of conventional monetary policy is the central bank base rate.
Countries that entered the Covid-19 crisis with low interest rate levels – mostly high-
income countries – had little margin for adjustment in their arsenal of conventional
monetary tools. Instead, those countries were more likely to resort to nonconventional
monetary tools. For example, low-interest-rate countries used more central bank
guarantees and financial asset purchases and were more likely to relax macroprudential-
based lending rules and to limit shareholder payouts in the form of dividends or share
repurchases by financial institutions. The patterns in the data are consistent with
Bernanke, 2020, who writes: “Chronically low interest rates pose a challenge for the
traditional approach to monetary policymaking, based on the management of a short-
term policy interest rate.”4

         Overall, the data show that governments reactions to the crisis occur at the
confluence of fiscal and monetary policy. Countries with ultra low interest rates at the
beginning of the pandemic – those with rates below 1% – deployed larger fiscal
spending – chiefly in the form of government guarantees.

         Our paper adds to the emerging literature on the macroeconomic effects of
Covid-19 (Auerbach, Gorodnichenko and Murphy, 2020, Baqaee and Farhi, 2020,

 See Bernanke, 2020 p. 943. Dell’Ariccia et al., 2018 argue that unconventional monetary policies
have been effective in preventing further financial difficulties following the Great Financial Crisis.

Barro, Ursua and Weng, 2020, Bigio, Zhang and Zilberman, 2020, e Castro, 2020,
Eichenbaum, Rebelo and Trabandt, 2020, Guerrieri, Lorenzoni, Straub and Werning,
2020). Our paper also sheds new light on the use of fiscal and monetary policies in a
low-interest-rate environment. While some economists argue that nonconventional
monetary tools may offset the effect of the lower bound and provide space for monetary
policy (Bernanke, 2020), others suggest that because of the changing nature of
macroeconomics, the ability of monetary policy to accomplish much when interest rates
are at their lower bound is limited (DeLong and Summers, 2012; Summers, 2014;
Eichenbaum, 2019).

        We also show that a country’s ability to deploy fiscal policies when short-term
rates are ultra-low is limited by its access to credit markets – or its credit rating. The
Covid-19 pandemic has affected advanced economies disproportionally in terms of the
number of confirmed cases and deaths. The ability of these countries to react to the
adverse health shocks with fiscal policies is facilitated by their higher sovereign credit
ratings. These findings raise the concern that countries with poor credit histories – those
with lower credit ratings and, in particular, lower-income countries – will not be able
to deploy fiscal policies of similar magnitudes in times of economic crisis.

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the data and
presents summary statistics. Section 3 analyzes the determinants of fiscal and monetary
policies during the Covid-19 crisis. Section 4 discusses the confluence of these policies.
Section 5 concludes.

2. The data

In this section, we describe our variables and summarize the data.

2.1 Variable definitions

        We collect data on 85 countries for which we find information on fiscal and
monetary policy responses to the Covid-19 pandemic. Our dataset consists of 35
advanced economies and 50 emerging market and developing economies.5 We use two
main sources to construct our dataset: the IMF website on policy responses to Covid-


5
  Our sample covers 90% of the world‘s advanced economies. We use the IMF’s definition for
advanced economies versus emerging market and developing economies throughout the paper. More
information can be found in IMF (2020), table 1.1.

19 and the OECD.6 We update our database using information up to May 5, 2020. Table
1 describes the variables used in the paper and their sources.

2.2 Summary statistics

        Table 1 describes the variables used in this paper, and Table 2 presents the data
on the variables. Panel A of Table 2 shows our main macrovariables, and Panels B, C,
D, and E of Table 2 present the Covid-19 fiscal, monetary, nonconventional monetary
policy, and exchange rate policy response variables, respectively. The standard
macrovariables in Panel A are log GDP per capita, log population, debt-to-GDP ratio,
log Covid-19 cases per one million people as of May 5, 2020, Fitch sovereign credit
rating, and government expenditure to GDP ratio.

        Panel B reports summary statistics for the fiscal policies implemented by the
countries in our data as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The mean fiscal spending
(excluding government guarantees) is 4.97% of GDP, and it ranges from 0.4% (Sri
Lanka) to 22.8% (Japan). The average fiscal package is already much greater than the
total fiscal policy package implemented after the Global Financial Crisis: for example,
in the United States, fiscal spending after the Global Financial Crisis was 5.5% of GDP
(Auerbach et al., 2009), but after the Covid-19 crisis it now equals 13% of GDP and is
projected to grow.7 Government guarantees amount on average to an additional 2.73%
of GDP, with a standard deviation of 4.81%. Detailed information on the allocation of
fiscal spending across economic categories is available for more than half of the
countries in our data. These categories of fiscal spending are: healthcare, households,
and businesses. The mean healthcare Covid-19 policy fiscal spending is 0.67% of GDP,
with a range of 0.10% to 3.0%. Fiscal stimulus to households ranges from 0.10% to
8.0% with a mean of 1.70% of GDP, and the mean fiscal stimulus to businesses is
2.53% of GDP, with a standard deviation of 2.36%.

        Panel C reports summary statistics for the monetary policies implemented by
the countries in our data. The mean interest rate level before the start day of the Covid-
19 crisis was 3.55%, and the mean rate ranges from -0.75% (Switzerland and Denmark)

  As a result of the pandemic, the global economy is projected to contract sharply by –3% in 2020,
much worse than during the 2008–9 financial crisis (IMF, 2020).



                                                6
to 38% (Argentina). The mean change in the monetary interest rate due to the Covid-
19 crisis is -0.63%, with a range from -3.5% (Pakistan) to 0.15% (Denmark).8
Compared to previous crises, this crisis started with ultra-low levels of interest rates
among advanced economies after many years of declining rates.9 The mean initial
interest rate level among advanced economies in the Global Financial Crisis was around
4% (IMF, World Economic Outlook, April 2020), whereas in the pandemic crisis it is
around 0.5%. After the Global Financial Crisis, central banks in advanced economies
reduced rates by an average of 3%, compared to 0.3% in the Covid-19 crisis.

         The low central bank interest rate environment in advanced economies has led
monetary authorities to rely more on nonconventional monetary tools in the Covid-19
crisis (Baumeister and Benati, 2013; Borio and Zabai, 2016; Borio and Zabai, 2018;
Bernanke, 2020).
         Panel D reports summary statistics for nonconventional monetary policies
implemented by the countries in our data. Central bank guarantees amount on average
to 1.42% of GDP, with a standard deviation of 2.22%. Asset purchases as a percentage
of GDP due to the Covid-19 crisis is 2.11% on average, with a standard deviation of
2.88%.
         Advances economies used asset purchases extensively during and after the
Global Financial Crisis, leading to a marked increase in the size of central bank balance
sheets in recent years (IMF, 2020). In the current pandemic, central banks in several
advanced economies launched new large-scale asset purchase programs. The Federal
Reserve bought US Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities amounting to 4.5%
percent of GDP in order to ensure market functioning. The European Central Bank
(ECB) commenced a new €750 billion temporary public and private securities purchase
program, amounting to 6% of ECB countries’ GDP.
         In response to the Covid-19 crisis, 22% of the countries in our data lowered
their reserve requirements ratio, 31% implemented repo operations, and 73%
implemented at least one macroprudential policy tool.10 In addition, 39% imposed

   The macroprudential policy tools used most commonly are countercyclical capital buffers and LTV

restrictions on dividend payouts, bonus payments, or share buybacks by commercial
banks, and 86% eased lending restrictions for financial intermediaries.
       Panel E reports summary statistics on exchange rate interventions as a
percentage of GDP. The mean change in exchange rates policies is 1.16%, with a
standard deviation of 2.55%.

2.3 Comparing policy responses across countries

Table 3 presents the data arranging countries by income level measured as the average
log GDP per capita between 2016 and 2018. We split the data based on the median log
GDP per capita and report the statistics for countries that are either at or above the
median (high-income countries) and those that are below the median (low-income
countries). Panel A shows that there is a significant difference in the number of Covid-
19 cases until May 5 between high- and low-income countries, which we control for in
our regression analysis. Panel B shows that fiscal spending as a proportion of GDP is
higher in high-income countries. On average high-income countries announced fiscal
policies that amount to 6.8% of GDP compared to 3.1% in low-income countries (t-test
5.23). Similarly, government guarantees in high-income countries are 4.8% of GDP
compared to 0.6% in low-income countries (t-test 4.38). We have fewer observations
for the subcategories of fiscal policies, but the data suggest a similar pattern – in which
higher-income countries have implement larger fiscal programs relative to their GDP.
Fiscal programs directed at the healthcare sector are slightly higher in higher-income
countries as compared to lower-income countries (0.8% versus 0.5%, t-test -1.84).
Fiscal programs targeted toward households average 2.3% of GDP in high-income
countries compared to 1.1% in low-income countries (t-test 3.62). Fiscal programs
targeted toward businesses average 3.5% of GDP in high-income countries compared
to 1.2% in low-income countries (t-test 3.85).

       Panel C compares monetary policies between high- and low-income countries.
High-income countries had much lower interest rates before the outbreak of the Covid-
19 pandemic. The mean interest rate in high-income countries was 0.78% and ranged
from -0.75% (Switzerland and Denmark) to 4.25% (Qatar). In contrast, in low-income
countries the mean interest rate was 6.39% (t-test for equal mean 5.45). Given that low-
income countries had much higher interest rates before the crisis, it is not surprising
that they responded by lowering their rates more than high-income countries. The mean




                                            8
interest rate change in low-income countries was -0.84% compared to -0.43% in high-
income countries (t-test for equal means 2.56).

       Panel D compares nonconventional monetary policies between high- and low-
income countries. High-income countries also implemented larger nonconventional
monetary programs, including central bank guarantees (2.21% of GDP compared to
0.61%), financial assets purchases (3.76% compared to 0.43%), and reserve
requirements (0.14% compared to 0.31%). Panel D also shows that high-income
countries were more likely to loosen macroprudential restrictions on mortgage lending
– 91% of high-income countries loosened their policies as compared to 55% of low-
income countries. Also, high-income countries were more likely to impose restrictions
on dividend payments by banks (58% of high-income countries compared to 19% of
low-income countries). On the other hand, there are no significant differences between
high- and low-income countries in their propensity to change their repo operations or
ease lending requirements.

       Last, Panel E provides information on policies targeting exchange rates and
shows that high-income countries implemented more exchange rate policies as a
percent of GDP: 1.65% compared to 0.67% (t-test for equal means -1.78).

       Table 4 repeats the analysis presented in Table 3 using a different comparison
of countries. Instead of splitting countries by income, we use the IMF definition of
advanced economies versus emerging market and developing economies (IMF, 2020,
table 1.1). Our data include 35 advanced economies and 50 countries that are classified
as emerging market and developing economies.

       Similar to the results in Table 3, Panel A of Table 4 shows a significantly higher
number of Covid-19 cases in advanced economies compared to emerging market and
developing economies. Panel B of Table 4 shows that advanced economies
implemented larger fiscal policies relative to their GDPs. The mean fiscal spending of
advanced economies is 7.04% of GDP compared to 3.52% in emerging market and
developing economies. Likewise, government guarantees and healthcare, household,
and business spending are all higher (as a proportion of GDP) in advanced economies.
In the Global Financial Crisis, advanced economies spent 4% of GDP on fiscal policies.

       As Panel C of Table 4 shows, and similar to Table 3, advanced economies
entered the Covid-19 crisis with lower interest rates compared to emerging market and



                                           9
developing economies and lowered their rates less than emerging market and
developing economies. Panel D shows that advanced economies announced
significantly larger nonconventional monetary programs than emerging market and
developing economies. These programs include central bank guarantees, asset
purchases, macroprudential policies, and dividend distribution restrictions. Similar to
the results in Table 3, there are no significant differences between the two types of
countries in their propensity to change their repo operations or ease lending
requirements. However, emerging market and developing economies are more likely to
implement reserve requirement policies. Finally, as Panel E shows, advanced
economies spent on average 2.02% of their GDP on exchange rate interventions
compared to 0.56% by emerging market and developing economies (t-test for equal
means -2.69).

         Figure 1.A plots fiscal spending (as a percentage of GDP) and interest rate levels
before the Covid-19 crisis across countries sorted by fiscal spending from the highest
(United States) to the lowest (Sri Lanka). The figure illustrates two important facts: (1)
higher-income countries announced larger fiscal programs, and (2) higher-income
countries had much lower interest rates before the Covid-19 crisis, which likely left
them with little room to implement conventional monetary policies. In Figure 1.B we
extend the definition of fiscal policies to include government guarantees. Although this
extended definition changes the ranking of countries with the highest fiscal programs,
a similar pattern emerges: richer countries with low initial interest rate levels
implemented fiscal tools more heavily.11

         Figure 2 displays the pre-crisis interest rate level and the monetary response of
interest rate change (in absolute values) across countries. The figure shows that in
general, countries with higher initial levels of interest rates, mostly developed countries,
lowered their interest rates more as a response to the Covid-19 crisis.

         Figure 3 plots fiscal spending, including government guarantees, as a
percentage of GDP and interest rate changes (in absolute values) across countries. As
the figure clearly shows, countries that implemented policies of larger fiscal spending




11
  Figure 1.B includes the following fiscal tools: deferred and canceled taxes, strengthening the social
safety net, direct grants, wage subsidies, money transfers, income support, and government guarantees.



                                                  10
made smaller changes to their interest rates compared to countries that implemented
fewer fiscal policy tools.

           Finally, Panel A of Figure 4 illustrates the geographical patterns in the
preexisting levels of interest rates, and Panel B displays the geographical distribution
of Covid-19-related fiscal spending around the world.

3. Determinants of fiscal and monetary policies

In this section, we present cross-sectional results on the determinants of fiscal and
monetary policies responses during the Covid-19 crisis.

3.1 Fiscal policy

Table 5 examines the effects of a battery of several macroeconomic variables on Covid-
19-related fiscal policy. The dependent variable is the ratio of total fiscal spending
(excluding government guarantees) to GDP. The first six columns of Table 5 report
results from univariate regressions of fiscal spending on several macrovariables. As
column 1 of Table 5 shows, and consistent with Table 3, there is a positive correlation
between GDP per capita and fiscal policy: advanced economies and richer countries are
more likely to implement higher fiscal spending because they have more debt
sustainability. 12 The univariate analysis also shows positive correlations between fiscal
policy and the log number of Covid-19 cases (column 4) because richer countries
experienced larger number of Covid-19 cases up to May 5; sovereign credit rating
(column 5), which means that higher credit rating is positively correlated with higher
fiscal spending because high-income countries have better credit ratings; and
government expenses relative to GDP (column 6).
           After establishing the univariate correlations in the data, we move to a
multivariate framework in which we run a “horse race” among the macrovariables.
Column 7 reports results from a multivariate regression that includes all six variables
used in columns 1–6. We find that the four variables that remain correlated in a
statistically significant manner with fiscal spending in a multivariate analysis are: (1)
log GDP per capita, (2) debt-to-GDP ratio, (3) sovereign credit rating, and (4)
government expenditure to GDP ratio. A one standard deviation increase in the log of
GDP per capita (1.27) is associated with a 2.12 percentage point increase in fiscal


12
     All the macrovariables are measured pre-Covid-19 crisis.



                                                    11
spending as a percentage of GDP, representing a 42.6% increase relative to the
unconditional mean of 4.97%. Similarly, a one standard deviation increase in debt to
GDP ratio (35.9) is associated with a 1.43 percentage point increase in fiscal spending,
representing a 28.8% increase relative to the mean. Moreover, a one standard deviation
increase in credit rating (4.39) is associated with a 28.3% increase in fiscal spending
relative to the mean. Last, a one standard deviation increase in government expenditure
to GDP (10.64) is associated with a 1.1 percentage point decline in fiscal spending as a
percentage of GDP – or 22.7% relative to the mean.

       In column 8 of Table 5 we use the broader definition of fiscal policy that
includes government guarantees as the dependent variable. We obtain similar results
for GDP per capita ratio, debt-to-GDP ratio, and sovereign credit rating variables. All
three are significantly positively correlated with fiscal spending. However, the
government expenditure to GDP ratio is no longer correlated with fiscal spending when
we use the broader definition that includes government guarantees.

       Japan is an outlier observation with the highest level of debt-to-GDP in our
sample (235%) and fiscal spending of 23% of GDP. We drop Japan from the analysis
and re-estimate the specifications in columns 7 and 8. When we use the narrower
definition of fiscal policy, the point estimate of debt-to-GDP is 0.015 and is statistically
insignificant (column 9). However, when we use the broad definition of fiscal policy,
which includes government guarantees, the coefficient of debt-to-GDP is still positive
(0.046) and statistically significant even when we drop Japan from the sample (column
10). Given that Japan is such an outlier we drop it from most of the analyses presented
in the paper.

       The positive correlation between fiscal policy during the Covid-19 crisis and
debt-to-GDP contrasts with the pre-Covid-19 evidence showing that countries with
lower levels of public debt can more easily provide fiscal stimulus to avert a detrimental
simultaneous retrenchment of private and public spending (Jorda et al., 2016, Romer
and Romer 2018, and 2019).

       In Table 6 we further explore the determinants of fiscal spending by focusing
on policies aimed at private businesses. As in Table 5, we run univariate regressions
(columns 1–6) as well as a multivariate “horse race” among the macrovariables (column
7). We have detailed information on fiscal spending on businesses for 48 countries. The



                                            12
results reported in Table 6 are similar to those in Table 5. The main determinant of
fiscal spending is the pre-crisis sovereign credit rating. A one standard deviation
increase in credit rating (4.39) is associated with a 2.13 percentage point increase in the
fiscal spending, or a 84% increase relative to the mean fiscal stimulus to private
businesses.

3.2 Monetary policy

We next analyze the determinants of traditional monetary policy – that is, central bank
interest rates. We estimate cross-country regressions of the change in central bank
interest rates (in absolute value) using a number of country-level variables and report
the results in Table 7. The variables that have statistical significant univariate
correlations with the change in interest rates are: log population (column 2); sovereign
credit rating (column 5); government expenses relative to GDP (column 6); and the
level of the central bank interest rate before the outbreak of the Covid-19 crisis (column
7).

       Column 8 reports the results from a multivariate analysis of the effect of the
macro variables on interest rate change. Two variables are significantly correlated with
monetary policy: (1) government expenses relative to GDP are negatively correlated
with interest rate changes; and (2) the level of the central bank interest rate before the
crisis is positively correlated with interest rate changes during the crisis. That is,
countries with a higher central bank interest rate before the crisis cut their rate more
during the crisis. In terms of economic magnitude, a one standard deviation increase in
the government expenses to GDP (10.64) is associated with a 0.21 percentage point
decrease compared to the mean change of 0.63 percentage point. In terms of the pre-
crisis central bank interest rate, a one percentage point higher interest rate before the
crisis is associated with a change in the interest rate of 11% relative to the mean.

3.3 Government guarantees as a fiscal policy tool

In addition to direct fiscal payments, some countries implemented a package of
government guarantees – that is, loans that are either fully or partially insured by the
government in the event of default by the borrower. These government-guaranteed
loans are mostly targeted toward small to medium enterprises (SMEs) and industries
directly affected by Covid-19. The goal of this policy is to alleviate frictions in credit
markets and facilitate lending by financial intermediaries to distressed borrowers.



                                            13
        Government guarantees differ across countries in both size and scope – in
particular, in the percentage of the loan that the government guarantees. For example,
in Belgium, the government guarantees up to 80% of the loan, whereas in Australia,
government guarantees are up to 50% of the loan amount. Government guarantees can
be classified as part of fiscal policy because they are funded by fiscal authorities rather
than by the central bank.

        Table 8 presents information on the relative size of government guarantees for
the countries with the largest government guarantee programs relative to their GDP.
The table reports the share of government guarantees to GDP as well as the scope of
coverage of these guarantees – relative to the loan amount. Italy announced the largest
government guarantee program, amounting to 25% of GDP, followed by Germany
(23%), Czech Republic (16%), United Kingdom (14%), France (14%), Luxembourg
(13%), and Belgium (11%). The 18 countries listed in Table 8 account for 76% of all
government guarantees in our data. The only developing economy listed in Table 8 is
Colombia, with a government guarantee program that amounts to 7% of GDP. Most of
the countries that implemented government guarantees are in Europe, likely since their
monetary and traditional credit tools are controlled by the ECB and due to the low levels
of interest rates and their high debt-to-GDP ratio. The table also lists the scope of the
guarantees in each program. Among the 18 countries, the average scope of government
guarantees is about 80%, with Australia being the country with the lowest scope of
guarantees (50%) and Switzerland the highest (up to 100%).

4. The Confluence of Fiscal and Monetary Policies

In this section, we present cross-sectional results on the joint determination of fiscal
and monetary policies and their confluence.

4.1 The effect of pre-Covid-19 interest rate on fiscal policy

We hypothesize that countries with low interest rates will be more likely to resort to
fiscal policy in the crisis since their ability to use traditional monetary tools is limited.
A growing literature analyzes the potential effects of fiscal stimulus when nominal
interest rates are at the zero-lower bound. For example, Almunia et al., 2010 argue that
fiscal stimulus is most effective when banking systems are dysfunctional and monetary
policy is constrained by the zero bound. Similarly, Christiano et al., 2011 argue that




                                             14
fiscal multipliers can be much larger than one around the zero lower bound of interest
rate.13
          Specifically, we estimate the following baseline regression specification:

     (1) 𝐹𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑃𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑎𝑔𝑒+ = 𝛼/ + 𝛼1 × 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠_𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒+ + 𝑋+ 𝛽 + 𝑒+ ,

where the dependent variable is the ratio of total fiscal spending to GDP.14 Table 9
presents results from estimating different variants of the model with robust standard
errors (in parentheses). Our specifications control for country-level variables that are
included in the vector 𝑋+ .15 Our main coefficient of interest is 𝛼1 , which measures the
effect of the central bank interest rate level before the crisis on fiscal spending.

          In Table 9, column 1, we use GDP per capita, the number of Covid-19 cases,
and the central bank interest rate as our explanatory variables. As column 1 shows, the
level of interest rate before the policy is negative but statistically insignificant. When
we add debt-to-GDP and credit rating as additional explanatory variables (column 2),
only GDP per capita and credit rating are statistically significant. Column 3 shows that
a one standard deviation increase in credit rating (4.39) is associated with a 1.27
percentage point increase in the size of the fiscal policy implemented due to Covid-19,
or 25.6% relative to the mean. Also, a one standard deviation increase in the level of
government expenditures to GDP before the crisis is associated with a 0.8 percentage
point decline in the size of the fiscal policy, representing a 16% decline relative to the
unconditional mean. This finding suggests that countries with higher government
expenditures before the crisis either did not need or could not afford to spend much
during the crisis. In column 4 we add to the regression a dummy variable that equals
one for countries with an initial interest rate below 1% and zero otherwise. We use this
specification to capture the differential effect of near-zero interest rates on fiscal policy.
As column 4 demonstrates, neither variable pertaining to the level of the interest rates
is significant in explaining fiscal spending. Other work also points to monetary policy
accommodation being less effective when public debt to GDP is high, such as De Luigi
and Huber, 2018, who find that expansionary monetary policy helps stabilize an

bound.

   Fiscal policy package implemented by each country from the beginning of the crisis until May 5,
2020.
15
   Given our earlier discussion about Japan we drop it from the sample.



                                                 15
economy in a downturn, but has a lesser effect when the economy is in a high public
debt-to-GDP regime.

           To further investigate the robustness of the effects of credit rating and debt-to-
GDP on fiscal spending we replicate the analysis presented in column 2 of Table 9 in
Appendix Table A.1. As column 1 of Table A.1. shows, when we include Japan the
coefficient of debt-to-GDP is positive and significant (0.033) but it is close to zero and
insignificant when we exclude Japan (column 2) or exclude Japan and Greece (column
3).16 In columns 4 and 5 of Table A.1. we estimate the specification in column 3 using
the jackknife and bootstrap methods to estimate standard errors, respectively. Columns
6-10 of Table A.1. repeat the analysis using the specification reported in column 4 of
Table 9 and obtain similar results. That is, the pre-crisis sovereign credit rating and
GDP per capita are always significant economically and statistically in explaining fiscal
spending. Also, the effect of debt-to-GDP on fiscal spending is close to zero when we
drop Japan from the sample.

           In Table 10 we present results from estimating regression (1) using the broader
definition of fiscal policy that includes government guarantees with robust standard
errors in parentheses. As column 1 illustrates, the interest rate level before the Covid-
19 crisis is negatively correlated with fiscal spending and is statistically significant. An
interest rate that was one percentage point higher before the crisis is associated with a
0.17 percentage point lower fiscal policy package, representing a 2% decline relative
to the unconditional mean. When we include debt-to-GDP in the regression (column
2), the interest rate level is still significantly negative. When we add credit rating and
government expenditures as additional explanatory variables (column 3), the effect of
the initial interest rate level is much smaller and becomes insignificant. The effect of
credit rating on broader fiscal policy that includes government guarantees is even higher
than its effect on fiscal policy absent government guarantees: column 3 shows that a
one standard deviation increase in credit rating (4.39) is associated with a 2 percentage
point increase in the size of the fiscal policy, representing 26.1% relative to the mean.

           In column 4 we add to the regression a dummy variable that equals one for
countries with an interest rate below 1% and zero otherwise. As column 4 shows, the
effect of the low-interest-rate dummy on the measure of fiscal spending that includes


16
     Greece is the country with the second highest pre-crisis debt-to-GDP ratio in our sample (180%).



                                                    16
government guarantees is positive and statistically significant suggesting that countries
at the zero lower bound deployed larger fiscal policies in the form of guarantees. In
contrast to the results in Table 9, and despite that we have excluded Japan from the
analysis, the debt-to-GDP ratio is a significant positive determinant of fiscal spending.
A one standard deviation increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio increases the fiscal policy
that includes government guarantees by 1.6 percentage point.

         We repeat the analysis in columns 2 and 4 of Table 10 in Appendix Table A.2.
and use the same specifications and estimations as in Table A.1. We find a positive
coefficient of debt-to-GDP in 7 out of 10 regressions even when we exclude Japan and
Greece and use jackknife and bootstrap procedures to estimate standard errors. These
results contrast sharply with prior evidence (Jorda et al., 2016, Romer and Romer, 2018,
and 2019), suggesting that the Covid-19 crisis is different and that the traditional
“fiscal-space” argument does not explain the ability of countries to deploy fiscal
expansionary policies during this crisis.

         We rerun regression (1) using the fiscal policy targeted for businesses as our
dependent variable and report the results in Table 11. Similar to the analysis in Table
9, the effect of the interest rate on fiscal policy is negative and insignificant (column 1).
As in our earlier analysis, the debt-to-GDP ratio and credit rating are significant
determinants of fiscal policy for businesses (column 3).17

4.2 Determinants of nonconventional monetary policy during the Covid-19 crisis

Given that interest rates in many advanced economies were at their lowest historical
levels at the outbreak of the Covid-19 crisis, policymakers in these countries had to rely
more heavily on nonconventional monetary tools. We now analyze the determinants of
nonconventional monetary policy tools during the crisis.
         We estimate the following baseline regression specification:

     (2) 𝑁𝑜𝑛 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑦 𝑃𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑦+ = 𝛼/ + 𝛼1 × 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡_𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒+ + 𝑋+ 𝛽 + 𝑒+ .

We use eight dependent variables, each capturing a different nonconventional monetary
policy and exchange rate policy tool. These measures are: (1) central bank guarantees
to GDP; (2) financial asset purchases as a percentage of GDP; (3) reserve requirements


17
   It is important to note that debt-to-GDP is positive and significant in column 3 although we drop
Japan from the sample.



                                                  17
easing (a dummy variable that takes the value of one if the central bank eases reserve
requirements, and zero otherwise); (4) repo operations (a dummy variable that takes the
value of one if the country uses repo operations, and zero otherwise); (5) loosening of
macroprudential policy18 (a dummy variable that takes the value of one if a country
loosens its macroprudential policy tools, and zero otherwise); (6) payout restrictions19
(a dummy variable that takes the value of one if a country restricts dividend payment
by banks, and zero otherwise); (7) easing loan payments20 (a dummy variable that takes
the value of one if loan repayments are eased, and zero otherwise); and (8) the ratio of
exchange rate intervention relative to GDP.

         Our main explanatory variable is each country’s central bank interest rate level
before the crisis. Table 12 presents the results from estimating model (3). All
specifications also control for the GDP-per-capita, log Covid-19 cases, and government
expenditure to GDP ratios. Given that we are not using debt-to-GDP as an explanatory
variable we also include Japan in the analysis. Our main coefficients of interest are the
different 𝛼1 in each of the models, which measure the effect of the central bank interest
rate level on each of the nonconventional monetary policy tools.

         As Table 12 demonstrates, the interest rate level has a significant effect on six
of the eight nonconventional monetary policy tools. A higher interest rate level is
negatively correlated with central bank guarantees as a percentage of GDP (column 1).
In other words, central banks with low interest rates before the Covid-19 pandemic are
more likely to implement guarantees due to the crisis. A one percentage point higher
interest rate before the crisis is associated with a reduction of 0.06 (4.5% relative to the
mean) in central bank guarantees relative to GDP. Similarly, a higher pre-crisis interest
rate is negatively and statistically significant correlated with asset purchases (column
2). A one percentage point higher interest rate before the crisis is associated with 0.11%
lower amount of asset purchases by the central bank due to the crisis, representing a 5%
decline relative to the unconditional mean.21 Also, the interest rate level has a

18
   Most common macroprudential tools that were loosen are: countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB), LTV
limits, capital requirements, debt-service-to-income (DSTI) ratio, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.
19
   Restrictions on dividend distribution (or buy back shares) imposed on banks in order to boost capital
and support lending during the Covid-19 crisis.
20
   Easing borrowers’ loan repayments, for households and businesses. These include grace periods or
extended maturity. The payment break will not affect borrowers’ credit records and recordings on the
credit registries.
21
   See Borio and Zabai, 2016 and BIS, 2019a, and 2019b for more detailed descriptions on the
implementation of large-scale asset purchases.



                                                  18
significant negative effect on implementing macroprudential policy (column 5) and on
dividend distribution policy (column 6). A one percentage point higher interest rate
before the crisis is associated with lower propensities of easing macroprudential tools
or restricting dividend payments. Overall, countries with lower interest rates before the
crisis are more likely to implement nonconventional monetary policies as a response to
the Covid-19 crisis.

       The sole exception is the reserve requirements tool. As column 3 of Table 12
shows, a higher interest rate before the Covid-19 crisis has a positive and statistically
significant effect on the likelihood of loosening reserve requirements. Table 12 also
shows that the interest rate level before the crisis is not correlated with implementing
repo operations (column 4) and implementing exchange rate policy (column 8).

5. Conclusion

       This paper analyzes the determinants of fiscal and monetary policies during the
Covid-19 crisis. We find that high-income countries announced larger fiscal policies
than lower-income countries. We also find that a country’s credit rating is the most
important determinant of its fiscal spending during the Covid-19 pandemic. High-
income countries entered the crisis with historically low interest rates, and as a result
they lowered their rates less than low-income countries and were more likely to use
nonconventional monetary policy tools. Our findings demonstrate that the ability to
deploy fiscal policies when short-term rates are ultra-low is limited by a country’s
access to credit markets. These findings raise the concern that countries with poor credit
histories – those with lower credit ratings and, in particular, lower-income countries –
will not be able to use fiscal policy tools effectively during economic crises.

                           variable receives a negative sign if a country lowered
                           the interest rates due to the crises and zero if there
                           was no change in the interest rate. Denmark is the

Note: This table presents the results from regressions of fiscal spending as a percentage of GDP on a battery of macro-
economic variables. The dependent variable is the ratio of fiscal spending (excluding government guarantees) to GDP. The
first six columns report results from univariate regressions of fiscal spending on macro variables. Column 7 reports results
from a multivariate regression that includes all six variables used in columns 1-6. Column 8 uses a broader definition
of fiscal policy that includes government guarantees as the dependent variable. Columns 9 and 10 report results from
multivariate regressions shown in columns 7 and 8, respectively, but exclude Japan from the sample. Significance at the
1%, 5%, and 10% levels is indicated by ***, **, and *, respectively.

Note: This table presents the results from regressions of the change in the central bank interest rate on a battery
of macro-economic variables. The dependent variable is the change in the central bank interest rate (in absolute
value). The first seven columns report results from univariate regressions of monetary policy on macro variables.
Column 8 reports results from a multivariate regression that includes all seven variables used in columns 1-7. The
regressions reported in this table exclude Japan from the sample. Significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels is
indicated by ***, **, and *, respectively.
