                          FEAR OF NUCLF.AR WAR AND
              INTERCOUNTR? DIFFERENCES IN THE RATE OF SAVING


                                 ANIM

     This paper demonstrates that a survey—based measure of the perceived

likelihood of nuclear war in a country is negatively correlated with the

country's rate of net private saving, holding other determinants of saving

constant. This result is established using date on twenty OCCO countries for

the period 1981—4. The measure of the perceived likelihood of nuclear war is

celculeted from surveys conducted in each country by the Gallup Internetional

Research Institutes. The magnitude of the estimated' effect Is large,

suggesting that en Increase of 10 percent in the fraction of the population

that believes a world war is likely is associated with a decline of 4.1

'percentage points in the net private saving rate,

     This finding is consistent with other evidence based on U.S. aggregate

time series end cross-individual data suggesting that fear of nuclear war

decreases savings. That proposition has profound implications for the

interpretation of the performance of the post-nuclear world economy.

                     tntercountry Differences in the Rate of Saving


1. introduction

     Thin paper investigates the hypothesis that an increased fear of a cata-

strophic nuclear war, by reducing the expected horizon, reduces the rate of

saving. This hypothesis, first proposed in Slearnd (1982). ia consistent with

U.S. postwar saving behavior. Holding other determinants of saving constant1

two separata indicee of fear nf nuclear war have a statistically significant

negative correlation with the U.S. net private saving rste since 1948 (Sleisrod,

1986). Nendershott and Peek (1985, 1987), using several alternative definition,

of saving and investigating other influencas on saving, also find that increased

fear has tended to reduce ssiing in the postwar U.S. econoey. Ruaaett and

Lsckay (1985) find no consistent relationship between savings and fear of war

at the aggregate level for several advanced countries. However, using individ—

nal data from the U.S. National Election Survey, they find that, for individ—

usia who did some saving, actual saving is negatively related to fear of nu-

clear. war to a statistically significant extent. Xuasett and Lackey conclude

that the moat appropriate data set is consiatent with the hypothesis that fsar

of nuclear    war reduces saving.1

     Can    differences   in the percsived likelihood of nuclear war also explain

intercountry differences in saving behavior! The analysis preaented in this

paper,   based on's    recent   intarnatiànsi survey of attitudes concerning the like-
lihood of    world   war, auggests that the answsr to this question is yes. Holding


'Stewart and Venieris (1985) find empirical support for a related hypothssis.
 that sociopolitical instability reduces the saving rate of developing
 countries.
other deterrainanta of saving constant, a country's saving rate is lower the

greater is the fractinn of its population that believes a world war ia imminent.


2, Data and Results

        in recent years the Gallup Internattonal Research Institutes has annually

conducted a poll    in   as many ae thirty—three countries concerning attttudee

about    the likelihood of world war.2 The poll in each country asks a random
sample of individuals to assess on a 0 to 10 scale the likelihood of a world

war breaking nut in the next ten years.3

        Table 1 ranks the countries surveyed in 1986 according to the fraction of

respondents who felt that the chance of world war wee 50 percent of greater

within the next ten years. Moat       striking to a student of saving behavior is
that    the U.S. stands at the top of the list, with 49 percent of the respondents

indicating at least a 50—SO chance of a world war occurring within ten years.

Also of special interest is that Japan, which has had exceptionally high eaving

rates, is nest the bottom of the list with only 15 percent of those interviewed

professing to a high fear of world war.



2At lesst for Americans, the interpretation of the term world war as a cata-
 strophic nuclear exchange is not in doubt. According to eurvey evidence,
 throughout the postwar period over 60 percent of Americana believed that a
 world war would involve nuclear weapons, and as many ea 60 percent viewed
 their chances of surviving such a nuclear exchange as poor. See Slemrod
 (1996). The interpretation of the term world war may, however, vary by
 country, especially considering the difficulty of precise tranelstion into
 other languages. To the extent that the interpretation vsries across coun-
 tries, the survey results measure with error the perception of a war of con-
 stant magnitude.

 3The precise wordingof the question was: I'd like your opinion of the
  chances of a world war breaking out in the nert 10 years. If 10 means it is
 absolutely certain that a world wmr will break out and zero means that there
 is no chance of a world war breaking out, where on this scale 0f 10 to zero
 would you rate the chances of world      war breaking nut in the next ten yearaV'

     The analysis that folLows compares the survey responses concerning the

likelihood of a world war to average saving rates in twenty of the thirty—three

countries listed in Table 1 nver the period 1991 to 1984. These twenty are the

DECO (Organization of Rconneiic Cooperation and Development) member countries

both covered by the Gallup survey and tor which deta on net private savings are

available.4 The sample was restricted to 080 member countries becauae stan-

dardized and relatively reliable national income data are available, and he—

cause of the difficulty in comparing the characteristics of countries in radi-

cally different stages of development. The sample period of 1981 to 1984 was

chosen because it is the umost recent period for which both saving and survey

data are available. tt is appropriate to consider data averaged over several

years because it minimizes the importance of cyclical factors irrelevant to the

hypothesis being studied.

     Table 2 presents the average net private aeving tate end the Index of the

perceived likelihood of world warover the period 1981 to 1984 for these twenty

countries,5 and Figure 1 graphs these date. The points corresponding to the

six largest countries in the sample are highlighted. The data for these six

countries, in particular, seem to indicate a negative association between the

net private caving rate snd the index of fear of war.

     This apparent association is confirmed in a weighted least—squares regres-

sion explaining the average net private saving rate expressed as a percentage,


OECO member countries New Zealand, Portugal, Turkey, and Yugoslavia were omit-
 ted because of the unavailability of data on net private savings. tceland was
 not included in the Gallup survey.

 of war to be the fraction of respondents who regiatered an opinion that said
 that the chance of war was 50—50 or greater. All the regresaione were also
 run with en altsnattve index, the average percentage chance of war indiceted
 by those who registered an opinion. None of the conclueiona discussed In the
 text depend on which index ia chosen.

          As Figure 1 suggests, there is a statistically significant negative corre-

    lation between the net private saving rate and the likelihood of war index.

    The regression line corresponding to equation CL) is shown in Figure 1.      The

    magnitode of the estimated coefficient indicates that a decline of ten points

          The analysis is next expended to include other determinants of a country's

    sawing rate. Several studies of intercoontry differences in saving behavior

    exist, ist notmbly Hnuthakkar (1961. 1965), Modigliani (1910), Feldetein

    (1977, 1980), Sarro and MacDonald (1979), Kapits and Gotur (1980). Modigliani

    and Sterling (1983), and Hnrioks (1986). 9esed on the life—cycle model of sav-

    ing, they have examined the effect on eaving of both demographic factors and

    government policies such ma the social security program. These studies differ

     saving rate represented an average of independent units, with e homngenous

and specification, and the results are not entirety consistent across studies.

      As a basis fur studying the effect on saving of fear of nuclear war, 1

study an undated version of the savings function estimated by Feldetein (1980),

which is representative of the other studies' methodology. I then investigate

the effect of introducing into the equation the index of the perceived Likeli-

hood of wsr. Fsldstein estimsted the following equation on a sample of 12 QEGO

countries, using data from the 1950's:

where C is the growth rate of total real private national income, AGE is the

ratio of the number of retirees aged 65 or over to the population aged 20 to        -




65, DEF is the ratio of the number of persons under 20 to the working age popu-
lation, B/S is the benefit replacement ratio of the social security progran,

end LPACED is the labor force participation rate of men 65 or order. Three

principal changes were made to Feldstein'e analysis. First, the data are up-

dated to reflect more recent conditions. Second, due to data conetrsints, the

measure of the generosity of social security is the ratio of public pension

benefits pet person over 65 to per capita private national income (denoted

SOCSEC), instead of the benefit replacement ratio. Finally, the sample of

countries studied is expanded from twelve to twenty.7

      The results of estimating this saving equation with and without WAR as en

explanatory variable are displayed in Table 3. The second column of Table 3

shows that, without WAR, the explanatory variables are not very successful in


 7dnother methodologicsl difference is that Feldstein used two—stage least—
  equares to account for the endogeneity of LPACED. The results, though, are
  not significantly different fron those obtained with OLS. Finally, Feldstetn
  weighted the observations by the country's population, rather then the square
  root of population.

explaining intercountry differences in net private saving rates, The rate of

income growth. C, is negatively associated with saving, in contrast to most

previous studtes, although its estimated coefficient is not significantly

different than cern. Neither of the estimated coefficients on the variables

reflecting the age structure of the pnpulation, ACE and DEP. are significantly

different than zero. Hoet previous studies found both to be negatively asso-

ciated with the saving rate. The estimated coefficient on the social security

variable, SOCSEC, is close in zero. This finding is at odds with the negative

coefficient found by Feldstein (197?, 1980), although neither Bsrro and

MacDonald (1979) nor Modiglieni sod Sterling (1983) corroborated this tesolt.

The estimated coefficient on LPAGED is positive (though not significsnt), fail-

ing to support the prediction of f he life—cycle theory and in contrast with

earlier empirical results. tn sum, while Feldsteio (1960) foold all five coef—

fictents to be statistically significant and consistent with the qualitative

predictions of the extended life cycle model, these same conclusions do not

follow from this updated and slightly revised version of the eaae model.8

     When WAR is included in the regression eqoatlon, its estimated coefficient

Ia negative snd statistically significant, and is therefore consistent with the



81t is difficult to pinpoint why the results reported in table 3 differ eo
 greatly froa the resolts reported in peldetein (1960). Merely updating the
 saving rates used by Feldatein does not substantially change the results, nor
 does the difference in the weighting scheme. However, updating C, ACE, and
 DEP, or changing 6/E to en updated SOCSEC does change the results markedly.
 Furthermore, the results reported In table 3 change drastically when the
 sample is restricted to the same twelve countries studied by Feldetein. Thus,
  any of a number of changes in the analysis is sufficient to cause the results
  to differ significantly. It is Interesting to note that, in en appendix to
  Feldatein (1960). Charles Horioka concluded that the difference between the
  findings of Bairn and MacDonald (1979) and Feldstein (1977) concerning the
  effect on saving of social aecurity was caused In part bf differences in
  specification, sample of countries, variable definitions, data sources, and
  time period.

hypothesis that increased fear of war reduces a country's rate of saving. The

magnitude of the estimated effect is large1 indicating that an increase of 10

percent in the fraction of the population that believes a world war is likely

is associated with a decLine of 4. L percentage potnts in ths net private saving

rate. lncludtng thia variable also changes the sign of the estimated coeffi-

cients on LPAGED, fron positive to the negative coefficient found by Feldeiein

and others. With WAR included, all of the estimated coefficienta except that

of 0 have the same sign as estimated by Feldstein, although nnly the coefficient

on ACE is significantly different than zero at the 9Sf level of confidence.

     Several variations of the baaic eatimation strategy were investigated to

test the robuatneee of the finding with reapect to changes in specification.

Weighting the obeervations by population, aa done by Feldatein ([977. 1980) and

Rorioka (1986), rather than the square root of population, increased the abso-

lute magnitude of the coefficient on WAR to 0.44 and substantially decreased

its standard error. The signs of the other estimated coefficients did not

change, but coefficienta except that on C became mare than one and a half times

their standard errora.9 Estimating the equation with unweighted ordinary

leaat—aguaree does weaken the qualitative conclusions. The estimated coeff i—

cient on the WAR variable becomea —0.219 with a atandatd error of 0.200. The

negative relationship between SI Y and WAR also survives the addition of the

several other potential influences on saving. One of special interest is the

level of real national income which, in the abaence of the WAR variable, has a

significant negAtive association with the saving rate. When WAR is iocluded,

thta association disappears and WAR tetaina a significant negative aasociation.



9Changiog to weighting by population does not, though, reacue the equation
 without the WAR variable, which still has no estimated coefficient aignifi—
 cantly different than zero and of the sign found by Faldstein.

including as an explaoatnry variable the fraction of gross   nattonal   product

devoted to military spending did not affect the sam result, end it attracted a

negative sign not significantly different then zero. Finally, the analysis

was repeated excluding the U.S. from the sample. The estimated coefficient on

WAR was not much changed (—0.430). although the standard error increased to

0.097. The negative coefficient remained significantly different from zero.


3. Conclusion

     This paper establishes than an index of the perceived likelihood of nuclear

war in a country ma negatively correlated with the country's rate of net pri-

vate saving, holding other deterisioanta of saving constant. This finding is

thus consistent with other evidence based on 11.5. aggregate time series and

cross—individual data suggesting that feet of nuclear war decreases saving.

That proposition has profound implicationa for our   interpretation of   the per-

formance of the poet—nuclear world economy, and thus deserves further attentton

and etudy by economists.
