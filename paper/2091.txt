          New Developments in Corporate Finance and Tax Avoidance:
                               Some Evidence


                                  ABSTRACT

      The financial behavior of corporations has changed greatly in the last
 ten years. Previously most of the cash that stockholders received from
corporations took the form of dividends, and economists' models that have
div-idends as the ultimate determinant of equity values were not far off the
mark. This paper documents how much things have changed. There are strong
tax incentives for nondividend cash payments between corporations and
shareholders. These payments can take the form of a repurchase by the company
of its own shares, or the acquisition of the shares in another company.
     There has been tremendous growth in the magnitude of nondividend cash
payments. In the early 1970s these payments amounted to roughly 15 percent of
dividends. By 1984, they exceeded dividends, and in 1985 the amounted to $120
billion, or almost 50 percent more than total dividends in the economy.
     The paper shows that dividends per unit equity have not fallen.  Rather,
the acquisition of equity has allowed firms to retain relatively constant debt
equity ratios in the past five years despite strong equity markets. Firms
have chosen to absorb equity and issue debt, roughly holding leverage
constant, and have thus saved large amounts of taxes.
     The paper estimates that the cost to the Treasury of treating share
purchase payments differently than dividends was more than $25 billion in
1985. It also finds that future corporate tax collections are
                                                                significantly
reduced by the resulting decline in corporate equity.
     The paper suggests that the existing model of dividend driven equity
valuation must be discarded. It simply is not consistent with the facts.
Further research on the form of payments between firms and their shareholders
is clearly merited.

                     NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN CORPORATE FINANCE
                       AND TAX AVOIDANCE: SOME EVIDENCE

        do you Mr. Jones." Ballad of a Thin Man, Bob Dylan, 1965.

      The financial behavior of corporations has changed greatly in the last

 ten years. Previously, most of the cash that stockholders received from

corporations took the form of dividends, and the dividend cash flow was the

ultimate determinant of the value of equities.     Recently, as this paper will

document, dividends have been surpassed by nondividend cash distributions to

shareholders. These distributions are the sum of share repurchases and cash

mergers. In 1985, more than half of the money received by shareholders from

corporations was for the acquisition of shares.

     The growth of nondividend cash payments to shareholders has major

consequences for our understanding of share valuation and investment, as well

as for revenue projections of the U.S. Treasury. In particular, the fact that

the financial behavior of companies has changed so significantly (and without

much recognition) calls into question the forecasts that the new tax law will

increase corporate tax collections by $120 billion. In order to predict tax

collections in a new tax environment, one has to understand the behavior of

firms. And, in terms of payments to stockholders, the times are changing.

    Dividends have been central to economists' models of the valuation of

corporate equity. In fact, the value of a share of a corporation's stock is
                                     —2—



taken to be the present discounted value of future cash payments to be

received by the owners of that share, where those cash payments are taken to

be dividends. Further, the value of equity is important to the economy. One

leading model of corporate investment has investment depending crucially on

the financial valuation of the firm (see, for example, Tobin (1969) or Summers

(1981)). Thus, we have dividends being the fundamental determinant of share

value and share value being an important factor in the strength of investment.

     There are problems, however, with pursuing this line of reasoning

further. Certainly, the financial valuation of the firm is the present value

of the properly discounted stream of cash payments returned to investors. The

first problem with the model driven by dividends is that a large fraction of

the cash payments to stockholders do not take the form of dividends, as this

paper will document. Presumably, these other cash payments are determinants

of the value of corporate equity. The second problem is that, as a

profession, we do not have a very good explanation for the payment of

dividends in the first place. Under the current tax code, dividends are a

distinctly tax-disadvantaged way to transmit cash between the firm and its

investors relative to other available financial strategies. Their existence

presumably indicates either that dividends convey a valuable signal to

stockholders about the management's perception of future earnings prospects

(Miller and Rock (1984)) or that the payment of dividends restricts the

actions of management in a nianner which helps reduce the control problems

brought about by the separation of management and ownership (Jensen and

Meckling (1976)). Whether these explanations are adequate to account for the

actual level of dividends, given their tax handicap, has continued to be
                                       —3-


 debated.

      The tax problem with equity financing in general, and dividend paying

 equity in particular, is that two levels of taxation must be paid on the

 incremental earnings resulting from investments financed by these means.

 First, the corporation income tax applies with a federal marginal tax rate of

 46 percent. Second, the remaining 54 percent of earnings are subject to the

 personal income tax if the investor is a household and if the funds are paid

 out as a dividend. Even if the money is retained at the corporate level, it

 will be implicitly taxed; the market will capitalize the fact that eventually

 it will be subject to personal dividend taxation when it is remitted to

 shareholders. Thus, an after corporate tax dollar in the corporate treasury

will be valued at less than a dollar. If dividends are the only means of

returning cash to investors, an after corporate tax dollar will be valued at

the ratio of one minus the marginal personal tax rate of shareholders to one

minus the effective marginal tax rate on accrued capital gains. However, the

assumption that dividends are the only way to return cash to a firm's

financiers is incorrect.

     An alternative strategy, of course, is to use debt finance.   Its

advantage is that interest payments are deductible from the corporation income

tax and thus the return to debtholders is subject to only personal taxation.

Most models of optimal corporate financial structure involve the firm trading

off the tax advantages of debt against its inflexibility and hence the

increased chance of incurring the costs associated with bankruptcy.1     The

taxation of debt at the personal level may be reduced by the use of pension

funds and other retirement accumulation tax shelters.

     Even for equity, there are ways other than dividends to return cash to

stockholders which involve far lower total taxes and, therefore, more value to

investors. One such method is the repurchase of shares by the company. In

the absence of information problems between stockholders and management, and

in the absence of taxes and transaction costs, dividends and share repurchase

programs are equivalent. If a company uses the same amount of money to buy

back shares or pay dividends, the total value of the firm will be the same

after either transaction. It will have the same debt-equity ratio, the same

real assets, the same opportunities, and therefore the same value. In the

share repurchase case, each shareholder can sell sufficient shares to match

the cash flow he would have received in the dividend case. In the dividend

case, the dividend recipient can use the proceeds to buy additional shares in

the company and therefore match the percentage interest he would have had if

he had been one of the stockholders who did not sell in a share repurchase

program.

     Taxes cause a major break in this equivalence to the disadvantage of

dividends and, therefore, to the relative advantage of share repurchase. It

is still true that the total equity value of the firm should be the same after

the payment of an equivalent amount of cash in either dividend or share

repurchase form. This equivalence rests on the idea that the firm has the

same assets, capital structure, and future opportunities in either case. If

the cash was paid out as a dividend, then it is fully taxable with the

exception of the modest $100 exclusion offered under current law. However, if

it was paid out as a repurchase, the payment results -in a capital gain to

shareholders of the amount of the purchase. However, most of this capital

gain is accrued and not realized.

     To make the share repurchase strategy absolutely clear, consider the

simple example outlined -in Table 1. A company is originally financed by the

issue of 100 shares at $10 each. The company uses the $1000 proceeds to

purchase productive capital and after a year it has realized a $100 profit.

The competitive market value of the firm is now $1100 ($11 per share) as the

company now consists of a fully restored $1000 machine and $100 cash.

     Consider two strategies of returning the $100 earnings to the

shareholders. If the money is paid out as a dividend, then the personal tax

bill will be $35, if the marginal tax rate of the equity holders is

35 percent. The net of tax receipts from the dividend are $65. The value of

the company would return to $1000 or $10 per share after the dividend payment.

On the other hand, if the firm used its $100 to buy 9.09 of its shares at a

price of $11, then the total realized gain by those who sell their shares to

the firm is $9.09, assuming that the sellers are among those who originally

financed the firm at a $10 per share price, and the tax on that $9.09 would be

at long term capital gains rates. Under current law there is a 60 percent

exclusion on long term gains, so that only $3.64 would be subject to full

personal taxation. If the appropriate tax rate were again 35 percent, that

tax bill would amount to $1.27 and the stockholders would have net of tax

proceeds of $98.73.

     Note that in this example the company's shares remain at $11 after the

repurchase and thus the remaining 90.91 shares each have an accrued gain of

one dollar. These accrued gains will generate some taxes for the government,

although the present value of those tax collections depends on average holding
                                      —7-



 periods, as well as the use of the escape of capital gains taxes which
                                                                           pass
 through estates.

      This example highlights the much lower personal taxes which result from

 share repurchases relative to dividends. Even so, it still may exaggerate

 what would actually be paid with share repurchase. In the real world,

 investors have bought their shares at different times and at different prices,

 and those most likely to actually tender their shares back to the company will

 be those with the lowest reservation price on holding the shares.    These most

 likely would be shareholders who have actually lost money on their

 investments, particularly those who have held the shares less than six months

 and who may be able to fully deduct their losses. This indicates that the

government may actually get no immediate revenue from those who receive the

corporate cash. The example also illustrates that even when the tax rate on

realized capital gains was the same as that on dividends, the government's

contemporaneous tax collections would be lower with share repurchase (because

most of the money received is treated as a return of basis), as would the

present value of its eventual tax receipts.

     One interesting aspect of share repurchase is that shareholders are

nearly indifferent to the price offered in a share repurchase plan which is

accomplished through a tender offer. The point is that in a fundamental way

they are buying the shares from themselves, so the indifference comes from

their being both buyer and seller. Consider what would happen to the above

example if the firm offered to buy 8 shares at $12.50 rather than 9.09 at

$11.00. Shareholders as a group still get $100 cash and the firm is still

worth $1000 after the transaction. In some sense there -is a transfer between
                                     -8-


those who sell and those who don't if the firm pays an above market price for

the shares it recaptures, but this effect is diminished by the fact that if

the offer is oversubscribed and the shares are repurchased from those who

offer to sell on a pro-rata basis. As long as all shareholders have an equal

right to participate, then it is again hard to argue that there is a

significant transfer among shareholders. There is a secondary tax difference.

In the example of Table 1, the total realized capital gain would be $20 at the

$12.50 price, while -it was $9.09 at $11.00 per share.

    While I have emphasized the personal tax advantage of share repurchase,

there are other reasons for this practice. One is that it is a mechanism for

increasing the firm's debt-equity ratio. As mentioned above, the standard

wisdom is that a firm's debt-equity ratio is determined by a tradeoff between

the tax advantage of debt and the costs of its resulting inflexibility in

times of crisis. However, if there is a change in the underlying riskiness of

the firm (perhaps due to the maturing of a market or the resolution of some

technological uncertainties), the firm may want to operate with a higher

leverage ratio to enjoy the tax advantages of debt. Or, once the firm has

achieved its desired debt-equity ratio, the stockmarket could increase the

valuation of the shares and thus automatically lower leverage. The firm might

want to counter the automatic unlevering that occurs with a rise in the

stockmarket. Share repurchase can be a mechanism for increasing leverage. It

may be a better mechanism for this transitional purpose than an increased

dividend (suggested by the work of Feldstein and Green (1983)) because of the

penalty that the market imposes on firms which subsequently cut their

dividend.2 Taken together with the previous observation that shareholders are
                                      —9-


 approximately indifferent regarding the price of a share repurchase, this

 implies that a large increase in equity values such as that of the past three

 years may encourage share repurchases, rather than discourage them as seems to

 be the conventional wisdom.

      Of course, the argument that share repurchases occur to implement an

 optimal debt-equity ratio is itself a tax driven argument. In this case it is

 the corporate tax faced by equity which is being avoided by the absorption of

equity, rather than the personal tax which would accompany a dividend payment.

     Another reason that one might expect to observe firms buying back their

own shares in preference to paying dividends is that doing so could be part of

an anti-takeover strategy (Simon (1986)).   If a company pays cash out as a

dividend, then the cash is given to all shareholders in proportion to their

share holdings. However, if the cash is used to make a share repurchase

tender offer, only those who tender their shares (or a     rata proportion of

those tendered) will receive cash from the firm. Due to different

transactions costs, tax situations, and expectations about the firm's

prospects there exists a distribution over prices at which different

shareholders are willing to sell. The cash dividend doesn't change that

distribution, while the share repurchase buys out those with the lowest

reservation prices, leaving behind those who would sell only when offered a

premium above the tender offer price. Since a successful raider must obtain

51 percent of the outstanding shares, the fact that those with the lowest

reservation prices have been taken out of the distribution by a share

repurchase raises the cost of a takeover. This explanation is consistent with

the empirical observation that merger activity and share repurchase have
                                     -10-


increased simultaneously in the last few years, although other theories might

also explain both practices.

     In fact, I assert that, in the absence of informational problems and

transactions costs, buying the shares in another company is nearly equivalent

to buying back your own shares. Rather than returning cash to the

shareholders, the firm instead buys a financial investment. If the market

value of the acquired asset is equal to what is paid for it (and there -is no

evidence that the rate of return on the common stock of the acquiring firm is

abnormal, whereas there is an excess return enjoyed by the holders of the

securities of the acquired firm (Dennis and McConnell (1986)), then in the

absence of transactions costs the acquisition is as good as cash to the

holders of the stock in the acquiring firm. If there are transactions costs,

they would have to be taken into account since some investors might now prefer

cash and some investors may want to rebalance their portfolio after the

acquisition.

    Another way to note the near equivalence of cash mergers and share

repurchase is to consider an example with two firms. The owners of firms A

and B are nearly indifferent to whether both firms buy back ten percent of

their own stock or whether they buy ten percent of each other. The cash flow

to the investors is the same, the individual who owns a proportion of MB is

treated exactly equivalently, and the individual who owns either A or B has a

claim of equal value. One qualifier is that if either A or B pays out

dividends, then each corporation will face a tax on 15 percent of the

dividends it receives from the other. Also, the proposition made above that

shareholders are nearly indifferent regarding the price offered in a share
                                      —11—


 repurchase tender offer program is clearly not true if the acquirer is an

 outside firm. Rather than the shareholders buying a fraction of
                                                                   outstanding
 shares from themselves, they now are selling them to an outsider, and

 therefore the common logic that the higher the price the better applies.

      Cash mergers and leveraged buyouts (LBOs), much in the news of late, are

 just the complete purchase of all of the shares of a company by another

company. They often involve large sums of money being paid from the corporate

sector to stockholders and therefore are a significant determinant of the

value of equity. In a merger or acquisition, the appreciation of the

securities (which may reflect previous retained earnings) will be taxed as a

capital gain rather than as ordinary income. Since in this case (unlike the

situation with share repurchase), we are mainly comparing realized capital

gains with dividends, the tax advantage of a cash merger will be diminished if

the capital gains exclusion is eliminated, as now appears likely. However, a

fraction of the money used for the acquisition will be a nontaxable return of

basis.

     So far, I have been arguing that there are significant tax advantages to

paying out whatever cash is to be returned to equity investors in a form other

than dividends, as well as the advantage of increased leverage. In this

paper, I present data which indicates that indeed most of the cash received by

stockholders from firms is the last two years has been due to share repurchase

and cash mergers. In 1985, at least $125 billion was paid out in share

acquisitions, whereas dividends amounted to $83.5 billion. This phenomenon is

relatively new, since the the first half of the 1970s the total money paid by

corporations for equity acquisition amounted to only about 15 percent of
                                      —12—


dividends.   I also demonstrate that the growth in share acquisitions is

consistent with firms taking advantage of the tax treatment of debt in

response to their -increased market values.

     The next section of the paper presents the data regarding the magnitude

of these cash flows between firms and stockholders. The primary data source

is the Monthly Stock Returns File of the Center for Research in Security

Prices (CRSP). The second section of the paper examines where the money to

make these payments comes from. One possibility is that they are directly

substituting for dividends, and that dividends have declined as these

practices have grown. This hypothesis is addressed by fitting aggregate time

series equations for dividends and looking at the out-of-sample forecast

residuals for recent years. As funds are fungible, it is always difficult to

be precise as to where particular monies are coming from. Other possibilities

in this case are that the money is being raised -in debt markets and that

effectively firms are changing their debt—equity ratios (in which case

dividends and share repurchases are complements), or that declining industries

are depreciating their capital in their traditional business and either

returning the funds to their investors (share repurchase) or making

investments on their behalf.

    The third section addresses the question of what is the cost to the

Treasury of these nondiv-idend cash payments. The answer depends on what firms

would do if these payments were disallowed or taxed as dividends. If firms

would pay these sums out to equity holders nonetheless, then the loss depends

on the difference between the current taxation applying to these payments and

their taxation as dividends. However, if they would retain these earnings and
                                       -13-


reduce borrowing, the loss is the present value of the future corporation

 income tax which would result from the higher level of corporate equity if

these nondividend payments were not made. Both alternative scenarios are

considered. The paper concludes in section four with an assessment of what we

have learned regarding the nondividend payments to shareholders, and some

speculation as to how the new tax bill will affect these practices.



1.   How Large is It?


     There -is surprisingly little data regarding these non—dividend cash

payments between firms and stockholders, particularly share repurchases.

There -is no separate entry for them in the Federal Reserve's Flow of Funds

accounts and my contacts with the Fed have indicated that they do not have

accurate information regarding this cash flow. There are some sources

regarding mergers and acquisitions and those figures are reported here.

     To gain some feel for the magnitude of share repurchases, I examined the

CRSP Monthly Stock Returns File which contains monthly information on the

number of shares outstanding. Only New York Stock Exchange securities were

examined and the period covered was January 1970 through December 1985. Each

decrease in the number of shares outstanding (adjusted for splits and reverse

splits) was taken to be a share repurchase and the amount of cash represented

by that share repurchase was determined by valuing the decrease in shares at

the average of the price at the end of the preceeding month and the price at

the end of the month in which the reduction occured. Overall, the sample

covered 3,211 firms over 192 months.

Sources: Column 1 is the author's computations based on the CRSP tape. It
          represents the total value of firms which disappear from the NYSE,
          where value is determined by multiplying the number of shares
          outstanding the month before disappearance by the price at that
           time.

           Column 2 is the author's computations based on the CRSP tape. It
           represents the sum of the value of all monthly decreases in the
           number of shares outstanding for NYSE stocks, where the value of the
           decrease in shares is determined using the average of the price at
           the end of the preceding month and the price at the end of the month
           in which the reduction occurred.

           Column 3 is from the Economic Report of the President, February
           1986, column 4, Table 6-84, page 351.
                                      —15—


      The results of this procedure are shown in column 2 of Table 2.    They
 show that the value of shares repurchased moved trendlessly between 1970 and

 1976 at level of approximately $2 billion or less. By 1980, the aggregate

 figure had grown to almost $8 billion and it continued to grow rapidly, rising

 to more than $29 billion in 1984. There was a slight decline in 1985,

 although the figure of $27 billion is still very large.

      For several reasons, the estimates of column 2 should be taken only as

 rough, but very conservative estimates. First, only monthly net declines in

shares outstanding are valued, rather than the more appropriate, but

unavailable, gross number of shares repurchased. The distinction should be

made clear if you think of a firm which repurchases 100,000 shares but uses

50,000 of them to cover exercised executive stock options. The company

shareholders receive cash for 100,000 of their shares, but the CRSP based

technique of this paper will only record that 50,000 shares were bought by the

company.,3 By examining some 1985 and 1986 NYSE data on changes in Treasury

stock for listed companies, I estimate that the valuation of net rather than

gross stock repurchases may cause the figures of column 2 to be underestimated

by as much as 20 percent.4

     Second, only NYSE securities are covered in the procedure behind the

figures in the first two columns of Table 2. While they represent the vast

majority of dividends, assets, and profits in the U.S., the strategies being

examined here, particularly share repurchase, are also likely to occur in

small, closely-held companies where possible information problems relating to

corporate financial behavior are much less severe than in large corporate giants.

     Third, while CRSP offers accurate data on the change in the number of shares
                                     -16-


outstanding, I have no information on the price at which those shares were removed

from the market. The procedures of using an average of the end of previous

month's price and the price at the end of the month in which the repurchase oc-

curred is probably downward biased. In fact, those repurchase programs which are

accomplished using a tender offer usually involve a premium above market price,

and therefore involve more cash than the procedure of this paper will record.5

     The first column of Table 2 contains information about mergers and

acquisitions from the same sample of months and firms. The figures represent

the value of shares of companies which disappear from the NYSE, where value is

determined by multiplying the number of shares outstanding at the end of the

month before disappearance by the price at that time. The results again show

a series with no tendency to growth from 1970 to 1975. During that period,

aggregate mergers and acquisitions averaged less than $2.5 billion compared to

dividends which averaged about $25 billion. By 1979, total mergers and

acquisitions were almost $14 billion and in 1985 they surpassed dividends by

totalling almost $95 billion. In fact in 1985 total dividends in the economy

were only 68 percent as large as the value of NYSE mergers and share

repurchases.

     As with column 2, the figures of column 1 should be treated as rough

approximations. They cover only NYSE securities, they do not include partial

acquisitions, the price at which the shares are valued is certainly biased

downwards in this case, and they do not separate cash from stock-swap mergers.

In recent years, at least 83 percent of the largest mergers and acquisitions

have used cash or equivalents rather than an equity exchange,6 but it is

difficult to summarize the magnitude of the bias in the figures in column 1.

It   is my personal assessment that the numbers are once again fairly

conservative. The third column of Table 2 reports aggregate dividends of the

corporate sector. It is an extremely stable series as is well documented

(Lintner (1956), Brittain (1966), and Shiller (1981)).

      Figure 1 displays the same information, although now expressed in

constant 1982 dollars, where the GNP deflator has been used to deflate the

figures of Table 2. The figure clearly shows that both mergers and share

repurchases were relatively insignificant until 1978, but since then they have

experienced explosive growth.

      Table 3 contains information on the 25 largest mergers and acquisitions

in 1984 and Table 4 has the same information for 1985. The data were compiled

by Mergers and Acquisitions. For 1984, the 25 largest deals amounted to

almost half of the value of all mergers and acquisitions. Even the top 25

were dominated by the largest three, all involving oil companies buying other

oil companies. The total cost of the acquisitions of Gulf, Getty, and

Superior alone amounted to almost $30 billion, or nearly 25 percent of all

such activity. Table 4 shows that no 1985 merger was as large as the three

giant oil deals -in 1984. However, total mergers and acquisitions were larger,

with even the 25th largest deal amounting to $1 billion. Table 4 also shows

that foreign investors became a major factor in equity mergers and

acquisitions in 1985. The purchase of U.S. firms by non-U.S. firms went from

$8 billion in 1984 to almost $18 billion in 1985. I note that the aggregate

information shown for 1984 and 1985 in Tables 3 and 4 exceeds the

corresponding figures in Table 2 and Figure 1. Part of the explanation is

that the Mergers and Acquisitions data of Tables 3 and 4 include partial

           We considered as potential candidates firms evidencing
           large repurchase by either of two sources: either being
           amongst the 45 largest as derived by our CRSP
           manipulations, or having significant increases in the
           shares of Treasury stock holdings, and thus repurchase
           value, as obtained by our NYSE Treasury stock report
           manipulations.

acquisitions, non NYSE firms, and even non-U.S. firms. However, I do not mean

to imply that the two sources could be exactly reconciled. On the other hand,

both indicate the same order of magnitude for the value of mergers and

acqu i sit ions.


      Table 5 shows the 25 largest share repurchase programs for 1985. The

list was generated by identifying the 45 firms with the largest net share

acquisition programs from the CRSP file, and augmenting that sample by those

firms whose share repurchase programs appear to be large in the New York Stock

Exchange data. The annual reports and SEC 10-K forms for all of these firms

were examined, and the values here are derived from these reports. The oil

companies are extremely prominent on the list, as they are on the mergers and

acquisitions tables above. The oil companies were experiencing large cash

flows due to the high price of crude, but had excess capacity in refining as

the high prices had reduced demand. This so-called "cash-cow" situation is

exactly the type of situation where one would expect the firm to transmit cash

or value to shareholders via a non-dividend technique. Exxon alone

repurchased more than $5 billion of its shares in the two years 1984 and 1985,

a sum which exceeds Exxon's dividends for the same two years. The non-oil

company's on the list also appear to be mature companies in slow growth

industries. In subsequent research, I intend to examine econometrically the

determinants of which firms are most likely to engage in repurchase programs.

     The overall conclusion that I reach from the data gathered so far is that

non-dividend forms of payment have been growing rapidly, now exceed dividends

in aggregate, and that this may be a mechanism for investment to be

reallocated away from slow growth sectors of the economy to other areas
                                     —23-


offering higher growth. In this regard, it should be noted that even when one

oil company absorbs another with a cash merger, some cash is reallocated out

of the industry since equity holders receive cash from the acquiring firm,

which they then can reallocate in whatever manner they choose.



2.   Have Firms Reduced Dividends?


     Corporations are now paying out over $100 billion per year in

non-dividend cash to equity holders. At some level it is impossible to track

down the origins of that money, since the interchangeability of funds renders

it fundamentally impossible to match sources and uses. However, it still is

interesting to investigate what other behavior has accompanied the growth in

cash flows from share absorption.

     The first source suspected might be dividends. If it has become

recognized that share repurchases and cash mergers are tax-preferred relative

to dividends, then one would expect dividends to have declined as these

practices have grown. It has long been known that aggregate dividends are a

very smooth series, with dividend levels adjusting to changes in earnings with

fairly long lags (see, for example, Lintner (1956), Brittain (1966), and

Auerbach (1982)).

     I wish to test this substitutability hypothesis. Thus, I have fit simple

partial adjustment models similar to those used by Auerbach (1982). In the

equations shown in Table 6, dividends depend on the previous year's dividends,

profits, a correction for the real inflation-adjusted cost of debt, and q (the

ratio of the financial valuation of the firm to the replacement cost of its

assets).7 Three alternative specifications are estimated.

     The 1960-82 aggregate data used in the estimations are shown in Table 6.

The resulting estimated equations are then used to predict the level of

dividends in 1983 and 1984. The results strongly suggest that the source of

the cash is not a lowering of dividends. All three specifications of the

dividend equation continue to track dividends rather well, with the residuals

in 1983 and 1984 always being positive. This indicates that dividends were

slightly higher than the equations would have forecasted. Equation 1 and

Equation 3 show profits to be a significant variable in determining dividends.

The long run equilibrium payout rate out of inflation adjusted profits ranges

from 30 to 37.5 percent. Of course, the stability of dividends and the market

penalty for failing to fulfill expectations regarding dividends is well

known. Once the practice of paying dividends and periodically increasing them

is established, the market makes it difficult to not satisfy this expectation.

     Despite the cash payouts for share acquisition, the total sources of

funds raised or generated by the corporate sector have continued to increase

in the last few years. Total internal cash generated in the corporate sector

increased 66 percent between 1981 and 1985, going from $213 billion to almost

$355 billion (Flow of Funds (1986)). This increase alone is more than

sufficient to account for the increase in equity absorption. The fungibility

point made earlier is highlighted when one notes that the corporate sector has

been increasing its bond and bank debts by over $100 billion per year in the

last several years. This source is also large enough to fund the share

acquisitions.

     The available aggregate information weakly supports the hypothesis that

 firms are repurchasing equity with debt-financed funds to achieve their target

 leverage ratios. The aggregate debt-equity ratio of U.S. corporations in 1984

 and 1985 was approxiamtely the same as it had been in 1979-1981, despite the

 large increase in equity values. The aggregate figures compiled by Salomon

Brothers are shown in Table 7.   It shows that U.S. corporations have been on

average absorbing equity and issuing debt, so that the net effect has been

relatively constant leverage rates, despite the rally in equity market values.



3.   How Much Does It Cost?


     The next question I address is how much does the Treasury lose because of

the use of non-dividend forms of payment between firms and their stockholders.

It is a somewhat difficult issue for a number of reasons. Fundamentally, we

do not know what the firm would have done if share repurchase and cash mergers

were disallowed. One possibility is that they would increase dividends as the

only remaining mechanism to absorb equity in establishing their desired

debt-equity ratio. Of course, the optimal debt-equity ratio itself is a

function of the tax laws. A second possibility is that the funds would be

retained in the corporation and the firm's new borrowing would have been

reduced. Either of these possibilities imply that share repurchase and

acquisition cost the Treasury large amounts of tax revenue.   I will assess

this cost for these two scenarios.

     If the alternative would have been an equal amount of payments as

dividends, the revenue loss to the Treasury is the difference between the

average marginal tax rate on dividends and the effective tax rate on the share
                                     -28-


purchase cash payments. The average marginal tax rate applying to dividend

distributions depends on a number of factors. First, within households, some

will have not used up the $100 per person ($200 per couple) dividend

exclusion. Second, one would expect that people would arrange their

portfolios such that those with low marginal tax rates hold assets which are

heavily taxed (e.g. stocks which offer high dividend yields such as utilities)

while those with high marginal tax rates would hold more lightly taxed

securities (such as companies which retain earnings or repurchase shares, or,

at the extreme, municipal bonds). Certainly, these clientele effects exist,

although their empirical strength is somewhat uncertain.8 Of course,

substantial amounts of equity are held by insurance companies, pension funds,

and non—profit institutions, which are not taxed. Feldstein and Jun (1986)

have estimated a time series of the effective average marginal tax rates on

dividends, taking into account the proportion of stocks held by households,

insurance companies, and nontaxable holders. Their series is reproduced as

the second column of Table 8. Using these rates, it is rather simple to

determine how much tax would have been paid if these nondividend payments to

stockholders continued and were taxed as dividends or, in fact, companies

replaced them with increased dividends.9 However, to know how much extra the

government would collect, we must know how much tax was indeed collected from

these payments in the current situation.

     The effective tax rate applying to the non-dividend cash payments under

current law is undoubtedly quite low. As was demonstrated in the example of

Table 1, share repurchases create a capital gain of equivalent magnitude to

Sources:   Tax rate on dividends column was taken from Column 3, Table A-4, of
           Feldstein and Jun (1986).

           Additional tax revenues were derived by multiplying the magnitudes
           in columns 1 and 2 of Table 1 of this paper by the tax rate on
           dividends less 5 percent. The 5 percent represents the effective
           marginal tax rate on accrued capital gains and is roughly consistent
           with Protopapadakis (1983).
                                     -30-


the cash payment of dividends, but most of that capital gain is accrued rather

than realized. Most of the money received by the actual sellers is a return

of basis, with the remainder being taxed at capital gains rates. Under

current law, only 40 percent of realized long term capital gains are taxed.

The effective rate of taxation on accrued gains is much lower, due to both

deferral and the fact that the gains on assets which pass through estates

completely escape taxation. A recent times series of estimates of effective

marginal tax rates on accrued capital gains, taking these considerations into

account, put those rates between 4 and 6 percent (Protopapadakis (1983)).

     The tax situation with cash mergers, is similar to share repurchase.

Relative to the payment of a dividend, the holders of the acquiring company

experience an accrued capital gain. The owners of the acquired company pay

capital gains taxes on the appreciation of their securities, but again the

majority of the money received is usually a non-taxed return of basis. With

this background, I have assumed that the tax rate applicable to the

non—dividend cash flows was 5 percent over the entire 1970 to 1985 period.

This is consistent with Protopapadakis' estimates and, further, small errors

in this figure are relatively insignificant compared to the magnitude of the

tax rate on dividends shown in Table 8.

     With these tax rate assumptions, Table 8 indicates that the practice of

share acquisition costs the government very little between 1970 and 1975

(roughly $1 billion per year), but that its cost has risen sharply since, to

more than $27 billion in 1985. This assumes that the alternative to

acquisition is the increase of dividend payments. Interestingly, this $27

billion per year exceeds the intended shift between the personal and corporate
                                      -31-


 taxation in the new tax bill. This exercise provides one indication how the

 adjustment of household and firm behavior can significantly affect revenue

 projections, from any proposed change of incentives in the tax code.

      In the previous section, we found that dividends have not declined

 relative to equity earnings, thus it can be argued that dividends are not

 likely to be the behavior which is depressed as a result of share acquisition.

 What may be depressed is the outstanding quantity of corporate equity. If

 share purchases effectively reduce equity and increase debt (i.e. if the

 acquisitions are financed by borrowing), then the Treasury loses in present

value terms much more than is reflected in Table 8. The loss is not

 immediate, but results from the lower future corporation income tax receipts.

By absorbing equity, the corporate sector is escaping from the double taxation

imposed on equity. This opportunity exists because the corporate tax applied

only to equity investments, since interest is deductible.

     At a marginal corporate income tax rate of 46 percent, the value of the

government's equity claim on an extra dollar's worth of earnings is 85 percent

as large as the value of the claim of the investors. The government gains 46

cents from a marginal dollar of pre-tax profit, while the company keeps 54

cents. 10


     Table 9 shows the loss in present value terms of the Treasury's tax

receipts, under the assumption that share acquisition programs have reduced

corporate equity.   The figures indicate that the loss to the Treasury is

insignificant before 1975, but exceeds $100 billion in 1985. That is, the

absorption of corporate equity which occurred in 1985 reduces the present

value of the corporate tax receipts by slightly more than $100 billion. The

annual loss, of course, is much lower than this, perhaps only $5 billion.

 This table assumes that the personal tax bill is equivalent for corporate debt

 and equity, and that the transfer of capital between the two forms simply cuts

 corporate collections. While the tax rates faced by households on the return

 to debt may exceed the rates on equity return, a large fraction of debt is

 held in tax sheltered investments such as pension funds.

      Each of the two hypotheses indicate that the Treasury losses are

extremely large due to these practices. The former theory implies that the

government is losing tax on dividends, while the latter suggests that it is

 losing corporation income tax revenue. Relative to models which do not

 incorporate behavioral change, each of the alternative hypotheses suggest

massive revenue effects.



4.   Conclusion


     Corporations in the United States are now making nondividend cash

payments to shareholders the sum of which exceeds that of dividends. These

payments have not received much attention by research economists, but their

growth in magnitude challenges the conventional model of share valuation, and

certainly affects estimates of the taxes collected on corporate source income.

     Share acquisitions (both share repurchase and cash mergers) may well be

motivated by tax minimizing behavior. In fact, there are two potential

sources of tax savings from these activities. First, if because of share

acquisition, dividends are lower than they otherwise would have been, then

there is a tax saving at the personal level. With share acquisition by

corporations, most of the cash returned to shareholders is a return of basis.
                                     —34-


The magnitude of the taxable capital gain depends on the form of the share

acquisition. In the case of a firm repurchasing its own shares, most of the

resulting capital gains are accrued rather than realized. The deferral

advantage of accrued capital gain will continue to exist even when realized

capital gains are fully taxed under the new federal law.

     The second tax motivation for share acquisition is simply to escape the

double taxation of equity. Both dividends and share acquisition eliminate

equity. The tax saving results from the fact that equity earnings are subject

to the corporation income tax whereas debt interest -is not. As the market

expects increases in dividends to be sustained, repurchase is an attractive

mechanism to decrease equity. The tax advantage of leverage will continue

with the new tax law.

     A leading model of optimal financial policy has firms balancing the tax

advantages of debt against the increased chance of incurring bankruptcy costs.

The tremendous rise -in equity values of the past three years may have given

firms a capacity to carry more debt and absorb some equity. This hypothesis

is consistent with the observations of explosive growth in non-cash payments

to equity holders and the fact that dividends are, if anything, also greater

than their historic pattern.

     In evaluating corporate behavior and tax policy, it is almost certainly

useful to know what is happening. In 1985, corporations purchased well over

$100 billion of equities and, in present value terms, this may cost the U.S.

Treasury as much as $100 billion. Clearly, there has been a major change in

corporate financial behavior which necessitates future research.

      *Stanford University and National Bureau of Economic Research.

      Preliminary draft of a paper to be presented at the Economics of Tax

 Policy conference of the National Bureau of Economic Research to be held in

 Washington, D.C. on November 17, 1986.    It is not for quotation without

 permission. This work was made possible by the tireless work and intellectual

 stimuli provide by Laurie B. Simon, who is also doing research on this

 subject. It also benefited greatly from the research assistance of Karen

Prindle and Karen Van Nuys. Larry Summers and Jim Poterba gave me extremely

useful advice.

1.   While under the assumptions of Modigliani—Miller (1958) (in the world

without taxes and bankruptcy costs), "the market value of one firm is

independent of its capital structure (p. 268)," the optimal capital structure

becomes 100% debt with the incorporation of corporate taxes
                                                              (Modigliani-Miller

(1963)). However, there exists voluminous literature on the effect of

bankruptcy costs limiting the use of this tax-advantaged debt. See, for

example, Stiglitz (1972), Kraus and Litzenberger (1973), Kim (1978), and more

recently Modigliani (1982) and Gordon (1982), where it is argued "that the tax

advantage to using debt is in equilibrium just offset at the margin by the

additional agency costs and possible bankruptcy costs incurred as a result of

the extra debt" (Gordon (1982), p. 462).

2.   The fact that capital markets punish dividend cuts with large stock-price

reductions is documented in Charest (1978), Aharony and Swary (1980), and

Jensen (1986).
                                           -36-



3.      For example, in the first quarter of 1985, IBM repurchased 1.575 million

shares, but issued 1.35 million as part of defined contribution saving plans

and stock options for employees.

4.      This estimate is made by examining the monthly gross increases and

decreases from Treasury stock in data made available by New York Stock

Exchange for 1985.

5.    Dann (1981) cites that "the tender offer price is usually higher than the

market price at the time of the offer (p. 114, footnote 3)," and that while

"open market repurchases occur more frequently than do tender offers to

repurchase ...    (they)    are generally of much smaller magnitude (p. 115)."

6.    This calculation -is the result of the comparison between total value and

cash and equivalence of the 1985 Mergers and Acquisitions in Table 4.

7.    The partial adjustment model can be represented as
                              *
               — ot.i   =
                            A(D
                                  —

                                           *
where       is dividends for year t and        is the long run equilibrium or

desired level of dividends. 0* is assumed to depend on corporate profits

corrected for inflation (i.e., with the capital consumption adjustments,

inventory valuation adjustment, and a recognition of the gain on the net

corporate debt due to inflation) and q.

8.    The clientele effect was originally suggested by Modigliani-Miller

(1961), and has been quantified by Elton and Gruber (1970), and Pettit (1977).

9.    This assumes that the effective average marginal tax rate for the pool of

firms using repurchase is the same as for the market at large. We will not

consider issues of self-selection here.

10.   In fact, the Treasury's claim may be worth more than 85 percent of the
                                     -37-


value of the investor's claim, since the 54 cents faces further taxation at

the personal level.
