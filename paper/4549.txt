                                         ABSTRACT

       In this paper we construct a number of quality-adjusted price indexes for personal
computers in the U.S. marketplace over the 1989-92 time period. We generalize earlier work
by incorporating simultaneously the time, age and vintage effects of computer models into a
fully saturated parameterization, and then develop a corresponding specification test
procedure.
       While the simple arithmetic mean of prices of models by year reveals a price decline
of about 11% per year, use of a matched model procedure similar to that commonly used by
government statistical agencies generates a much larger rate of price decline --about 20% per
year. Since the matched model procedure holds quality constant, it ignores quality change
embodied in new models. When data on new and surviving models are used in the estimation
of hedonic price equations, a variety of quality-adjusted price indexes can be calculated, with
varying interpretations. Although there are some differences, we find that on average these
quality-adjusted price indexes decline at about 30% per year, with a particularly large price
drop occurring in 1992. Parameters in hedonic price equations for desktop PC models differ
from those for mobile PCs. Moreover, quality-adjusted prices fall at a slightly lower AAGR
for mobile models (24%) than for desktops (32%). We conclude that taking quality changes
into account has an enormous impact on the time pattern of price indexes for PCs.

I. INTRODUCTION

        The rapid technological and market developments in the personal computer

industry are widely known and have received a great deal of public attention.

One way of summarizing these major changes is to look at the unweighted

arithmetic mean of prices and technological characteristics of personal

computer models sold in the last four years in the US. Based on data as

reported by DATAPRO, in Table I we present such a summary.

        As is seen in the final column of Table 1, mean nominal prices of PC

models dropped slightly between 1989 ($4616) and 1991 ($4320), but then fell

sharply in 1992 (to $3378), thereby changing at an overall average annual

 growth rate (AAGR) of -10.97%. Even as the unweighted mean of computer            "box"


 prices fell at about 11% per year, dramatic quality improvements occurred in the

 performance and characteristics of PC models. For example in 1989,            37.3% of PC

                                                                       Page 2 -

models had a 32-bit processor, but by 1992 this had doubled to 76.7%; over the

same time period, the percent of PC models having an 8-bit processor fell from

8.0% to zero. As a result, random access memory (RAM) speed increased by about

80% from 15.06 to 27.78 M1-IZ.   Furthermore, mean RAM capacity almost quadrupled
from 1227 kilobytes (KB) in 1989 to 4755 KB in 1992, while hard disk capacity

increased from 45 to 123 megabytes (MB). Even more dramatically, all this

increased capacity and performance was compressed into an ever smaller and

lighter "box"; while mean size fell from 1695 to 1419 cubic inches between 1989

and 1992, weight fell even more rapidly from 30.43 to 25.60 pounds.

      The measurement of price indexes in the presence of such rapid

technological change is of course a difficult task. One measurement procedure

is to construct a "matched model" index, a procedure that is often used by

government statistical agencies. With a matched model index, prices of products

are compared only for models which survive unchanged from one year to the next.

Since the quality of the product is constrained to be unchanged, any price

variability represents a "pure" or "quality-constant" price change.

      Using the same DATAPRO data, we have constructed a PC matched model index

for the 1989-1992 time period. A matched model is defined here in a rather

restrictive manner, having identical characteristics in the two adjacent time

periods (e.g., speed, memory, storage capacity) --    not   just the same model name

and number. This limits the number cf matches. As is seen in Table 2, the

matched model index implies that prices of PC's declined at an AAGR of about

19%, with a rather steep decline of 44% in 1992.

      Though the decline of this matched model price index is almost double that

of the unweighted mean price change for all models (-19.35% vs. -10.97%), it is

reasonable to expect that even the matched model procedure understates true

price declines. By examining only those models which survive unchanged year-to-

year, any incremental improvements in a particular model (e.g.. a faster

processor), disqualify it from the index. New models are ignored entirely as

of course are models that exited the market. Moreover, with the matched model

procedure, since the percentage of matches in the data ranges from 3% in 1991-92

to 32% in 1990-91, a clear majority of observations are ignored. Finally, it is

plausible to argue that the fewest matches occur precisely during the most

active periods of product improvement - -       and   thus that the matched model

procedure might substantially understate quality-adjusted price changes.

      An increasingly useful alternative to the matched model procedure involve5

using econometric estimates of hedonic price equations to construct price

indexes that hold quality fixed.1 In an exploratory econometric study, Berndt-

Griliches [1993] have estimated hedonic price equations based on computer

magazine advertisement data for 1265 computers, beginning with the introduction

of the IBM PC in 1982 and ending in 1988. The results they obtained were

remarkably robust across alternative functional forms, and implied about a 28%

annual decline in real quality-adjusted PC prices.2'3

       In this paper we extend research on PC price indexes in a number of ways.

 First, because the data employed consists of an unbalanced panel, and because

 there is an identity relating the age of a model, its vintage, and the year in
PC PRICE INDEXES IN THE 1990'S                                 -
                                                                   Page 4 -

which the model is observed, important issues emerge involving the interpreta-
tion of dummy variable coefficients. Some of these issues were addressed in

Berndt-Griliches. Here we extend that discussion by introducing a "saturated"

parameter model that permits a much richer parameterization, and also allows for

a more complete set of specification tests in the unbalanced panel context.

Second, in this paper we consider more completely the issue of parameter

stability and equality. This is particularly important in the PC context, where

new markets have emerged (notebooks vs. desktop models), technological change is

dramatic, and where equation specifications need to be sufficiently general to

capture possible nortlinearities. Third, this study incorporates data through

1992, and therefore updates results from previous studies. As we shall see,

1992 was a most remarkable year in terms of quality-adjusted price declines.

II.   THE DATA SETS

      The data sets for this paper were obtained for the most part from Datapro

Information Services Crup, a division of McGraw-Hill (DATAPRO).4 As is seen in

Table I, the data consists of an unbalanced panel of 1,883 observations on PC's

during the four-year 1989-1992 timeframe.   To avoid the extreme end "toy" and

"file server" computer models, we have restricted the sample to models having at

least 512KB of RAIl, a speed of at least 7.8MEZ (thereby still including the IBM-

XT), and having a hard disk capacity of no more than 500 MB.

      In previous work, we used data from personal computer advertisements, such

as those for mail-order purchases, to obtain measures of a particular model's

characteristics and price. The advantage of that approach is that the resulting

price data more closely approximates actual transactions prices than does, say,

a list price. The disadvantage is that typical advertisements frequently

provide less than full information on the particular combination of attributes

"packaged together" in the model by the vendor. The DATAPRO data set has the

advantage of providing far more complete technical specifications than does the
PC PRICE INDEXES IN THE 1990'S
                                                                 -
                                                                     Page 5 -

typical   magazine advertisement; DATAPRO provides technical information on

approximately 40 characteristics in a consistent form across manufacturers,

models and years. However, the price data from DATAPRO is for the list price of

the particular base model, rather than a transactions price. Although in our

previous study we found that "street" prices were frequently 35% lower than list

prices, whether this discount proportion has changed substantially over time is

not clear. Using 1970-86 data from the US mainframe computer market, Stephen

Oliner [1993) reports that rates of growth in list prices were very similar to

those of transactions prices. To the extent that percent discounts from list

price to transactions price have increased as competitive pressures in the PC

market have intensified in the past few years, the price indexes resulting from

our use of DATAPRO data might understate somewhat the true rate of price decline

of PC's. On the other hand, the share of sales accounted for by mail order

models has plausibly increased since 1989. Since in the mail order market there

is no apparent distinction between list and transactions prices, the use of list

price data for the entire 1989-92 time period might overstate the average

transaction price decline. Moreover, it is widely known that in 1992 major

brand manufacturers changed pricing strategies and brought list prices down

considerably to match others' transactions prices.       Which of these various

offsetting effects is dominant is, unfortunately, unknown at this point in time.

          It would of course be desirable to link the 1989-92 data of this study

with the Berndt-Griliches 1982-88 data. Because the 1989-92 data employs list

price, there is no feasible link between the 1988 prices based on magazine

 advertisements with the 1989 list price data from DATAPRO. A preliminary

 attempt to merge the data sets resulted, not surprisingly, in very large and

 unrealistic price increases from 1988 to 1989. Unfortunately, DATAPRO data

 series prior to 1989 are not currently available. Consequently, the results of

 this study are not directly comparable to those presented in Berndt-CrilicheS.

      The technical characteristics data we employ from the DATAPRO data base

include measures of the following variables: PRICE (in current dollars); RAM

(install'd random access memory capacity, in kilobytes); MAXRMI (maximum amount

of addressable RAN capacity possible); M}Z (speed of processor chip, in

megahertz); HRDDSK (hard disk capacity, in megabytes); SIZE (in cubic inches);

WGT (in pounds); DENSITY (WGT/SIZE); ACE (age of the model, i.e. a model

introduced in year t   and   observed in year t   is   0 years old, a model introduced

in year t-l and observed in year t     is   1 year old, etc). The sample is confined

to models three years of age and younger. Dummy variables ACEO, AGE1, AGE2 and

ACE3 are defined accordingly; DFLP23 is a dummy variable equal to one if the

model has two or more floppy drives, and DNOHDDSK is a dummy equal to one if the

model does not have a hard disk. Other dummy variables include DPROC (a series

of dummy variables for whether the processor chip is 8-bit -- DPROC8, 16-bit --

DPROC16, or 32-bit -- DPROC32); DMOBILE (a dummy variable equal to one if the

computer is defined by DATAPRO as notebook, laptop, portable or transportable,

as distinct from desktop or floorstanding; a series of brand dummy variables

equal to one if the computer brand is ALR (DALR), Apple (DAPPLE), AST (DAST),

Compaq (DCMPQ), CompuAdd (DCOMPUAD), Dell (DDELL), Digital Equipment Corporation

(DDEC), Hewlett Packard (DHP), IBM (DIBM), NEC (DNEC), Toshiba (DTOSH), Zenith

(DZEN), or all other brands (DOTHER).5 Finally, we have constructed dummy

variables T89, T90, T9l and T92 that equal one if the computer model is being

observed in that particular year, and seven vintage dummy variables (V86 through

V92) corresponding to the vintage of the particular model (the year it was first

introduced on the market).6 This data is summarized in Table 3 below.

      As is seen in Table 3 from means of the dummy variables, the data set is

dominated by new models (ACEO —     0.62)   that are desktop or floorstanding (not

laptops or notebooks, for DMOBILE —     0.23),    having either zero or only one floppy

disk drive (DFLP23 —   0.22)   and a hard disk drive (DNOHDDSK —     0.25,   implying 75X

leading vendors (OTHER —     0.44,   but with Dell, IBM, Compaq, DEC and NEC having

the largest number of models).

III. ECONOMETRIC ISSUES

        Our data set comes in the form of an unbalanced panel, in that the number

of observations by age, and by vintage, varies by year. Let TIME be a variable

equal to the year in which a model was observed (say, TIME — 1991), let VINTAGE

be a variable equal to the year in which the model was first introduced into the
PC PRICE INDEXES IN THE 1990'S                                 -
                                                                   Page 8 -

market (e.g., VINTAGE — 1989), and let ACE be a variable equal to the number of

years that a particular model has been in the market (e.g., ACE —    2).   For any

model-observation, we therefore have the identity

                     TI)E — VINrAGE + AGE.                                     (1)

      Because of this identity, one cannot include continuous linear versions of

all three of the TIME, VINTAGE and AGE variables into a regression equation,

else exact collinearity would occur; only two of the three could be included

directly, and indirect estimates for the impact of the third variable could be

computed using Eq. (1). Note that regardless of which two of the three

variables were included in the estimated regression equation, direct and

implicit parameter estimates would be identical, as would be the equation R2.

      Following Fienberg and Mason [1985), one could specify a model in which

two of the three variables were included linearly, and nonlinear transformations

of all three of the variables were also included; for example, all three squared

variables could be inc1.ided, in addition to linear forms of two of the three

variables.7 It is worth noting, incidentally, that this type of identity is not

unique to the hedonic price literature; a similar identity involving cohort, age

and time measures occurs in, for example, economic and sociological studies of

wage rates in the labor market.8

      An alternative procedure for capturing nonlinearities is to specify the

time, age and vintage variables in dummy variable form. Recall that we have

constructed four time dummy variables (T89 through T92), seven vintage dummy

variables (V86 through V92), and four age dummy variables (AGEO through AGE3).

As was noted by Berndt-Griliches, when the coefficients on these variables are

held constant over time and/or vintage, then the simple adding-up conditions

implied by Eq. (1) no longer hold. This raises significant issues concerning

the interpretation of dummy variable coefficients, as well as the maximal

parameterization possible that avoids exact collinearity.
PC PRICE INDEXES IN THE 1990'S                                 -
                                                                   Page 9 -

      Consider a traditional hedonic price equation relating in E'jvat, the
natural logarithm of the price of the th model of vintage v, age a and time t,

to a constant term, a vector of time dummies T (T — T90, T91, T92, with T89

excluded), a vector of age dummies A (A — AGEI, ACE2 and AGE3, with AGEO

excluded), and a number of model i-specific characteristic variables (called

X's), as well as a random disturbance term ujvat:

            ln E'ivat —   a + T'a + A'aa + X' + uivat.                        (2)


As Berndt-Griliches noted, in this T-A specification (with the V vintage dummy

variables excluded), one can interpret estimates of the at as changes in the

quality-adjusted price index relative to 1989, holding age fixed; hence the

parameters represent the general movement in average PC prices, given the

average rate at which selectivity occurs in the sample. Similarly, estimates of

the ma can be interpreted as the effects of age (relative to an ACEO model) on

price, holding time fixed. The expected sign of the ma coefficients is not

clear, however. One lie of reasoning suggests that new models of superior

quality should command a premium price, and if market competition forces the

valuations of all characteristics of incumbent models to obsolesce at the same

rate, then prices of surviving vintages would decline appropriately, and

therefore since the time dummies capture the full price effects, one would

expect estimates of the ma age dummy parameters to be approximately zero.

      But a different line of reasoning might yield positive estimates of these

parameters. Specifically, if selectivity in the marketplace reflects survival

of the fittest, then the age coefficients may to some extent reflect the effects

of unobserved positive quality differentials among the survivors as vintages

progress. Such unmeasured quality characteristics could include,     for example,

compatible software or hardware, or differential service policies or warranties.

       Suppose that instead of the T-A specification, one included only the

vintage V and age A dummy variables, and excluded the T time dummy variables:
PC PRICE INDEXES IN THE 1990'S                                          -
                                                                            Page 10 -

            in   1'ivat    6 +   V'6   +   A'âa   + X'$ + Ujvat,                        (3)

where, say the vintage V89 dummy variable was omitted. To the extent the

technical characteristics variables captured all of the quality changes embodied

in models, the 6,, vintage coefficients in this V-A model would essentially be

capturing the decline in prices by vintage. Since the 6a coefficients now

condition on vintage V rather than time T, the 6a coefficients represent the

average price decline of surviving models over the sample years, providing

another measure of the average rate of improvement in the quality of new

computers, forcing the price of incumbent models to decline.

      As Berndt-Criliches noted, except for the special case when models of only

one age are included (e.g., only ACEO models), in spite of the identity in Eq.

(1), estimates of, for example, ma in the T-A specification from Eq. (2) will

differ from estimates of 6a In the V-A model of Eq. (3)!           Estimates of the 's

in the two equations will also differ, as will the equation R2's.

      A T-V model which excluded age dummies and only had time and vintage

dummies would provide yet a third set of distinct parameter estimates and

equation statistics. An easy way to see this is to note that the total number

of T, A and V dummy variable coefficients estimated directly varies by model

specification --   six    in the T-A specification of Eq. (2), nine in the V-A model

of Eq. (3), and nine in an analogous T-V specification. Also, since the dummy

variables do not follow a strict linear dependence analogous to Eq. (1),

parameter estimates for models that condition on time and age dummies will

differ from those conditioning on vintage and age dummies.

      Since the V-A and T-A models yield varying estimates, choice among them is

not clear. There is ample precedent, of course, in the hedonic price literature

for simply using a T-A type specification, for in this case the directly

estimated time coefficients have a clear interpretation -          - they   can be used to
PC PRICE INDEXES IN THE 1990'S                                                -
                                                                                  Page 11 -

compute quality-adjusted price indexes in a very simple way. But precedent is

not a sufficient cause for determining functional form.

     One way to proceed is to examine whether it is really necessary to discard

entirely the information on one of the three sets of dummy variables. Can one

not employ a specification that efficiently combines information simultaneously

from the T, A and V dummy variables, yet avoids exact collinearity?

      In fact, as Hall [1971] has shown in a somewhat different context (a

balanced panel data set for second-hand trucks), this can be done. In the

current context, the maximal paraineterization consistent with avoiding exact

collinearity is one in which five of the seven vintage dummy variables are added

to the T-A specification of Eq. (2). We write such a T-A-V specification as

            ln ivat — 7 +   T'-y   +   A'ra   +   V'- +   X'fl   +   uivat,                   (4)

where the T vector excludes, say, T89, the A vector excludes ACEO, and the V

vector now excludes two vintages --      say, V86 and V92. To the extent that
quality improvements are not captured by the included X's but are embodied in

successive vintages, one might expect that the 7v coefficients capture effects

of omitted variables. However, as Hall noted, estimates of the -y,                   coefficients
should be interpreted as differences from the average rate of growth of

technical progress embodied but unobserved in pairwise comparisons of vintages.

Deleting the V86 and V92 dummy variables allows us to interpret the remaining

coefficients as measuring the acceleration or deceleration of technological

progress from the average rate between 1986 and 1992. In the current context

with V86 and V92 omitted, the coefficient on, say, the V90 dummy variable should

therefore be interpreted as the difference between the average 1990 effect and

the mean of the average vintage effects over the entire 1986-92 set of vintages.

      This type of reasoning led Berndt-Griliches to a specification test: A

necessary condition for an hedonic price equation such as Eq. (2) to be satis-

factory empirically is that the portion of quality change not captured by the
PC PRICE INDEXES IN THE 1990'S                                               Page 12 -
                                                                         -



characteristics    variables should be unrelated to vintages, i.e., in a desirable

specification, the       in Eq. (4) should be approximately zero. Based on this

specification test, Berndt-Criliches then proceeded to choose a preferred model.

         Although this specification test has obvious utility and interpretation,

we now show that an alternative model can be developed, one that is richer in

parameters and therefore permits greater flexibility in hypothesis tests and

choice of specifications. It also permits us to interpret more clearly why the

T-A, V-A and T-V specifications generate different parameter estimates.

         Specifically, since unbalanced panel data are available on seven vintages,

four age dummies, and four time dummies, one can envisage a fully saturated

hedonic price equation specification in which there is no intercept, but there

are separate coefficients for each of the sixteen time-vintage "interaction"

variables: V86T89, V87T89, V88T89, V89T89, V87T90, V88T90, V89T90, V90T90,

v88T91, V89T91, V90T91, V91T91, V89T92, V90T92, V91T92 and V92T92, where each of

these interaction dumm variables is an element-by-element product of VvTt, for

v—86 through 92 and t    —   89 through 92.

         With this fully saturated parameter model as the most general

specification, it can easily be shown that for the T-A model to be valid, the

following restrictions must be placed on coefficients of the dummy variables:9

  T-A:   V90T90 - V89T89 — V89T90      -   V88T89 — V88T90   -   V87T89 — V87T90   -
                                                                                       V86T89,
         V9lT9l - V89T89 — V90T91      -   V88T89 — V89T91   -   V87T89 — V88T91   -
                                                                                       V86T89,
    and V92T92 - V89T89 — V91T92       -   V88T89 — V90T92   -   V87T89 — V89T92   -   V86T89.

Note that with these nine independent restrictions, the number of time and age

dummy variable coefficients, plus the intercept term, is seven. Incidentally,

the interpretation of these restrictions is that in this model, the time effect

is the same for all ages in 1990, in 1991, and in 1992.10

         By contrast, the V-A model of Eq. (3) is a special case of the more

general fully saturated model when six linearly independent restrictions are

placed on the interactive vintage-time dummy       variables.       The first three of
PC PRICE INDEXES IN THE 1990'S                                                              -
                                                                                                Page 13 -

these restrictions result from the constraint that in the V-A model, vintage
effects are the same for all ages, while the last three reflect the constraint

that age effects are the same for all vintages. Together, the following six

restrictions are placed on coefficients of the dummy variables:

  V-A:     V87T88    -   V90T91 — V87T89        -
                                                    V90T92, V88T89 • V90T91 — V89T91                 -   V90T92,
           V89T90    -   V9OT91 — V89T91        -   V90T92, as well as
           V89T90    -   V89T89 — V90T91        -   V90T90 — V91T92    V91T91, and
           V89T91    -   V89T89 — V90T92        -   V90T90.

         Finally, for the T-V model to be empirically valid, six linearly

independent restrictions must be placed on the fully saturated model, thereby

leaving it with ten coefficients involving the intercept, time dummies and

vintage duitimies. The first three restrictions imply that with the T-V model.

the vintage effect is the same for all time periods, while the second three

restrictions result from the time effect being the same for all vintages. Hence

interactive dummy variable constraints must be as follows:

  T-V:      V89T90   -   V90T90    —   V89T91   -   V90T91 — V89T92 - V90T92, and
            V91T9I   -   V90T9'l   —   V91T92   -   V90T92, as well as
            V87T90   -   V87T89    —   V88T90   -   V88T89 — V89T90 - V89T89, and
            V88T91   -   V88T89    —   V89T91   -   V89T91 - V89T89.

         Hence, roughly speaking, the saturated model places no restrictions on the

acceleration or deceleration of vintage and age effects over time, the T-A-V

model of Hall places parameter restrictions on this acceleration or

deceleration, while the T-A model constrains this deceleration or acceleration

of vintage effects to be zero. Specifically, relative to the fully saturated

model, the T-A-V model involves two constraints on the age effects,

where the a's are coefficients on vintage dummies.

      The existence of this more general specification suggests a somewhat

different specification test procedure than was used in Berndt-Griliches.

First, we undertake year-by-year regressions; since these regressions involve

only one time period, the age and vintage dummies are perfectly colinear, and

thus we can estimate these equations with either (but not both) the age or

vintage dummies. Second, we test for parameter stability by pooling the 1989-92

data and estimating the fully saturated time-vintage interaction specification

described above. If these parameter stability restrictions are satisfied

empirically, then we will estimate and test for restrictions incorporated in the

various T-A-V, T-A, V-A and T-V specifications. As a preferred specification,

we will choose that model consistent with the data but most parsimonious in

parameterization; we will also examine whether there is empirical support for

the traditional T-A model. Third, if the above test for 1989-92 parameter

stability is rejected, we will test for a weaker type of parameter stability

over time by undertaking adjacent (two-) year regressions, and comparing them

with the year-by-year regressions. If the parameter constraints from adjacent

year regressions are not rejected, we will compare the corresponding fully

saturated, T-A-V, T-A, V-A and 1-V models and choose a preferred specification.

If, however, the parameter constraints of these adjacent year models are

rejected, we will choose as the preferred model the year-by-year regressions.

      The above tests can be carried out using the standard F-test methodology.

Among others, however, Arrow [1960] and Ohta-Griliches [1976) have noted that

when samples are large and standard test procedures are employed, one is likely

to reject most simplifying parameter restrictions on purely statistical grounds,

even though they may still serve as adequate approximations for the purpose at

hand. There are several ways one can deal with this problem.
PC PRICE INDEXES IN THE 1990'S                                   -
                                                                      Page 15 -

       First,   to accommodate the larger sample size, we can compensate by

choosing very tight significance levels for the standard F-tests. We do that

here by choosing 0.01 significance levels. Second, since in our hedonic

regressions the dependent variable is the natural logarithm of price, the root

mean squared error (RNSE) measures the unexplained variation in prices in,

roughly, percentage units. A reasonable criterion is to employ the difference

in the RMSE of the constrained and unconstrained regressions as a relevant

measure of the explanatory power of a particular model. As an alternative test

criterion, therefore, we will reject the null hypothesis when the RMSE under the

alternative results in a reduction of more than 5% in the RMSE (the standard

deviation of the unexplained variation in log prices). With a typical RMSE of

around 0.40, this RMSE criterion implies that we are looking for a movement of

at least about 0.02, say, from 0.40 to 0.38, before we will "give up" on the

more parsimonious paraxneterization corresponding to the null hypothesis.

       Two other comments concerning hypothesis testing are appropriate here:

(a) Since heteroskedasticity may be present, we will compute standard errors and

variance-covariance matrices of the coefficients using the White [19801

heteroskedasticity-robust procedure. Traditional F-tests involving joint

hypotheses, not just t-tests, will therefore be adjusted to accommodate the

heteroskedasticity-consistent variance-covariance matrix; and        (b)   as an

additional check on the various model specifications, we will assess the

sensitivity of computed price indexes to various parameter restrictions,

including some of those rejected by the above test criteria. If growth in the

price indexes is robust to alternative models, the empirical significance of

rejections of particular models will, for our purposes, be diminished.

 IV.    FUNCTIONAL FORMS. STABILITY AND RESULTS OF SPECIFICATION TESTS

       We now turn to a discussion of empirical findings. Results from

preliminary regressions suggested that parameters differed significantly for
                                                                   Page 16 -

mobile and desktop models, and thus we proceeded by disaggregating PC's into
these two groups.)1 We now discuss the two sets of findings separately.

      IV.1 RESULTS FOR DESKTOP MODELS

      We began by estimating yearly regression equations using an expanded

version of the T-A functional form specified in Berndt-Griliches, where squared

values of LRAN, LMAXRAM, LMBZ, LHDDSK, L.RAM, LSIZE and LWCT (variables

identified by the suffix SQ), as well as interaction variables LRAMHARD,

LMHZSIZE, and LWGTSIZE were included as regressors.12 We also added a dummy

variable DNOHDDSK for models having no hard disk. With our basic model refined

in this manner, we then examined parameter stability issues further.

      Our first result is that for desktop models from 1989 to 1992, there is

little support for parameter stability. Comparing the year-by-year regressions

with the 1989-92 pooled fully saturated model, we reject the hypothesis of

parameter stability using both the traditional F-test (test statistic of 6.11,

.01 critical value of 1.39) and the 5% RMSE criteria (b.RMSE is 9.70%).

Moreover, this rejection of parameter stability largely remains even when one

compares year-by-year with adjacent- (two) year regressions. Specifically, for

1989-90 and 1991-92, the F-test statistics of 4.35 and 3.22 exceed the .01

critical values of 1.71 and 1.79, while for 1990-91 there is marginal support

for parameter stability (test statistic of 1.52 compared to 1.70 critical

value). Similar conclusions emerge when using the .RMSE criterion (the 1989-90,

90-91 and 91-92 E.RMSE are 7.67X, 1.35%, and 5.10%, respectively).

      Given this rejection of parameter stability for the desktop models and our

testing methodology, we terminate our testing procedure for further functional

form restrictions, such as those involving the T-A and other models. However,

several other results are worth noting. First, with each yearly regression,

results from Box-Cox regressions strongly supported the log-log specification.13

Second, as is seen in Table 4 where results from year-by-year regressions are

presented, a number of reasons underly the rejection of parameter stability.

In 1989 and 1992. for example, the coefficients on LRAN and LRAMSQ are

statistic-ally significant, but are reversed in sign; similar significant sign

reversals occur in 1991 and 1992 for LMAXRAN and UIAXRAMSQ. Trends in other

coefficients are also evident, such as those for LHDDSKSQ, LRAMHARD, LMCT and

LWGTSQ. Of special interest are coefficients on several premium brand name

dummy variables. For IBM, DELL, CMPQ, APPLE and ZEN, the 1992 estimates

indicate sharp declines from earlier years, corroborating the highly publicized

aggressive changes in pricing strategy adopted by these companies in 1992 to

meet competitive market pressures. In fact, by summing the company and company-

1992 coefficients, we find that in 1992, quality-adjusted list prices for IBM.

DELL, and CMPQ were not significantly different from the "OTHER" brand names,

ZEN had become somewhat cheaper, and while APPLE still commanded a premium

price, this premium had been approximately halved. Third, even though

parameters vary considerably by year, the yearly estimates are plausible. In

Figure 1, for example, we plot the fitted price of desktop PC models as a

function of speed (in MHZ) for 1989 and for 1992, where all other variables are

measured at their yearly sample means and MHZ is plotted over the observed range

of values for that year. As is seen in Figure 1, the price frontier is upward

sloping, but has fallen sharply between 1989 and 1992. A similar pattern is

displayed in Figure 2, where desktop computer price is plotted as a function of

hard disk capacity.

      IV.2 RESULTS FOR MOBILE MODELS

      The results we obtained from regressions with mobile (laptop, notebook,

and transportable) models differed considerably from those of the desktop

models. First, the considerable nonlinearities among variables such as MHZ,

RAM, HDDSK, and MAXRAM were not significant in the mobile model regressions.

This led us to stay with a more parsimonious and linear specification. Second,

somewhat surprisingly, there was some support for parameter stability over time

in the mobile model regressions. Specifically, when the pooled fully saturated

regression (with 1992 dummy intercepts for premium brands) was compared with the

year-by-year regressions, the parameter restrictions of the former did not

reduce goodness of fit significantly; the traditional F-statistic was 0.97 (with

a .01 critical value of 1.60), while the RMSE was 1.00%. However, this non-

rejection of parameter stability over the entire time period masks somewhat the

possibility that 1992 may be different. In particular, based on a comparison of

year-by-year with adjacent-year regressions, the null hypothesis of parameter

stability (except for time dummies) is clearly not rejected in 1989-90 and 1990-

91 (F-test statistics of 0.46 and 0.49, .01 critical values of 2.01 and 2.07,

and RMSE of -2.72% and -2.04%), but is rather marginal for 1991-92 (F-statistic

of 2.07, .01 critical value of 2.18, and IRMSE of 4.70% being very close to our

5% threshhold). We consider this 1992 result further in Section V below.

      Based on the pooled model, when the more restrictive T-A and T-V models

were compared to the fully saturated model, again the loss of fit was

insignificant; the F-statistic for the nine restrictions of the T-A model was

1.60 (.01 critical value of 2.41), and for the four restrictions of the T-V

model it was 1.02 (.01 critical value of 3.32); the respective RMSE's were

0.82% and 0.14%. However, the two restrictions of the V-A model were decisively

rejected (F-statistic of 8.85 compared to a .01 critical value of 4.61, and

IRMSE of 8.94%). Hence the T-A and T-V models empirically dominate the V-A
PC PRICE INDEXES IN THE 1990'S                                    -
                                                                      Page 20 -

specification.    In terms of choice between the T-A and T-V models, we can

compare their RMSE (recall they differ in number of parameters), and on this

criterion, there is a modest preference for the traditional T-A hedonic price

equation --   0.2650 for T-A vs. a slightly larger 0.2664 for T-V. Moreover, with
this T-A model, the specification test outlined in Section III yields supportive

results; T-A as a special case of the fully saturated model is not rejected.14

Finally, with T-A, a Box-Cox transformation yields further support for the log-

log model; the estimate of A is 0.1854 and its 99% confidence interval ranges

from -0.1958 to 0.4094, thereby including the A — 0 (log-log) specification.

      Parameter estimates from the pooled T-A model are given in Table 5. As

expected, coefficient estimates on LRAM, LtRZ, LMAXRAN and LHDDSK are positive

and significant. with that on L1-IDDSK being particularly large (1.27). Since the

LDENSE variable is defined as log(WCT/SIZE), the total effect of LWGT on LPRICE

is the sum of the coefficients on LWCT and LDENSE - -   about   -0.20. The marginal

effect of LSIZE on LPRICE is the negative of the LDENSE parameter estimate -      -

therefore   about -0.19. Hence increases in weight and in size, ceteris paribus,

reduce prices of mobile models, but there is also a premium for density. The

estimate of the DCOLOR parameter is positive, as is that on DNOI-IARD, and both

are substantial (the no hard disk models tended to be very small, powerful and

 expensive models). Although the DACE dummy variables have positive parameter

 estimates consistent with the notion of 'survival of the fittest", the number of

AGE3 models is very small, and thus the insignificance of this parameter is not

 surprising. In terms of brand effects, the APPLE, CMPQ and ZEN premia are

 substantial until 1992, but the large negative estimates of DAPPLE92, DCMPQ92,

 DIBM92 and DZEN92 reveal a sharp change in pricing strategies by these companies

 to meet heightened competition. Interestingly, the slightly positive estimate

 of DTOSH92 suggests that Toshiba did not follow the other major brands in

reducing 1992 prices. Finally, the very large and negative estimate of the D92

dummy variable suggests that in 1992, quality-adjusted prices of mobile computer

models dropped significantly. This raises issues of price index measurement, to

which we now turn our attention.

V.       PRICE INDEX RESULTS

         Price indexes based on the various hedonic price equations can be

constructed in a variety of ways, often reflecting different assumptions

concerning what is being held fixed over time. In this section we construct and

comment on several price indexes, based for the most part on our hedonic

regression equations, but varying in their interpretation and in their use of

parameter estimates and quantity weights.

      V.1 PRICE INDEXES FOR MOBILE COMPUTER MODELS

      Recall from the introduction that a crude measure of price increase is

simply the change over time in the unweighted sample means of models. For

mobile computer models, as is shown in the first row of Table 6, for 1989-92

this yields an AAGR of -10.6%. Since no matched models occur between 1989 and

1990, one cannot replicate the BLS-like matched model procedure for the mobile

PC models.15 Based on the various estimated hedonic price equations, however,

one can construct a number of quality-adjusted price indexes.

      One simple procedure for constructing price indexes is to use the dummy

variable coefficient on the last-year time dummy in adjacent year regressions,

and simply exponentiate it. For example, letting the price index for 1989 be

1.0, exponentiate the T90 time dummy from the 1989-90 adjacent year regressions,

and set this equal to the 1990 price index. For 1991. exponentiate the T9l time

dummy from the 1990-91 adjacent year regression, and multiply this by the 1990

price index: do an analogous calculation for the 1992 price index, based on the

1991-92 adjacent year regression. The results of such calculations are given in

the second row of Table 6.16 There it is seen that the quality-adjusted price

index falls about 13% in 1990, another 12% in 1991, and then drops more

dramatically by about 41% in 1992. The average annual growth rate (AACR) over

 the three-year time period is about -23%. This is more than twice as large a

price decline as that based on simple arithmetic means.

       An alternative price index calculation can be undertaken using the

 saturated dummy variable model, estimated over the 1989-92 time period.

 Analogous to the matched model procedure used by the BLS, one can envisage a

 matched vintage price index procedure. Specifically, note that from 1989 to

1990, three vintages overlap       1987, 1988 and 1989. Using overall 1989-92

sample means for all other right-hand variables, we construct a fitted price for

1989 and for 1990, where the vintage-time interaction coefficients on the 1987-

89 overlapping vintages are weighted by the sample means of the vintage-time

dummy variables in the two years, where these weights sum        to   unity. Then we

construct a 1990 price index as the 1990 fitted price divided by the 1989 fitted

price. We do similar calculations involving three overlapping vintages for

successive years 1991 and 1992. The results of this calculation are given in
PC PRICE INDEXES IN THE 1990'S                                  Page 26 -

the third row of Table 6, where it is seen that the matched vintage price index
based on the saturated model yields price indexes that fall at a slightly larger

rate than the hedonic price index from the adjacent year regressions (an AACR of

-26.51 vs. -23.2%).

      Recall from Section IV.2 that there was some empirical support for the

1989-92 pooled T-A specification, although there also was evidence pointing to

the 1992 parameters being different. In the pooled model, if one exponentiates

the 1990, 1991, and 1992 time dummy coefficients (with 1992 modified to account

for the brand-specific dummies as noted in the previous footnote), one obtains

another set of price indexes, which we present in row four of Table 6.   The T-A

model yields AAGR's slightly smaller than those based on the saturated model

(-23.8% vs. -26.5%), but very similar to those based on adjacent year regres-

sions (-23.8% vs. -23.2%). This similarity in AAGR's of quality-adjusted price

indexes is not surprising, since the adjacent year, fully saturated and T-A

models were not rejected as valid special cases of the yearly regression models.

Moreover, the price index calculation for the saturated model is based on a

matched vintage notion, which is not quite the same as that based on time

dummies, and thus the slight difference among them is not surprising.

      Each of the above price indexes is based on a regression equation that

implicitly weights each observation equally. An alternative price index concept

 is one we call a fixed-weight Laspeyres index. In this index, one employs the

parameter estimates (which reflect implicit characteristic quality prices) and

 fixed base-period quantity weights for the characteristics (sample means of the

 regressors in the base year, say 1989) to compute fitted prices for 1989, 1990,

 1991 and 1992. The ratio of the various yearly fitted values to the 1989 value

 is then the Laspeyres quality fixed (1989) price index. Such a calculation

 could be done with yearly, or pooled parameters. Since the evidence presented

 above is somewhat marginal concerning 1992, we employ and compare results based
                                                                  Page 25 -

PC PRICE INDEXES IN THE 1990'S

on both the year-by-year and pooled coefficients. With pooled coefficients, as

seen in Table 6, the resulting Laspeyres index declines at a smaller rate than

the pooled T-A index (-19.0 vs. -23.8%), even though both are based on identical

parameter estimates; when yearly coefficients are employed, the AACR becomes

-17.1%. Both these values are considerably smaller (in absolute value) than

that based on the pooled TA model. The reason for this difference is that the

use of 1989 fixed quality weights does not capture adequately the significant

change in quality that occurred for mobile models between 1989 and 1992.

     To shed more light on this weighting issue, we also compute a Paasche-type

quality updated price index. For 1990, this Paasche index computes a fitted

price using the pooled and 1990-specific parameters along with the 1990 quality

(mean characteristics) weights, and for 1989 the fitted price is computed using

the same 1990 quality weights, but the pooled and 1989-specific parameters. The

1990 Paasche index is then calculated as the ratio of 1990 to 1989 fitted

prices. For 1991. the quality weights are updated to 1991, and fitted prices

are calculated for 1991 using pooled and 1991-specific parameters, while for

1989 the pooled and 1989-specific parameters are employed with 1991 quality

weights. The 1991 price index is then computed as the ratio of these 1991 and

1989 fitted prices. A similar quality updating occurs for 1992. Hence, unlike

the case with the Laspeyres fixed 1989 quality price index, with this Paasche

updated quality price index the changes over time in quality are explicitly

incorporated as changing weights. As shown in Table 6, with the Paasche index

the AACR declines slightly more rapidly than the Laspeyres indexes (-21.2% vs

-17.1 to -19.1%).

      Yet another set of possible weights to employ in calculating an aggregate

price index is based on model-specific revenue shares that vary over time.

Following procedures detailed in Berndt-Griliches [19931, we calculate a Divisia

price index, using the year-by-year coefficients and models for which we were
PC PRICE INDEXES IN THE   1990'S                               -
                                                                   Page 26 -

able to obtain quantity sales data)-7 It is worth noting here that with the
mobile models, there was very little overlap of models between years --    indeed

in 1992, all mobile models for which sales data were available were new.       This

implies that the Berndt-Griliches Divisia index procedure, a procedure    that

compares the fitted price of a model in, say,   1992 with a fitted price of an

unobserved model having 1992 characteristics but fictitiously existing in 1991,

is not likely to be as reliable when there is no overlap of models between

years. Somewhat surprisingly, therefore, as is shown in the bottom panel of

Table 6, with this share-weighted Divisia procedure, the decline in the price

index is -23.9% per year, very similar to price index trends based on the

adjacent year and pooled T-A model regressions.'8.

      v.2 PRICE INDEXES FOR DESKTOP COMPUTER MODELS

      We now turn to desktop models, which dominate mobile models in terms of

numbers (1456 vs. 427), and on the basis of revenue shares (the yearly revenue

shares of desktops in 1989-92 are 83%, 88%, 83% and 76%). Again, we construct a

variety of price indexes, reported in Table 7 below. A price index calculated

 as the simple arithmetic means of prices of all models by year, relative to

 1989, declines at an annual rate of 9.7%, while one based on the matched model

 procedure declines about twice as rapidly, -19.32%. Both these measures

 understate considerably the quality-adjusted decline in prices, however.

       As seen in the third row of Table 7, when quality-adjusted price indexes

 are computed using the saturated model specification with pooled 1989-92

 parameters, the index declines at a much larger rate of -31.23%. This rate of

 decline is reasonably robust to alternative model specifications, being -32.13%

 for the pooled T-A model, and -31.15% based on the adjacent year regressions.

 It is even robust to the use of year-by-year coefficients and the Divisia index,

 which declines at an AAGR of -31.93%. However, if one employs the fixed 1989

 quality weights and computes a Laspeyres index analogous to that discussed

above, the rate of decline increases to an AAGR of -36.59%. By contrast, if one

computes a Paasche price index, the decline is considerably smaller, an AACR of

-25.6%. This suggests that with this data, the choice of weights appears to

make a much more critical difference to price index calculations than does the

choice of model specification. Price indexes based on (statistically rejected)

models with parameter stability imposed are very similar to those based on

yearly regressions and adjacent-year regressions.

      It is also worth noting that quality-adjusted prices for desktop models

tended to decline more rapidly than for mobile models (the respective Divisia

indexes decline at -31.93% and -23.90%), This raises the issue of how one might
compute a price index for the combined desktop-mobile markets.

      V.3 PRICE INDEXES FOR COMBINED DESKTOP AND MOBILE COMPUTER MODELS

      One way of computing a composite PC price index is simply to pooi the

data, ignore differences in parameters between mobile and desktop models, and

simply exponentiate the appropriate time dummy variable coefficients. Such a

simple approach has some support, for the evidence presented above suggests that

AACR's of price indexes are reasonably robust, even when calculated using

hedonic models that are statistically rejected. Using a pooled T-A type hedonic

model, we obtain 1989-92 price indexes of 1.000, 0.771, 0.694 and 0.358,

yielding an AACR of -28.97%.

      Alternatively, one could employ the separate regression models for the

mobile and desktop models along with year-by-year coefficients, and then

calculate a combined mobile-desktop Divisia index. When this is done, we obtain

1989-92 price indexes equal to 1.000, 0.963, 0.914 and 0.349, implying an AACR

of -29.62%. Hence even though the procedures and models differ considerably,

the resulting average growth trends are surprisingly similar -    -a   1989-92 price

index for the total PC market declines on average between 29 and 30% per year.

VI.   SUMMARY REMARKS

      Our purpose in this paper has been to construct a number of quality-

adjusted price indexes for personal computers in the US marketplace over the

1989-92 time period. To do this, we generalized earlier work on incorporating

simultaneously time, age and vintage effects into an unbalanced panel data set,

and we developed a corresponding specification test procedure.

      Our results can be summarized as follows. Parameters of hedonic price

equations differed in the mobile and desktop PC markets. Although there was

very little evidence supporting parameter stability over time in the desktop

market, in the mobile market the evidence suggested overall parameter stability;

                                                                      Page 29 -

however, even in the mobile market there was a suggestion of parameters being

different in 1992. Given parameter stability in the mobile market, we also

found substantial support for the traditional hedonic price equation involving

time and age variables, in addition to the various measures of quality. In

particular, the traditional 1-A model was not rejected as a special case of the

fully saturated dummy variable specification. For both the mobile and desktop

markets, the Box-Cox model provided support for the log-log formulation.

      A simple arithmetic mean of prices of models by year reveals a price

decline of about 10% per year. The common government statistical agency

procedure of using only matched model prices generates a much larger rate of

price decline - -   about   19% per year. But this matched model procedure is also

unreliable, for by construction it excludes new models. When data on new

models, as well as surviving vintages, are employed in the estimation of hedonic

price equations, a variety of quality-adjusted price indexes can be calculated,

with varying interpretations. Although there are some differences, on average

these quality-adjusted price indexes based on econometrically estimated hedonic

price equations decline at about 30% per year. The average decline in the

mobile market was about 24%, while that in the desktop market was larger at 32%

per year. Together these results imply that taking quality changes properly

into account has a very substantial impact on the time pattern of price indexes.

      The research in this paper can be extended in a number of ways. First,

the DATAPRO data set we have employed is based on list price data. To the

extent it is feasible, it would be useful to gather "street" prices for as many

models as possible from advertisements in appropriate magazines, newspapers and

journals. To the extent that increasing competition has widened the gap between

list and transactions prices, the approximately 30% decline in quality-adjusted

price indexes for personal computers may understate somewhat the true rate of

price decline. On the other hand, the 1992 change by premium manufacturers in
PC PRICE INDEXES IN THE 1990'S                                  -
                                                                    Page 30 -

list   price policy that more closely matched the transactions prices of mail

order firms could generate overstated price declines. Which effect dominates

empirically is an important empirical issue worthy of further examination.

        Second, it would be interesting to link the mobile and desktop markets,

which are essentially separate in our analysis. One way of doing this would be

to pooi mobile and desktop models (with, perhaps, a separate intercept term for

each) until mobile models became sufficiently important to generate a "regime

shift", and thereafter to treat them separately. The link could be constructed

by comparing fitted prices for the various models pre-regime shift (using the

pooled parameters) and post-regime fit (based on separate regressions), and then

weighting by using a Divisia index.

        Finally, the prices and embodied technological change in new models of

personal computers have an obsolescing impact on older vintages. A most

interesting line of research would be to gather data on prices of used

computers, and then to model and estimate the price movements of used models

over time in response to the persistent and dramatic technological change

embodied in new models.

2Year-to-year real price changes based on their preferred T-A pooled model
were, from 1982-83 to 1987-88, respectively, -33%, -1%, -36%, -34%, -28%,
and -35%, implying an AAGR of -28.7%.

3A recent unpublished paper by Nelson, Tanguay and Patterson [1992], using a
sample of 1841 IBM-compatible PC models (but excluding laptops and notebooks)
from 1984 through 1991 and similar estimation procedures yields an AACR of
-23.4%; for the common period of 1984-88, the Berndt-Griliches estimate of
price change is an AACR of -25.5%, while that for Nelson et al. is a
comparable -24.5%.

5Brand-specific dummy variables were introduced for all brands having a market
share of 2.0% or more, where market share here means the number of model
versions of a particular brand divided by the total number of all model
versions (1,883) from 1989 to 1992.

example, if the model had the terms a1TIME + a2VINTAGE + Q3ACE + o4TIME2 +
a5VINTAGE2 + a6AGE2, one could solve out for AGE —      TIME - VINTAGE, substitute

9The restrictions are based on the assumption that V90, T89 and AGEO are the
omitted dummy variables in the T-A, V-A and T-V models having an intercept
term.

'°That the effect of age is the same for all time periods turns out to involve
redundant restrictions.

11The F-test statistic for the null hypothesis of parameter equality across
mobile and desktop models was 13.47, while the .01 critical value is 1.49; the
ARMSE was 14.05%. The rejection was also decisive when a DMOBILE dummy
variable was included.

12The L prefix denotes a natural logarithm transformation. Following
                                                                      Bernt-
Criliches, we defined LHDDSK and LHDDSKSQ as log(MB + 1) and (log(MB + 1))
respectively. Note that the interaction variables are calculated as the
product of the logs, and not as the log of the product.

13Estimates of the Box-Cox A parameter and values of the     test statistic for
the null hypothesis that A — 0 are, respectively, -0,05 and 0.35 for 1989,
0.02 and 0.27 for 1990, 0.06 and 1.56 for 1991, and -0.30 and 3.33 for 1992.

14The F-test statistic is 1.60, while the .01     critical   value is 2.41; the
RMSE is 0.82%.

15For 1990-91 and 1991-92, however, matched models do occur. Based on these
matched models, price indexes for 1991 and 1992 are 0.9966 and 0.5673,
respectively. Thus the 1990-92 AAGR for matched mobile models is -24.7%,
which is about twice the comparable growth rate based on arithmetic means
(-12.5%).

16SLnce the 1991-92 adjacent year regressions have 1992-specific brand dummy
variables (see Table 5), it is necessary to weight the 1992 brand coefficients
by the 1991-92 mean proportion of that brand's models, and add this weighted
sum to the 1992 time dummy before exponentiation.

Corporation.

18However, when we employed pooled coefficients, the 1990-92 Divisia price
indexes were 0.9786, 1.0169 and 0.7935, implying an AAGR of but -7.42%.
