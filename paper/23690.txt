                                           ABSTRACT

This paper presents an analysis of the effect of China's entry into the WTO on the quality choices
of Chinese exporters in terms of their outputs and their inputs. Using highly disaggregated firm-
level data, we show that the quality upgrading made possible by China's tariff reductions was
concentrated in the least productive Chinese exporters. These firms, which had been laggards in
terms of quality prior to the tariff reduction, were the most aggressive in increasing the quality of
their exports and their inputs and in redirecting their exports toward high income markets where
demand for high quality goods is strong. Our empirical results are consistent with a simple model
featuring scale effect and non-Hicks' neutral productivity that disproportionately affects the
efficiency with which firms use intermediate inputs. This latter feature does not appear in
workhorse models of firm heterogeneity and endogenous quality choice which provide a distorted
view of the impact of trade liberalization on quality upgrading.

1       Introduction
Firms from developing countries historically have failed to break into developed country
markets. Much of their difficulties stem from an inability to produce at sufficiently low
cost the high quality goods that these markets demand. One of the reasons proposed
for the competitive disadvantage of developing country firms is that government efforts
to protect domestic intermediate input producers artificially raise the cost of the high
quality intermediate inputs necessary to produce high quality goods.
    This paper presents an analysis of the effect of China’s entry into the WTO on the
quality of Chinese exports. We use highly disaggregated firm-product-level data and the
shock of China’s entry into the WTO to trace through in detail the mechanisms through
which trade liberalization contributes to quality upgrading by Chinese firms. We find
that the chief beneficiaries of liberalized intermediate input tariffs are not the initially
most productive firms but are instead the less productive firms that are operating in
industries in which the scope for quality variation is the most pronounced. It is these lower
productivity firms that are most likely to upgrade the quality of their exports, increase
the quality of their imported intermediates, and upgrade their workforces. In so doing,
these firms are better able to break into markets with high demand for product quality
and reduce the gap in their quality performance relative to initially more productive
firms.
    China’s entry into the WTO in 2001 provides an excellent opportunity to identify the
causal effect of trade liberalization on quality upgrading. First, the tariff reductions im-
posed on China, viewed as unilateral trade liberalization, were largely outside of China’s
control.1 Second, China’s imports are mostly dominated by intermediate inputs with
tiny share of final consumption goods, and so the impact of import tariff reductions is
largely operating on imported intermediate inputs.2 Third, the effect of tariff reductions
on the cost of Chinese production is highly heterogeneous across industries and across
    1
     As a condition for WTO accession, the reduction in import tariffs by China is largely viewed as the
unilateral trade liberalization, because the WTO accession does not require corresponding changes in its
trading partners’ import barriers (Ju, Shi and Wei, 2012). It is also well known that its major trading
partners had already granted MFN treatment to China long before China joined the WTO (Fan, Li and
Yeaple, 2015). The summary statistics of the export tariff reductions also supports the fact of unilateral
liberalization: between the sample period of 2001 and 2006, the export tariff reductions imposed on
China’s exports by trading partners are around 1%. In contrast, the average import tariff reductions by
China are around 6% during the same period.
   2
     Based on product classification by BEC (Broad Economic Categories), intermediate goods and capital
goods account for 74% and 19%, and final consumption goods account for only 4%, of total import values
for China during 2000-2006. A fourth “uncertain” category accounts for approximately 3%. If we view
capital goods also as “intermediates”, then intermediates account for 93% of total imports in China. In
contrast, the share of intermediate goods in total imports for US is approximately 47% during the same
period. To show the comparison of import composition between China and other developed countries, we
present the share of the four categories of goods, namely, capital goods, consumption goods, intermediate
goods, and uncertain goods, in total imports for China, US, EU, and Japan in Figure A.1 in the online
appendix (see Appendix D).


                                                    2
firms within industries. We carefully calculate total factor productivity of Chinese firms
just prior to the trade liberalization and provide the following stylized facts: low TFP
exporters were most likely (i) to increase their export prices to foreign destinations, and
(ii) to increase the wages they pay their workers and the prices they pay for their inputs.
Importantly, these outcomes were only present in those industries in which quality het-
erogeneity across products is high. Moreover, the evidence at the extensive margin shows
that low TFP exporters were most likely to expand into high income country markets
where demand for high quality goods is strong.
    We develop a simple model of output and input quality choice to flesh out the mech-
anisms at work. In the model, firms differ in their productivity and maximize profits by
choosing the quality of their output and inputs. As in many models of innovation, our
model features scale effects whereby a larger market share induces more quality innova-
tion and more productive firms charge higher export prices. Additionally, higher quality
output requires higher quality (and more expensive) inputs. As a result, more productive
firms pay higher prices for their inputs and sell at higher prices for their outputs. This
mechanism induces firms to upgrade their quality in response to a reduction in import
tariffs since productivity and low cost inputs are in a sense substitutable. More impor-
tantly, firm productivity is not Hicks’ neutral and disproportionately affects the efficiency
with which firms use intermediate inputs. As initially more productive firms are less af-
fected by cost of inputs, the return to quality upgrading for high productivity firms is
less sensitive to tariffs on imported inputs. Consequently, our model makes it possible
to explain why more productive firms produce higher quality output using higher quality
inputs, but gain less from tariff reductions than less productive firms.
    We use the first-order conditions of our model to devise an econometric strategy to
estimate the size of mechanism at work in our model. The model’s predictions prove to be
robust to a wide range of econometric specifications, to alternate methods of calculating
tariff reductions enjoyed at the firm level or industry level, and to alternative measures
of initial firm productivity. More importantly, we provide support to the interpretation
of the data as quality upgrading through input prices of both labor input and imported
intermediate inputs as well as through the share of imported inputs in total intermediate
inputs. In addition, we present evidence at the extensive margin that the change in export
price and destination markets’ income is more pronounced for less productive firms who
aggressively respond to input tariff reductions by shifting their exports from countries
with relatively weak demand for high-quality goods to countries with strong demand for
high-quality goods.
   Our paper is linked to a large literature on firm heterogeneity in performance. We
show how firm heterogeneity in productivity maps into firm heterogeneity in quality and
how shocks to the economic environment caused by trade liberalization alters this map-


                                             3
ping. Our theoretical model shows and our empirical estimates confirm that the role
of productivity is not as simple as the standard heterogeneous-firm models that have
followed from the canonical Melitz (2003) framework. In particular, our results show
that firms demonstrating high productivity in highly protected developing countries are
relatively well adapted for an environment in which high quality intermediates are ex-
pensive to procure. In this way, our results provide nuance to the results of Halpern,
Koren and Szeidl (2015) who show asymmetric effects across Hungarian firms’ measured
productivities following a trade liberalization. Improved access to intermediate inputs fa-
vors relatively low productivity exporters who were less efficient in handling intermediate
inputs before trade.3
    Our paper also contributes to a growing literature on the impact of greater access
to imported intermediate inputs on firm-level performance, especially on export quality.4
Highly related, recent examples include Fan, Li and Yeaple (2015) and Bas and Strauss-
Kahn (2015). Fan, Li and Yeaple (2015) focus on cross industry heterogeneity. They show
that export price increases were present only in those industries in which quality variation
was initially high and that firms tended to migrate toward markets and toward products in
which quality heterogeneity is most important. Our current paper digs deeper into cross-
firm heterogeneity within industries. We show that, both theoretically and empirically,
the chief beneficiaries of the tariff reduction with respect to trade liberalization is not
the most productive firms who were initially producing relatively high quality goods from
high quality inputs but was rather the least productive of the set of exporters. Indeed, the
most productive firms may respond little to tariff cuts on their imported intermediates
and to the extent that they did, they simply passed cost savings on to consumers. Bas
and Strauss-Kahn (2015) explore the link between tariff cuts that hit Chinese exporters
asymmetrically and the prices paid by firms for their imported inputs and received for
their exports. This paper also differs from Fan, Li and Yeaple (2015) and Bas and
Strauss-Kahn (2015) by examining extensive margin effect that firms set different prices
for their outputs in different markets and how the extensive margin relates to a firm’s
initial productivity under trade liberalization.
   Much of the literature on the effect of trade liberalization on quality (e.g. Verhoogen,
2008) relies on variation in access to foreign markets following a fall in foreign tariffs or
a real exchange rate shock. The interpretation given in these papers tends to be one
   3
     Feng, Li and Swenson (2016) provide evidence that private Chinese firms derived a greater benefit
from imported foreign intermediates relative to foreign invested firms, which is consistent with the
interpretation given by Halpern, Koren and Szeidl (2015).
   4
     For instance, Amiti and Konings (2007) and Kasahara and Rodrigue (2008) for the impact on
productivity. Antràs, Fort and Tintelnot (2017) estimate a model in which profits are supermodular in
productivity and imports. Goldberg et al. (2010) show that access to greater intermediate inputs induced
Indian firms to expand their product scope. Manova and Zhang (2012a) focuses on cross sectional data in
trying to infer the relationship between export quality and productivity. We take the further step to look
at the effect of trade liberalization on the relationship between input/output quality and productivity.


                                                    4
of scale effects: more productive firms enjoy large sales which tilts innovation decisions
toward higher variable profits at the expense of higher fixed costs. Our paper shows this
mechanism alone is insufficient to understanding the heterogeneous quality upgrading
that is actually observed: the impact on scale effects for the most productive firms needs
to be moderated by some form of decreasing variable returns.5
    The remainder of this paper is organized in five sections. In Section 2, we describe the
data and generate a series of stylized facts on the link between firms’ initial productivity,
export and import prices, and the subsequent adjustment of export and input prices
following the trade liberalization. In Section 3, we introduce a model that shows how
input and output quality and firm initial efficiency map into a firm’s choice of export
and input prices and how this mapping is altered by falling input tariffs. In Section 4,
we specify a simple econometric model and describe the construction of the data and
measures used to estimate the model. Section 5 provides the main results and robustness
exercises concerning the link between a firm’s initial productivity, the size of the tariff
reduction experienced, and the resulting impact on export prices, input prices (such as
imported input prices and wage payment) and export destinations. The final section
concludes.



2       Data and Stylized Facts
Data.— To capture firms’ productivity and import/export prices, we merged two databases:
(1) the firm-product-level trade data from Chinese customs, and (2) the firm-level pro-
duction data, collected and maintained by the National Bureau of Statistics of China
(NBSC). Our sample period is between 2001 and 2006.6
    The transaction-level trade data, provided by China’s General Administration of Cus-
toms covers the universe of all Chinese exports and imports in 2001-2006 at the HS 8-digit
level. For each trade transaction, it records detailed information including import and
export values, quantities, products, source or destination countries, contact information
of the firm (e.g., company name, telephone, zip code, contact person), type of enterprises
(e.g. state owned, domestic private, foreign invested, and joint ventures), and customs
regime (e.g. “Processing and Assembling”and “Processing with Imported Materials”).
As firms under processing trade regime are not subject to import tariffs, we focus on
firms under ordinary trade regime. Then we aggregate transaction-level data to firm-HS6
product-level or firm-HS6-country trade data.7 For each HS 6-digit product, we use ex-
    5
     Our framework shares much in common with Feenstra and Romalis (2014) who focus primarily on
aggregate provision of quality across markets, but do not explore the differential impacts of quality across
firms and the heterogeneous response within industry.
   6
     We do not include the year 2000 because the WTO tariff data at HS 8-digit level are not available.
   7
     China changed HS-8 codes in 2002, and the concordance between the old and new HS-8 codes (before


                                                     5
port/import values and quantities to compute unit value export/import prices by each
firm.8 Our empirical analysis for product/variety therefore refers to either HS6 product
category or HS6-country combination.
    To characterize firms’ attributes such as TFP and capital intensity, we also use the
NBSC firm-level production data from the annual surveys of Chinese manufacturing
firms, covering all state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and non-state-owned enterprises with
annual sales of at least 5 million Renminbi (RMB). The NBSC database contains firm-
level production and accounting information of manufacturing enterprises in China, such
as employment, capital stock, gross output, value added, and firm identification (e.g.,
company name, telephone number, zip code, contact person). Due to some mis-reporting,
we follow Cai and Liu (2009) and use General Accepted Accounting Principles to delete
the unsatisfactory observations.9
    Then we merge the firm-product-level trade data from the Chinese Customs Database
with the NBSC Database using the contact information of manufacturing firms.10 Our
matching procedure is done by company name first, and next by both zip code and
telephone number, and lastly by telephone number and contact person name together
(see detailed description of the matching process in Fan, Lai and Li, 2015). Our merged
sample covers 52.4% of total export value and 42% of total import value reported by the
Customs Database.11
    We use the NBSC firm-level production data to measure revenue TFP in our main
results. To overcome known issues in revenue TFP, we also show that our main results
are robust to physical TFP measures by merging the firm-level revenue-based production
data with another newly obtained dataset on firms’ quantity output from the NBSC for
the same sample period (see Section 4.3 for more detailed discussion on various TFP
measures and their estimation methods).12
and after 2002) is not available. To ensure the consistency of the product categorization over time (2001-
2006), we choose to adopt HS-6 codes maintained by the World Customs Organization (WCO) and use
the conversion table from the UN Comtrade to convert the HS 2002 codes into the HS 1996 codes.
    8
      We use two measures to compute unit value export/import prices: (1) the export/import prices of
each HS 6-digit goods by each firm, and (2) the export/import prices of the HS 6-digit goods shipped
to/from different countries by each firm, i.e., we view the same HS 6-digit goods exported to/imported
from different countries as “different” varieties.
    9
      We use the following rules to construct our sample: (i) the total assets must be higher than the
liquid assets; (ii) the total assets must be larger than the total fixed assets; (iii) the total assets must be
larger than the net value of the fixed assets; (iv) a firm must have a unique identification number; and
(v) the established time must be valid.
   10
      This merging has to be done using the contact information of firms due to the lack of consistent
firm identification between the two databases. The NBSC Database uses the corporate representative
codes to identify firms while the Customs Database adopts another set of corporate custom codes as firm
identity. These two firm identity coding systems are not transferable between each other.
   11
      When merging the Customs Database with the NBSC data, we exclude intermediaries and/or trading
companies.
   12
      This quantity output database contains information on each product, defined by the Chinese product
classification (CPC) at the 5-digit level, produced by the firm, and in particular, output quantity. We


                                                      6
    Finally, the Chinese import tariff data are obtained from the WTO website, available
as MFN (most-favored nation) applied tariff at the most disaggregated level, the HS 8-
digit level, for the period 2001-2006.13 As our product is defined at HS6 level, we compute
average tariff at HS6 level by using each HS8 tariff line within the same HS6 code. We
then calculate firm-specific and industry-specific tariffs in empirical investigation (see
more details in Section 4.2). The summary statistics of key variables in our firm-product(-
country) sample for regression analysis are reported in Table 1.

   Stylized Facts.— Now we document three stylized facts concerning the relationship
between output/input prices and productivity during trade liberalization. In this section
we use unit-value price as coarse proxy for quality because quality differentiation is often
viewed as the main determinant of variation in export unit values (Hallak, 2006; Feenstra
and Romalis, 2014), and also because of its simplicity and easy availability in the data.
We acknowledge that, apart from quality, there exist other determinants of export unit
are able to merge this quantity database with the NBSC production data as the two databases adopt
the same firm identification code. We will focus on single-product firms in estimating physical TFP.

     The data are available at http://tariffdata.wto.org/ReportersAndProducts.aspx.

values (see a more explicit and detailed discussion in Hallak, 2006). As a result, unit value
prices are not perfect proxies for quality. The development in the literature proposes a
solution using price and market share data to estimate quality (see a seminal work by
Khandelwal, 2010). In the later part of this paper we will also estimate quality as residual
from a demand equation. Nonetheless, here we document stylized facts using data on
unit values.
    The key message from those facts is the closing gap between less and more productive
firms following the initial differences in terms of their output and input prices under
trade liberalization. As China joined the WTO in December of 2001, we use the data
from 2001 to represent the pre-liberalization period and data from 2006 to represent the
post-liberalization period. All firms we examine are incumbent exporting/importing firms
that are present in both pre- and post-liberalization periods. We focus on incumbent two-
way traders that conduct both exporting and importing because of their importance in
the productivity distribution and data availability. Since a product is defined at either
HS6 or HS6-destination level, it is convenient to compare the changes in export prices
at different levels of aggregation that can uncover how changes in the composition of
destination markets affect average export prices.
   Fact 1: Levels and changes of export prices with respect to firm initial productivity.—
Table 2 reports the changes in (log) export prices by less and more productive firms via
the levels of export prices in both 2001 and 2006. Firms are divided into two groups –
high- and low-productivity firms based on whether their labor productivity (value added
per worker) is above or below the median in the pooled sample in 2001.14 Within each
group, the median and mean (log) export prices per firm-product in 2001 and in 2006 as
well as the percentage changes (in parentheses) are reported.
    Table 2 shows that firms with lower initial productivity increase export prices more
than those with higher initial productivity, at both firm-product and firm-product-country
levels. It is also interesting to note that the price increases are greater at HS6 product
level than at HS6-country level due to a composition effect, i.e., firms would charge
higher average export prices by entering more destination markets where demand for
high quality goods is strong after trade liberalization. To better illustrate the difference
between low- and high-productivity firms regarding the change in their export prices of
both HS6-country or HS6 products, we also plot the distributions of export prices (in
natural logarithm) in 2001 and 2006 in Figure 1. The left panel of Figure 1 refers to firms
with initial productivity lower than median productivity; the right panel refers to firms

    Using estimated total factor productivity (TFP) to group the data yields similar patterns. Note that
when using value added per worker or revenue based TFP measures, prices might pollute the measured
TFP cutoff used to construct two groups of firms. Then a simple mean-revision pattern would occur to
yield higher price growth for initially low-price firms. To eliminate this concern, we also use physical
productivity measures and show the robustness of our results to the use of physical TFP (see later
discussion in Section 5.1.2 “Robustness for Main Results”).

bottom and top 2nd percentiles. The distributions of export prices for both HS6 product
and HS6-country move to the right in 2006, and this shifting pattern is more profound
for low-productivity firms. We summarize the first stylized fact as follows:

Stylized fact 1. During trade liberalization, firms with lower initial productivity raise
export prices more than those with higher initial productivity.

    Fact 2: Export price changes depend on product quality differentiation.— To explore
whether the effect of trade liberalization on export prices depends on quality differenti-
ation, we report in Table 3 export price changes for all goods, differentiated goods, and
homogeneous goods, according to Rauch’s product classification (Rauch, 1999).15 It is
usual practice in the trade-and-quality literature that adopts differentiated goods and ho-
mogeneous goods to roughly represent heterogeneous-quality products (i.e., goods with
large scope for quality differentiation) and homogeneous-quality products (i.e., goods
with small scope for quality differentiation), respectively. There are two observations
in Table 3. First, for all goods and differentiated products, the firms with lower initial
productivity always raise their export prices more than those with higher initial pro-
ductivity (see column 1 vs. 2 and column 3 vs. 4), while for homogeneous goods this
pattern is less pronounced (see column 5 vs. 6). Second, for firms with similar pro-
ductivity (see low-productivity firms in odd columns and high-productivity firms in even
columns), the export price increases show the greatest changes in differentiated goods,
the medium changes in all goods, and the least changes in homogeneous goods. Figure 2
also presents the differential effect of product differentiation on price distributions by firm
productivity: the export prices of differentiated goods significantly increase from 2001
  15
    Here homogeneous goods include both goods traded on organized exchanges and reference-priced
goods. When we use a narrower definition of homogeneous goods with only organized-exchanged goods,
the fact still remains.

to 2006 in Panel (a) where the low-productivity firms (in the left graph) raise export
prices more than high-productivity firms do (in the right graph), i.e., the gap between
the solid line and the dashed line is larger for low-productivity firms; while the export
prices of homogeneous goods nearly remain unchanged over time (see Panel (b)) regard-
less of firm productivity.16 This suggests that the effect of tariff reduction on export
prices conditional on firms’ initial productivity also depends on the scope for product
quality differentiation. The finding is summarized as follows:

Stylized fact 2. During trade liberalization, firms with lower initial productivity raise
export prices of heterogeneous-quality products more than those with higher initial pro-
ductivity, while the changes in export prices of homogeneous-quality products are less
pronounced regardless of firm productivity.

         Notes: The initial values (in logarithm) refer to wage payment and import prices in 2001 (presented
         in brackets underneath). ≤50th indicates the firms associated with lower initial productivity (i.e.,
         the bottom 50th percentile); >50th indicates the firms associated with higher initial productivity
         (i.e., the top 50th percentile).




    Fact 3: Changes in input prices.— Table 4 shows that the changes in labor input
prices through wage payment per firm and the percentage changes in import prices for
intermediate inputs per firm-product between 2001 and 2006 indeed depend on initial firm
productivity. Columns 1 and 2 present the results for wage payments; columns 3-4 and
5-6 show the results for import prices at HS6-source country and HS6 level, respectively.
Table 4 clearly shows that the increases in wages and import prices are greater for initially
low productivity firms (see the odd columns vs. even columns). Also, the initial values
in brackets show that more productive firms pay higher input prices at the beginning.
Hence, we have the following stylized fact:

Stylized fact 3. More productive firms pay higher input prices for both its primary and
intermediate inputs. During trade liberalization, firms purchase more expensive labor and
intermediate inputs. This effect is more pronounced for less productive firms.



3      Model
In this section, we develop a simple model to rationalize the stylized facts presented
in the previous section. There are two mechanisms at work in the model. First, more
productive firms charge higher prices for their output and pay higher prices for their
inputs because large scale production induces productive firms to dramatically upgrade
their output quality and high output quality requires high quality inputs. This mechanism
also induces firms to upgrade their quality in response to a reduction in import tariffs. The
second mechanism makes the model’s predictions consistent with the stylized fact that
quality upgrading’s effects are larger for initially less productive firms. This mechanism
arises from the assumption that firm productivity disproportionately affects the efficiency


                                                           12
with which firms use intermediate inputs. Hence, a reduction in the cost of imported
intermediates acts as a relatively less powerful impact on the initially more productive
firms.


3.1    Assumptions

As we are interested in how firms behave both within and across industries, we consider
the following system of preferences:

                            I             Z                                     σ σ−1
                                                                                     i
                            X                            ηi        σi −1           i
                       U=         νi ln           q(ω) x(ω)
                                                         σi         σi
                                                                           dω             ,
                             i             ω∈Ωi

where νi is the share of industry i in total expenditure, q(ω) is a measure of quality
of variety ω, x(ω) is the quantity of variety ω consumed, σi > 1 is the elasticity of
substitution across varieties of good i, ηi > 0 is a measure of the scope for quality
differentiation, and Ωi is the set of varieties available of good i. These preferences imply
that in a market in which aggregate expenditure is E, the demand for variety ω in industry
i is
                              xi (ω) = νi EPiσi −1 q(ω)ηi p(ω)−σi .                      (1)

where Pi is the industry-level price index that is exogenous from the point of view of
individual firms.
    Producing a higher quality product raises firm profitability directly through its effect
on demand but it is more costly to the firm for two reasons. First, product design incurs
fixed costs and these fixed costs depend on the number of attributes that the firm chooses
to build into the variety. We assume that these fixed costs, measured in terms of bundles
of the primary inputs is given by f q βi . The industry subscript on βi > 0 indicates that
given the nature of goods in some industries, designing products with a large number
of attributes desired by consumers differs. The higher is βi the more difficult it is to
design products that consumers value more. Hence, a large value of βi or a low value of
ηi indicates that the scope for quality differentiation is limited.
    Second, producing higher quality output requires firms to use higher quality inputs.
The production function for output of quality q for a firm of productivity ϕ takes the
following form:

                                              1−µi             µi
                                       V (q)             Mi (q)
                     xi (q) = ϕ                                         , µi ∈ (0, 1)         (2)
                                      1 − µi              µi
where V (q) is a bundle of primary factors of quality q, Mi (q) is a composite intermediate
input of quality q that is used in industry i, and ϕ is firm productivity. The price facing


                                                   13
the firm for a bundle of primary factors of quality q is given by w(q) = wg(q), where
g(q) is a strictly increasing function of quality. The price of a bundle of intermediate
inputs of quality q is given by PiM (q). The composite intermediate input is produced via
a Leontief production function over a unit interval of individual intermediates, indexed
by m ∈ [0, 1]. The price of any input m of quality q in China is pd g(q), where pd is
a constant. A firm may also source an intermediate input from abroad. The imported
price of that intermediate input m of quality q is τ pf (m)g(q), where τ is one plus the ad
valorem tariff on the input and pf (m) is strictly decreasing and continuous in m.17 We
assume that τ pf (0) > pd and τ pf (1) < pd so that there exists a cutoff intermediate that
is not imported that is solution to

                                            τ pf (m∗ ) = pd .

Hence, the price of the composite intermediate input of quality q is given by
                                                                                         Z   1           
                                                                             ∗
           PiM (q; τ ) = PeiM (τ )g(q), where PeiM (τ ) =                m pd + τ                 pf (m)dm .   (3)
                                                                                          m∗


It follows from these assumptions, that the cost of production of a firm of productivity
ϕ for a level of quality q is given by
                                                                           µi
                                                     1−µi
                                                 w              PeiM (τ )
                               cP (q; ϕ, τ ) =                                    g(q).                        (4)
                                                                ϕ

    In addition to production costs, we assume that firms also face a variety of additional
costs of handling of their outputs. Those costs possibly span all stages of production,
including prior, post, and during production services, such as services of product design,
advertisement, production monitoring, product quality control, distribution, etc. It is
natural to think that higher quality goods require better all-around production services
given by S(q) = swg(q).18 In the similar spirit of a per unit shipping charge in Hummels
and Skiba (2004), the specific transport costs in Feenstra and Romalis (2014) and the
distribution cost in Chatterjee, Dix-Carneiro and Vichyanond (2013), we assume that
these costs are per unit of output sold so that the total cost of providing a unit of final
  17
     In the online appendix, we develop a simple microfoundation for the price setting given here (see
Appendix A).
  18
     The assumption that all-around production services vary in quality is realistic but is made primarily
for convenience. It is realistic because, according to Chinese data, firms that produce high quality out-
puts are also high-productivity firms that indeed disproportionately hire more highly-educated workers.
Meanwhile, it is safe to believe that those all-around production services usually require hiring non-
production workers to conduct management related tasks, and highly-educated workers often conduct
management related, non-production tasks.

                                                                          µi 
                                                     1−µi

                        Ci (q; ϕ, τ ) = sw +                                   g(q).                 (5)
                                                                ϕ

Henceforth, we parameterize the quality premium schedule as g(q) = q α .
    As the assumption of an additional component of marginal cost that is not subject to
a firm’s productivity is not common in the literature, it is worth discussing its role in the
model. As both all-around production services and production itself are required in fixed
proportion within a firm we have essentially adopted a Leontief production function in
which firm productivity disproportionately affects the cost of the activity using interme-
diate inputs. This means the marginal cost effect of changes in intermediate input prices
is relatively smaller for more productive firms than for less productive firms.19


3.2     Implications

We now explore the implications of our model for firms’ choices of quality of inputs,
outputs, and prices as a function of firms’ productivities and the input tariffs that they
face. We consider a particular industry and drop the industry subscript i, henceforth.
    Conditional on its cost-minimizing choice on the source of intermediate inputs, the
firm chooses its price, p, and its quality, q, to maximize its export profits of the firm,
which are given by


                        π(ϕ) = max (p − C(q; ϕ, τ )) x(q, p, ω) − f q β ,
                                                                       
                                   p,q

Substituting (1) and (5) and solving for the first-order conditions for the choice of quality
of outputs and inputs and the price of the final good, we find that the optimal quality
choice is given by

    More generally, a model that features concavity of the profit function with respect to productivity
where more productive firms respond less to a cost reduction on high-quality foreign inputs would
generate the similar predictions as in the current model. In the online appendix we present a more
general formulation with wider interpretations (see Appendix B).

Note that an interior solution requires that β > η − α(σ − 1) > 0, which we assume holds
henceforth.
    We first consider the variation across firms in their choices of the quality of inputs,
outputs and price as a function of variation across firms in their productivities given a
tariff on intermediate inputs. Differentiating equations (6) and (7), yield the elasticities of
quality and output price with respect to firm productivity. This yields after substitution,

Given that an increase in quality of output implies an increase in the quality of inputs,
the following propostion is immediate from equations (8) and (9):

Proposition 1. More productive firms always produce higher quality output than less
productive firms and so use inputs (local and foreign) that feature higher prices than less
productive firms. In industries in which the scope for quality differentiation is high (η >
β), more productive firms also charge higher prices for their output than less productive
firms while the opposite is true in industries in which the scope for quality differentiation
is small (η < β).

   The prediction is consistent with the stylized fact that more productive firms pay
higher wages and buy higher quality inputs. The result is driven by the scale effects
associated with quality innovation. More productive firms produce at larger scale and
so benefit more from increases in demand induced by quality innovation relative to less
productive firms.
    We now consider the effect of a reduction in the tariff on intermediate inputs such as
followed China’s accession to the WTO. Totally differentiating equations (6) and (7), we
obtain

The following propositions are immediate from equations (10) and (11):

Proposition 2. A reduction in tariffs on intermediate inputs induces firms to upgrade
their quality. This effect is smaller in absolute magnitude for high productivity firms. The
differential effect between low- vs. high-productivity is most pronounced in industries in
which the scope for quality differentiation is higher (high η or small β).

Proposition 3. In industries in which the scope for quality differentiation is high (η >
β), a reduction in tariffs on intermediate inputs induces firms with lower productivity
to raise the price of their final output more than those with higher productivity. The
differential effect between low- vs. high-productivity is most pronounced in industries in
which the scope for quality differentiation is higher (high η or small β); while the opposite
is true in industries in which the scope for quality differentiation is small (η < β).

    The above propositions are consistent with Fan, Li and Yeaple (2015), but extend
the implications to the differential effect between low- vs. high-productivity and to the
choice of input qualities. The key mechanism driving the heterogeneous response of
firms of different productivity is driven by the assumption that firm productivity is not
Hicks’ neutral and disproportionately affects a subset of inputs that includes imported
intermediate inputs.20
    Now, the impact of the tariff reduction on the payment for both primary factors and
foreign intermediate inputs satisfy
  20
    Note that firms use both a bundle of primary factor inputs (e.g., labor inputs) and composite inter-
mediate inputs to product outputs. As aforementioned, we find in Chinese data that high-productivity
firms do tend to be more skill intensive as they disproportionately hire more highly-educated workers
(see footnote 18 for more details).

Upgrading of input qualities, induced by a reduction in tariff on intermediate inputs,
increases the payment for primary factors.

Proposition 4. A reduction in tariffs on intermediate inputs, τ , induces firms with lower
productivity to increase their payment for both primary and intermediate inputs more than
those with higher productivity. The differential effect between low- vs. high-productivity
is most pronounced in industries in which the scope for quality differentiation is higher
(high η or small β).

    The above predictions show that our model of scale effects and non-Hicks neutral
productivity differences across firms can generate the broad set of stylized facts presented
in the previous section. The model is novel in establishing a mechanism through which
more productive firms produce higher quality and sell at higher prices but respond less to
a reduction in the cost of imported intermediates. That more productive firms produce
higher quality and sell at higher prices in any given environment is driven by the scale
effects. The less sensitive response of high-productivity firms to tariff reductions is due
to the fact that productivity and low cost inputs are in a sense substitutable so that
a reduction in tariffs on intermediate inputs has a bigger impact on the costs of less
productive firms.
    Before concluding this section, we describe a simple extension of the model that would
allow analysis of the extensive margin. By observation of equation (6), it is immediate
that firms sell higher quality products in countries with high demand, A, which in some
extent reflects GDP per capita since higher quality products are consumed in these coun-
tries. Suppose that countries with high levels of demand (A) involve very high upfront
investments in distribution and advertizing. If these investments are sufficiently costly,
only the most productive firms would sell there. As a reduction in input tariffs lowers
the variable costs of less productive by a larger percentage, it is the less productive firms
that are most likely to upgrade the set of markets in which they operate. Specifically,
those less productive firms will start exporting to countries with higher demand A and,
as a result, to raise export prices more, while more productive firms have already been
operating in those higher demand markets before trade liberalization. We will show in

                                             18
Section 5.3 “Evidence of Extensive Margin of Exports” that this is exactly what happens
in the data.
    In summary, we have shown that understanding the data require the standard model
regarding the relationship between quality upgrading and firm productivity to be amended
in such a way that firm productivity is non-Hicks neutral. Moreover, the model makes
predictions over the logarithmic changes in tariffs to logarithmic changes in the price of
inputs and the price of outputs at the firm level where the effect of tariff changes is het-
erogeneous across firms of different initial productivities. In the next section, we devise
a simple econometric model that captures exactly these predictions.



4      Empirical Strategy
In this section we specify our main estimating equation and describe the measures of the
key components of the econometric model, namely, tariff reductions and productivity.


4.1     Baseline Specification

Our empirical investigation is guided by the propositions of our model regarding the
changes in output and input prices with respect to firm productivity during trade lib-
eralization. To test how the effect of tariff reductions on export prices depends on firm
productivity, we estimate the following equation:

∆ ln(pf h(c) ) = β1 ∆Dutyf +β2 ∆Dutyf ×ln(T F P )f +β3 ∆ ln(T F P )f +βf ∆χf +βi ∆HHIi +ϕs +f h(c) ,
                                                                                        (14)
where ∆ denotes a change in any variable during a five-year period between 2001 and
2006, i.e, ∆x = x2006 − x2001 ;21 ∆ ln(pf h(c) ) denotes the change in log unit value export
price of HS6 product h exported by firm f (to destination country c). The specification
can represent a firm-product-destination-level (f hc) regression or one at the firm-product
level (f h), in which case the optional c subscript is omitted. ∆Dutyf is the change
of import tariff faced by firm f which is firm-specific (see detailed description on the
construction of firm-specific tariff measures in Section 4.2);22 ∆Dutyf × ln(T F P )f is
the interaction term of the change of import tariffs and the firm’s initial productivity;
  21
     We use long difference because the adjustment to the shock of trade liberalization may be slow (e.g.,
Fan, Li and Yeaple, 2015) and there may also be issues of autocorrelation when estimating the model
in levels (Trefler, 2004). We also experiment with shorter difference estimators using various periods,
including four-year, three-year, and two-year difference. The results remain qualitatively similar and are
reported in the online appendix (see related discussion of baseline results in Table 5 in Section 5.1.1
“Main Results”).
  22
     We also report results using conventional industry-level input tariffs in robustness checks (see Section
5.1.2) and obtain qualitatively similar results.



                                                     19
∆ ln(T F P )f controls for the change in firm productivity (estimated TFP) that affects
price change.23 The vector ∆χf t consists of other firm-level observables that potentially
affect export prices, including the change of capital intensity (capital to labor ratio), the
change of total employment, and the change of total wage bill. We also add ∆HHIi to
control for the change in competition effect through Herfindahl index, computed at the
4-digit CIC (Chinese Industrial Classification) industry level. In addition, we control the
2-digit CIC industry-fixed effect ϕs . Finally, f h(c) is unobserved demand and cost shocks
that affect export prices. When we examine input prices, the dependent variable will be
replaced by import prices at firm-HS6(-country) level or wage payments at firm level.
    Our theory predicts that the coefficient of ∆Dutyf , β1 and, in particular, the coeffi-
cient of the interaction term ∆Dutyf × ln(T F P )f , β2 , should be negative and positive,
respectively in the industries where the scope for quality differentiation is large. As the
scope for quality differentiation decreases, the aforementioned effect becomes weaker, i.e.,
β1 increases and even becomes positive, β2 decreases and may also becomes negative such
that the differential effects of tariff reduction on price change for low productivity and
high productivity firms would attenuate or even reverse. We now turn to the construction
of the variables used to estimate (14).


4.2     Tariff

As the main focus of this paper is to explore the relationship between prices and produc-
tivity under trade liberalization, it is important to measure properly the effective tariff
reductions that are actually faced by firms. As in Fan, Li and Yeaple (2015), we focus on
firm-specific measures of tariff reductions due to their consistency with our theory: those
firm-specific measures use information on the exact initial bundle of intermediates im-
ported by firms and provide high resolution to the firm-specific intensive margin effects
of tariff reduction within the same industry.24 In robustness checks we also construct
conventional industry-level input-output table based measures that would be more com-
prehensive in capturing the potential to import more intermediates if firms obtain some
of the foreign intermediate inputs from other importing firms, but may miss much of the
variation of the impact of tariff reductions across firms within the same industry. Our
empirical results are not sensitive to alternative measures of tariff cuts.
  23
     In an alternative specification, we experimented with including initial TFP level (rather than the
change in TFP) along with other initial firm and industry characteristics, and obtain largely similar
results.
  24
     For example, the Input-Output sector, automobile manufacturing (Chinese I-O classification code
37074), includes the HS4 products, “motor cars & vehicles for transporting persons” (HS4 code 8703),
and “special purpose motor vehicles” (HS4 code 8705). Within the same I-O sector, some products
enjoyed substantial import tariff reduction from 80% in 2001 to 28% in 2006 (e.g., HS8 product “other
vehicles”, code 87033390), while others remain the same tariff level at 3% between 2001-2006 (e.g., HS8
product “fire fighting vehicles”, code 87033390).


                                                  20
                                                                         P
    Our main measure of firm-specific tariff reduction is ∆Dutyf =         h∈Z wh ∆Dutyh ,
where the weight wh is the import share of product h in the total import value by the
firm in the initial year, and ∆Dutyh is the tariff change at HS6 product level.25 This
firm-specific input tariff reduction measure reflects changes in effective tariffs faced by
each firm and is not subject to the problem of the weight change from 2001 to 2006.
    To assess robustness, we adopt three alternative firm-specific measures of tariff re-
ductions. The first is the arithmetic mean of product-level tariff reductions across all
imported varieties both before and after the trade liberalization. The formulation is
                                         0
              P                
∆Dutyf =        h∈Z∪Z 0 ∆Dutyh / |Z ∪ Z |, where Z is the set of varieties imported before
the tariff reduction (intensive margin), Z 0 is the set of newly imported varieties after the
tariff reduction (extensive margin), and |Z ∪ Z 0 | denotes the total number of imported
varieties by the firm over the whole sample period. This measure includes tariff changes
relevant to both the intensive margin and the extensive margin.26 The second measure is
the weighted average tariff reductions only to goods that are clearly intermediate inputs,
according to the Broad Economic Categories (BEC) classification.
    The third measure attempts to connect individual tariff reductions on intermediate
inputs to specific goods in the firm’s export portfolio of products. We follow Manova and
Zhang (2012b) to focus on foreign inputs in the same broad industry classification as the
output product. For example, if a firm buys brakes and seat belts and sells cars, both its
exports and imports would be recorded in the motor vehicles industry. If the company
also manufactures cell phones, tariff reduction in SIM cards would enter the measure of
import tariff change of its cell phones but not that of its cars. Therefore, we construct the
weighted average tariff change across all the inputs imported by the firm (e.g. brakes,
seat belts) in a given HS4 category (e.g. motor vehicle) and assign this average tariff
change to all products exported by this firm in the same HS4 category. Using this
method we eventually compute the firm-product specific tariff change ∆Dutyf h for each
product h exported by firm f .27 Among all the firm-specific tariff reduction measures,
  25
     ∆Dutyh ≈ ∆ ln τh since τ > 1 is one plus the tariff rate, and the HS6 product index h is the
empirical counterpart of intermediate type z in the model. When constructing the weighted average
change in input tariffs, we use a product’s imports in total import value by the firm as weights, because
this measure has been widely employed in the literature (e.g., Fan, Li and Yeaple, 2015; Yu, 2015). It is
also because we lack precise data on domestic intermediate inputs: the value of total intermediate inputs
in the NBSC firm production survey data is denominated in Chinese currency, while the imports in the
customs data are denominated in US dollar. Nonetheless, we also use an alternative weighting scheme
where the weight is computed as the import share of product h in the total costs of intermediate inputs
by the firm in the initial year, as suggested by one of the referees, and obtain similar results (see related
discussion of baseline results of Table 5 in Section 5.1.1 “Main Results” and the supplementary table in
the online appendix).
  26
     This measure isolates pure changes in tariffs rather than the changes in input bundles (Ge, Lai and
Zhu, 2011) by fixing the total number of imported varieties over the sample period.
  27
     We also compute this tariff measure at HS2 level by assigning the average tariff across all the imported
inputs in a given HS2 category to all products exported by the same firm within the same HS2 category
and it yields the similar results. Those results are available upon request.



                                                     21
this one generates the smallest sample size as it loses those exported products that have
no imported inputs in the same HS4 category.


4.3     Productivity

To control for changes in firm productivity, we estimate various measures of productivity,
including revenue-based total factor productivity (TFP), physical TFP, and value added
per worker.28 We also report results using firm size and alternative quantity-based proxy
for firm-product level productivity. Our results are robust across productivity measures.
    Our primary TFP measure is revenue TFP using the method of Olley-Pakes (hereafter
O-P) (Olley and Pakes, 1996) that has been augmented to account for additional firm-
level decisions.For instance, we allow a firm’s trade status in the TFP realization, as
in Amiti and Konings (2007), by including two trade-status dummy variables-an export
dummy (equal to one for exports and zero otherwise) and an import dummy (equal to
one for imports and zero otherwise). We also inclu de a WTO dummy (i.e., one for a year
since 2002 and zero for before) in the O-P estimation as the accession to WTO represents
a positive demand shock for China’s exports.
    In estimating revenue TFP, we measure output using value-added,29 and deflate firms’
inputs (e.g., capital) and value added, using the input price deflators and output price
deflators from Brandt, Van Biesebroeck and Zhang (2012).30 We construct the real in-
vestment variable via the perpetual inventory method. For the depreciation rate we use
each firm’s real depreciation rate provided by the NBSC firm-production database. Be-
sides TFP estimated using the O-P method, our results are robust to various approaches
in estimating revenue TFP, including the OLS method and the Ackerberg-Caves-Frazer
augmented O-P and L-P (Levinsohn and Petrin, 2003) methods (Ackerberg, Caves and
Frazer, 2006).
    Because revenue TFP estimated using sales or value added deflated by industry-
level producer price index can create an omitted-variable bias (see detailed explanation
in De Loecker and Goldberg (2014)), we also report results using physical TFP, firm-
product export quantity as proxy for firm-product-level productivity, and other variables
of efficiency or firm size, such as value added per worker, total sales or total employment
payment. Our main results are robust to all those quantity-based productivity measures
  28
     We estimated production functions at the 2-digit CIC level. In total, there are 29 2-digit CIC
industries.
  29
     Our results are not sensitive to TFP measures estimated by total output with material input. The
results are available upon request.
  30
     The output deflators are constructed using “reference price”information from China’s
Statistical Yearbooks, and the input deflators are constructed based on output defla-
tors and China’s national input-output table (2002).              The data can be accessed via
http://www.econ.kuleuven.be/public/N07057/CHINA/appendix/.



                                                 22
and alternative measures of efficiency and firm size.
    We estimate physical TFP using the method of De Loecker et al. (2016). While the
details are presented inAppendix C in the online appendix, it is worth mentioning two
specific features of the methodology. First, as in De Loecker et al. (2016) we assume
that multi-product and single-product firms use the same technology so that we can
focus on single-product firms to circumvent the problem of unobserved input allocations
in multi-product firms. We merge the NBSC firm-level production data with another
dataset on firms’ output quantity which has the same firm identity code as the NBSC
firm-level production database and provides output quantity at CPC 5-digit level (see
a more detailed description of the output quantity data in Fan et al. (2017)). Our
sample of single-product firms is about 25% of our previous sample of revenue TFP.31
Second, to solve the issue of omitted firm-specific input prices, we use the (unit value)
output prices, market shares and export status to control for the omitted input prices
in estimating the quantity-based TFP. Specifically, we follow De Loecker et al. (2016)’s
approach to “control for unobserved input price variation across firms using information
on observables, particularly (but not exclusively) output prices,” based on the belief that
output prices capture information about input prices which is a well documented fact in
the quality-and-trade literature (e.g., Kugler and Verhoogen (2012), Manova and Zhang
(2012a)). Those results are reported in Section 5.1.2.



5       Results
In this section, we present the results of our empirical analyses. We begin with firm-
level export price responses to tariff reduction. After presenting the baseline results and
robustness checks, we then consider firm-level input responses to tariff reduction. We
conclude the section with evidence regarding firm-level extensive margin responses.


5.1     Export Prices and Import Tariffs

5.1.1    Main Results

We report the impact of tariff reductions on export price changes in Table 5 using our
main measure of firm-specific tariff reduction (see detailed discussion in Section 4.2) and
the baseline regression equation (14).32 The dependent variables are firm-product-country
  31
     Nevertheless, the estimated physical TFP and revenue TFP is positively correlated. The correlation
between revenue-based TFP and quantity-based TFP in our sample is 26.41%.
  32
     We also use an alternative weighting scheme for the main tariff measure where the weight is computed
as the import share of product h in the total costs of intermediate inputs by the firm in the initial year,
as suggested by one of the referees, and obtain similar results (see Table A.1 in the online appendix).

      (log) price change at the firm-HS6-country level, computed as the log price difference of the
      same firm-HS6-country triplet from 2001 to 2006. The dependent variable in specifications
      (4)-(6) is the (log) price change at the firm-HS6 product level. All regressions include a
      constant term. Herfindahl index (HHI) is computed at the 4-digit CIC industry in China.
      Industry fixed effect is computed at 2-digit CIC industry level. When we use initial levels
      of TFP, capital-labor ratio, employment, wage payment, and Herfindahl index to replace
      the changes in those firm-level and industry-level controls, the similar results obtain: the
      coefficient of ∆Duty is still significantly negative, and the coefficient for the interaction
      term is still positive (the coefficients of the interaction terms for the firm-product-country
      and firm-product regressions are 0.203 and 0.302, respectively).



    We first discuss the results at firm-product-country level. Column 1 reports the co-
efficient estimate of regression of log changes in export prices on log changes in tariff re-
ductions. The statistically significant and negative coefficient on tariff changes indicates
that a reduction in import tariffs of 10 percentage points increases unit value export
prices at firm-product-country level by 3.4%. This result is consistent with Proposi-
tion 3 that tariff reductions induce an incumbent importer/exporter to raise its output
prices. In columns 2 and 3, we add the interaction term of tariff change and initial pro-
ductivity (∆Duty×log(TFP)), without and with firm- and industry-level controls and
industry fixed effect, respectively. The positive, and statistically significant coefficients
on the interaction term of tariff change and initial productivity suggest that initially less

                                                     24
productive firms enjoy a larger raise in export prices during trade liberalization.
    According to the coefficient estimates in column 2, a 10% reduction in import tariffs
would raise export prices by approximately 3.9% for an average firm whose (log) pro-
ductivity equals 4.3; while the same 10% tariff reduction would increase export prices by
around 6.0% for a firm whose (log) productivity is 10% lower than the average firm.33
In other words, the effect of tariff reduction on export price increase is 53.8% greater on
this less productive firm than that on the average firm. This result confirms the second
prediction in Proposition 3 that the magnitude of the effect of tariff reductions on export
prices is decreasing in a firm’s productivity.
    When we move to columns 4-6 for firm-HS6 product level regressions, similar results
obtain: a reduction in import tariff induces firms to increase export prices, and this effect
is more pronounced for low-productivity firms.34 The fact that the coefficient estimates
on tariffs and interaction terms tend to be larger at the firm-HS6 level than at the firm-
HS6-country level suggests a composition effect: import tariff reductions induce Chinese
firms to export to markets with strong demand for higher quality goods where higher
prices can be charged, and this effect is more pronounced for less productive firms.
    Besides using the interaction term to distinguish the differential effect of tariff reduc-
tions on export prices between less and more productive firms, we test Proposition 3 by
adopting a discretized version of the TFP variable to loosen the linearity assumption:

           ∆ ln(pf h(c) ) = β1 ∆Dutyf + β2H ∆Dutyf × High T F Pf + β3 High T F Pf
                         + β4 ∆ ln(T F P )f + βf ∆χf + βi ∆HHIi + ϕs + f h(c) ,

where High T F Pf is a firm-specific dummy variable that is equal to 1 if a firm belongs
to the category of high-productivity firm and is 0 otherwise.35 The corresponding results
at the firm-product-country and firm-product levels are reported in columns 1-4 and
  33
      We also present the baseline regression results of Table 5 using the demeaned (log) productivity
in Table A.2 where we demean ln(T F P ) over the estimating sample before interacting it. In that
way, the estimate on the interaction term is unaffected, but the estimate on the uninteracted term
∆Duty retains its interpretation that represents the effect of tariff reduction on an average firm. All
coefficients on ∆Duty in Table A.2 are significantly negative at the firm-product level. At the firm-
product-country level, the coefficients on ∆Duty are also significantly negative with one exception that
has 15% significance level. The negative coefficients on tariff change in Table A.2 imply that the average
effect of tariff reduction on export price is indeed negative. In other words, a reduction in import tariffs
on average would raise export prices.
   34
      We also run an F-test on key results for tariff and its interaction with TFP, since there exists a
certain amount of collinearity, especially when coefficients are not independently significant. The results
show that both coefficients of interest are statistically significant, at at least 1 percent significance level.
   35
      In the main results as shown in Table 6, we define High T F Pf = 1 if a firm’s TFP is above 75
percentile of all firms in the sample. We experimented with various thresholds, e.g., 90 percentile, 80
percentile, etc., and find similar results. Those results are available upon request. We further test the
three-segment discretized version of TFP by dividing firms into three categories, namely high-, medium-,
and low-productivity firms among which low-productivity firms are the omitted group, and also obtain
similar results (see Table A.3 in the online appendix).

5-8 in Table 6, respectively, in which the odd columns exclude firm-level and industry-
level controls while the even columns include those controls. The estimated coefficients
on ∆Duty × High T F P in all specifications are significantly positive, suggesting that
the effect of tariff reductions on export price increase for high-productivity firms is less
pronounced than that for low-productivity firms.36 Note that the sum of the relevant
coefficients (β1 + β2H ) is not statistically different from zero so one cannot conclude from
these results that the highest TFP firms actually reduce their prices in response to an
input tariff tariff cut.37 This implies that less productive firms are affected by tariff
reduction and show an increase in their export prices, and this pattern attenuates as firm
productivity rises.
   According to Proposition 3, the difference in the responses to tariff reductions between
low- and high-productivity firms should be more pronounced in industries with large
  36
      The differential effect regarding firm productivity is further supported by regressions using separate
samples for more and less productive firms (available upon request).
   37
      In our model, the potential for quality upgrading is limitless as the range of the quality of inputs
is unbounded. Were quality bounded from above, the most productive firms would respond to a trade
liberalization by lowering the price of their output while firms below a certain productivity cutoff would
increase their output price. The results here cannot distinguish between these subtle alternatives.



                                                                  26
scope for quality differentiation. We address the predicted slope heterogeneity using four
approaches to categorize industry’s scope for quality differentiation and report results in
four panels in Table 7. In Panel A, under the reasonable assumption that differentiated
goods present greater scope for quality differentiation than do homogeneous goods, we
adopt Rauch (1999)’s classification to distinguish two types of products.38 In Panel B,
we compute quality dispersion within each HS6 product as the residual from a demand
equation using observed prices and market share data as in Khandelwal, Schott and Wei
(2013) and Fan, Li and Yeaple (2015).39 Intuitively, conditional on price, higher market
shares imply higher quality (Khandelwal, 2010). We use the median of quality variances of
all goods to distinguish products with highly-dispersed quality as differentiated goods and
those with less-dispersed quality as homogeneous goods. Finally, we use R&D intensity as
a proxy for the scope for quality differentiation within an industry (Kugler and Verhoogen,
2012). We use both U.S. and Chinese data on R&D intensity and report in Panel C and
Panel D, respectively.40
    Columns 1-3 and columns 4-6 of Table 7 present firm-product-country level and firm-
product level results, respectively. The first column one reports the results using a sub-
sample where the scope for quality differentiation is large (i.e., heterogeneous goods sam-
ple). The second column reports the results obtained from the subsample where the
scope for quality differentiation is small (i.e., homogeneous goods sample). The third
reports results based on a set of interactions for the whole sample, rather than splitting
the sample in two, where the dummy variable “Diff” (Differentiated) is equal to 1 if the
product is classified as differentiated goods and zero otherwise using the aforementioned
four approaches in all panels.
    We first compare the subsample results. Table 7 shows that the effect of tariff re-
ductions on price increase is more pronounced when the scope for quality differentiation
is large (see the comparison between the subsample of heterogeneous goods and of ho-
mogeneous goods, i.e., columns 1 vs. 2 and columns 4 vs. 5). Also, the coefficients on
  38
     In our main results, we treat goods traded on organized exchanges and reference-priced goods as
homogeneous goods. An alternative classification that includes only organized-exchange goods to homo-
geneous goods and refers heterogeneous goods to both differentiated goods and reference-priced goods
generates similar results (see Table A.4 in the online appendix). Now, the coefficients on the triple inter-
action term ∆Duty× ln(TFP)×Diff are significantly positive in both firm-product level and firm-product-
country level results; the coefficients on the interaction term ∆Duty×Diff are significantly negative in
both firm-product level and firm-product-country level results.
  39
     For a more detailed discussion of quality estimation, see the later part of “(B.3) The test using
estimated quality” in “Robustness II — Alternative Explanations” in Section 5.1.2.
  40
     In Panel C, we adopt U.S. R&D intensity based on industry-level information of R&D from U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Line of Business Survey as in Kugler and Verhoogen (2012). To be
more specific, we employ the measure constructed by Kugler and Verhoogen (2012) and concord to HS6
using the concordance form the UN Comtrade. Using U.S. R&D intensity to examine the role of quality
scope on Chinese firms’ behavior may be better exempt from the potential issue of the endogeneity of
R&D than using Chinese R&D intensity. In Panel D, we compute the R&D intensity for each CIC 4-digit
industry based on Chinese R&D data from the annual surveys of NBSC manufacturing firms.

specifications (2) and (5) use subsample of homogeneous goods; specifications (3) and (6) use whole
sample. All regressions include a constant term, firm-level controls, and industry-level competition
control. Industry-level competition control refers to the change of Herfindahl index. Firm-level controls
                                                    28
include the changes between 2001 and 2006 in the following variables: TFP, capital intensity, average
wage, and total employment. Industry fixed effect is computed at 2-digit CIC industry level.
the interaction term (∆Duty× ln(TFP)) that indicate the difference between low- and
high-productivity firms are positive and significant in heterogeneous goods sample in all
specifications (see columns 1 and 4). In contrast, columns 2 and 5 show that in the sam-
ple where the scope for quality differentiation is small, all coefficients on tariff reduction
(∆Duty) and the interaction term (∆Duty× ln(TFP)) are either insignificant or smaller
in absolute magnitude.
    The contrast in the size of the coefficients between homogeneous and differentiated
goods is more noticeable at the firm-product level when comparing column 4 with column
5 than at the firm-product-country level. Apparently, the compositional shift among dif-
ferent destination markets is an important dimension of change in firm quality strategies.
To be more specific, at the firm-product level, in Panels A, C, and D, only heterogeneous
goods subsamples show significant response to tariff reduction conditional on initial pro-
ductivity while this pattern is not statistically significant in homogeneous goods sub-
samples; in Panel B, the effect of tariff reduction conditional on TFP almost doubles in
heterogeneous goods subsample, comparing with the one in homogeneous goods subsam-
ple. The comparison of those coefficients in the two types of subsamples are consistent
with our previous discussion.41
    Next, we study the results based on the whole sample using the interactions with
the “Diff” dummy (see columns 3 and 6). This exercise can pin down whether there is
indeed a statistically different effect of tariff reduction on export prices conditional on
firm productivity in heterogeneous goods industries. According to Proposition 3 of the
model, the difference in how high- and low-productivity firms respond to tariff reductions
should differ based on whether the product is differentiated or homogeneous, with stronger
effects observed for differentiated products. Thus, the variables of interest are the triple
interaction term ∆Duty× ln(TFP)×Diff and the interaction term ∆Duty×Diff.
    Columns 3 and 6 show that the coefficients on the triple interaction term are positive
in all specifications, and are all significant in firm-product level results in column 6. The
coefficients on ∆Duty×Diff at the firm-product level are all significantly negative, except
for the one in the last panel where the significance level is within 20% when Chinese
R&D data are used. The fact that the results at the firm-product level are stronger than
at the firm-product-country level is again consistent with the compositional effect that
occurs when firms switch their destination markets (see more discussion about extensive
margin later in Section 5.3).42
  41
     See Proposition 3 for theoretical justifications of possible reasons why the coefficient would reverse
the sign and the discussion after equation (14) in Section 4.1 for empirical implications.
  42
     The results of two subsamples in Table 7 also reflect the role of compositional effect for industries
in which the scope for quality differentiation is high when comparing coefficient estimates in column 1
with those in column 4, but this compositional effect does not occur in industries in which the scope for
quality differentiation is small when comparing column 2 with column 5.



                                                    29
    The results in Table 7 confirm the role of quality differentiation as stated in Propo-
sition 3: when the scope for quality differentiation becomes smaller, the effect of tariff
reduction on price changes and the differential effect between less and more productive
firms would become less pronounced or even become ambiguous.
    In the online appendix, we report several sensitivity tests. First, we show that the
results remain unchanged when we experiment with 2-year, 3-year, and 4-year lags in
Table A.5. Second, to eliminate the concern that changes in destination country import
tariffs might be affecting the results, we report in Table A.6 that adding export tariffs
does not alter our main results.43 Third, we report the weighted regression results to
alleviate the concern of heteroskedasticity in Table A.7 where various weighting schemes
are used: Panels A, B, and C are weighted by the number of observations in each 2-digit
CIC industry, the number of observations in each firm, and the export value of each firm,
respectively. Table A.7 shows that the results are not driven by small exporters.


5.1.2    Robustness for Main Results

In this subsection, we show the robustness of our results from both statistical and mech-
anism perspectives. To show the statistical robustness of our results, we conduct four
exercises. First, We show our results are robust to various measures of productivity
(including physical TFP to remove the concern of revenue-based TFP, other quantity-
based measures, labor productivity, and firm size). Second, we confirm the robustness
of our results to alternative measures of tariff cuts (including other firm-specific or firm-
product-specific measures and the conventional industry-specific tariffs). Third, we use
instrumental variable (IV hereafter) estimation to address the potential issue of the en-
dogeneity of tariff reductions and obtain similar results. In addition, we show that our
results are not biased toward big firms using the whole customs data without matching
the data to the manufacturing firm survey.
    From the mechanism perspective, we conduct three exercises to show that our results
are not sensitive to other explanations. First, we conduct a placebo test to verify the
model mechanism through imported intermediate inputs. Second, we present a battery
of sensitivity tests to eliminate the concern that our results might be spuriously picking
up the effect of other mechanisms (such as reduced policy uncertainty and currency
appreciation) rather than the import tariff reduction effect through imported intermediate
inputs. Lastly, we quality estimates to test the quality upgrading mechanism directly.

  43
     In columns 2, 4, and 6 of Table A.6 we also add the interaction term of export tariff and productivity,
the results remain qualitatively the same.

 Firm-level controls include the changes between 2001 and 2006 in the following variables: TFP, capital
 intensity, average wage, and total employment. Industry fixed effect is computed at 2-digit CIC industry
 level. When we use firm-product productivity proxy based on HS4 product, the similar results as in Panel
 B obtain.




of initial productivity on firms’ response to tariff reductions, it is important to show that
our results are robust to different approaches of estimating firm productivity. Table 8
reports robustness checks using quantity-based productivity measures. Panel A presents
results based on physical TFP (see Section 4.3 for the discussion on the measurement
issues and estimation approach).44 The first two columns correspond to the whole sample,
columns 3-4 use the subsample of differentiated goods, columns 5-6 refer to homogeneous
goods, where the odd and even columns use firm-HS6-country and firm-HS6 level price
change as dependent variable, respectively.45
  44
     We also replicate the evidence of our key stylized fact using physical TFP to divide firms into low-
and high-productivity firms and find similar patterns: the average (log) export price changes per firm-
HS6-country for low- and high-TFP firms are 20.27% and 12.12% in the whole sample, 21.04% and
14.35% in the differentiated goods sample, and -2.20% and -0.78% in the homogeneous goods sample,
respectively.
  45
     Here, the magnitude of the coefficient estimates is not always larger at more aggregated level, per-



                                                        31
    For all goods and for differentiated goods, the coefficients on tariff changes are signifi-
cantly negative, and the coefficients on ∆Duty× ln(TFP) are positive. The effect of tariff
reductions for differentiated goods are always larger than the effect for all goods across
all specifications, while for homogeneous goods the effect is insignificant. This pattern
is consistent with the prediction of Proposition 3 that the effect of tariff reduction on
price changes and the differential effect between less and more productive firms would
become less pronounced when the scope for quality differentiation is smaller. Panel B of
Table 8 reports results using firm-HS6 product level export quantity as rough proxy for
firm-product level productivity, and all previous main results still hold.46
   In addition, we use other variables, such as valued added per worker, total sales and
total wage bill to replace firm productivity.47 Table A.8 in the online appendix shows
that when using these alternative proxies all coefficients on tariff changes are significantly
negative and the ones on the interaction term ∆Duty× ln(TFP) are positive for all goods
and for differentiated goods. Furthermore, the effect of tariff reductions for differentiated
goods is always greater than the effect for all goods across all specifications, while for
homogeneous goods the effect is insignificant.
    (A.2) Alternative measures of tariff cuts.— So far our discussion is based on the effect
of firm-specific tariff reductions. This measure has the advantage of being theoretically
justified and consistent with the intensive margin effect across firms. In Section 4.2 we also
discussed various approaches to measure alternative tariff reductions and their features.
We now show that our result is robust to other firm-specific, firm-product specific and
industry-specific tariff reduction measures.
    In Table 9, columns 1-2 refer to the first alternative measure of tariff cuts using fixed
set of imported inputs, columns 3-4 adopt tariffs only of intermediate goods, and columns
5-6 use Manova and Zhang (2012b)’s method of computing the input within the same
product category. Panel A reports the results in the whole sample, Panel B presents the
results using the differentiated goods sample, and Panel C reports the results with the
homogeneous goods sample. The firm-HS6-country level results are presented in columns
1, 3, and 5, while the firm-HS6 product level results are presented in columns 2, 4, and
6.
    Table 9 shows that for all goods and for differentiated goods, the effect of tariff
haps due to the sample size change since we only keep single-product firms when estimating physical
productivity.
  46
     Results in Panel B of Table 8 use firm-product level average export quantity in the sample period
2001-2006 as proxy for productivity. We also use the export quantity in the initial year 2001 as proxy
and obtain similar results.
  47
     Here, we use the total employment payment instead of the total employment number, because firm
with different productivity pay different wages due to different levels of labor’s effort based on our model.
To drop outliers, we also delete the firms with the total employment payment below 1 percentile, around
forty thousand dollars.

reduction on export price and the difference between low- and high-productivity firms
are all significant and consistent with our model predictions. The results of differentiated
goods are stronger than the ones for all goods across all specifications, while the effect
of interest is not significant for homogeneous goods. Since Measure 3 is firm-product

    One might worry that the correlation between the reduction in import tariffs on inter-
mediate inputs and tariff cuts on firms’ outputs might cause the coefficient estimates to
be polluted by competition effects (Amiti and Khandelwal, 2013). Moreover, as discussed
in Section 4.2, while the firm-specific measures of tariff cuts have advantages, they may
  48
    Adding firm fixed effect instead of HS6 product fixed effect in columns 5 and 6 would make coefficients
become insignificant. The reason of insignificance when including firm fixed effect is that each firm only
exports a small amount of products in the sample of using Measure 3 and, moreover, there is on average
only 1.58 firm-product tariff lines (based on Measure 3) within each firm.

miss the broader effect of tariff cuts on intermediate inputs when firms use domestically
purchased intermediate inputs that are produced by other importing firms. We address
these concerns by including output tariffs and input tariffs constructed using input-output
tables.49
    Table 10 reports results of both level regressions (see Panel A) and difference esti-
mations (see Panel B). In Panel A, the dependent variable is (log) price at firm-HS6-
destination level in odd columns and (log) price at firm-HS6 level in even columns. To
better capture the variation of export prices over time, we control for year fixed effects
and firm-HS6(-country) fixed effect in level regressions. The coefficients on input tariff
are mostly significant and negative, and the coefficients on the interaction term are al-
ways significantly positive, for the samples of all goods and differentiated goods, even
after precisely controlling for firm-HS6(-destination) fixed effects. This pattern is more
profound when using difference estimations in Panel B. To sum up, using industry-level
input tariff does not alter our main results even after taking into account the effect of
output tariffs.
    So far, we have shown that our results are robust to alternative productivity and tariff
measures using the subsamples of differentiated goods and of homogeneous goods. In ad-
dition, we check those robustness results using the triple interaction term ∆Duty× ln(TFP)×Diff
with the whole sample in Table A.10 for alternative measures of productivity and firm-
specific tariff cuts and in Table A.11 for industry input and output tariff measures in
the online appendix. We find that the coefficients on the triple interaction term are all
positive and they are mostly significant at firm-product level, which further confirms the
differential effect of tariff reduction between low- and high-productivity firms.
    In addition, to assess the average effect of tariff reduction on export price change using
alternative measures of productivity and tariff cuts, we demean (log) productivity before
interacting it for the main specifications of Tables 8, 9, and 10. The results are reported in
Table A.12 in the online appendix where columns 1-2 correspond to physical TFP measure
and export quantity measure, columns 3-5 use the three alternative measures of tariff
cuts, and column 6 corresponds to industry-specific tariff reductions. The significantly
negative coefficients on tariff change in columns 1 and 2 indicate that the average effects
of tariff reductions are negative and robust for alternative productivity measures. When
using alternative tariff measures, the average effects also remain significantly negative for
Measure 2 and industry-specific tariff (see columns 4 and 6).50
  49
     We map the harmonized system (HS) 8-digit tariffs into the 3-digit Chinese Input-Output sectors
(coded in 5-digit format). Our 3-digit output tariff, then, is the simple average of the tariffs in the HS
8-digit codes within each 3-digit IO industry code. To compute the input tariff, following    P Amitioutput
                                                                                                       and
Konings (2007) we use an input cost weighted average of output tariffs where:τitinput = k aki τkt
        output
where τkt      is the tariff on industry k at time t, and aki is the weight of industry k in the input cost
of industry i. Then we convert the input tariffs to CIC 4-digit industry level.

    (A.3) Endogeneity.— Now, we address the issue of the potential endogeneity of tariff
changes, though we believe that tariff changes are arguably exogenous from the individ-
ual firm’s perspective. Using industry-specific input tariffs alleviates the concern of the
endogeneity of tariff cuts, but does not eliminate the concern. To address this issue, we
re-estimate the baseline specification using past tariff levels as instruments for changes
in tariffs as is commonly done in the literature (e.g., Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2005; Amiti
and Konings, 2007). The idea is that the past tariffs are strongly correlated with the
current changes in tariffs, but the past tariffs are uncorrelated with the error term or any
other determinants of the dependent variable in the baseline regressions. Because the
results of instrument are not qualitatively different, they are reported in Table A.13 in
the online appendix in order to conserve space.
    (A.4) Large sample test using whole customs data.— So far, our results are based on
a merged sample that combines both the NBSC firm production data and the customs
data. As the NBSC dataset contains only large firms, selection bias is a potential concern.
This problem is not unique to our data: in developing countries and low-income countries
a large proportion of firms may not be part of conventionally available datasets (see
McCaig and Pavcnik (2014, 2015) for related evidence in Vietnam). Since our focus is on
incumbent firms who are already exporters/importers, the left end of the firm distribution
that contains the smallest firms is beyond the scope of this paper. Nonetheless, to alleviate
the concern of sample selection bias, we present results using the whole customs data that
covers the universe of all firms that either export or import through Chinese customs. As
we cannot estimate TFP for lack of NBSC firm production data, we employ total export
value as proxy for firm productivity and include HS2-product fixed effects. As the results
are strongly consistent with our benchmark results, especially at the firm-product level,
we present them in Table A.14 in the online appendix. We also replicate key stylized
facts using whole customs data (see Table A.15 in the online appendix) and find that the
key stylized facts still hold.
B. Robustness II — Alternative Explanations
    (B.1) Placebo test using processing trade.— Our previous results were based on ordi-
nary trade firms that pay import tariffs to import intermediate inputs. Processing firms
were excluded because they are not subject to tariffs. As a placebo we replicate our base-
line regressions using processing trade firms as a comparison group.51 Since our model
tariff reductions are still negative though insignificant.
   51
      A firm cannot freely choose between ordinary trade and processing trade: its choice of trade regime
is often constrained by financing situation. Profits, profit-to-sales ratios, and value added are higher for
firms that conduct more ordinary relative to processing trade, while processing trade firms must face
some constraint that prevents them from doing ordinary trade (Manova and Yu, 2016). Thus, even
though processing firms can benefit from import tariff exempt, firms may not necessarily want to engage
more in processing trade as it is a low value-added trade regime in the context of global production chain.
This is also reflected in the steady share of processing exports in total exports over time that is around
55% (Kee and Tang, 2016). This eliminates the concern that firms purposely conduct more processing


                                                    36
highlights the channel through the improved access to imported intermediate inputs, we
expect that processing trade firms do not respond significantly to tariff reductions and
certainly there is no difference of the response between low- and high-productivity pro-
cessing firms. Table A.16 in the online appendix reports the results using processing trade
sample and confirms our expectation: All coefficients on tariff reductions and interaction
terms are statistically insignificant.
    (B.2) Sensitivity to other mechanisms.— One may concern that there are other mech-
anisms through which trade liberalization affects low- and high-productivity firms differ-
ently regarding their export price changes. Those potential mechanisms include reduced
uncertainty that restraints Chinese firms’ ability to export to certain markets, especially
those high-income countries where demand for high quality goods is strong, and appre-
ciation of Chinese currency.
   Policy uncertainty.— Prior to its accession to the WTO, China was vulnerable to the
sudden loss of MFN status in its trade relations with the United States, where such status
required annual congressional action to maintain. Pierce and Schott (2013) have shown
that this vulnerability depressed Chinese exports to the U.S., particularly in industries
where non-MFN tariffs were very high. To role out the potential for this mechanism
to drive our results, we remove the U.S. from our sample and reestimated our main
equations. The resulting estimates for all goods, differentiated goods, and homogeneous
goods are shown in columns 1, 4, and 7 in Table A.17 in the online appendix, respectively.
    Currency appreciation.— As China’s currency, Reminbi (RMB), has appreciated since
July 2005, one may be also concerned that the price increase is partially due to the
appreciation of RMB. It is possible that a stronger RMB reduces firms’ costs to purchase
imported inputs with local currency, and thus provides firms more incentive to switch to
better inputs. To test the sensitivity of our results to RMB appreciation, we use the data
during the period before the appreciation to test whether export prices indeed increase
without currency appreciation. As the RMB appreciated in late 2005, we dropped data
of 2005 and 2006, and conduct the long-difference estimation for the period between 2001
and 2004 in columns 2, 5 and 8 for firm-HS6-country level price change (∆ ln pf hc ) and
columns 3, 6, and 9 for firm-HS6 level price change (∆ ln pf h ) in Table A.17, respectively.
    (B.3) The test using estimated quality.— It is not easy to directly measure quality,
but we can infer “effective quality” (quality as it enters consumer’s utility) from observed
prices and market shares. We estimate “quality” of exported product h shipped to
destination country c by firm f in year t, qf hct , according to demand equation (1) in
the model, using an OLS regression as in Khandelwal, Schott and Wei (2013) and Fan,
trade in order to avoid paying import tariff.




                                                37
Li and Yeaple (2015), via the following empirical demand equation in our model:

                             ln(xf hct ) + σ ln(pf hct ) = ϕh + ϕct + f hct                          (15)

where xf hct denotes the demand for a particular firm’s export of product h in destination
country c in year t, pf hct is the price the firm charges that equals the price that consumers
face, σ is the elasticity of substitution across products, the country-year fixed effect ϕct
collects the destination-year specific information including price index and expenditure
at destination markets, and the product fixed effect ϕh captures the information on prices
and demand across product categories due to the inherent characteristics of products. We
allow the elasticity of substitution to vary across industries (σi ) using the estimates of
Broda and Weinstein (2006) to estimate quality.52 Then estimated quality is ln(q̂f hct ) =
ˆf hct , i.e., the residual from equation (15).53
    The results using estimated quality as dependent variable are reported in Table A.18
in the online appendix. The results present a similar pattern as in our main results in
which price changes are the dependent variable. In the whole sample of all goods and
the sample of differentiated goods, tariff reductions significantly induce firms to upgrade
quality of their products, and this quality upgrading pattern is more profound for low-
productivity firms as shown by the significantly positive coefficients on the interaction
term. This pattern does not appear in the homogeneous goods sample.
    (B.4) Controlling for Mark-Up Changes.—To further verify quality upgrading by
firm’s access to higher quality inputs, we check whether the effect of tariff reduction
on price increase along the intensive margin still exists after controlling markup varia-
tion. To this end, we include change in market share in our estimation to control for
the change in markup (see Amiti, Itskhoki and Konings (forthcoming) and Fan, Li and
Yeaple (2015)). In specifications (1), (3) and (5) of Table A.19 in the online appendix,
we add change in firm’s market share as control variable to test impact of tariff reduction
on ∆ ln pf hc , for all goods, differentiated goods and homogeneous goods, respectively. In
accordance, coefficients on tariff reductions are significantly negative, while coefficients
on interaction terms (∆Duty × log(TFP)) are significantly positive for all goods and
differentiated goods. As for homogeneous goods, all effects are, however, insignificant.
This alleviates the concern that our results reflect markup variation rather than quality
adjustments along the intensive margin. To address the potential endogeneity of market
  52
     Using the existing values of estimated σ from the literature is a common approach used in the prior
studies (e.g., Khandelwal, Schott and Wei, 2013). Broda and Weinstein (2006) estimate the elasticity
of substitution for disaggregated categories and report that the average and median elasticity is 7.5 and
2.8, respectively. We use their estimates aggregated to HS 2-digit level and merge with our sample. In
addition, to avoid parameterizing σi based on the existing values given in the literature, we also estimate
quality using IV estimation and our results remain robust. To save space, the results based on estimated
quality using IV estimation are not reported here, but available upon request.
  53
     Here q̂f hct ≡ qfηhct . In other words, the estimated quality q̂ is corresponding to q η .


                                                    38
share change, we employ initial tariff levels in 2001 (see columns 2, 4 and 6) facing all
other firms in the same 4-digit CIC industry to instrument market share change for each
individual firm. Again, the effect of tariff reductions on price increase across firm would
not be affected by instrumenting for market share changes.


5.2     Tariff Reduction and Input Upgrading

In this section, we explore the input implications of our model. According to Proposition
4, a reduction in import tariff would induce an incumbent exporter/importer to pay
higher prices for both its primary and intermediate inputs. That is to say, an increase in
export prices would go through two channels of input quality upgrading: the upgrade in
the quality of imported intermediate inputs and an increase in the primary input quality
involving better workers that require a higher wage. Moreover, this effect is smaller in
absolute magnitude for more productive firms, and the differential effect between low- vs.
high-productivity firms is most pronounced in industries in which the scope for quality
differentiation is high. In the end of this section, we also explore the implication for input
upgrading pattern at the extensive margin regarding the imported input share in total
intermediate inputs.
    Table 11 reports the regression results with changes in import prices as dependent vari-
able at the firm-HS6-country level (see columns 1-4) and the firm-HS6 level (see columns
5-8).54 Our model suggests that the effect of tariff reductions on the import price in-
crease would be more pronounced for low-productivity firms. As a result, the coefficients
on the interaction term ∆Duty× ln(TFP) would be positive and the coefficients on tariff
change itself would be negative. The results using the whole sample (see columns 1 and
5) and the differentiated goods subsample (see columns 2 and 6) are all significant and
consistent with our expectation. In particular, the differentiated goods subsample gen-
erates the largest response to tariff reductions, while the effect on homogeneous goods is
insignificant. The significantly positive coefficients on ∆Duty× ln(TFP) for all goods and
for differentiated goods indicate that the tariff reduction effect on import price increase
is also stronger for less productive firms.
    It is worth noting that the effect of the tariff reduction is stronger on the export
prices for final outputs than on the import prices of inputs.55 There are several potential
explanations. First, part of the quality upgrading story is due to innovation efforts on the
part of the firm induced by lower marginal cost of production. That is, only part of quality
  54
     The sample size of Table 11 for import prices at the firm-product-country level and the firm-product
level is not much different. This suggests no compositional effect from the perspective of switching
importing source countries within each firm-product dyad.
  55
     The difference between the effect on import price vs. export price can be seen by comparing columns
1 and 5 in Table 11 for import prices vs. columns 3 and 6 in the baseline results of Table 5 for export
prices.

       level.




upgrading of output is due to quality upgrading of inputs. Second, the elasticities of input
quality supply and output quality demand will in general be different. Third, as shown
by (Amiti and Khandelwal, 2013) a tariff reduction that leads to greater competition in
the home market is associated with an increase in export quality. The improved access to
imported intermediate inputs would also induce an increase in total factor productivity
or expanded export scope that would eventually relate to export quality upgrading.56
Finally, our price data is in unit values. Export unit values well capture export quality,
while only a fraction of observed import unit value differences are attributed to import
quality (Feenstra and Romalis, 2014).
    Table 11 also reports results using triple interaction term ∆Duty× ln(TFP)×Diff to
further confirm the differential effect between low- and high-productivity firms conditional
on quality scope. Indeed the coefficients on triple interaction terms are significantly
positive while the coefficients on ∆Duty×Diff are significantly negative (see columns 4
and 8). These results are again consistent with Proposition 4 that in the industries where

the scope for quality differentiation is large, trade liberalization has a greater effect on
import price increase, especially for less productive firms.

           geneous goods. All regressions include a constant term, firm-level controls, and
           industry-level competition control. Industry-level competition control refers to
           the change of Herfindahl index. Firm-level controls include the changes between
           2001 and 2006 in capital intensity and total employment. Industry fixed effect is
           computed at 2-digit CIC industry level.



    Table 12 presents the results of regressing the change in firm-level wages on firm-
specific tariff reductions and on the interaction terms to check the effect of trade liberal-
ization on labor quality upgrading. Columns 1-3 use the whole sample of all firms, the
subsample of firms that import differentiated goods, and the subsample of firms that im-
port homogeneous goods, respectively.57 Import tariff reductions significantly raise wage
payments, and this effect is more pronounced for low-productivity firms in the whole
sample and in the heterogeneous subsample (see columns 1 and 2). The magnitude of
tariff reduction effect is larger in column 2 than in column 1, while this effect is not
  57
     Here we use the core imported product to determine whether a firm belongs to heterogeneous or
homogeneous subsample: if a firm’s largest imported product is differentiated goods, we categorize
this firm into heterogeneous subsample; if a firm’s largest imported product is homogeneous goods, we
categorize this firm into homogeneous subsample. This approach is based on a belief of complementarity
between primary inputs and intermediate inputs, e.g., more differentiated intermediate inputs may need
relatively more skilled labor inputs to use.

                                                 41
significant in the homogeneous subsample (see column 3). Moreover, column 4 reports
the significantly positive coefficient on the triple interaction term, and the signs of coeffi-
cients of all other variables of interest are consistent with our expectation. These results
confirm the model predictions in Proposition 4 that the trade liberalization induces firms
with lower productivity to increase their payments for primary inputs more than those
with higher productivity, and this differential effect is most pronounced in industries with
large scope for quality differentiation.
    In addition to examining the changes in intensive margin of inputs through import
price and wage payment, we also explore the comparative statics of extensive margin of
imports, i.e., how the share of imported inputs in total intermediate inputs evolves. As
firms choose a higher quality of their output, they would substitute from domestic inputs
towards imported inputs. As a result, we expect similar predictions as for the other
propositions: more foreign sourcing by high-productivity firms, but a stronger increase
following tariff reductions by low-productivity firms. We test these two predictions in
Table A.20 in the online appendix where columns 1-3 regress imported inputs share
on firm productivity using the data in initial year 2001 and columns 4-6 regress the
changes in imported inputs share from 2001 to 2006 on tariff reduction and the interaction
term ∆Duty× ln(TFP). All results are significant and support the aforementioned two
predictions.


5.3    Evidence at Extensive Margin of Exports

In this section, we turn to the extensive margin of exports. As discussed in the theory
section, an immediate extension of our model with market penetration costs that are
increasing in market demand can generate an extensive margin of market entry that is a
function of input costs. Such an extension suggests that a tariff reduction on imported
intermediates ought to affect the composition of destination markets of less productive
firms by more than it affects the composition of destination markets of more productive
firms.
    To examine the pattern along the extensive margin, within the same firm-HS6 product
(hereafter f h, for short), we distinguish three types of markets, namely, “continuing”,
“entry”, and “exit” according to their status in the pre-liberalization period (2001) and
post-liberalization period (2006). If a destination market for a f h combination exists in
both 2001 and 2006, it is defined as a “continuing” type; if it appears in 2006 but not
in 2001, it is characterized as “entry” type; if it appears in 2001 but not in 2006, it is
characterized as “exit” type. Then we compare the changes in (log) export prices and
in (log) incomes (GDP per capita) of destination markets for different types of markets
using a mean or median (see Table 13).

  associated with higher initial productivity (i.e., the top 50th percentile). Prices and incomes are in logarithm. Productivity in this
  table refers to labor productivity computed as value added per worker. When using other measures of TFP, the similar pattern also
  holds.




    In Table 13, we compute the following measures of changes in export prices (see Panel
A) and changes in incomes of countries across destination markets (see Panel B) within
the same firm-product: the price/income change for all markets and continuing markets,
and the price/income change for markets of “entry” versus markets of “exit”.58 Within
each firm-product, the price change for “entry-exit” is computed by the average price of
each firm-product across all its newly added markets (markets of entry) in 2006 minus
the average price across all its dropped markets (markets of exit) in 2001. As for changes
in incomes of destination markets, we take either the mean or the median incomes across
destinations within each firm-product in 2001 and 2006, and then compute the change
over time for each type of market within the same firm-product. We present the mean
and median price and income change for all markets, continuing markets, and switching
markets (entry vs. exit) in columns 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6, respectively.
   The first important message conveyed by Table 13 is that the quality upgrading pat-
tern along extensive margin is related to firm productivity. To show this, we divide
sample into low-productivity and high-productivity firms by median in each type of mar-
kets. For all three types of markets, the price increase for low-productivity firms is greater
than that for high-productivity firms (see the odd columns vs. even columns). The av-
erage incomes of destination markets also present the pattern that less productive firms
have greater increase than more productive firms with the only exception at continuing
  58
    According to the literature (e.g., Manova and Zhang (2012a)), there is a positive correlation between
product quality and income of destination markets, i.e., firms charge higher export prices in richer markets
because they sell higher quality goods there. Hence, we study changes in incomes of destination markets
as evidence at extensive margin.



                                                                  43
markets.
    We then compare different types of markets in Table 13. We start with continuing
markets (see columns 3 and 4) that reflect the intensive margin effect. The export price
increases is greater for less productive firms than for more productive firms at continuing
markets. When we move to the results for the sample of all markets in columns 1-2,
the compositional shift at the extensive margin suggest that firms are able to enter more
high-income markets where the demand for high quality goods is strong and so charge
higher export prices, especially in the case of low-productivity firms (see column 1 vs.
column 3). We provide more indirect evidence at the extensive margin through switching
markets in the last two columns of Table 13, which shows that the price and income
increase for low-productivity firms in switching markets (entry vs. exit) is of the greatest
magnitude (see column 5 vs. other columns).

 The dependent variable in specifications (1), (4), and (7) is the (log) price change at the firm-HS6 level. The dependent variable
 in specifications (2)-(3), (5)-(6), and (8)-(9) is the (log) income change at the firm-HS6 product level, where columns 2, 5,
 and 8 use mean income and columns 3, 6, and 9 use median income. Columns 1-3, 4-6, and 7-9 correspond to all markets,
 continuing markets, and markets of entry versus exit, respectively. All regressions include a constant term, firm-level controls,
 and industry-level competition control. Industry-level competition control refers to the change of Herfindahl index. Firm-level
 controls include the changes between 2001 and 2006 in the following variables: TFP, capital intensity, average wage, and total
 employment. Industry fixed effect is computed at 2-digit CIC industry level.



    Finally, we replicate the baseline regressions using the price or income change for
different types of markets as dependent variable and report results in Table 14. Columns
1-3, 4-6, and 7-9 correspond to all markets, continuing markets, and markets of entry
vs. exit, respectively. Again, we start with continuing markets (intensive margin effect,
see columns 4-6) that is the focus of our paper. At continuing markets, the price increase
significantly depends on initial productivity and the coefficients on the interaction term
are significant and consistent with the predicted sign (see column 4); while the income
increase and its relation to productivity is not significant at continuing markets which
is not surprising (see columns 5-6). The coefficients obtained from the “all markets”
sample, shown in columns 1-3, indicate both a price increase and an income increase

                                                              44
that arises due to the compositional effect. Lastly, the switching markets present the
strongest pattern regarding the magnitude of coefficients (see columns 7-9 vs. columns
1-3 and 4-6). This indicates that incumbent firm-product pairs indeed switch from the
lower income markets where demand for high quality goods is weak and products are
sold at lower prices to higher income markets where demand for high quality goods is
strong and products are sold at higher prices, and this pattern is more pronounced for
low-productivity firms.



6    Conclusion
This paper studies the relationship between quality and productivity under trade liberal-
ization and highlights the heterogeneous response across firms to import tariff reductions.
We use highly disaggregated firm-product-level data and the shock of China’s entry into
the WTO to trace through the manner in which trade liberalization on intermediate
inputs induced Chinese firms to upgrade their input and output quality. We find that
quality upgrading is primarily achieved by the initially less successful Chinese firms. In
other words, the chief beneficiaries of liberalized intermediate input tariffs are not the
initially most productive firms but are instead the less productive firms that are operating
in industries in which the scope for quality variation is the most pronounced. When ini-
tially more capable firms run into diminishing returns to quality upgrading, it is precisely
those lower productivity firms that are most likely to upgrade the quality of their exports,
increase the quality of their imported intermediates, and upgrade their workforces. They
are also more aggressive in entering new, high income markets where demand for high
quality goods is strong along the extensive margin. As a result, the gap between low
and high productivity firms regarding their quality performance would be reduced under
an import tariff reduction. In this sense, trade liberalization appears to have evened the
playing field with respect to firm performance.
    To explain these facts, we developed a simple heterogeneous-firm trade model that
relates a firm’s input and output quality choice to its imported intermediates and produc-
tivity. The model predicts that low productivity firms are induced to raise their output
prices and quality more than high productivity firms do under a reduction in import
tariffs. Meanwhile, they increase input prices more for both primary inputs and inter-
mediate inputs than high productivity firms. In addition, at the extensive margin, low
productivity firms expand destination markets by entering those with relatively strong
demand for high-quality goods. Those tariff reduction effects are more pronounced in
industries where the scope for quality differentiation is large.
    Our finding has important policy implications that low productivity incumbent firms
are potential winners from trade liberalization and this alleviates the concern that trade

                                            45
liberalization hurts small and less productive firms. There exists intriguing possibility
that a high level of protection may favor firms that are particularly well suited for this
environment.

  Between Quality and Productivity: Evidence from
          China’s Accession to the WTO”

A      A Simple Micro foundation for Price Setting

Consider an industry i. In this industry, a firm with productivity ϕ produces output with
quality q according to the following production function for quality:
                                     "         1−µi       µi #
                                           ev           q iM
                         q (ϕ) = g −1 ϕ                                                (A.1)
                                         1 − µi          µi

where ev is the final-good worker’s effort (or the quality of labor inputs in producing final
good), qiM is the quality of the composite intermediate inputs, µi ∈ (0, 1).
    The quality of composite intermediate input, qiM , is costlessly assembled from a con-
tinuum of intermediates that are indexed by m ∈ [0, 1] according to the following function:

                                  qiM = min {qi (m)|∀m}                                (A.2)

where qi (m) ≡ qim is the quality of intermediate input m. The intermediate input
market is perfect competition. Producing one unit of an intermediate input of quality
qim = a (m) eim depends on the intermediate-good worker’s effort eim and intermediate-
good producer’s productivity a (m). Plants face worker quality-wage schedules that are
assumed to be upward-sloping and, in the interest of simplicity, linear:

                                        ev = κv wv                                     (A.3)
                                       eim = κim wim                                   (A.4)

where wv and wim are the wages of final-good and intermediate-good worker on a partic-
ular production line and κv and κim are positive constants.
    For a cost minimizing firm, qim = qiM for all m. If the firm purchases intermediate
m with quality qim locally, it pays the domestic unit price cd (m)qiM = κim 1a(m) qiM , where
cd (m) = κim 1a(m) denotes the cost to produce unit quality by domestic intermediate-good
producer. If the firm imports the intermediate m with quality qim , then it must first pay
the unit price of τ cf (m)qiM , where τ cf (m) denotes the cost to produce unit quality by
foreign intermediate-good producer and τ > 1 is one plus the tariff rate.
    To be simplified, we assume that cd (m) ≡ cd is a constant and cf (m) is strictly
decreasing and continuous in m. Hence, foreign producers have a comparative advantage
in high m goods and domestic producers have a comparative advantage in low m goods.

                                             1
We also assume that τ cf (0) > cd and τ cf (1) < cd so that there exists a cutoff intermediate
that is not imported that is solution to

                                           τ cf (m) < cd                                   (A.5)


   It follows that the marginal cost to produce the composite intermediate input with
one unit of quality qiM satisfies:
                                                   Z   1              
                                            ∗
                            PeiM (τ ) =    m cd + τ         cf (m)dm                       (A.6)
                                                      m∗


Meanwhile, the marginal cost for one unit of effect ev is κ1v . Minimizing the production
cost implies that the marginalcost of producing   aµivariety of final good with quality q by a

                                           PeiM (τ ) g(q). Hence, the payment for workers,
domestic inputs and foreign intermediate input are:

which provide the microfoundation for their functions in our model.


B      Alternative Explanation Using a General Model Setup

Instead of production function (2), we assume that production function for a firm of
productivity ϕ producing quality level q is:

                               y(ϕ, q) = min ϕδ S(q), ϕM (q) ,
                                                            


where M (q) is a composite input of quality q, S(q) is a composite of other inputs into
production, and δ ∈ [0, 1] measures the comparative advantage of more productive firms
in efficiently using intermediate inputs. Here greater productivity will trigger scale ef-
fect, whereas asymmetric impact of productivity on input requirements generates lower
intermediate input price sensitivity of more productive firms.
    S(q) could include any number of inputs such as managerial labor, after sale distribu-
tion, etc. Let the price schedule for S(q) be swq α , where α > 0 and s > 0. This is similar
as the additional fixed costs of distribution and handling output in our benchmark model.

                                                 2
Different from our assumption, we generate it by allowing it is a function of productivity.
This is to say, our benchmark model could be viewed as a special case with δ = 0.
    As in our benchmark model, the composite intermediate input M (q) is produced via
a Leontief production function over a unit interval of individual intermediates, indexed
by m ∈ [0, 1]. A firm may source an intermediate input from both domestic market and
abroad. Same as our benchmark model, the price of the composite intermediate input of
quality q is PiM (q; τ ) = PeiM (τ )q α . Now, the total cost of producing a unit of final output
satisfies:                                                      !
                                                  sw PeM (τ )
                                Ci (q; ϕ, τ ) =      +            qα                        (A.7)
                                                  ϕδ       ϕ

    Moreover, we also assume that product design incurs fixed costs and these fixed costs
depend on the number of attributes that the firm chooses to build into the variety, which
is assumed to be f q β .
    The firm chooses its price, p, and its quality, q, to maximize its export profits of the
firm, which are given by

                        π(ϕ) = max (p − C(q; ϕ, τ )) x(q, p, ω) − f q β ,
                                                                       
                                 p,q


Solving for the first-order conditions for the choice of quality of outputs and inputs and
the price of the final good, we find that the optimal quality choice is given by
                                                                        1

Note that an interior solution requires that β > η − α(σ − 1) > 0, which we assume holds
henceforth.

                dPeM (τ ) p        β − η + α(σ − 1) sϕ1−δ + PeM (τ )/w



                                                 3
So the elasticity of quality and price with respect to the price of imported intermediates is
decreasing in productivity as long as δ < 1. A tariff reduction on imported intermediates
decrease the price of imported intermediates and hence raise the quality of inputs used
within the firm. In addition, this impact on quality and price must be greater for less
productive firms. The impact of tariff reductions on quality and price satisfy:

Hence, our propositions in our benchmark model still hold.


C     Quantity-Based Production Function Estimation

We rewrite production function as

                          qf t = βl lf t + βk kf t + βm mf t + ωf t + εf t             (A.14)

where lf t , kf t , mf t is the vector of (log) physical inputs: labor, capital and materials,
βl , βk and βm are the production function coefficients to be estimated; ωf t is firm-specific
productivity; and εf t is an i.i.d. error term.
    We use the merged firm-level data, built upon the NBSC annual survey of manu-
facturing firms and another dataset from NBSC that contains physical quantity output
of firms’ main products during the same sample period in estimating physical TFP. Al-
though this quantity output database provides the output quantity at 5-digit CPC level
for each firm, we only have information on production inputs (e.g., employment, capital
and material) at firm-level. As a result, we focus on single-product firms based on this
merged sample.
    Now this new sample provides the physical quantity of output qf t and the information
on employment, which allows us to measure labor input lf t in physical quantity. However,
capital kf t and material mf t inputs are only available in value terms; specifically, we use
the value of fixed assets as a measure of kf t and the total value of intermediate materials
as a measure of mf t . To back out the physical quantity of kf t and mf t , we deflate these
values with the sector-specific price indices provided by Brandt, Van Biesebroeck and
Zhang (2012). As a result, the true estimation specification of equation (A.14) is:

                                             e f t − βk wfkt + βm wfmt + ωf t + εf t
                                                                      
               qf t = βl lf t + βk e
                                   kf t + βm m                                         (A.15)

flated by a sector-specific price index; wfxt denotes the deviation of the unoberserved (log)
firm-specific input price from the (log) industry-wide input price index. Hence, consis-
tent estimation requires the proper control for unobserved firm productivity ωf t and the
                                                                               
omitted firm-specific input price Bt wfkt , wfmt , βk , βm = − βk wfkt + βm wfmt .
      To control for omitted firm-specific input prices, we follow De Loecker et al. (2016)
and Lu and Yu (2015) by assuming that firm-specific input prices are a function of output
price (pf t ), market share (msf t ), and exporter status (ef t ), i.e., wfxt = wt (pf t , msf t , ef t )
for x = k or m. As a results, Bf t becomes B ((pf t , msf t , ef t ) , δ), where δ depends on the
parameters    in wt (·). To       proxy productivity, Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) assume that
me f t = mt ωf t , lf t , e
                          kit , Zf t , where Zf t is a vector of controls including output price (pf t ),
market share (msf t ), and exporter status (ef t ), input tariff (τfinput
                                                                     t    ), output tariff (τfoutput
                                                                                               t     ),
product dummies and region dummies.
    In the first stage, we estimate the following equation:
                                                                           
                                  q f t = φt       lf t , kit , m
                                                          e     e f t , Zf t + εf t .

We approximate the function with a third-order polynomial in all its elements, with the
exception of product dummies and region dummies. We add the product dummies and
region dummies linearly and yields an estimate of predicted output φbf t by getting rid of
unanticipated shocks and/or measurement error εf t . One can then express productivity
ωf t as a function of data and parameters. In particular, we have:

                  ωf t = φbf t − βl lf t − βk e
                                              kf t − βm m
                                                        e f t − B ((pf t , msf t , ef t ) , δ)


   Meanwhile, to recover the parameter βl , βk , βm and parameter vector δ in the second
stage, we consider the following law of motion for productivity:

                              ωf t = g ωf t−1 , τfinput     input
                                                                           
                                                   t−1  , τf t−1  , ef t−1   + ξf t

We form moments based on the innovation in the productivity shock ξf t , which satisfies:

                           ξf t = ωf t − E ωf t |ωf t−1 , τfinput   input
                                                                                        
                                                             t−1 , τf t−1 , ef t−1


The moments that identify the parameters are:

                                               E (ξf t Yf t ) = 0

where Yf t contains lagged labor, current capital, lag materials, as well as lag output
prices, lagged market shares, lagged input/output tariff, lagged export status, and their

                                                                                         kf t −

Figure A.2: Price Distributions for Differentiated Goods and Homogeneous Goods (HS6 prod-
ucts)

Notes: Prices for continuing firm-HS6 pairs are in logarithm. Panel (a) presents price distribution for differentiated goods
(see the top panel) and Panel (b) presents price distribution for homogeneous goods (see the bottom panel). Graphs in
the left panel refer to firms with lower initial productivity (i.e., productivity lower than the median) and graphs in the
right panel refer to firms with higher initial productivity (i.e., productivity above the median). Price distributions are
drawn by regressing export prices on firm-HS6 fixed effects and then plotting the residuals, as in De Loecker et al. (2016).

Notes: *** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1. Robust standard errors corrected for clustering at the firm level
in parentheses. Compared with odd columns, we also add the interaction term between export duty change
and TFP in even columns. All regressions include a constant term, firm-level controls, and industry-level
competition control. Industry-level competition control refers to the change of Herfindahl index. Firm-level
controls include the changes between 2001 and 2006 in the following variables: TFP, capital intensity, average
wage, and total employment. Industry fixed effect is computed at 2-digit CIC industry level.
