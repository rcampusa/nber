                                                ABSTRACT

We test for sorting of workers between and within industrial sectors in a directed search model with
coordination frictions. We fit the model to sector-specific vacancy and output data along with publicly-available
statistics that characterize the distribution of worker and employer wage heterogeneity across sectors.
Our empirical method is general and can be applied to a broad class of assignment models. The results
indicate that industries are the loci of sorting–more productive workers are employed in more productive
industries. The evidence confirms assortative matching can be present even when worker and employer
components of wage heterogeneity are weakly correlated.

    In this paper, we reconcile a tension between theoretical and empirical work on labor
market sorting. Many models predict that more skilled workers should sort into more pro-
ductive firms. However, unobserved worker- and firm-specific components of earnings have a
negligible correlation in matched employer-employee data. This stylized fact appears at odds
with a labor market characterized by assortative matching. The tension arises not because
these findings are contradictory, but because they emerge from different approaches to the
same problem. As shown by Eeckhout and Kircher (2011) earnings data are not sufficient to
solve this tension. Hence, this paper begins to reconcile the tension by using data on multiple
outcomes: earnings, value-added, vacancies, and employment to demonstrate that positive
assortative matching across sectors is a prominent phenomenon in the U.S. labor market.
Taking Shimer’s (2005) model of coordination frictions as the stationary general equilibrium
description of the market, we show that unobservable differences in worker productivity are
strongly positively correlated with unobservable differences in firm productivity across sec-
tors. However, unobservable differences in worker earnings are only weakly correlated with
unobservable firm differences in earnings–exactly as the coordination friction model predicts.
    Current research on labor market sorting seeks to explain a set of stylized facts that
emerge from the statistical decomposition of wage rates in longitudinally matched employer-
employee data into portions due to observable characteristics, unmeasured worker hetero-
geneity, and unmeasured firm heterogeneity. We will follow the literature in referring to
this wage decomposition, introduced to the economics literature in Abowd, Kramarz and
Margolis (1999), as the “AKM decomposition.” The AKM decomposition has two consistent
features documented across a many different data sources. First, it attributes substantial
variation to the unmeasured individual and employer components. Second, the correlation
between worker and employer heterogeneity is generally small and positive.1 These empiri-
cal regularities appear consistent with a model with search frictions in which labor market
matching is essentially random (Mortensen 2003), rather than one in which workers with
varying levels of ability are sorted to employers on the basis of job-specific productive assets.
    The literature’s focus on the aggregate correlation between worker and employer compo-
nents of earnings heterogeneity ignores considerable variation in pay within and across indus-
trial sectors. In contrast to the negligible aggregate correlations, Abowd et al. (2012a) find
a strong positive relationship between the industry-average person effect and the industry-

average employer effect of 0.54 (see their Table 3). The strong between-sector correlation
suggests that different kinds of workers sort into particular industries, and are compensated
differently there.
    The different patterns of between- and within-sector variation in pay raise the question
of whether the process that matches workers to particular sectors is the same process that
matches them to jobs within sectors. On one hand, variation in wage heterogeneity, output,
and employment across sectors can facilitate estimation and identification of sorting on the
basis of unobservable productive traits. On the other, the factors that drive sorting within
industries may differ from the factors that drive sorting between industries. We address
this question by estimating a general equilibrium model of job assignment with coordination
frictions due to Shimer (2005). We ask whether the data can be explained by a model in
which sorting across and within sectors is driven by variation in the productive characteristics
of workers and their employers.
    We make a substantive contribution by connecting the literature on sorting with that on
inter-industry wage differences. The reduced-form evidence on inter-industry differentials,
comprehensively summarized in Abowd et al. (2012a), has evolved by progressively account-
ing for new sources of observable and unobservable heterogeneity. The early research on
sorting was focused, by necessity, on considering only sorting across industries. Our results
suggest it was right to do so. Our results indicate that industries are the loci of sorting–
more productive workers are employed in more productive industries–thereby providing a
new perspective on both literatures. Consistent with Shimer’s conjectures, the small cor-
relation between person- and firm- effects in the AKM decomposition understates the true
extent of assortative matching. Furthermore, the model explains between-sector variation
in the observable productivity and wage data very well. However, the model has a mixed
performance in fitting within-sector variation in earnings heterogeneity. The model correctly
predicts the variation in worker-specific earnings heterogeneity, but it tends to under-predict
within-sector variation in employer earnings heterogeneity. It also tends to predict counter-
factually large, positive within-sector correlation between worker and employer effects.
    To obtain our results, we make two methodological contributions. First, we develop a
new method to estimate the coordination friction model that is applicable to a broader class
of assignment models. While the AKM decomposition is not a structural wage equation (ex-
cept under certain restrictive assumptions), it contains information on equilibrium matching
and productivity. We derive a closed-form expression that relates the observed distribution
of worker and employer earnings components from AKM to the model primitives. These ex-


                                               2
pressions are valid in any assignment model with heterogeneous workers and employers that
has: (1) a wage offer function that depends only on the type of worker and the type of firm;
(2) a prediction on the set of employment relationships that are realized. We estimate the
model by the simulated method of moments. Since earnings data are not sufficient for iden-
tification, we also use data on sector-specific vacancy rates, value-added, and employment
shares, in addition to summary measures from the AKM decomposition.
     A second, complementary, contribution is to make available the complete set of data
moments used in estimation. Doing so goes beyond standard best-practices regarding repli-
cability because the essential matched employer-employee microdata used in this paper are
confidential. While access is open, in practice obtaining it can be quite time-consuming.2
Researchers studying labor market sorting can use our data and empirical strategy to es-
timate alternative models of assignment and matching. We are not aware of another pub-
licly available source of comparably detailed summary data based on underlying matched
employer-employee data. We describe the data in Section 3 and our empirical approach in
Section 4.
     Our paper is among the first to estimate a directed search model with two-sided het-
erogeneity, and the first to formally incorporate industrial sector heterogeneity. Unlike this
paper, most recent efforts to estimate assignment models draw on Shimer and Smith (2000).
Becker’s frictionless assignment model (Becker 1973) cannot match the firm-specific vari-
ation in wages observed in the data. Adding frictions changes the equilibrium so that it
is more consistent with the reduced-form evidence from matched employer-employee data.
Shimer and Smith (2000) extend Becker’s model by allowing for costly search, and establish
conditions under which assortative matching still holds. In a separate extension, the one we
consider in detail here, Shimer (2005) introduces coordination frictions whereby workers and
firms cannot perfectly coordinate on application strategies or wage posting. Both Shimer
models predict that assortative matching depends on the production technology, and may be
obscured in the correlation between worker and employer effects in the AKM decomposition.
     Eeckhout and Kircher (2011) discuss the general problem of identifying sorting in assign-
ment models based on Shimer and Smith (2000). In their setting, wages are not monotonic
in firm productivity, so wage data cannot be use to rank firms. This critique does not
directly apply here, since wages are monotonically increasing in employer productivity in
   2
    Our public-use data include moments of wage components from the AKM decomposition for twenty
industrial sectors, stratified by firm size. In this paper, we do not use the employer size detail since Shimer
(2005) does not make any predictions related to firm size.

Shimer’s coordination friction model.3 However, a similar problem can arise because wages
are non-monotonic in worker productivity. Indeed, this aspect of the model is prominent in
our estimates. Recent papers by Hagedorn, Law and Manovskii (2012) and Lopes de Melo
(2013) also directly confront the problem raised by Eeckhout and Kircher (2011). We view
their contributions as complementary to ours.
    Little published research exists that estimates structural assignment models, but there
are several related working papers. Lopes de Melo (2013) estimates a model with two-sided
heterogeneity and undirected search using matched employer-employee data from Brazil.
His results indicate that the AKM decomposition understates the true extent of positive
assortative matching. However, he finds that the undirected search model delivers too little
earnings heterogeneity across employers. Lise, Meghir and Robin (2013) estimate a model
with two-sided heterogeneity, undirected search, and wage renegotiation using data from
NLSY79. They find that the data are best fit by a model in which productive complemen-
tarities vary across workers with different skill levels. Finally, Kennes and le Maire (2013)
develop a dynamic directed-search model, and show that it provides a better fit to aggre-
gate wage and productivity distributions than a model without heterogeneity. None of these
papers considers the problem of sorting across versus within industrial sectors.
    Shimer (2005) and Eeckhout and Kircher (2011) observe, correctly, that the correlation
between worker- and firm-specific components from the AKM decomposition cannot iden-
tify the nature of assortative matching on latent productive characteristics. This point was
made earlier by Abowd and Kramarz (1999). Although it is frequently asserted (for example
Hagedorn, Law and Manovskii 2012) that Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999) interpret
the correlation between person and firm effects as evidence against assortative matching,
they were careful to avoid that explicit structural interpretation. The first discussion of us-
ing the estimated heterogeneity components to draw inferences about labor market sorting
appears in Abowd and Kramarz (1999). Abowd and Kramarz derive a matching model with
homogeneous workers (see Table 2), a rent splitting model (see Table 3), and an incentive
model with unobserved heterogeneity (see Table 4). For each model they provide the exact
link between the components of the AKM decomposition and the structural differences in
individual and employer productivity. They also show that the model now known as ex-
ogenous mobility offers the only clean interpretation of the least squares AKM estimates as
direct measures of assortative matching. Mortensen (2003, p.12) draws on the exogenous
mobility interpretation when he cites the negligible correlation as evidence in support of a

wage posting model with undirected, on-the-job search.
    Although these models are much simpler than the one we employ, they clarify the role
of the AKM decomposition as a statistical description of labor market outcomes to be used
as one component of a full structural analysis.4 The recent literature, including this paper,
attempts to reconcile the statistical evidence in light of more general structural assignment
models. Nevertheless, objections to a particular structural interpretation do not imply ob-
jections to the reduced-form evidence provided by the AKM decomposition, which must be
consistent with the predictions of the structural models since it represents the best statistical
description of the actual data.5


1       Theoretical Assignment Model
In this section we summarize those features of the coordination friction model (Shimer 2005)
required for our analysis: the equilibrium wage offers and matching sets. Shimer’s model
extends the frictionless assignment model of Becker (1973) in which workers with different
ability (productivity) apply for jobs with differently productive employers. Shimer’s central
insight is that in a large anonymous labor market, workers and employers cannot fully
condition their behavior on that of all other agents. In other words, they are restricted in
their ability to coordinate. In practice, this means employers post the same wage offers to all
workers with the same ability (a strategy restriction), and all workers of the same type follow
the same application strategy (an equilibrium refinement). The model predicts matching on
the basis of comparative advantage, as in Becker (1973), but with more empirically realistic
features: equilibrium mismatch and, consequently, wage variation across workers with the
same ability.


1.1     Job Assignment with Coordination Frictions
The economy consists of workers, who maximize expected income, and employers, who maxi-
mize expected profit. Each employer has one vacancy to fill by hiring one worker. Employers
propose wage offers for each worker. Workers then choose one vacancy to apply for. Based
    4
     In their Section 5.5, Eeckhout and Kircher (2011) accurately criticize one set of assumptions on the
assignment process previously used to interpret the least squares correlation as a measure of sorting.
   5
     A related, but different literature, directly considers violations of the exogenous mobility assumption
and, in particular, whether the firm effects in the AKM decomposition actually measure variation across
firms in compensation. See, for example, Card, Heining and Kline (2013) and Abowd and Schmutte (2013).




                                                     5
on the pool of applicants, employers each hire one worker to fill their vacancy. Workers
and employers only differ in productive type. There are M types of workers and N types
of employers. When a worker of type m is hired by an employer of type n, the output of
production is xm,n .
    A decentralized equilibrium of the coordination friction economy is characterized by
a randomized application strategy by workers and wage offers from employers of a given
productivity. The coordination friction implies that all agents of the same type use the
same strategy in equilibrium. Equilibrium depends only on the nature of the production
technology, the measure of each type of worker, and the measure of each type of employer.
Out of a total measure µ of workers in the economy, µm have productive type m ∈ {1 . . . M }.
Similarly, out of a total measure ν of employers in the economy, ν n have productive type
n ∈ {1 . . . N }. Although it will not matter in the final equilibrium, we follow Shimer in
naming individual workers by (m, i) and individual employers by (n, j), where the first term
is the type of the agent, and the second term is the agent’s name. Thus, each worker or
employer can be uniquely identified.


1.2       Worker and Employer Behavior
Each worker can apply for only one job, and chooses an application strategy based on wage
offers poster by employers. A type-m worker’s strategy, pm,(n,j) , specifies the probability
with which she applies to each employer.
    In the coordination friction economy, all workers of type m follow the same strategy. The
number of workers of each type is very large, so it is easier to think in terms of the queue of
applicants of type m to each employer. The number of applications from type m workers to
employer (n, j) follows a Poisson distribution with expectation qm,(n,j) = pm,(n,j) µm . Given
wage offers, equilibrium queue lengths must provide all workers of type m the same expected
income at jobs for which they apply with positive probability. A job for which a worker does
not apply must offer strictly lower expected income. 6
    Employers choose wage offers for workers of each productive type and a hiring rule that
maximizes expected profits, given the queueing behavior of workers. The type-n employer’s

                               Incomem,(n,j) = e−Qm+1,(n,j)                  wm,(n,j)       (1)
                                                                 qm,(n,j)

optimal wage offer to a type-m employee maximizes net revenue times the probability that
a worker of that type will apply. Shimer (2005) shows that the optimal hiring rule selects
the applicant with highest productivity.7


1.3       Search Equilibrium
Definition 1 (Shimer 2005) A Competitive Search Equilibrium consists of wage offers, w, and
queue lengths, q, chosen such that employer’s expected profits (2) are maximized, worker’s
expected incomes are given by (1), and the expected number of applications from type m
workers does not exceed the total measure of such workers, µm :

                                                     N Z

                                              µm =                   qm,(n,j) dj.                                (3)
                                                      n=1   0


    Shimer proves the competitive equilibrium exists and is unique. He also shows the equi-
librium queue lengths, qm,n , are those that would be chosen by a social planner seeking to
maximize expected output, and who also faces coordination frictions. Letting υ m be the
multiplier on the resource constraint given by equation (3), the Lagrangian for the social
planning problem is

1.4    Empirical Implications
Equations (4) and (5) provide all the information required for estimation. Given the pro-
duction technology, xm,n , and the measure of each type of employer and worker, equilibrium
wages and queue lengths are uniquely determined. Although the equilibrium queue lengths
are not observable, we can use them to derive the expected number of workers of type m
that ultimately become employed by employers of type n:

                                λm,n = ν n e−Qm+1,n (1 − e−qm,n ).                         (6)

    The coordination friction equilibrium has two properties that are essential to the estima-
tion strategy. In equilibrium, the wage offer function violates the law of one price. Different
jobs pay identically able workers different wages. That is, there is a structural employer
effect in the wage. Shimer shows that the wage offer will generally be increasing in the
productive type of the employer. The equivalent result does not hold for workers, however.
It is possible for an employer to offer workers with low ability (low worker productivity) a
higher equilibrium wage than workers with higher ability. Therefore, it is possible to observe
a negative correlation between worker and employer effects estimated from the empirical
earnings decomposition even when there is positive assortative matching on the unobserved
productivity types.
    Note, however, that the model does not generally imply that log earnings can be additively
decomposed into a worker and firm effect. An additive wage offer model is not required for our
estimation procedure. The worker and firm effects from the statistical decomposition of log
earnings in a linear model are complicated transformations of the underlying productivities
and abilities along with factors determining the supply of and demand for worker skill. As we
show, Shimer’s coordination friction model provides exact formulas for these transformations
that we can identify through restrictions on observable moments of the joint distribution of
the estimated worker and firm effects from the earnings decomposition.
    With respect to the nature of assortative matching, Shimer derives several results. First,
if the production function is supermodular, Shimer’s Proposition 3 shows that if Qm,n > 0,



                                                8
then it is strictly increasing in n, which is ordered from least to most productive employer.
In addition, a more productive job is more likely to be filled, a worker is less likely to
obtain a more productive job conditional on applying for it, and for all levels of worker
productivity, the wage is increasing in the employer’s productivity. This result holds for
production technologies that exhibit comparative advantage for high-productivity workers
in high-productivity jobs. It also holds, as is well known, for a production technology that
exhibits no comparative advantage, specifically, one in which output is multiplicative in the
productive types of the worker and employer. A converse result holds when there is a com-
parative advantage for low-productivity workers in high-productivity jobs. In that case, Qm,n
is decreasing in n, so that the assortative matching again corresponds to comparative advan-
tage. We estimate the structural model with a CES production function that is sufficiently
flexible to allow for either positive or negative assortative matching.
    On their own, these results do not distinguish the coordination friction economy, since
the frictionless model also predicts that job assignment will be in accord with comparative
advantage in production. However, the coordination friction model makes more reasonable
predictions about equilibrium unemployment and vacancies, and predicts a certain amount
of mismatch, which eliminates the untenable “perfect correlation” prediction for worker
and employer types generated by comparative advantage models without the coordination
friction. Since workers apply to employers using a randomized mixed strategy, there is a
positive probability that multiple workers will apply for the same job–leaving all but one
unemployed. There is also a positive probability that no one will apply for any particular
job, leaving it vacant. Therefore, there will be simultaneous unemployment and job vacancy
for workers and employers of all types. Furthermore, even among employed workers and
occupied vacancies (filled jobs), there will be mismatch, in the sense that the particular set of
matches realized in the economy could be improved, in the sense of maximizing total output,
by aligning assignments that are mismatches more closely with comparative advantage.


2     Empirical and Theoretical Earnings Decomposition
The novelty in our empirical approach is to formally relate the equilibrium quantities from the
structural assignment model to heterogeneity components from the statistical decomposition
of earnings associated with workers and employers. The worker and employer effects from
the earnings decomposition are complicated transformations of the equilibrium quantities.
So is the correlation between worker and employer effects across realized matches, as well as


                                               9
other moments of their observed joint distribution. We explicitly derive the map between
structural equilibrium quantities and empirical moments used for estimation.


2.1     Empirical AKM Decomposition
Following Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999), we decompose the logarithm of the real
annualized full-time wage rate, yi,t in each job as:

                                   yi,t = hi,t β + θi + ψ J(i,t) + εi,t                            (7)

where yi,t is the log wage of worker i at time t; hi,t β is the worker’s labor market experience,
and labor market attachment, interacted with sex; θi is the worker effect; J(i, t) is the
dominant employer of individual i at time t; ψ J(i,t) is the employer effect. We follow the
methods in Abowd, Creecy and Kramarz (2002) to obtain the full least squares solution and
for identification of worker and employer effects (7).


2.2     Theoretical Wage Decomposition
The theoretical assignment model is a sample selection model. It characterizes potential
outcomes, which are the wages offered by any employer to any worker, and the manner in
which the job matches we observe, and their associated wages, are selected for observation
from the set of all possible matches. The theoretical model, therefore, predicts the empirical
moments, which are transformations of the equilibrium wage offers, w∗ , and application
queues, q ∗ , given the model primitives (µ, ν, x). Given q ∗ , the model also predicts the
expected number of realized matches of each type, λ∗ . Starred quantities represent solutions
to the coordination-friction general equilibrium described in Section 1.
    Given the solution to the coordination friction problem, the statistical decomposition of
the log wage, analogous to the AKM decomposition of equation (7), paid in a realized match
between worker i ∈ (0, µ) and employer j ∈ (0, ν) is

                                           ∗
                                      log wi,j = θ∗(m,i) + ψ ∗(n,j) .                              (8)

because wage offers do not vary within job types, nor within worker types; hence, there are
M × N distinct wage offers.8 The expected equilibrium worker and employer effects are the
  8
      Here, and throughout, we suppress the intercept in the AKM decomposition, implying that the model
is fit in deviations from the overall mean and that the average worker and firm effects are zero.

The model worker and employer effects, θ̂ , ψ̂ , are identified when the cross product
matrix in 11 has full rank, implying that the g-inverse can be replaced by a regular inverse.
This requires Λ∗ to have full rank as well as standard identifying restrictions on D and F .
Λ∗ has full rank only if each type of worker is hired by every type of employer with positive
probability.
    For consistency with the empirical procedure applied to the LEHD data, we implement
identification in the theoretical decomposition by setting the mean overall worker and em-
                                                              ∗    ∗
ployer effects to zero across matches. We use the notation (θ̂ , ψ̂ ) to refer to the components
of earnings derived from (11). For estimation, we match moments of the joint distribution
      ∗    ∗
of (θ̂ , ψ̂ ) across matches predicted under the model to their empirical counterparts.


3       Data and Estimating Equations
We use estimates of worker and employer effects from the AKM decomposition (7) applied
to LEHD data. For every employment match, in every year, we record the estimated worker
effect, θ̂i , and estimated employer effect, ψ̂ J(i,t) , along with the NAICS sector to which the
employer belongs. The result is a dataset, (θ̂i , ψ̂ J(i,t) , sJ(i,t) )i,t , where sJ(i,t) ∈ {1, . . . , 20}
records the sector.
    Within each sector, s, we estimate eight empirical moments:10
        (s)
    • ḡ1 = E(θ̂|s), the mean worker effect in sector s;
        (s)
    • ḡ2 = E(ψ̂|s), the mean employer effect in s;
        (s)
    • ḡ3 = V ar(θ̂|s), the variance of worker effects in s;
        (s)
    • ḡ4 = Cov(θ̂, ψ̂|s), the covariance between worker and employer effects in s;
        (s)
    • ḡ5 = V ar(ψ̂|s), the variance of employer effects in s;
        (s)
    • ḡ6 = Z (s) , the share of matches in sector s;
        (s)
    • ḡ7 = R(s) , the rate of vacant job openings in s;
        (s)
    • ḡ8 = Y (s) , value-added per worker in s.
  10                                           (s)      (s)
     We estimate the sampling covariance of ḡ1 , . . . , ḡ6 , across 1, 000 bootstrap samples from the data in
(3). The sampling covariance is included in the data archive.

                            (s)             (s)
To compute moments ḡ1 , . . . , ḡ6 , we use matched employer-employee data from the Lon-
gitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) Program of the U.S. Census Bureau. The
LEHD Program uses administrative data from state Unemployment Insurance wage records
and ES-202/QCEW establishment reports that cover approximately 98 percent of all non-
farm U.S. employment. Our estimation sample is based on a snapshot of the LEHD data
infrastructure that includes information from twenty-eight states collected between 1990 and
2004.11 Appendix B provides a detailed description of the LEHD data.
                                         (s)
    Data on sectoral vacancy rates, ḡ7 = R(s) , are from the Job Openings and Labor
Turnover Survey (JOLTS). The sectoral vacancy rates are reported in JOLTS as
                                                                            

                                                      Empj + V acj

where V acj is the number of openings reported by employer j, and Empj is employment.
This statistic has an interpretation as the probability that a job opening in sector s is left
vacant. Using the monthly JOLTS data disaggregated by sector for the years 2001-2003, we
           (s)
compute ḡ7 as the simple average of the monthly observations for sector s. To measure the
                       (s)
sampling variance of ḡ7 , we combined the median cross-sectional standard error (squared)
of the job opening rate for each sector with that rate’s time-series variation.12
                                         (s)
    We measure sectoral productivity, ḡ8 , using data on value-added per worker from the
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Annual Industry Accounts.13 For each year between
1990-2003 (corresponding to our years of LEHD data), we take the BEA report of total
value-added by NAICS sector in millions of chained 2005 dollars and deflate by reported
employment in that sector. This yields a measure of value-added per worker for each year.

We compute the moment used in estimation, ḡ8 , and its sampling variance, s8 , as the
simple average and variance across the annual observations for sector k.

     Only the first quarter of 2004 is available in this snapshot. The annualized real wage rate is, therefore,
only available for the years 1990-2003.
  12
     The sectoral classification for the public-use JOLTS data does not quite conform to the NAICS 2002
major sectors. We use a custom crosswalk that maps JOLTS sectors, which are generally more coarse, onto
NAICS 2002. The details of the crosswalk are available upon request. We obtained median standard errors
for 2013 by industry from JOLTSInfo@bls.gov.

4      Parameterization and Estimation Details
We fit the coordination friction model to 159 unrestricted moments.15 The model predicts
                                               ∗   ∗
the components of the AKM decomposition, (θ̂ , ψ̂ ), their joint distribution across realized
matches within and across sectors, the sectoral distribution of employment, sectoral output
per worker, and sectoral vacancies. This is sufficient information to compute theoretical
analogues to the empirical moments. Formulas for the estimating equations in terms of
model primitives and equilibrium quantities are fully specified in Appendix E.


4.1    Parameterization of the Coordination Friction Economy
We fit a vector, ζ = (µ, ν, h, χ, ε, φ, β, ρ, ς), of 52 structural parameters. The parameter µm
measures the share of workers of type m. We assume M = 5 types of worker and impose,
                                   P
without loss of generality, that m0 µm0 = 1, leaving four free parameters. Each type m
worker is endowed with productivity, hm ∈ (0, 1).16 In estimation, we require that the
worker productivity distribution have mass at h2 = 0.25 and h4 = 0.75. We then estimate
h1 , h3 , and h5 as free parameters on [0, 0.25), (0.25, 0.75), and (0.75, 1], respectively.
     The model assumes a single dimension of productive heterogeneity across employers. We
now specify how productivity varies across and within sector. We model 20 sectors that each
offer 3 latent job types. There are thus N = 60 job types distinguished by productivity. The
index n of the job is (s, `), where s = 1, ..., 20 indicates the sector and ` = 1, ..., 3 indicates
the productive job type for that sector. The parameter ν n = ν s,` is the measure of jobs of
type n. The total number of openings in each sector is a free parameter, and we assume
openings are uniformly distributed across the three latent job types.
     Employer productivity, kn = ks,` ∈ (0, 1), varies by sector and the latent job type. We
define kn as
                                kn ≡ ks,` = φχ(s) + (1 − φ) εkj .                              (13)

where kj ∈ {0.1, 0.5, 0.9} is a grid over latent levels of employer productivity. Productivity
depends on χ(s) ∈ (0, 1), a sector-specific productivity level, ε, a productivity dispersion
  15
    Because the employment shares sum to one, we delete one sector share–NAICS government (92).
  16
    We impose that worker productivity is strictly increasing across types: hm0 > hm whenever m0 > m.
This restriction avoids solutions that simply relabel the worker types.



                                                 15
parameter, and φ, which determines how much of the variation in productivity is across
sectors and how much is within sectors.
    Output is produced by combining worker and employer productivity according to a con-
stant returns to scale constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function. The
CES production function can be either log supermodular or log submodular, and, as such,
admits either positive or negative assortative matching Shimer and Smith (2000).17 The
output from matching a type m worker to a type n employer is:

                                  xm,n = A (βhρm + (1 − β) knρ )1/ρ .                                 (14)

A is total factor productivity, β is worker productivity’s share in output, and σ = 1/(1 − ρ)
is the elasticity of substitution. β and ρ are free parameters to be estimated. We set the
TFP parameter to A = 300, 000 to match the scale of output.18
    The job openings rate from JOLTS likely understates the extent of labor demand, or
slot constraints, within sectors. Davis, Faberman and Haltiwanger (2013) report that 41.6
percent of hires occur in establishments without a vacancy posting. Without correction,
our model predicts many more vacancies than reported by JOLTS. The discrepancy is due
to a disconnect between the model’s notion of a job opening, which represents a binding
slot constraint, and the concept measured in the data, which is the number of positions for
which employers are actively recruiting. We address this problem by introducing a parameter,
ς ∈ [0, 1], that rescales the level of vacancy rates while preserving their cross-sector variation.


4.2     Estimation Details
The moment estimator, ζ̂ Ω , solves

                                ζ̂ Ω = arg min(ḡ − γ(ζ))T Ω (ḡ − γ(ζ))                              (15)

We solve equation (15) by Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA) (Ingber 1993), which allows
for adaptive rescaling of the parameter search.19 Simulated annealing is known to be effective
on related estimation problems (Goffe, Ferrier and Rogers 1994), and the ASA variant is
  17
     See Shimer and Smith (2000) for details. For our application, the assumption of constant returns to
scale is not restrictive, since it amounts to a rescaling of the latent variables h and k.
  18
     We experimented with estimating A directly. In practice, we get estimates of A close to the calibrated
level. Changing A does little to affect our qualitative results.
  19
     To implement ASA in MATLAB, we use the ASAMIN routine maintained by Shinichi Sakata (Sakata and
White 2001).


                                                    16
particularly useful in applications that involve a large parameter space and in which the
sensitivity of the objective function varies widely across the parameters. In practice, we set
Ω = I, the identity matrix.
    At each iteration in the algorithm, ASA proposes a vector of structural parameters,
ζ̃. At ζ̃, we solve the planner’s problem in the coordination-friction economy numerically
(Equation 4).20 Equilibrium queue lengths in the decentralized economy are identical to those
the planner chooses, and we obtain the equilibrium wage offers by application of equation
(5). With the matching set and wage offers in hand, we calculate the theoretical moments
as in Section 2.2.
    Once the simulated annealing procedure converges to an estimate, ζ̂ A , we estimate its
covariance matrix as: (F T ΩF )−1 F T ΩSΩF (F T ΩF )−1 where F = F (ζ) = ∂f∂ζ(ζ) and S is the
covariance matrix of ḡ.

4.2.1      Local Identification

The model satisfies the necessary order condition trivially. It remains to be shown that the
model satisfies the sufficient rank condition.We take note of a theoretical result that as long
as the Jacobian, F (ζ), has full-column rank at the minimizer, ζ 0 , and constant rank in a
neighborhood around ζ 0 , then ζ 0 is locally identified (Ruud 2000). We verify trivially that
F (ζ 0 ) is full rank. The smallest singular value of F (ζ 0 ) is the L2 -norm distance from F to
the space of rank-deficient matrices (Golub and Loan 1996). We verify the smallest singular
value is non-zero (1.647), which is sufficient for local identification since the continuous
differentiability of F in ζ ensures that there is a neighborhood around ζ 0 in which F always
has full column rank.


4.3       Discussion of Key Assumptions
Estimation requires longitudinally linked employer-employee data with sufficient connectiv-
ity. However, the theoretical model is static. We assume the data generating process is one
in which we repeatedly sample from the equilibrium of a coordination friction economy. This
type of assumption is also made by Eeckhout and Kircher (2011). Shimer (2005) argues that
“. . . the model must be extended to a dynamic framework if it is to be taken quantitatively
seriously.” Our approach demonstrates that this need not be the case. If the static model pro-
vides a good description of the distribution from which observed matches are sampled in the
 20
      The planner’s problem is convex, so a global minimum is guaranteed to exit.



                                                     17
longitudinal data, then our estimation strategy is valid. Moreover, Shimer’s coordination-
friction model was motivated, in part, by the stylized facts that emerged from the AKM
decomposition. As it turns out, a dynamic model is not required to complete the connection
between the stylized facts, the model, and the data. We push the model by considering its
ability to explain the observed pattern of earnings between and within sectors. We expect
future work will – and should – extend the coordination-friction model theoretically and
empirically to incorporate both dynamics and different forms of heterogeneity in assignment
and production technologies. However, these extensions are not necessary for the validity or
significance of our results.


5       Results
Our estimates indicate positive assortative matching in the sorting of workers to employers
across sectors. The AKM worker and employer effects conceal assortative matching because
of non-monotonicity in the estimated worker wage effects with respect to worker productivity.
In combination with the selection of realized matches, this non-monotonicity hides the true
correlation between unobserved worker and employer productivity.21


5.1       Model Primitives
We first report the estimated model primitives: the distribution of workers across latent
productive types, the distribution of job openings across sectors and latent productive types,
and the production function that characterizes match output.

5.1.1      Worker and Employer Populations

Table 2 reports the distribution of worker productivity and predicted worker effects from the
AKM decomposition. In estimation, we impose, without loss of generality, that the popu-
lation of workers has measure 1, i.e., µ = 1. We estimate, without parametric restriction,
the share of workers in each of M = 5 latent productivity classes. Column (1) reports the
distribution of workers over types, and Column (2) reports the productivity of each type.
The population shares of productive types 1 − 5 are (0.374, 0.001, 0.030, 0.461, 0.134). Their
respective productivities are (0.141, 0.25, 0.285, 0.75, 0.893).

    across the five latent worker types, and associated equilibrium quantities. See Table A.1 for associated
    standard errors. In Column (2), the worker productivity parameters, h2 = 0.25 and h4 = 0.75, are imposed
    during estimation. Column (3) reports the expected worker-specific component from applying the AKM
    decomposition to log earnings under the equilibrium matching. Column (4) reports the expected employment
    shares under the equilibrium matching.




    Table 3 describes the estimated population of employers. Employers are characterized by
heterogeneity in productivity, which has two determinants – the sector, which is observable,
and a latent productive type, which is not. The total measure of job openings per worker
is a free parameter for each sector. We report openings per worker in the first column. The
productivity of each job type is reported in the remaining three columns.

5.1.2   Production Technology

Match output is produced according to the constant elasticity of substitution production
function described in Section 4.1. We estimate the elasticity of substitution at σ̂ = 0.828 (±0.00001),
which implies that the economy-wide production function is log supermodular. Thus, the
model equilibrium should exhibit positive assortative matching. We also estimate the worker
productivity share as β̂ = 0.364 (±0.00002).
   Figure 1 illustrates the estimated production function. Each point represents a potential
match that could be formed given the distribution of worker and employer productivity.
Employer productivity is shown on the horizontal axis, while the vertical axis shows output.
Output is measured in chained 2005 dollars to match sectoral data on value-added per
worker. Each line in the graph corresponds to the output produced by matching a worker of
a particular productive type to a job with the productivity level shown on the horizontal axis.
The figure illustrates the comparative advantage of high-ability workers in high-productivity

jobs. Workers of type 2 and 3 are almost equally productive. However, there are very few
such workers, so they have little effect on equilibrium quantities. Workers of type 4 and 5
are much more productive than workers of type 1, but are themselves almost, but not quite,
perfect substitutes in production.


5.2      Model Equilibrium
Equilibrium is characterized by wage offers from each employer to each type of worker, and
by the resulting equilibrium application and hiring decisions. Figure 2 presents equilibrium
wage offers for each potential match. The vertical axis measures the equilibrium wage offer.
Each line represents the wages offered to workers of the indicated type by employers with the
level of productivity shown on the horizontal axis. Wage offers are increasing in employer

productivity, as the coordination friction model requires. The same is not true for the latent
worker productivity. Wage offers to the most able workers – ability type 5 – are actually
lower than wage offers to less able workers. In the most productive jobs, high-ability workers
actually receive the lowest wage offers.
    This result is a feature of the model and reflects a combination of general equilibrium
factors. Unemployment risk between type 4 and type 5 workers is discontinuously greater
than the productivity difference between those types. Employers always hire a type 5 worker
before a type 4 worker. The higher wage offer to type 4 reflects a compensating differential
for unemployment risk associated with type 5 applications. The wage offers also reflect the
marginal value to the employer of attracting another application from each type of worker.
We can interpret type 4 workers’ high wage offer as a measure of their ability to hold the
employer up when the employer actually needs their labor because there are no type 5
applicants. From the employer’s perspective, the value of the option to hire a type 4 worker,
which requires that a type 4 worker apply, is very high in the case that no type 5 worker
applies. The hold-up power of type 5 workers is very limited for two reasons: there are
relatively many other type 5 workers, and type 4 workers are close substitutes. Thus, the
marginal value to the employer of a type 5 application is low relative to the marginal value
of a type 4 application.
    The equilibrium matching is characterized in Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 shows the share
of employment in each job type for each worker type. The vertical axis measures the share
of filled jobs. Each line records the share of jobs that are filled by workers of the indicated
type. For each employer productivity level on the horizontal axis, the sum of the share of
those jobs held by each worker type is one. Most jobs are filled by workers of type 1, 4, or
5, reflecting their population shares. Second, and more importantly, the Figure illustrates
the presence of positive assortative matching and the presence of matching frictions. Low-
productivity jobs are filled predominately by low-productivity workers. High-productivity
jobs are filled predominately by high-productivity workers. In the intermediate range of
employer productivity, we observe a substantial overlap of worker types. Jobs with produc-
tivity greater than 0.2 are filled by all three common types of worker (1, 4, and 5), albeit in
different proportions.
    The positive assortative matching is even more clearly shown in Figure 4, which displays
a scatter plot of job productivity versus the expected level of worker productivity. There
is no positive assortative matching at very low levels of employer productivity, since only
the least-able workers sort into those jobs. However, over most of the range of employer

productivity, the average level of human capital is monotonically increasing with job-specific
capital (employer productivity). This result implies, as we will see, positive assortative
matching both across and within sectors.


5.3    Model Fit
To evaluate model fit, we compare predicted to actual values of the observable moments
used to estimate the structural parameters. The model fit is particularly good on several
dimensions: the fitted moments associated with average worker effects in wages (θ), average
employer effects in wages (ψ), vacancy rates, value added per worker, and the variance
of worker effects all match the actual moments reasonably well. Figure 5 compares the
empirical and predicted equilibrium relationship between the average worker effect, E(θ),
and average employer effect, E(ψ), by sector. The black squares indicate the observed
values, and the triangles indicate the predicted values. The relationship between worker
and employer effects is strong and positive for the model predicted values, which clearly
capture the central tendency in the between-sector covariance of worker and firm earnings
components, though clearly not all of the between-sector variance.

              Figure 6: Model Fit. Sectors sorted by predicted mean worker effect.


   Figure 6 displays the model fit by sector with respect to the worker and firm-specific
components of log earnings.22 Each panel reports for each sector the empirical data, the
predicted values, and the associated latent productivity component. The sectors are sorted
by the predicted average worker effect in that sector. For instance, Figure 6a reports for
each sector the empirical average worker effect, the expected average worker effect under the
model, and the expected average worker productivity.
   Three features of Figures 6 and 7 stand out. First, the model does an acceptable job
matching the mean worker effects, mean employer effects, and the variance of worker effects.

    Complete details of model fit are provided in the Appendix in Tables A.2–A.3. Table A.3 reports the
raw (unscaled) difference between the empirical moments and the theoretical moments.

Second, the model fails to predict the within-sector variance of the firm effects, predicts
counterfactually large within-sector correlations, and is unable to generate negative within-
sector correlations. These results are consistent with the finding of Hornstein, Krusell and
Violante (2011) that wage dispersion is difficult to support in the absence of on-the-job
search. Third, the figures highlight the weakness of the relationship between the components
of log earnings and the underlying productivity of workers and jobs. Even for those moments
where the model fit is good, the variation across sectors in predicted moments of the earnings
components is not clearly related to variation in the moments of worker and employer and
productivity.


5.4    Discussion
Our estimates provide support for the central intuition that assortative matching may be
masked by a non-monotone relationship between wage offers and ability. Figure 8 illustrates
the non-monotonic relation using a scatter plot of two theoretical moments: the estimated
employer effect versus the predicted average worker effect, for each sector-productivity class.
The bubbles in the Figure are scaled by the predicted number of matches. As the employer
effect increases, the expected worker effect increases, hits a maximum, and then decreases.
This result occurs because the predicted employer effect is monotonically increasing in em-
ployer productivity. Because of assortative matching, the expected worker productivity is
also increasing with the predicted employer effect. As employer productivity increases, the
share of jobs filled by the highest-productivity workers also increases. Because the highest-

productivity workers actually get lower wage offers, they also have lower worker effects in
their wage data than lower-productivity workers. Together, these factors pull down the
average worker effect in high employer-productivity sectors.
    Nevertheless, the estimates also suggest that the between-sector correlation in worker
and employer effects is a reliable measure of assortative matching across sectors. Figure
9 illustrates this relationship with two scatter plots. The first is of the predicted mean
employer effect versus the predicted mean worker effect across sectors. The second scatter
plot is the predicted mean level of employer productivity versus the predicted mean level of
worker productivity across sectors. The basic cross-sector correlations are very close, adding
support to the view that the model, while failing to explain within-sector variation, is very
useful for explaining the way workers sort across different sectors.


6    Conclusion
In this paper, we forged a synthesis between the theoretical literature on labor market
assignment and the empirical literature on inter-industry wage differentials. Our synthesis is
valuable for both literatures. The literature on assignment has not dealt systematically with

sector-specific variation in productivity and wages. We find that sector-specific variation can
be useful for identification. More importantly, we find that sorting is most easily interpreted
as a between-industry phenomenon. The empirical work on inter-industry differentials has
long emphasized the importance of worker and employer heterogeneity, and the importance
of sorting, but has struggled over the proper interpretation of the reduced-form evidence.
Our estimates support the interpretation that more productive workers are positively sorted
to more productive employers. These results, then, provide strong structural underpinning
to the inter-industry wage differentials estimated by Abowd et al. (2012a).
    We implemented a formal test of Shimer’s model of job assignment with coordination
frictions (Shimer 2005). We estimated the full structural model by the method of simu-
lated moments applied to sector-specific moments of the joint distribution of worker and
employer specific components of wage heterogeneity, along with data on vacancies, output,
and employment. Our empirical method is applicable to any assignment model that deliv-
ers predicted wage offers and matching sets. We make our estimation moments, which are
derived from restricted-access LEHD data, available to the public. We expect future work
using these tools will sharpen our understanding of how the labor market assigns workers


                                                                    28
across and within industries.
    We find that, between sectors, the empirical evidence of matching is attenuated in the
earnings data because high-productivity workers receive lower wages than workers who are
almost, but not quite as, productive. This is a stunning validation of Shimer’s original
hypothesis that to guard against the possibility that, randomly, no higher-ability workers
would apply for a particular job, it is profit maximizing to offer the lower-ability workers
a compensating differential. Then, in equilibrium, there will be assortative matching when
the technology is appropriate, but the worker and firm components of log earnings will not
mirror this sorting. The result also confirms the points made by Abowd and Kramarz (1999)
that the AKM components could be related to structural components in a variety of ways
that would not necessarily imply that their correlation would reveal sorting in the labor
market.
    This paper is among the first to estimate a structural assignment model with transfer-
able surplus using matched employer-employee data. Our results suggest the potential, and
the challenge, of using sectoral data to model labor market sorting. Exploiting cross-sector
variation in earnings, vacancies, and value-added, is useful for identification, but also of
economic interest. We have assumed, following the literature, that employers operate a com-
mon production technology, and that labor market sorting matches differently able workers
to differently productive jobs. That model is able to match many features of the data, but
fares poorly in predicting the within-sector variation in earnings.
    While direct measures of individual worker and job productivity within sectors are quite
rare, finding employer-level output measures would allow the use of within-sector moments
for more variables than just wage outcomes. Such a strategy is a potentially promising
way to provide additional empirical evidence on within-industry sorting to complement our
evidence on between-industry sorting.

B      For Online Publication Only – Data Appendix
We use data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program (LEHD), uni-
verse data for twenty-eight large American states with information from 1990-2004. Our
analysis sample is restricted to individuals aged 18-70, employed full-time at their dominant
employer. The following sections describe the underlying microdata sources and how we
construct the analysis variables and impose sample restrictions.


B.1      Unemployment Insurance
The individual data were derived from the universe of unemployment insurance (UI) quar-
terly wage records from twenty-eight states.23 The BLS Handbook of Methods (1997) de-
scribes UI coverage as “broad and basically comparable from state to state,” and claims over
96 percent of total wage and salary civilian nonfarm jobs were covered in 1994. The Federal
Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), first enacted in 1938, lays the ground rules for the kinds
of employment which must be covered in state unemployment insurance laws. While tech-
nically mandating coverage of all employers with one or more employees in a calendar year,
FUTA allows for numerous exceptions to covered employment. These include workers at
small agricultural co-operatives, employees of the federal government, and certain employees
of state governments, most notably elected officials, members of the judiciary, and emergency
workers. According to the Handbook, UI wage records measure “gross wages and salaries,
bonuses, stock options, tips, and other gratuities, and the value of meals and lodging, where
supplied.” They do not include OASDI, health insurance, workers compensation, unemploy-
ment insurance, and private pension and welfare funds. Individuals are uniquely identified
and followed for all quarters in which their employers had reporting requirements in the UI
system. Thus, cross-state mobility can be observed for individuals moving between any of
states for which we have data. Although coverage dates vary, all states provide between
seven and thirteen years of data. In our analysis, by combining them into a single “pooled”
file, we have information on approximately 190 million workers, 10 million employers, and
660 million annual earnings records.
  23
    We cannot disclose which states are included in the analysis as a condition imposed by the Census Bureau
on the public use data. We can, however, release the moment matrices used in the structural estimation,
upon request, as they have been designated as public-use data.




                                                    44
B.2     Creation of Variables
Using Census Bureau and other LEHD data bases, sex, race, and date of birth are com-
bined with the individual earnings data using an exact match to administrative Upon each
individual’s first appearance in the data, labor force experience as potential labor force ex-
perience (age - education - 6) is calculated. In subsequent periods, experience is measured
as the sum of observed experience and initial (potential) experience. The UI wage records
connect individuals to every employer from which they received wages in any quarter of a
given calendar year. Therefore, individual employment histories are constructed using the
same personal identifier used in the individual data. Employers are identified by their state
unemployment insurance account number (SEIN). While large employers undoubtedly op-
erate in multiple states, their SEINs are unfortunately state specific, meaning they cannot
be connected. In addition, while we match workers to their employers, it is not possible
to connect those employed in firms with multiple establishments to specific places of work.
This problem is not overly pervasive, as over 70% of employment occurs in firms with only
a single establishment.


B.3     Earnings
For every year an individual appears in a state, a “dominant” employer — the employer for
whom the sum of quarterly earnings is the highest—is identified in order to better approx-
imate the individual’s full-time, full-year annual wage rate using the following steps. First,
define full quarter employment in quarter t as having an employment history with positive
earnings for quarters t − 1, t, and t + 1. Continuous employment during quarter t means
having an employment history with positive earnings for either t − 1 and t or t and t + 1.
Employment spells that are neither full quarter nor continuous are designated discontinuous.
If the individual was full quarter employed for at least one quarter at the dominant employer,
the annualized wage is computed as 4 times average full quarter earnings at that employer
(total full quarter earnings divided by the number of full quarters worked). This accounts for
84% of the person-year-state observations in our eventual analysis sample. Otherwise, if the
individual was continuously employed for at least one quarter at the dominant employer, the
annualized wage is average earnings in all continuous quarters of employment at the domi-
nant employer multiplied by 8 (i.e., 4 quarters divided by an expected employment duration
during the continuous quarters of 0.5). This accounts for 11% of all observations. For the
remaining 5%, annualized wages are average earnings in each quarter multiplied by 12 (i.e.,


                                             45
4 quarters divided by an expected employment duration during discontinuous quarters of
0.33).


B.4    Annual Hours of Work and Full-time Status
We restrict our sample to individuals who worked full-time for their dominant employer.
Full-time status is taken to mean that the individual worked at least 35 hours per week. The
average number of hours per week for a worker is given by dividing the number of hours
worked over the year with the dominant employer by the number of weeks worked. The
number of weeks worked is approximated based on the observed number of full, continuous,
and discontinuous quarters with one’s dominant employer. Specifically, we compute weeks
worked as 13 times the number of full quarters + 6.5 times the number of continuous quarters
+ 4.33 times the number of discontinuous quarters. Annual hours of work are observed for a
subset of individuals in the sample via a database link to other LEHD and Census sources.
For those missing annual hours of work, a value is statistically assigned using a Bayesian
multiple imputation procedure.


B.5    Human Capital Estimates
To the dominant job frame, we attach the variance components of earnings estimated from
the Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999) human capital decomposition. The estimation
of those variance components in the LEHD data is the subject of another paper, Abowd,
Creecy and Kramarz (2002), to which we refer the interested reader.


C     For Online Publication Only – An Economy with
      Heterogeneous Workers and Firms
In this Appendix we derive worker and firm effects in an economy with only two types of
workers and a continuum of firms differing by size and production technology. Notation in
this appendix differs slightly from the notation in the main paper in order to accommodate
the more general specification.




                                            46
C.1     The Economy
Let the economy consist of two types of workers. This is not as limiting as it sounds, for it
may only represent heterogeneity inside a particular class of workers since we consider the
effects net of observables. The economy is divided in a finite number k̄ of industries. The
workers are hired by a continuum of firms, indexed by the share x of type 1 workers each
firm hires, the size t of the firm, and the industry k. The share x is unobserved by the
econometrician. In industry k, there is a mass (density) µk (x, t) of firms of type (k, x, t). We
omit from what follows the k index except when it is necessary.
    The economy as a whole is represented by the space Ω = {Ω1 , . . . , Ωk̄ } with Ωk = [0, 1] ×
                                                                                  R
R+ , the space defining each industry. There is a quantity (or number) J = Ω dµ of firms,
      R
Jk = Ωk dµk in each industry. Firm (x, t) hires xt of type 1 workers, and (1 − x)t of type 2.
            R                      R
We write Ω xt dµ(x, t) = M and Ω (1 − x)t dµ(x, t) = N so that there are M + N workers
in the economy. Type 1 workers earn w(x, t, k) in firm (x, t) in industry k while type 2 earn
u(x, t, k); the wage only depends on the industry, the share of type 1 workers, and the size
of the firm.


C.2     The Economy as Estimated by Person and Firm Effects
As in Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999) (hereafter, AKM99), decompose the individual
wage, ln wi,j(i,t),t , after conditioning for observables, in each period as the sum of an individual
effect, θi , a firm effect, ψ j(i,t) , and a residual, εi,j(i),t

                                 ln wi,j(i,t),t = θi + ψ j(i,t) + εi,j(i),t

We consider here only the limiting (and purely theoretical) case where the number of time
periods goes to infinity and the workers visit ergodically all firms and all industries. This
frees us from the identification problem discussed in detail in the above paper. Moreover,
the effects estimated in AKM99 would converge in probability to the theoretical values we
show below.
    In this case, even though the type of the worker is not directly known by the econome-
trician, observing the workers jump from job to job provides enough information to be able
to reduce the above ordinary least squares (OLS) problem to the following minimization
problem. Find W , U (worker effects) and ψ(k, x, t) (firm effect in industry k for a firm of

            Z
                 xt (w(x, t) − W − ψ(x, t))2 + (1 − x)t (u(x, t) − U − ψ(x, t))2 dµ(x, t).
                                                                               

This problem is exactly equivalent to minimizing the sum of squared residuals in ordinary
least squares. The solutions to this problem are unique up to a constant. We show that:

Theorem 2 Under integrability assumptions on w and u, the solutions to the OLS program
(16) are of the type

                                 x(1 − x)tw(x, t)
                            W =   R               + Λ,                                       (17)

                               R
                                 x(1 − x)tu(x, t)
                            U=    R               + Λ,                                       (18)

where the integrals are all taken on Ω with respect to the measure µ, and Λ is an arbitrary
constant (we will set Λ = 0 in the rest of the paper).

   Proof. Set U = 0 for the time being, as the solutions are only identified up to a constant.
                       R
Let us write J(W, ψ) = Ω ρ(W, ψ)(x, t) dµ(x, t). J is defined on R × L2 (Ω, µ), and may take
the value +∞. It is clear that ρ is convex in its two arguments (as sum of two squares);
hence J is also convex, and can be show to be strictly convex if w(x, t) − u(x, t) is not a
constant. Hence it has a unique minimum under this assumption, characterized by the first
order constraints
                                   Z
                                      xt(w(x, t) − W − ψ(x, t)) dµ(x, t) = 0              (20)
               Z                    Ω

                  xt(w(x, t) − W − ψ(x, t)) + (1 − x)t(u(x, t) − ψ(x, t)) = 0             (21)
                    Ω
              R              R
Hence W = xt(w − ψ) dµ/ xt dB and ψ = x(w − W ) + (1 − x)u. Replacing ψ by this
                                                            R          R
last value in equation 20 and simplifying with the fact that x2 t = M − x(1 − x)t and
R 2       R        R
  x tw = xtw − x(1 − x)w proves the theorem.

Remark 3 (Some special cases) If all firms hire the same number of both types of workers,
the distribution µk for all k is δ 1/2,2 , a Dirac distribution of firms of equal size and same
number of type 1 workers. This leads to W = k wk /k̄, U = k uk /k̄, ψ k = 21 (wk − w̄ +
                                                    P                P

uk − ū), where wk is the wage in industry k.
The case where the distribution µ has all mass in t at t = 2 and w(x, t) = u(x, t) + δ leads
to W = U + δ̄ and ψ(x, t) = u(x) − U .

    We define the firm-employee effects covariances cov(θ̂, ψ̂) as
            R                                  R                      R
                (xtW + (1 − x)tU )ψ(x, t) dµ     (xtW + (1 − x)tU ) dµ ψ(x, t) dµ
                         R                   −         R                R                 (22)
                           t dµ                          t dµ             t dµ

For total covariance the integrals are taken over Ω, for within-sector covariance over Ωk for
all k, and the between-sector covariance is the discrete covariance between the means (i.e.
integrals) on the Ωk . Total covariance is as usual the sum of between-sector and within-sector
covariances.

the probability that a job opening in sector s is left vacant. Under the assignment model,
this expectation is

     JOLTS reports the sectoral vacancy rate as the number of vacant openings divided by
the sum of vacant openings and sectoral employment (equation 12). The model primitive
ν (s) is the theoretical analogue to the total number of openings. In the model, the measure
of vacant openings is the difference between total openings and filled openings. Hence, the
expected vacancy rate in sector s is
