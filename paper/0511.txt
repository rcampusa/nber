                      A Model of Firms' Decisions
                      to Export or Produce Abroad



                                A BSTRACI



     This paper is a theoretical analysis of the factors influencing
production location decisions by a multinational corporation. It
starts with a simple model of optimization for a firm facing the
choice between exporting and producing abroad a single differentiated
final product and then develops the model to take account of produc-
tion of intermediate as well as final products, the existence of scale
economies, and finally, the effects of transport cost and of factors
affecting the cost of production.

     The share of foreign output is shown to be related to the level
of transport cost, to the size of host—country markets, to host—
country wage levels relative to those of the home country, in coinbina—
tion with labor intensities of production. All of these relationships
in turn are shown to interact in various ways with economies of scale
in affecting the choice of production locations.

                        A MODEL OF FIRMS' DECISIONS
                        TO EXPORT OR PRODUCE ABROAD

       This paper is a theoretical analysis of production location by a

multinational corporation (MNC). It starts with a simple model of

optimization   for a firm   facing the choice between exporting and producing

abroad   a single differentiated final product. The model is then developed
to   take account of the production of intermediate as well as final prod-

ucts, the existence of scale economies and finally the effects of trans-

port cost and of factors affecting the cost of production.

       Among the several analytical approaches to economic inultinationalism

summarized by Fatemi et al (1976), this paper belongs to the oligopolistic

approach that has been introduced and elaborated by Vernon (1966, 1971),

Caves (1971) and others. Empirical studies of foreign investment such

as those summarized by Iiufbauer (1975) and the later study by Swedenborg

(1979) show that heavy foreign investors are characterized by attributes

such as product differentiation, large size, high profits, and high levels

of advertising or research orientation. These characteristics are often

associated   with oligopolistic industrial organization. Most of them are
related   to the possible existence of scale economies. Product differentia-

tion is assumed to be a necessary condition for "horizontal" investments,

that   is, investments in the industry   of the parent.


                            A Model of Production Location

       The trade patterns of a multinational firm are implicit in the

production decisions if the market is taken to be the consumption in each
                                           —2—



country,   and that is assumed to be independent of the level of production

in that country. For some purposes, it             might   be appropriate to consider

production   decisions for export separately from those for host—country
consumption,     on the ground that production for export is relatively footloose

while production for host—country consumption is tied to location by host—

country   policies not easily Identified.           Here, however, we emphasize the

choice   between     home and foreign production to serve foreign markets and

therefore the choice between exporting and foreign production.

     The profit function for a multinational firm can be set out in a very

general way as


                 Pr =                         -
                        ijh 13      13 13         ih'                                   (1)

where:
                 h denotes goods (hl,...,n)

                 i   denotes producing countries (i=l,. . .,m)                     -


                 j denotes       purchasing countries (j=l,...,r)

               X. is the output of good h produced in country i and sold
                        to country j

               P.       is the   price   •in country j   of   good h produced in country i
                        and sold to country j

               T'.      is the unit cost of transfer (tariffs, taxes, transport
                        cost) of good h produced in country i and sold to country j
                        (T'.   is assumed to be 0)

                 C is the total          cost of producing good h in country i and is
             -
                        a function of x'i'   or          the total production of good h
                        in country i.
                                                     —3—

      To   focus on the decision about ways of serving foreign markets we
begin with the case of a firm             producing a single good, h,
                                                  considering

in countries i, the home country and j, the foreign country, for sale
in the foreign country, ignoring production in the home country for sales
in that country. However, we will have to consider it later because such
production will be important if there are economies of scale. The profit
function then reduces to:
                  Pr=Xh(Ph_)_Ch+Xp
                        ii ii i jiji
                              ii
                                                                                _ch
                                                                                        j
                                                                                                                          (2)




 The profit maximizing conditions are obtained by differentiating the

Equation (4') shows that the relevant variables in the profit maximiza-

tion process as formulated here are the following:                         (1) The different

MR's    which represent the difference in demand functions in country j for

good h produced         in the host country (j) rather than in the home country
 (1),   some    of which may be    attributable            to marketing advantages generated
by the production in the host country; (2)                     The   different MC's which,
assuming       that the   technology of producing commodity h is the same for the

multinational firm whether it produces in i or in j, are due to different

factor prices and/or different productivity of factors; (3)            The   unit

transfer cost of exporting h from I to j, including transportation costs,
custom duties, insurance premiums, etc.; (4) The marginal rate of substi—

                           are perfectly independent (4/3X =          0),    the

commodity produced in i and that produced in j            are really different

products. The profit maximizing condition is that each MR (or MR—T) = MC,

which is simply the condition for a producer under imperfect competition.

       If X. and X1. really are the sane commodity and are so perceived by

consumers, X/X = -1,                   the two equations (3') and (4') are identical

and the two MR's are equal. The maximization of profits simply involves
                                                                  h

 product differentiation. Home country production would be encouraged by
higher foreign demand for the imported product, or higher foreign production
 costs,     but discouraged by higher home country production costs, transport

 cost, or foreign demand for the foreign—made product. Foreign production

 would be encouraged by higher             home production cost, transport cost, or
 foreign demand for foreign—made products and discouraged by higher foreign
 demand for imported products             or foreign production cost. These effects

    Finally,       if                is positive, which would be the case if the goods

produced in the two countries were complements, as when the sale of one

product by a company familiarizes the market with a trade mark or the sale

of a machine gives rise to a demand for spare parts, the relationships are

different, as can be seen in the table. Higher demand in either country

encourages higher production in both countries and higher production costs

in either country or higher transport costs discourage production in both

countries.

Intermediate        and Final Products
     The   relation of foreign production and investments to exports and
therefore to domestic production and employment, and more specifically,
whether foreign investments and production reduce home—country exports
and employment, has troubled policy makers, legislators, labor unions,
and of course economists. An intuitive answer is that outflows of capital
create jobs abroad at the expense of potential domestic jobs. This seems
to have been the logic underlying the Burke—Nartke Bill that was supported
by the AFL—CIO. One way of examining this issue theoretically is by
incorporating intermediate goods into the analysis.
     u' to this point, we have assumed that a firm                          produces only final

prothcts    for sale. Yet much of the trade between paret firms and their
affiliates takes place in intermediate products, typically exported by the
parent in the home country to the affiliate in the host country.

     Let    us assume that a good--g--is an input into the production of 1j
arLd must b used in a fixed proportion in producing h, and that it pro-                           is

duced eay in the home country. The profit function corresponding to (2) is

                         Pr =   X.(P.-.)-C+X.

     The profitability of host-country production is increased by higher

home country production costs and higher transfer costs for the finished

product  and reduced by higher host country production cost and transfer
cost for the intermediate product.

     The   commodity g might be one which incorporates a high level of skill or
technology, inputs of country-specific resources, or one for which there         are
substantial   economies of scale. In the last case, the       marginal cost of pro-

ducing g for export [MC in equation (7)] is a declining            function of
roduction     in the home country for sale in the home country, which we have
                                   —10—


ignored up to this point),          and X (provided that X1 and          are not

perfect substitutes in which case it is a function of X1 and the sum         of
X . and X..). In this case, an increase of home market sales encourages
 iJ      3)

host—country production by bringing down the cost of production of the
input product. Using the same logic it Is easy to think of a case where

foreign production stimulates the total exports of the parent firm when

these exports include both the intermediate product and the final good.

      To sum   up,   when there is product differentiation and   host—country
production is not a perfect substitute for home—country production, a

higher    level of foreign production can be associated with a higher level
of exports.
     There is empirical evidence of such relationships. Bergsten, Horst,
and Moran (1978) concluded from a cross—section     of industries that

     .a   modest amount of foreign investing is highly complementary to U.S.
exporting    but that higher levels of foreign investment have no strong

or   consistent impact on U.S. exports." Swedenborg (1979) found that           for

Swedish    multinationals there was "a highly significant and positive effect
on exports of goods which are complementary      to foreign manufacturing by

Swedish     firms...." but also '.. .a negative effect on exports which are non—
complementary to foreign manufacturing...."     with   ". . .The net effect of these
opposing     influences... .a very small positive effect on the firm's exports

to countries where they have manufacturing affiliates." Lipsey and Weiss

(1976a and 1976b) found that affiliates' production in foreign countries

was positively associated with home—country exports to these countries.

In addition     they found that in the pharmaceutical industry the promotion
                                    — 11 —



of   exports by affiliates was mainly of bulk pharmaceutical at the expense

of packaged products. In other words, exports of intermediate goods were

stimulated by the production and activity of foreign subsidiaries.


 Scale Economies

        So far we have mentioned scale economies only in passing and have not

integrated them into the analysis. Aside from the pure cost analysis with

which   we began, we have not specified anything about the nature of the cost
function.    Economies of scale, in the absence of transfer costs, imply con-

centration of production in one location. Our problem, as with the earlier

analysis of the factor cost model, is to justify the existence and explain

the distribution of production in more than one market.


        We can begin again with the case in which a firm considers producing

a single product in   two locations.   Isorevenue curves can be plotted in

the plane X., X, as in Figure 1.



              /   '                FIGURE 1

        The curves Ro and Rot in Figure 1, based on different assumptions about

 the markets for xh,         represent       distributions of production of commodity h

 between countries i and j              resulting   in the same constant level of revenue.

 In the simple "competitive" case when a producer faces- constant prices for

 X.
  13
       and X.
           33
              (even if the prices             are different) the isorevenue curve will be

linear       as Rot. When       the two sources of h are perfect substitutes for con-

sumers and thus dX./dX. = -1, the Ro curve will have a unitary slope,
even if the price for ii in country j is not constant for the producer and
he faces a downward sloping              demand curve. In the      case when dX./dX     -1
                                                                              13   jj
but    is   constant, a curve of the type of Ro' will be the isorevenue line.

       The 1sorenue curve will be of the type of Ro, convex to'ard the

origin, when the firm has some degree of monopolistic power in selling

and X.. The coefficient of substitution dX./dX. is not constant. The

firm thus faces two downward sloping demand curves, one for X. and one for

            In this case, the slope for Ro is:




                                                               -

       It is obvious that a whole map of isorevenue curves can be plotted, each

curve representing a different level of revenue (R), and the alternative

allocations of this revenue betveen exports and foreign production.


       Using the same method we can draw an isocst curve                representing different
combinations      of X'. and X. resulting in the same constant level of the cost
                       13          33

       By combining the isocost and the isorevenue curves on the same diagram,

one can see the way in which a multinational corporation maximizes its

profits. A firm      that enjoys scale economies and some morropolistic power
(isorevcnue curve is R) could maximize its profits by                     producing at a poi.nt

such   as E in Figure 3.

       This condition will represent maximum income only if the isorevenue
curve is more convex than the isocost curve, as is true for R and C in
                                                                          0      0
Figure   3.     In this case, the returns to scale are small compared to the

revenue losses froni concentrating l1 production in either market.


       On the other hand, if the firm has no monopolistic power or if X. and

X. are perfect substitutes the isorevenue curve is linear (Rc in Figure 3).

In this case, point E would represent a point of minimum revenue subject to

the cost, hence a solution of maximum loss. The optimal solution in this

case would be a corner solution such as point F, where the firm produced in

only one location. The larger the scale economies (the convexity of the

isocost curve) the more likely that the firm will concentrate its production

in one location. The choice of the location will depend on the production

cost conditions, the transfer cost, the degree of monopolistic power of the

producer and the deoree of substitutability between X. and X..
                                                                           33


       The    degree of convexity of the above curves can be measured by their
elasticities of substitution. This measure can be formulated for each of
the    curves as:



                    a =
                          d(X../X..)        / d(dX../dX..)                            (13)

           We   will now explore the impacts of changes in some of the above variables

on the allocation of production between the home and the host country. This

test will provide some insight into the decision of a firm in its choice of

  location for its foreign production.



The    Effect of Transport Cost

           The transfer cost, denoted above by T., is composed of several variables,

such ascustons duties in country j, transportation cost, and possibly also

the money value of some other trade barri.ers.


       According to our formulation, T. is a part of the cost of selling, in

country j, good h that is produced in country i.. A change in T. generates

a change in both the slope and the convexity of the isocost curve.


       The slope of the isocost curve is given by equation (11) above.                    Higher

transport cost implies a slope (negative) that is lower in absolute value,

though      higher in algebraic value.

its convexity,is given by expression (17). Since                           is assumed to be

     An increase in the transfer. cost T. will decrease the optimal ratio

          and   thus     tend to increase foreign production and decrease exports.

Given the change of the elasticity of substitution, if the firm had no host-

chances that it will combine exports with foreign production are now greater.

If the firm was both exporting and producing in country j before the change,

after the change of T. the chances of concentrating production in country j

and stopping exporting become greater. In Figure 4 a change such as the one

described above is presented.

    Transfer cost interacts with th.e size of the host country when production

involves scale economies. For example, even if a market involves very high

cost of transfer for the home-country producer, the firm will not produce

there if the market is too small. This might occur when the sufficient condi-

tion for production in broth country I an(couñtry j is not met. The second order

condition, 0/OR   > 1,   may be satisfied, but if no combination of outputs can

 depend on the combination of these two variables. Horst (1971) discusses

  owned subsidiaries. A high tariff policy may encourage subsidiary production
                                         abroad". This conclusion is here extended to the

case in which there are scale economies. In this case,

the above mentioned competition is stronger the larger is the size of

domestic market.



The Impact of Cost of Production


     The impact of different levels of the cost of production in different

economies   has two aspects: (a) the possible existence of scale economies and
their relation to the size of production in different countries; (b)factor
prices   in different economies in conjunction with factor intensities in

production.


     (a) The degree of scale economies in production can be measured as the

magnitude   of either the negative       , or the negative MC The greater           the

absolute    value of each of these expressions the higher the degree of scale
economies in production. We can      see in expression (16)   that the greater C
both for X'. and for X., the smaller the chance that c Ic     CR   > 1,   and the
smaller the chance that production will take place in more than one location.

The higher the degree of scale economies the greater the probability that a

producer wIll concentrate his production in one location. If production costs,

 transfer cost, and the degree of differentiation between X. and XL. do not
                                                                   13       33

 justify   production abroad, the producer will produce only in the home country

 and export to other countries. If these conditions favor production in a

 host country, the firm will tend to concentrate its production other than for

 the home market in the host country, and its output there will be larger the

 greater the degree of scale economies.
                                    — 22   —




       (b)   Factor price differentials can obviously influence the location

of production. If we assume                             that prices of capital are,

more or less, uniform across countries •within firms, wage differences will

determine the location and size of foreign production.


       Marginal cost is positively related to the wage rate, and for given

wage differentials between countries i and j, the differences (both absolute

and relative) between MC. and    MC.
                                    3]
                                         will   be greater the more labor-intensive

is   the commodity. Thus, for a given differential between host-country (low)

and home-country (high) wage rates, the relative cost of producing abroad

relative to producing at home and exporting (MC' /MC.+T.) will be lower

and the ratio of production abroad to production at home (X/X.) will be

higher, the more labor intensive is the good, h. When we take scale economies

into consideration, we see that OTC/OR is smaller the greater the difference

between the wage rates. This is due to the fact that d1c/dw <
                                                                         MC
                                                                              <   0).
We can   conclude then, that the greater the wage differentials between countries
(when the producer faces    scale economies) the lower the probability for the

second   order condition (ac/aR >   1) to   be met. The producer will then tend
to   concentrate his output in the host country j and produce there as much as

possible. This is one more possible interaction between the degree of scale

economies and another (exogenous) variable, in this case, the wage differentials:


       To conclude, one can say that the impact of wage differentials on inter-

national productiQn is stronger (1) the greater the labor intensity in produc-

tion     (2) the higher the degree of scale economies. This chain of effects re-
lates wage    differentials to the size of the potential host country; thus, the

impact of low wages on production in the foreign country is stronger, the larger

the size of the host country.

 SunimdEmjrjcal        Implications


     The location and magnitude of the international production of a firm de-

pend on two groups of variables: the endogenous variables of the firm (in-

dustrial characteristics) and exogenous variables for which the firm adjusts

its behavior (national characteristics). The latter include T. --    the   transfer
cost, w. and w. -- home and foreign wages, and demand conditions in
                                                                    foreign
countriesj3 On the other hand, factors such as the degree of scale
                                                                   economies,
the factor intensities, the possible production of allied goods (inputs and/or

final goods), are endogcnous to the firm.


     The impact of national characteristics on the location and the size of pro-

duction of a firm will depend on industrial
                                              characteristics. In theory we know
the signs of the effects of the various national characteristics on the size

of foreign production and on the ratio of foreign production in a given location

to total output of the firm.


     In general we would expect the following
                                                relationships:
1.   The higher transport costs are, the larger foreign output is relative to

the home output and total output of the firm.   In symbolic terms, X./a'i'. .. 0
and a(X./X'.)/3T. > 0.     Assuming that the output in country i(X), or its

major part (X - X.), is completely independent of T., the above derivative
means that (X/Xl3/T1 > 0.

      If   commodity h is produced with scale economies, the greater the degree of

scale economies the greater the value of these derivatives. The size of the host

country also affects the optimal ratio                   When the firm   decides   to produce

in country j    (involving scale    economies), for a given level of ., the greater

the size of country j    the greater the optimal ratio X./XJ and also the ratio

x / x.

2.    Production in a foreign country will he higher, the larger the size of the

natural market of that countryJ4 That is, if Si denotes the size of the natural

market in country j,                > 0.   When production     of h involves scale economies,

the   value of the derivative will be greater the greater the degree of scale
economies. The same is true for the ratios          33    13
                                                               and
                                                                     33 1

       The higher the wage   in   the home country (w.)    relative to the foreign wage (w.),
the 1arger foreign production will be. aX./(w1/w) > 0 and
These two derivatives are positively affected by the labor intensity in the pro-

duction of h (and by the elasticity of substitution between the factors), and by
the   degree of scale economies in production. Since this is so, we can add the size

                                                as magnifying the wages effect through
of the market in the host country -
                                           Si
the   impact of the degree of scale economies.

       Thus    (X./X'i')I(wj/wi) =    f    (Labor/Capital, scale economies, S.).
We can conclude then that the three variables, in parentheses above, operate in

positive interactions with        wage differentials (or other factor prices) in de-
termining the relative and absolute level of foreign production by a firm.

3.   If we assume that a firm might improve its market share in a country by

     producing there, or that the location of production involves marketing

     advantages, then the demand conditions facing the firm are not perfectly

     exogenous.

4. The size of the natural market in country j can be larger than the size

     of its national market. For example, production in Belgium can be designated

     to supply the whole EEC, or a part of it.
