Why is Productivity Growing Faster?

NBER Working Paper No. 9530
February 2003
JEL No. E0

                                           ABSTRACT

        Productivity in the United States has been growing faster in the past seven years than it did
in the previous quarter century. U.S. productivity growth accelerated while that in Europe declined.
This paper asks why U.S. productivity growth has been faster than in the past and than in Europe.


        An important reason for the faster growth has been the strong incentives for managers at all
levels to make the kinds of changes that can raise productivity even if that involves personal risk
and discomfort. These incentives became much stronger during the 1990s for reasons that I
speculate about but do not begin to understand fully.


        The information technology developments in personal computers and in internet and intranet
communications provided a powerful means to achieve the productivity gains that everyone was
seeking. But even if the new IT opportunities had not come along, the combination of strong
incentives and a receptive corporate climate would have led managers to find other ways to increase
productivity, although undoubtedly not by as much.


        European firms had neither the incentive structure nor the corporate environment supportive
of making change that could involve significant job changes and layoffs. Although Europe has
higher unemployment rates, it is much more difficult to lay off workers in Europe than in the United
States. Reorganizing white collar work to change job assignments and locations is also much easier
in the U.S. than in Europe.


       The future is likely to see continued strong productivity growth and perhaps even increasing
productivity growth in the United States if the incentives and corporate environments remain
supportive. The prospects for Europe remain uncertain.

                                     Why is Productivity Growing Faster?

                                               Martin Feldstein*

          The rise in the growth rate of productivity has been the key economic fact in the U.S.

economy during the past decade. Faster productivity growth has raised the growth rate of real

incomes, kept inflation under control even though the tightening labor markets since 1995 have

caused wage increases to accelerate, and dampened the magnitude of the output decline in the

recession that began in early 2001.

          It is important to understand why productivity has grown so rapidly in order to assess

what is likely to happen in the future and what can be done to maintain or even increase the rate

of productivity growth.

          My conclusion is that the acceleration of productivity that began in the mid-1990s

reflects more than just the availability of new information technology, the most commonly cited

explanation.         Incentives and institutional structures were critical ingredients in the rise of

productivity. Without strong incentives and appropriate institutional structures, the developments

in information technology would not have been transformed into faster productivity growth.

Some Stylized Facts

          Let me begin with some stylized facts that characterize the faster growth of productivity.

Between 1970 and 1995, productivity in the non-farm business sector rose at an average annual

rate of 1.6 percent. In the seven years since then, the rate of increase was 2.6 percent.

          There is no sign that the rate of productivity growth is slowing down. In the year ending

Productivity.aea2003.rev1                               1
with the third quarter of 2002 productivity rose 5.8 percent. This no doubt reflects the

productivity pick-up as output rose from the very weak economy at the end of 2001. But even if

we look back before the recession to the period beginning in the third quarter of 2000, the two

year productivity growth since then has averaged 3.1 percent.

         Before going further, I should stress the need for caution in interpreting such productivity

statistics. Much of the measured change in productivity reflects estimated improvements in

product quality rather than increases in the number of physical units of output. In a time of low

inflation, these quality improvements often appear as estimated decreases in the real prices of

the products. Consider the improvements in computers, a major component of the productivity

change. How confident can we be of the measure of this change when the official annual rates of

change of the real price of computers and peripherals has varied since 1995 between minus 20

percent a year and minus 35 percent a year. The uncertainty of these measures should be born in

mind in interpreting what I will say as well as in interpreting studies that try to be more precise

than my impressionistic comments.

         An important feature of the productivity surge of the past seven years is that it has not

occurred in Europe or in Japan. The productivity rise there has been less since 1995 than it was

in earlier years. And while the U.S. productivity rise has been accompanied by a substantial

increase in employment, the volume of employment in Europe has stagnated. Looking ahead,

the European Commission’s recent Economic Review predicts that the annual growth rate in

Europe during the next fifty years will be only half that in the United States.1 So the title of my



         1
        Some of this difference in growth rates is of course due to a lower rate of growth of
population in the EU countries than in the United States.

talk, “Why is Productivity Growing Faster?”, can be interpreted as “faster in the U.S. than

elsewhere” as well as “faster now than in the previous quarter century.”

         The increase in business investment was a contributory factor but cannot by itself explain

the faster productivity rise. Moreover, the investment rate is endogenous and may have been, at

least in part, a response to the increased rates of return on investments made possible by the new

information technology. It may also have been a reaction to the changed management incentives

about which I will comment in a moment.

         Careful studies by several researchers have established that the productivity growth rate

was particularly strong in those parts of the economy where information technology goods are

produced.2 I believe this primarily reflects the product improvements rather than changes in the

manufacturing process itself. In that part of the economy, not surprisingly, the European

productivity gains were almost as large as those in the United States.

         The big difference in the productivity increase between the U.S. and Europe has been in

the sectors that are substantial users of IT equipment and software . In the US, the industries that

used IT intensively saw very substantial gains in productivity while in Europe there was no

increases in the rate of productivity gain. US productivity growth also rose in those industries

that did not use IT , although the gains were smaller. Again, Europe did not have equally strong

productivity gains in those industries.

percent from 1995-2000 and at more than 23 percent in the ICT manufacturing industries.

The New Technology

         Current generation computers, the internet, and high speed connections are now so much

a part of all of our daily lives that it is easy to forget how much has changed in the past few

years. Since the mid-1990s, when productivity growth accelerated, there have been fundamental

changes in all aspects of the information technology used in business as well as in research and

in our personal lives.

         Desk top computers have become faster and more user friendly, thanks to Windows and

improvements in a variety of standard office software packages. The new computers and

software can change the way that everyone in an organization works and communicates.

Company data systems allow managements to accumulate and process vast amounts of

information on a timely basis.

         The use of the internet and corporate intranets not only makes individuals more

productive as they search and process information but also permits significant reductions in staff

levels as managers can deal directly with much larger numbers of individuals and communicate

throughout the organization without the help of lower level managers and other support staff.

The internet and intranet have changed supply chain management, product design and

development, and inventory management.

         It is, as we all know from our own experience, a very different world than it was just a

few years ago. I see this every day not only in my own personal work but in the operation of the

NBER where a smaller support staff can now manage a much larger and more complex

organization, and can share data and research results with thousands of users around the world

every day.


Productivity.AEA2003.rev1                         4
         The productivity gains made possible by the new information technology have been

concentrated in white collar jobs. While earlier generations of technological change permitted

automation and robots in the production process, the IT revolution has brought productivity

gains to management, sales, purchasing, design, accounting and other non-production activities.

This is, in fact, where most of the jobs are now, even in the manufacturing industry.

         When we think about the dramatic changes in technology that have occurred, it is

perhaps surprising that the rate of productivity increase has risen by only about one percent a

year, implying that an organization with 100 employees can reduce its staff by only one

additional person per year while producing the same level of output. Over the past seven years,

the increased productivity has been equivalent to a 7 percent rise in output or a 7 percent fall in

the staff needed to do the original level of work. My casual empiricism tells me that there is a

lot more to come as firms learn to use the new technology and the new software and to make the

organizational changes that allow more output or reduced staff inputs. Even if there were no

future advances in computer technology and communications and in the standard programs to be

used with that technology – all an unlikely assumption – new gains could come from developing

company-specific software and from modifying the management software systems like SAP to

specific company needs.

The Speed of Adopting the New Technology

         This brings me to the questions of what determines the speed with which the new

technology is being adopted and why we saw these gains in the United States but not in Europe.

Much research needs to be done to answer those questions, particularly microeconomic research




Productivity.AEA2003.rev1                        5
on the experience in different firms and narrowly defined industries.3 For now I can only

speculate.4

         Innovation is disruptive and costly. Innovation is also risky, since the new system may

not work well after it is put in place. Output may decline during the transition while people are

learning to use the new system. Innovation is often frightening to the people who have to learn

new systems, particularly older workers for whom new computer technology may never be user-

friendly enough. Innovation can also be personally unpleasant for managers if it involves forcing

unwanted personnel changes and mandatory early retirements.

         The business process innovations nevertheless occurred in U.S. firms because the general

environment supported and encouraged change while the individuals who made the decisions to

drive change had strong incentives to do so. Both aspects were much more favorable to change

in the United States than in Europe. And while much of the change was associated with the new

information technology, the heightened incentives induced a faster pace of change in other

aspects of management and production as well.

         The nature of compensation changed substantially in the American companies in the

1990s. Bonuses and equity-based compensation (shares and options) became much more

important relative to ordinary salary, not only for top managers but throughout companies.

There has been much recent attention to some egregious examples of overcompensation that

observations is now getting started at the NBER under the direction of Richard Freeman and

Financial Times, June 28, 2001 [http://www.nber.org/feldstein/ft062801.html]

resulted from option plans and of the dishonest reporting of company incomes that was induced

in part by these new forms of compensation. But the increase in incentive compensation, tied to

individual and company performance, also caused executives and lower level managers to take

risks, to work harder, and to engage in the unpleasant tasks that raised productivity. These

changes in behavior were a response not only to the carrots of incentive compensation but also to

the sticks of employment termination and other pressures on each level of management from

those above them.

         The basic reasons for these changes in compensation are not well established. In part,

boards of directors and top executives were responding to the pressure from investment

managers and Wall Street analysts to “create shareholder value,” i.e., to raise profits. Much of

this may in turn have reflected the increasing professionalization of portfolio managers who

were to an ever greater extent working for corporate pension funds where performance was

judged on a quarterly basis. The emphasis on management performance and payment for creating

shareholder value may also reflect the ascendency of a new type of manager who had been

trained in a business school to quantify goals and performance.

         Raising profits and creating shareholder value was often equivalent to reducing costs.

Some firms attributed this focus on cost reduction to the reduced market power of companies to

raise prices because they faced competition not only from other domestic firms but from

increasingly sophisticated producers around the world. The low general rate of inflation was

accompanied by very low or even negative rates of price change for goods at the level of the

producer.

         The situation in Europe was quite different. Incentive compensation in general and the


Productivity.AEA2003.rev1                        7
use of stock options in particular is generally much less significant in Europe than in the United

States. With a few notable exceptions, the idea of increasing shareholder value was not central to

managements’ goals. Much more weight was given in both rhetoric and practice to achieving

satisfactory performance for all of the so-called “stakeholders” including all employees,

customers, and the government. This may play a large part in explaining why the adoption of IT

has occurred at a substantially slower pace in Europe than in the United States.5

         Even if the technical changes in information technology had not occurred, the pressures

to raise profits and reduce costs would have led to a greater increase in productivity in the United

States. Information technology was just the means, a very powerful means, for translating the

pressure for profit enhancement through cost reduction into practice. Notions of radically re-

engineering the corporation6 to raise productivity were an emphasis of American managers even

before the IT revolution began.

         The US-Europe difference is not just a matter of incentives. The organizational rules and

constraints are also very different on the two sides of the Atlantic ocean. European work rules,

embodied in union agreements and legislation, make it much more difficult to change work

assignments or discharge redundant workers. And to the extent that is true, it acts as a barrier

and a disincentive. Why introduce a new technology that permits managing with fewer

employees when you cannot discharge those who become redundant? And even when changing

work assignments can eventually be achieved, the effort to do so is so great that in many cases

European managers are discouraged from even starting.

         The same combination of differences in incentives and in institutional constraints may

also explain much of the US-EU difference in productivity gains in retailing, one of the key

sectors contributing to the difference between US and EU productivity gains (according to van

Ark et al 2002). European limits on the number of shopping hours per week and restrictions on

building reduce the incentive for the capital accumulation that raises productivity in this sector.

Of course, measuring productivity change in retailing is particularly difficult because the mix of

service quality, self-service requirements, and consumer time have changed without being

adequately reflected in measuring the output of retail services.

The Future

         I recognize that much of what I have said is based on personal impressions rather than the

kind of detailed evidence that I hope will eventually be produced. But I would nevertheless

draw the following tentative conclusions:

         Productivity in the United States is growing faster because there have been strong

incentives for managers at all levels to make the kinds of changes that can raise productivity

even if that involves personal risk and discomfort.

         These incentives became much stronger during the 1990s for reasons that I have

speculated about but do not begin to understand fully.

         In addition to personal incentives from a revised compensation structure, individual

managers were influenced by a corporate environment that emphasized and permitted driving

down costs to create shareholder value.

         The information technology developments in personal computers and in internet and

intranet communications provided a powerful means to achieve the productivity gains that


Productivity.AEA2003.rev1                        9
everyone was seeking. But even if the new IT opportunities had not come along, the combination

of strong incentives and a receptive corporate climate would have led managers to find other

ways to increase productivity, although undoubtedly not by as much.

         European firms had neither the incentive structure nor the corporate environment

supportive of making change that could involve significant job changes and layoffs. Although

Europe has higher unemployment rates, it is much more difficult to lay off workers in Europe

than in the United States. Reorganizing white collar work to change job assignments and

locations is also much easier in the U.S. than in Europe.

         The future is likely to see continued strong productivity growth and perhaps even

increasing productivity growth in the United States if the incentives and corporate environments

remain supportive. The prospects for Europe remain uncertain.
