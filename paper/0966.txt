                   The Fiscal Framework of Monetary Policy



                                  ABSTRACT



     This paper illustrates the importance of the fiscal framework for

monetary analysis by discussing three separate issues.        I begin by examining

how the fiscal framework changes the macroeconomic equilibrium associated

with different steady state rates of money growth. This includes a summary

of research that I have presented elsewhere and comments on several additional

aspects of the way in which the fiscal structure destroys the neutrality of

monetary policy.

     The second section deals with the short—run impact of changes in

monetary policy. Here again the fiscal structure complicates the economy's

response to monetary policy.

     The final section looks at the effect of the fiscal structure on

the central bank's choice of monetary policies. Because fiscal structures

affect the costs and benefits of monetary policies, they are likely to

influence the policies adopted.

                                 Martin Feldstein*


            I am very honored by your invitation to present this lecture. I

will use this occasion to discuss a subject that has been an important focus of

my own work in the past decade and that lies at the boundary of nacroeconomics

and public finance: the fiscal framework of monetary policy.

           The failure to deal explicitly with the fiscal framework of monetary

policy is a serious shortcoming of modern monetary theory. My purpose in this

lecture is to advocate that the theory and practice of monetary economics devote

more attention to the ways in which the tax structure influences the impact of

monetary policy.

            I find it very strange that virtually all studies of' monetary policy,

empirical as well as theoretical, ignore the system of tax rules within which

monetary policy has its influence. Ignoring taxes was no doubt justifiable when

tax rates were very low. Fifty years ago, most individuals paid no income tax

at all and the median tax rate among those who did pay tax was less than 5 per-

cent. By contrast, in the 1910s individuals could pay tax on investment income

at rates up to TO percent and taxes took more than two—thirds of the real income

of nonfinancial corporate capital.

           A   particularly important aspect of the tax system is its failure to
distinguish between nominal and real magnitudes. Monetary policies that alter
the   price level or the rate of inflation therefore change effective tax rates

and alter the incentives to engage in different types of activities. Thus, even

if the conditions required for the neutrality or superneutrality of money would

be satisfied in the absence of taxes, the fiscal framework would effectively

destroy both neutrality and superneutrality.

             To avoid misunderstanding, let me say at the outset that I am not

arguing    that   a full description of an econonr's fiscal structure should be part

of   every   study of monetary economics. Including even a rudimentary description

of the fiscal framework would obviously increase the complexity of any study.

In some cases, such complexity can obscure the particular subject of'          interest
without changing anything of fundamental          importance.   I do believe, however,

that those who would ignore the fiscal framework must bear the burden of

arguing that such simplification is not misleading. Empirical studies that

ignore taxes are particularly suspect.

              To illustrate the importance of the fiscal framework for monetary ana-

lysis, I will discuss three separate issues. I will begin by examining how the

fiscal framework changes the macroeconomic equilibrium associated with different

steady state rates of money growth. This will include a summary of research

that I have presented elsewhere1 and comments on several additional aspects of

the way in which the fiscal structure destroys the neutrality of monetary policy.

              The   second section of rrr,y remarks will deal with the short—run impact
of changes in monetary policy. Here again the fiscal structure complicates the
economy's response to monetary policy.
              The final section looks at the effect of the fiscal structure on       the

 central     bank's choice of monetary policies. Because fiscal structures affect

 the costs and benefits of monetary policies, they are likely to influence the

 policies adopted.

1. Tax Rules and Monetary Equilibrium

          An increase in the stock of money   induces   a corresponding increase in

the level of prices. Similarly, a permanent increase in the rate of growth of

the money stock induces a corresponding increase in the rate of inflation.

These basic steady—state properties follow directly from the proportionality of

money demand to the price level and are not affected by the econonr's fiscal

structure. However, the interaction of tax rules and price inflation does

change the equilibrium of the real econony in a wide variety of ways. This sec-

tion first comments briefly on the non--neutrality of one—time changes in the

money stock and then discusses in riore detail the effects of sustained increases

in the growth of money.

          The most widely understood effect of inflation on tax liabilities is

the result of the progressive structure of tax rates. A general rise in the

level of prices and incomes shifts taxpayers into higher tax brackets and

thereby raises the overall effective tax rate. With the existing structure of

U.S. tax rates, a 10 percent increase in money incomes raises tax revenue by 16

percent, thereby raising the effective tax rate by about 6 percent. Moreover,

the shift of individuals to higher tax brackets raises marginal tax rates and

thereby lowers the net of tax wage rate and the net of tax rate of interest.

Thus, a one—time increase in the stock of money is far from neutral in our economy.

          To simplify the discussion in the remainder of this paper, I will

ignore the bracket creep effect of the progressive structure of taxes. I will

assume instead that the tax brackets are fully indexed. I will, however, com-

ment on the implication of the fact that individuals do face different tax rates

and, in the third section, I will discuss the effect of nonindexation on the

determination of monetary policy.
                                                   ——



            Even if tax brackets are fully indexed, the tax system is very sen-

sitive to inflation because it fails to distinguish between real capital income

and nominal capital income. Recall for comparison what happens in an econori

without taxes when a permanent rise in the growth rate of money causes an

increase in the steady state inflation rate. If the demand for money is completely

interest inelastic, the nominal rate of interest rises by the rate of inflation.

This leaves the real rate of interest and all other real magnitudes in the eco—

nonr unchanged. This is the superneutrality property that we associate with

Irving Fisher. As          Tobin   (1965)   and   Mundell (1963) have emphasized, this super—

neutrality is lost if the demand for money is interest sensitive. The rise in

the nominal interest rate then causes a reduction in the demand for money and a

substitution of real capital for money in individual portfolios. The resulting

capital deepening in production reduces the real rate of interest. Although

this effect        is   theoretically correct,      it   is likely to be very small in practice.

Since Ml, which is a broader measure of money than is appropriate for the

Mundell-Tobin theory, is only five percent of total private wealth, the scope

for   portfolio substitution is extremely limited. I shall therefore                ignore this

effect   and assume a completely inelastic demand for money in order to contrast
the tax effects          with the superneutrality that would otherwise characterize

e gui 1 ib rium.

             One of       the most important features of the        U.S. tax system is that
taxable    income reflects nominal interest receipts and expenses instead of real

interest receipts and expenses. Before looking at other complexities of the tax

system, it is helpful to consider an econorrr in which taxable income is

correctly measured in all respects except that nominal rather than real interest
                                       —5—


receipts and expenditures are included.' Assume for the moment that savings are

not affected by the rate of return that savers receive and that all saving is

absorbed in private capital formation. This is sufficient to insure that the

steady state capital intensity remains constant and therefore that the real

marginal product of capital, f', is unchanged.

          The equilibrium condition for a competitive firm is that the real net—

of—tax marginal product of capital, (l—t)f' where t is the corporate tax rate,

is equal to the real net—of--tax rate of interest. If the nominal rate of

interest is i, the net—of—tax nominal rate is (l—T)i and the net of tax real

rate is (l—T)i—1r, where ii is the rate of inflation. It is important to note

that the tax law permits deduction of the nominal interest rate so that the tax

deduction is TI. The equilibrium condition is thus


(1)                        (1—r)f' = (1—T)i — 1'.


Solving for the rate of interest yields:

                                              it

(2)                              i=f'+
                                             l—T


          The individual lender who provides capital to the firm must, of

course, pay tax on the full nominal interest rate. The real net return received

by the individual, rN, is thus equal to the real interest rate, i—it, minus the

tax on the nominal interest rate, Gi, where 0 Is the marginal rate of personal

income tax. Thus,



   1This is the case examined in Feldstein (1976) which appears as Chapter 3
of Feldstein (1982).
                                                —6—




(3)                                    r =   (1—0)1 — ir.


Substituting     equation 2 for i yields


(1k)                                   r = (1—0)f'      +   _______    fl.



The real net interest rate received by the individual lender is thus affected by
inflation unless the corporate tax rate and the individual tax rate are equal,

i.e., unless the benefit that corporations get from deducting the full nominal

interest payment is offset exactly by the penalty to individuals that arises

from paying tax on the full nominal interest receipt.

              Since individuals have different personal tax rates, they will be

affected differently by inflation. Equation 1 shows that individuals with low

marginal tax rates (0 <        t) and   tax exempt investors like universities and pen-

sion funds (0 =      o) will benefit from      inflation     while investors with high rErgi—

nal    tax   rates (0 >   T) will   find that inflation lowers their real rate of return.

               If we now drop the assumption that saving is not sensitive to the real

net rate of return that savers receive, we see that a change in the rate of

monetary expansion will lead to a change in capital intensity. To see the

importance of this, consider for a nment the extreme case in which all personal

tax rates are equal and the supply of saving is infinitely elastic at the real

net interest rate (1—0)f'0 where f'0 is the marginal product of capital in the

absence of inflation. With inflation at rate it                 the   marginal product of capital

must adjust to a level f'1 that maintains the same real net return to savers:



 (5)                      (1—0)f'0 =    (1-0)f'1   +   ______
                                            —7—


or,

                                           1— 8
 (6)                 r'i =   'o   —   ___________
                                       (l—T)(l—8)


If T is greater than 0, inflation reduces the equilibrium marginal product of

capital and therefore increases the capital intensity of the economy.

          Although these simple calculations are sufficient to illustrate the

important non—neutrality of a sustained (and therefore anticipated) monetary

expansion, let me warn you not to take the specific results seriously because we

have not yet considered other important ways in which tax rules affect the

economy's monetary equilibrium. Among the most significant of these is the tax

treatment of depreciation and inventory costs.

          Existing tax law bases depreciation allowances on the original or

"historic" cost of an asset with no adjustment for the increase in the price

level since the asset was acquired. When the price level increases, the depre-

ciation component of costs is understated. Taxable profits are therefore

overstated and the effective tax rate rises. Similarly, the use of the first—

in—first—out (FIFO) method of inventory valuation also causes an understatement

of costs when there is inflation and therefore an overstatement of taxable

income. These effects are very large; a few years ago, Larry Summers and I

(Feldstein and Summers, 1979) calculated that the excess taxes due to the use of

historic cost depreciation and inflated inventory profits accounted for 5 per-

cent of the taxes paid by nonfinancial corporations.

          If we approximate this extra tax burden per unit of capital as propor-

tional to the rate of inflation, the real net—of—tax rate of return to the firm

becomes (l—r)f'—Air where A measures the effect of inflation on net—of—tax profi—
                                                         —8—


tability. Empirical calculations suggest that under the tax law prevailing

before 1981, A was    approxinRtely          one—fourth (see the appendix to chapter 11 in

Feldstein, 1982.) The firm's equilibrium condition requires equating the real

net—of--tax   return to the firm to the real net—of—tax rate of interest:

(7)                    (l—T)f'—Alr =         (1—t)j—w.


Thus the nominal rate of interest is
                                        1—A
(8)                    j =   f'    +
                                           l—t
                                                    it




and the real rate of interest is

                                             T— A
(9)                      j—n=     f'   +
                                             l—T
                                                         It.




Equation 9 shows that inflation raises the real rate of interest if t > A and

lowers it if T < A. The explanation of this is simple: the real rate of

interest that firms can pay with a given marginal product of capital is

depressed by inflation     to the extent that it               induces extra taxes because of

historic cost depreciation and FIFO inventory accounting (hence the negative

A term) but is increased by inflation because nominal interest payments are

deductible in the calculation of taxable interest (the positive effect of T).

              Equation 8 shows that if A and T were equal, the nominal interest rate

would rise roughly point—for—point with the inflation rate. Thus Irving

Fisher's equilibrium relation could be true in an econonr with distortionary

taxes, but because of numerically offsetting factors rather than because of any

inherent tendency toward a constant real rate of return.

              It is important, nreover, to note that a constant real rate of

interest nans that the real net—of—tax rate of interest received by taxable

lenders depends on the rate of inflation:
                                          —9—



(10)                   r = (1_9)i_ir

                                         (i—o)(i—x)
                          = (l—O)f' +                        — it
                                            1—t


                          = (1—O)f' +
                                            —
                                              (1—o)A
                                                       it.
                                            l—t


To see how large this effect is, note that if t6,       the    real net rate of interest

falls by A per percentage point of inflation; if we take asa a reasonable

approximation that the marginal product of capital is f' =          .12,   that 0 =   = 0.5
and that A =   0.25,   a 12 percent rate of inflation reduces the real net return in

half, from six percent to three percent.

         The fall in the net return caused by inflation implies that a

sustained monetary expansion will change the equilibrium capital intensity and

therefore the marginal product of capital. Thus even when T = A the full

general equilibrium response to inflation contradicts Fisher's prediction that

the equilibrium nominal interest rate rises by the rate of inflation.

         A further word of caution. The results that I have derived assume

that firms are 100 percent debt financed at the margin'. If firms are 100 per-

cent equity financed or use a mixture of debt and equity (Feldstein, Green and

Sheshinski, l9T8) the quantitative results can be quite different. For my pur-

pose today, however, it is not necessary to derive definitive results. It is

sufficient to establish that, even if money demand is completely inelastic,



   'See Stiglitz (1976) for an explicit model of this sort, although not in the
context of inflation. For a more general model of the debt — equity choice, see
Auerbach (1982).

changes in   the steady—state rate of money     growth   are   far   from   neutral   in their

effect on the real equilibrium of the econoxxr.

           Lest this seem like a lot of effort to demolish an intellectual straw

man,   let me remind you   that, except for Tobin—Mundell liquidity effects, the

long—run   dichotonr between the money growth rate and the real econoxmj is assumed
in virtually all of the best work in monetary theory, including such outstanding
examples as Tobin   (1963) and Sargent   (1980)1. Even more significant are the
statistical   studies like Earro (1977) and Faina    (1975) that       take   the neutrality
of   anticipated money growth as a theoretically Justified null hypothesis.

Similarly, when Schiller (1980) investigated whether Federal Reserve policy

could alter the real interest rate, his focus was too narrow. By altering the

rate of inflation, the Fed alters the difference between the net—of—tax real

profitability of investment and the net—of—tax real cost of funds.

             The adverse effect of inflation on the profitability of business

investments causes a shift of the capital stock away from plant and equipment

and into owner—occupied housing (Feldstein, 1982, chapter 6).                 In   fact, during

the 1970s the share of residential construction in total net investment

increased and the real value of single family homes rose sharply because the

relative stock of housing had not yet increased to its new equilibrium level

(Poterba, 1980).

             A sinillar disequilibrium response was also reflected in the behavior

of share prices. In the very long run, share prices rmist rise at the same rate

as the price level in general. In the short run, however, an increase in the



   'An interesting counterexample is a very recent paper by Modigliani and
Papademos (1982).

equilibrium inflation rate depresses the expected after—tax return on equity

capital relative to other portfolio investments and therefore reduces the market

price of corporate shares (Feldstein, 1982, Chapters 10 and ii).     This is a tem-

porary condition which is reversed gradually as a reduction in the relative size

of the corporate capital stock permits the real pretax rate of return to rise.2

            To understand the full interaction of inflation and the tax system, it

is necessary to look beyond the basic tax rules affecting interest payments,

depreciation, capital gains and inventories. The tax code contains a nrriad of

special provisions affecting different types of capital income that may   be
influenced by inflation: there are special rules for banks, insurance com-

panies, timber, oil and gas, farmers, utilities, etc.    I am certain that there

are many such influences of which I am unaware. To illustrate the importance of

such special features, I will describe the tax rules that apply to the portfolio

income of life insurance companies.3

            In the United States, individuals pay life insurance premiums with

after—tax dollars and the insurance benefits subsequently received are not part

of taxable income. If the insurance companies were not subject to tax on their

portfolio income, savings in the form of life insurance would effectively be

treated on a consumption tax basis, i.e., there would be no tax on the interest

earned on this form of saving. This was almost the situation immediately after

1959 when the current special income tax rules for insurance companies were

enacted.    That law provides that an insurance company would pay no tax on its



   'Share prices are also depressed by the fact that inflation produces
nominal capital gains that are subject to tax when the stock is sold.

   2See Summers (1982) for an explicit model of the adjustment process in a
rational expectations general equilibrium model.

           discussion draws on Feldstein and Warshawsky (1982).

portfolio income, savings in the form of life insurance would effectively be

treated on a consumption tax basis, i.e., there would be no tax on the interest

earned on this form of saving. This was almost the situation immediately after

1959 when the current special income tax rules for insurance companies was

enacted. That law provides that an insurance company would pay no tax on its

portfolio income if that income was just enough to provide the nominal rate of

return that it had promised to its policyholders. The promised rate, which is

controlled by the state insurance commissioners, changes very little and is

still less than five percent.

           If an insurance company earns more than the promised rate, it must pay

tax at the corporate rate on a portion of its capital income. That jxrtion is

determined by an archane rule, the Menge formula, that provides that the taxed

portion is ten times the difference between the rate of return on the company's

portfolio and its promised rate of return. Thus, if a company earns 6 percent

on its protfolio and has a promised rate of      percent, it pays tax at the cor-

porate rate on 20 percent of its portfolio income; equivalently, it pays tax on

all its prtfolio income at 20 percent of the corporate rate or about a 9 per-

cent tax rate.

           As long as the interest rate on the bonds held by insurance companies

was close to the low promised rate set by the regulators, saving in the form of

life insurance was virtually tax free. This not only encouraged life insurance

as a form of saving but also, by providing a tax free vehicle for life cycle

saving, encouraged saving in general.

           Consider now what happens as inflation raises the rate of interest.

With a 10 percent inflation rate and a l).t percent bond interest rate, the Menge

formula   indicates that   the insurance company would be taxed at 100 percent of
                                            —13—



the    corporate tax rate on its total portfolio income. Inflation means that life

insurance is no longer an essentially untaxed way to do life cycle saving.

Moreover, saving in the form of life insurance would have a lower after—tax

yield than direct investment in the same bond portfolio for anyone whose per-

sonal tax rate was less than the corporate tax rate.

            The special tax rules affecting life insurance thus are another 'way in

which an inflationary monetary policy reduces the rate of capital accumulation.

I think the problem of life insurance taxation is also a good indication of the

complexity of adjusting the tax laws to eliminate the effect of changes in the

rateof inflation. Although fifteen years of inflation has been long enough to
reduce substantially the rate of life insurance saving, it has not been long
enough    for   the political   process to find a way to remedy these problems.

            Until now, I have limited my analysis to the effects of monetary

policy, in a closed economy. When the broader perspective of an open economy is

considered, the interaction between inflation and tax rules also influences

international capital flows and therefore international trade. In an open eco—

nomy without taxes, a steady state increase in inflation in the home country

would cause its nominal interest rate to rise by the increase in the rate of

inflation. Because of purchasing power parity, the value of its currency would

depreciate at that same rate relative to the currencies of all other countries.

A foreign lender who buys bonds of the home country would thus receive the same

rate of interest net of exchange loss as he had before the increase in infla-

tion. Inflation provides no incentive for international capital flows.

            To see one way in which taxes might     change the analysis, I will follow
Hartman    (1979) and consider an economy in which the only imperfection in the tax
system    is to include nominal    interest instead of real interest. With that tax
                                            114

rule,   the nominal interest rate in the home country     would rise not by the
increase   in the rate of inflation but by that rate divided by one minus the cor-

porate tax rate (di/dif =     i/(i—r)).    With a corporate tax rate of one—half, the

nominal interest rate would      rise by   twice the increase in inflation. Purchasing

power parity would still      imply that   in equilibrium the currency depreciated at

the rate of inflation. The rate of interest to the foreign lender who buys home

country bonds, net of currency depreciation, thus rises by the increase in the

rate of inflation.

            This is clearly not an equilibrium situation. Capital will flow into

the home country until the rate of interest net of currency depreciation is the

same there   as in the rest of the world. Capital flow achieves equilibrium
                                                                           the
by increasing the capital intensity in the home country (thus driving down
real rate of return) and lowering the capital intensity in the rest of the world

(thereby raising the real rate of return elsewhere). The equilibrium occurs

when the difference between the marginal products of capital at home and abroad

is equal to the rate of inflation.

             Although this is an oversimplified picture of taxes and international

capital    movements, it is   sufficient to show how taxes cause an inflationary

monetary   expansion to have    real   effects on the distribution of the world capital
stock   and therefore on capital flows      and trade patterns.
             Before   leaving the framework of the steady—state behavior of the eco-

nomy, I want to comment briefly on the implication of the fiscal framework for

the   theory of optimal inflation and the optimal quantity of money. Milton

Friedman (1969) pointed out that a negative rate of inflation equal to the real

rate of interest would make the nominal interest rate         zero and would thereby
reduce    the opportunity cost of holding money to its zero cost of supply. Any
                                       —15—


higher rate of inflation would in effect imply a tax on holding money balances

and would thereby move the econoxiw away from an efficient equilibrium.

           Friedman's negative rate of inflation would of course require a con-

tinuing decline in the money stock which would in turn require a continuing

surplus in the government budget. Friedman's condition would thus be optiuRl

only if there were a lump sum tax to produce the necessary revenue without

introducing any distortion. Phelps (1973) subsequently noted that without lump

sum taxes it would be optimal to have a higher rate of inflation since the net

money creation (or the reduced rate of decline of the money stock) would permit

a reduction in other distorting taxes.

           The optimal rate of inflation and the optimal quantity of money become

a more complex problem when we recognize that inflation distorts the taxation of

capital income. Because of the fiscal structure, a higher rate of inflation has

the advantage of producing tax revenue (if the effects of understated depre-

ciation and inventory costs outweigh the deduction of nominal interest income)

and of shifting portfolios from capital to money (thereby offsetting the usual

bias against holding non—interest—bearing money balances). At the same time, of

course, the interaction of inflation and the fiscal structure reduces the incen-

tive to save and distorts the allocation of capital among different uses. The

optimal steady state rate of inflation can only be established by a quantitative

evaluation of all these effects.


2. Tax Rules and Monetary Transition

           The   fiscal structure of an econonw affects not only the steady state
equilibrium associated with any    level   and rate of growth of the money   stock   but
also   influences the character of the transition from one steady rate of money
                                           —i6—


growth to another. Since the evolution of expectations about monetary policy

are a critical determinant of the transition process but are not central to

understanding the influence of tax rules, I will assume that expectations adjust

immediately to the new reality. To be specific, I will consider the case in

which the money stock has been growing at 10 percent a year for a long period of

time when the central bank announces that henceforth the money growth rate will

be only 1 percent. Everyone immediately and correctly adjusts his expected rate

of money   growth to 4 percent        indefinite future.
                                 for the

           Consider first what ou1d happen in an econon with no taxes. The 6
percentage point decline in the money growth rate implies a 6 percentage point

decline in the steady state inflation rate. Th keep the real interest rate

unchanged, the nominal interest rate must also decline by six percentage points.

This "superneutral" response to the decline in money growth is possible only if

the demand for money is completely insensitive to the interest rate. With any

interest   elasticity, the lower nominal interest rate causes an increase in the

demand for money. The increased money demand means a lower capital intensity

and a higher real rate of interest. As I noted earlier, however, the very small

size of the non—interest—bearing money stock relative to the capital stock makes

this Tobin—Mundell effect on capital intensity and on the equilibrium real

interest rate very small.

            Although the interest sensitivity of money demand has only a small

effect on steady state equilibrium, it can have a powerful effect on the tran-

sition process. To satisfy the increased demand for real money balances at the

lower nominal interest rate, the price level must decline immediately. Thus the

announcement of a lower rate of growth of money implies an equal decline in the
                                           —17—


nominal interest rate only if the price level can drop immediately by enough to

reduce the demand for nominal rroney balances to the available supply.

               In reality, prices are not conletely flexible downward and the price

level   does not fall fast enough to permit the real interest rate to remain
unchanged. Instead, the nominal interest rate must remain high to balance the
supply and demand for money. The result is a rise in the real rate of interest
and this high real rate induces a decline in economic activity. The lover level
of economic activity and the decline in inflation that it causes both reduce the
demand for nney but not by enough to permit an immediate return of the real

interest rate to its natural level. As long as the real interest rate is above

its natural rate, there will be slack in the economy and therefore downward

pressure on inflation and interest rates. The high real rate is thus eventually

self—correcting.

               The slow fall in the short—term rate keeps the long term rate above

its eventual equilibrium value even if expectations about declining inflation

are held with certainty. This high level of the long—term rate follows directly

from the fact that, in the absence of uncertainty, the long rate is an average

of the future short rates. Thus if the short rate is expected to decline from

13 percent to 7     percent   at the rate of one percent a year and then to remain at

7   percent,   a new 10—year bond will have a yield to maturity of 9     percent.
               The increase in real rates of interest during the transition period

implies   that a decline in the rate of nney growth        is far from neutral even in a

taxless   economy. The presence of a tax system complicates and exacerbates this
non—neutrality.
               As I emphasized earlier, because the tax system is not indexed, the

rate of money     growth affects the   real rate of   interest and the real after—tax
                                      —i8—


profitability of different activities. A change in the   rate of nxney   growth

therefore induces a shift of resources among different industries. In par-

ticular, because the interaction of taxes and inflation penalizes investment in

depreciable plant and equipment relative to investment in owner—occupied

housing, a permanent decrease in the rate of money growth induces a shift of

resources out of housing and into plant and equipment investment. Similarly,

because inflation reduces the after—tax yield on saving, a decrease in the rate

of money growth induces a shift from consumption to saving.

           Although the intersectoral shift of resources induced by a change in

money growth could in principle occur without any unemployment, the reduced

demand for the products of some sectors is likely to involve some unemployment

before the workers in those sectors find employment elsewhere. Unemployment

would arise naturally in this process if there is an advantage to devoting full

time to searching for a new job. The availability of unemployment benefits that

drastically reduce the opportunity cost of remaining   unemployed tends to raise
the   reservation wage of those who must change jobs and therefore to increase

significantly the duration of unemployment.1

           It is interesting to contrast this view of the way in which a reduc-

tion in the money growth rate causes unemployment with the theory developed many

years ago by Freidrich Hayek. Hayek also argued that a decline in inflation

would cause a downturn in economic activity because the lower rate of inflation

would cause some sectors to contract. More specifically, however, Hayek believed

that business investment would expand during an inflationary period because bank



   1See Feldstein and Poterba (1982) for a discussion of the effect of
unemployment insurance on reservation wages and the average duration of
unemployment.
                                     —19—


credit looked cheap and profits were artificially increased by the fact that

price increases temporarily exceeded wage increases. The essence of Hayek's

argument was therefore that inflation induced a misperception of investment

incentives which in turn led to a misallocation of capital. Reversing that

misallocation caused the unemployment that accompanied a reduction of inflation.

          With an unindexed tax system, a misallocation of capital can occur

during inflation without any misperception. The change in inflation changes

relative tax burdens and therefore induces a new allocation of capital. It is

interesting also to note that the misallocation of capital caused by the U.S.

inflation of the 1970s was opposite in direction to that predicted by Hayek so

that net investment in plant and equipment declined during the decade as a share

of GNP.

          The effect of the tax system on the econorxr's transition from a high

inflation rate to a low inflation rate is not just a function of its unindexed

character. Even a completely indexed tax system would affect the transition

process if the reduction in inflation caused some firms to experience a tem-

porary period of accounting losses. The high real interest rates, the depressed

level of economic activity, and the reallocation of activity that accompany a

reduction in the inflation rate all imply that some firms will have an unprofi-

table period.

          Under conventional tax rules, a firm's incentive to invest is sharply

reduced during any period in which it has no taxable profits. The reduced

incentive to invest reflects the fact that without taxable profits the firm can-

not take advantage of the investment tax credit or the relatively large depre-

ciation allowances that occur during the first few years of an investment's

life. The tax savings associated with the depreciation and investment tax cre—
                                           —20—


dit   must be carried forward to future years and are thereby reduced in value.
This    implies that the net cost of any investment is increased. In contrast, the

positive income from the investment will occur only in the future when the firm

expects to be fully taxable. breover, since interest payments during the early

years of the investment do not reduce concurrent tax liabilities, the effective

net interest rate is higher for a nontaxable firm than for a taxable firm.

            These distortions arise because the tax system is assymetric in its

treatment of gains and losses. If negative tax liabilities were rebated con-

currently or could be      carried   forward with an appropriate rate of interest, this

problem would not arise. it          existing   tax law1 increases the cyclical sen-

sitivity    of   investment and makes the impact of monetary policy quite non—neutral

among    firms   and industries.


3. The Determination of Monetary Policy

             Several years ago, I argued        that   monetary policy   in   the 1960s and

1970s had been too expansionary because the monetary authorities failed to

recognize the interaction between inflation and the tax system.                  The monetary

authorities focused on the interest rate and worried that what they perceived as

a high interest rate 'was     discouraging      investment and depressing economic acti-

vity.     In fact, although the nominal interest rate was          rising     during this

period, the real interest rate showed no trend and the real net—of—tax interest

rate has fallen substantially. The low real net rate of interest increased



   'The problem is substantially ameliorated by the "safe harbor leasing rulest'
enacted in 1981 but these are now (July 1982) effectively in abeyance and their
future is uncertain.

      2The argument is summarized in Feldstein (1980).
                                      —21—



consumption and investment in housing by ure than enough to offset the
depressing effect of inflation on investment in plant and equipment.

         Since 1979 the Fed has been following a imich sore xronetarist approach

in determining its monetrary policy. The gradual deceleration of the soney

growth rate has become the overriding target of monetary policy. Since interest

rates are no longer a fundamental target, the previous mistakes    in interpreting
the interest rate are no longer relevant.

         The future evolution of monetary policy is of'    course less   clear. The

future Governors of the Federal Reserve may   be   less manetarist in their behavior

and may revert to targeting interest rates or nominal GNP or some weighted func-

tion of inflation, unemployment, and other measures of economic performance.

If this happens, how will the fiscal framework influence the future choice of

monetary policy?

          It is of course possible that the monetary authorities will continue

to ignore the fiscal effects of monetary policy and might therefore choose poli-

cies that do not achieve their intended results. I want however to examine the

implications of assuming to the contrary that the monetary authorities do

understand the fiscal consequences of alternative monetary policies and take

them into account in their choice of monetary policy. How then might alter-

native fiscal frameworks affect the choices made by the Fed or urged upon it by

the Congress or the administration?

          With the tax laws that prevailed in the 1970's, a one—time increase in

the money stock caused a one—time increase in tax revenue as taxpayers were

pushed into higher tax brackets. A sustained increase in the growth rate of the

money stock increased tax revenue continually and, by raising the rate of infla-

tion, discouraged investment in plant and equipment. A government eager to
                                        —22—


increase tax revenue in order to eliminate a deficit or to finance increased

government spending might therefore encourage an inflationary monetary policy.

The enthusiasm for raising revenue in this way would however be tempered and

perhaps reversed by recognizing that inflation reduced business investment and

therefore the growth of productivity.

           The 1981 tax legislation changed both of these fiscal effects.

Starting in January 1985, the personal income tax is to be indexed: each year

the bracket limits and other nominal amounts in the tax law will be increased in

proportion to the recent rise in the price level. Inflation will therefore no

longer push people into higher tax brackets and increase real tax revenue. The

1981 legislation also provides for a much rrxre rapid tax depreciation of plant

and equipment. All equipment is now written off over at most five years and

with an accelerated schedule equivalent to 150 percent of the five—year

declining balance rate. The rapid tax depreciation increases the after—tax

return to investment at arw inflation rate. Tbreover, since depreciation is so

rapid, an increase in the rate of inflation reduces the real value of the depre-

ciation allowance by much less than it did under the old tax rules when much of

the equipment was depreciated over 15 years or more. Indeed, companies with

moderately high ratios of debt to capital are likely to find that a rise in the

rate of inflation actually increases the incentive to invest.

           How does the 1981 tax legislation alter the likely course of monetary

policy? First, indexing the personal tax brackets removes any incentive to use

one—time increases in the money stock as a rmthod of raising revenue through

bracket   creep. Second, since both the "favorable" revenue effect and the
adverse investment effect of a sustained monetary expansion are eliminated, the
effect on the incentive to pursue an inflationary monetary policy is   ambiguous.
                                     —23—



A pessimist might well worry, however, that virtually eliminating one of the

major adverse effects of inflation may cause future governments and Federal

Reserve Boards to pursue a more inflationary nnetary policy.

          Future changes in tax rules may make an inflationary monetary policy

seem either nre or less appealing. One such change is now under active con-

sideration in the Congress. The very large deficits projected for the next

several years have induced Congress and the administration to consider alter-

native ways of increasing tax revenue. One proposal is to repeal the indexing

of the personal income tax before it takes effect in 1985. An unindexed tax

system would provide a clear incentive to reduce the projected budget deficits

by increasing the rate of inflation rather than by the politically painful pro-

cess of reducing government spending or increasing tax rates explicitly. The

knowledge that the inflation will not decrease investment and may actually

encourage it would reinforce this temptation to use an expansionary rronetary

policy.


.   Concluding Remarks
          My aim in today's lecture has not been to propose or defend any par-

ticular theory about the effect of monetary policy on the economy. Instead, rrrj

purpose has been the more general one of encouraging macroeconomists and mone-

tary theorists to devote attention to the way that the fiscal framework affects

the impact of monetary policy.

          The traditional distinction between the specialities of public econo-

mics and macroeconomics is undoubtedly a useful one for advancing research in

both fields. But the growing role of the public sector and of taxes in par—

ticular cannot be ignored in analyzing macroeconomic behavior.
            I hope that my remarks today will encourage some of those who hear

them or read them later to turn their own attention to this important subject.
