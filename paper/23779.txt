The Effects of Marijuana Liberalizations: Evidence from Monitoring the Future

                                         ABSTRACT

By the end of 2016, 28 states had liberalized their marijuana laws: by decriminalizing possession,
by legalizing for medical purposes, or by legalizing more broadly. More states are considering
such policy changes even while supporters and opponents continue to debate their impacts. Yet
evidence on these liberalizations remains scarce, in part due to data limitations.

We use data from Monitoring the Future’s annual surveys of high school seniors to evaluate the
impact of marijuana liberalizations on marijuana use, other substance use, alcohol consumption,
attitudes surrounding substance use, youth health outcomes, crime rates, and traffic accidents.
These data have several advantages over those used in prior analyses.

We find that marijuana liberalizations have had minimal impact on the examined outcomes.
Notably, many of the outcomes predicted by critics of liberalizations, such as increases in youth
drug use and youth criminal behavior, have failed to materialize in the wake of marijuana
liberalizations.

I. Introduction

        Since the 1970s, more than 28 states have liberalized their laws toward marijuana

possession, production, and sale. In the 1970s, 11 states decriminalized possession of

small amounts, and since 2002, 10 more have decriminalized. Since 1996, 24 states have

legalized marijuana for medical purposes, and since 2012, 8 states have legalized more

fully.1 All these policy changes reflect state laws; marijuana remains illegal under federal

law. Since much drug law enforcement is state or local, however, these state-level policy

changes potentially affect marijuana use and related outcomes.2

        Supporters and opponents make strong claims about these marijuana

liberalizations. Advocates believe that liberalizations reduce crime, raise tax revenue,

lower expenditure on criminal justice enforcement, enhance traffic safety, improve public

health, and stimulate the economy. Critics argue that liberalizations increase crime, raise

criminal justice expenditure, spur youth marijuana use, reduce teen educational

performance, undermine public health, and diminish traffic safety.3


1
  The District of Columbia also “legalized” in 2015, but their legalization fell far short of
permitting retail trade. Our analysis does not include the District.
2
  We refer to the new marijuana polices in Colorado and Washington State as marijuana
legalization, even though a more accurate description would be re-legalization. See discussion
below under background and history.
3
  The debate in Colorado, for example, included claims from opponents that legalizing marijuana
would increase youth drug use (Ferner 2012, Walters, 2014); violent crime (Meese and Stimson,
2014; Healey, 2014); and addiction and traffic accidents (Sabet, 2014). On the other hand,
advocates have asserted that marijuana legalization will reduce consumption of alcohol and other,
more dangerous drugs, help end mass incarceration, diminish black market trade, and undermine
illicit criminal organizations (Nadelman 2014; Osterman 2013). In addition, proponents believe
that a surge in crime would be unlikely because, over the past decade or so, marijuana has already
become somewhat accessible to the public in certain states, so any potential impact on crime
should have already taken place. Other prominent politicians support marijuana legalization and/or
decriminalization because they see growing evidence that the drug does not in fact lead to the
deleterious outcomes with which it is often associated. Nevada Senator Harry Reid, for instance,
recently commented, “If you'd asked me this question a dozen years ago, it would have been easy
to answer — I would have said no, because [marijuana] leads to other stuff. But I can't say that
anymore” (Demirjian, 2014).


                                              –2–
       Existing evidence on medical marijuana laws is somewhat mixed. Sabia et al.

(2017) estimate declines in body weight post medical marijuana laws using data from the

Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Using the National Survey on Drug

Use and Health (NSDUH), Williams et al. (2017) also find no increase in adolescent

marijuana use from medical marijuana laws. Smart (2015) also uses NSDUH and finds

that states with larger increases in registered medical marijuana users experience increased

adolescent marijuana use, traffic fatalities, and alcohol poisoning. Anderson and Rees

(2014) and Anderson, Hansen, and Rees (2015) suggest little effect of medical marijuana

laws on adolescent marijuana use and related outcomes. MacCoun et al (2009), Anderson

et al (2013, 2015), and Hall and Lynskey (2016) also review much of this literature. The

existing evidence on decriminalizations is thin and suggests little effect on consumers.

MacCoun et al. (2009) also review the decriminalization literature. They argue that one

reason for the lack of response is that consumers do not realize that the penalties have

changed.

       We add to this literature by examining the effects of state marijuana liberalizations

on marijuana use and related outcomes utilizing a different data source: Monitoring the

Future’s annual surveys of high school students (hereafter MTF). This dataset has several

attractive features. The sample begins in 1977, so we can examine both early and recent

liberalizations. MTF tracks a broad range of outcomes including substance use, crime,

health, behavior, and attitudes. MTF is widely cited and highly regarded in the public

health community. MTF samples high school students, a group of particular concern when

it comes to marijuana consumption. MTF data do have their own limitations: MTF




                                           –3–
surveys only youths in public and private high schools; the data are self-reports; and

students or their parents can opt out, possibly creating selection bias.

         Previous work typically relies on the NSDUH or YRBS/BRFSS. The NSDUH

captures some information on marijuana use, but though the survey is conducted annually,

state-level data are only reported as two year averages. Data from the Youth Risk Behavior

Survey (YRBS) are collected every two years; moreover, key states such as Washington

and Oregon do not currently participate.4 Some states conduct their own surveys, but these

tend to be sporadic and use differing methodologies.

         We consider a variety of outcomes potentially affected by state marijuana

liberalizations: marijuana and other substance use, perceived riskiness and disapproval of

drug and alcohol use, health outcomes, criminal behavior, and driving under the influence.

Our study relies on restricted-use data that sample high school seniors from 1977 to 2015.

The length of the sample includes variation in marijuana laws from early decriminalization

laws, medical marijuana laws, and some recreational marijuana laws.

         Our results suggest that marijuana liberalizations have had little or no impact on

teen marijuana use and related outcomes. Generally, marijuana liberalizations have been

associated with outcomes that most observers would regard as beneficial, such as reduced

marijuana, alcohol, and other drug use;                 reduced desirability of consuming these

substances;, and reduced access to these substances on school property. We emphasize,

however, that virtually all our estimated impacts are small and statistically insignificant,

so the first-order description of our results is, “no effect.”

  Both states, however, participated in the late 1990s in years surrounding their passage of medical marijuana
laws. See, for example, the analysis in Anderson, Hansen, and Rees (2015)


                                                   –4–
II. Background on Marijuana’s Legal Status in the United States

       The first anti-marijuana laws in the United States date from 1911, when

Massuachusetts banned marijuana, followed in 1913 by California, Maine, Wyoming, and

Indiana. 5   Other states followed suit over the next two decades; by 1933, 27 had

criminalized marijuana.6 The main factors generating these new laws seem to have been

anti-Mexican sentiment (whipped up by popular notions that marijuana was a social ill

brought by Mexican laborers) and fear that marijuana would engender criminal or even

murderous tendencies in its users.

       At the federal level, marijuana was legal in the United States until 1937, when

Congress passed the Marijuana Tax Act, effectively criminalizing marijuana and

prohibiting its possession or sale under federal law. Only those who paid a hefty excise

tax were permitted to use marijuana for medical and industrial uses. In the 1950s, a series

of federal laws, including the Boggs Act of 1952 and the Narcotics Control Act of 1956,

strengthened penalties against marijuana use and imposed mandatory jail sentences for

drug-related offenses.

       Attitudes began to change in the late 1960s; in 1970 Congress repealed most

mandatory penalties for drug-related offenses, based on the view that mandatory

minimums had done little to curb drug use (Schlosser 1994). The 1972 Shafer

Commission, appointed by President Nixon and operating under the National Commission

 The states were Utah (1915), Vermont (1915), Wyoming (1915), Texas (1919 or 1931), Colorado

on Marijuana and Drug Abuse, advised Congress to reduce penalties for marijuana use

and possession and to seek alternative methods to discourage heavy drug use (Smith

2014).

         The release of the report marks the beginning of three waves of marijuana

liberalizations. In 1973 Oregon became the first state to decriminalize marijuana. Under

decriminalization, possession of small amounts carries no criminal record or prison time

and is instead treated more like a traffic fine, even though production and distribution are

still illegal. Colorado, Alaska, Ohio, and California followed suit in 1975 (Smith 2014),

and by the end of the 1970s, ten states had decriminalized. More recently, Connecticut

(2011), Delaware (2015), Illinois (2016), Maine (2009), Massachusetts (2008), Nevada

(2002), Oregon (1995), Rhode Island (2012), and Vermont (2013) decriminalized,

bringing the total to 21 as of this writing.

         By the end of the 1970s, it seemed that decriminalization and perhaps legalization

might sweep the country, but various events such as the arrival of crack cocaine and the

election of Ronald Reagan led to a new drug war. First Lady Nancy Reagan’s famous “Just

Say No” campaign aimed to expose the perils of youth drug use and helped maintain a

negative public perception of marijuana. National approval of marijuana legalization, as

measured by annual Gallup surveys, rose from 12% to 28% between 1969 and 1977 but

then fell and hovered around 23% during the next decade. Few major changes in state

marijuana policies occurred between 1982 and 1995. National drug policy with respect to

other substances saw increased strictness and enforcement. In passing the Anti-Drug

Abuse Act of 1986, Congress established harsh mandatory minimum sentences for drug




                                               –6–
trafficking; two years later, it mandated five-year minimum sentences for first-time

possession of five grams of crack cocaine.

        The second wave of liberalizations began in 1996, when California legalized

marijuana for medical purposes. As of March 2017, twenty-eight states and the District

of Columbia permit medical marijuana, though the scope of these laws varies widely

across states. Oregon, for example, allows patients to possess up to 24 ounces of usable

medicinal marijuana in addition to 24 plants. Montana, on the other hand, permits

possession of just one ounce of medical marijuana and four plants. 7 Similarly, the

conditions for which physicians can legally prescribe marijuana vary widely. California,

for example, allows “the use of marijuana in the treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS,

chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine or any other illness for which

marijuana provides relief,” resulting in its recommendation for hundreds of indications;

New Hampshire allows medical marijuana if the patient has both “(a) a chronic or terminal

disease; and (b) symptoms or treatment results that include at least one of the following:

cachexia or wasting syndrome, severe pain that has not responded to previously prescribed

medication or surgical measures for more than 3 months; severe nausea, severe vomiting,

seizures, or severe, persistent muscle spasms.” Many medicalization states have rules in

between these extremes.8

describes differences across states’ medical marijuana laws. In their sample, they find that fourteen
of the twenty-four states enroll almost all medical marijuana participants. Less regulated states
enroll more medical marijuana users.


                                               –7–
       The third wave of marijuana liberalizations began in 2012 and consists of the eight

state legalizations for recreational use. Colorado and Washington legalized in November,

2012, with retail stores opening in January 2014 in Colorado and July 2014 in Washington.

Alaska and Oregon legalized in November 2014; retail stores opened in Oregon on

October 1, 2015 but have not yet opened in Alaska. California, Nevada, Massachusetts,

and Maine legalized in November 2016, but licensed retailers have yet to open.9

       Table 1 summarizes these laws. Considerable variation exists within each category

(as noted above regarding medical marijuana laws). Even across states with similar laws,

moreover, enforcement can differ. We take no account of enforcement differences in our

empirical analysis below, mainly because measurement is problematic.

       Despite the substantial liberalization of state marijuana laws over the past several

decades, federal marijuana prohibition continues. In some periods, moreover, federal

authorities have pushed back against state marijuana liberalizations. Attorney General

Eric Holder, for example, stated in 2009 that the Justice Department would stop raiding

medical marijuana dispensaries;10 but by 2012 the Justice Department had raided more

than 100.11

        Over the past four years, however, federal authorities have taken minimal action

against state legalizations. In August 2013, Attorney General Eric Holder informed the

governors of Colorado and Washington that the Department of Justice would permit them

to implement their legalization ballot initiatives (Reilly, 2013). According to Holder, the

Department of Justice reserved the right to file a preemption lawsuit at a later date (Reilly,

2013). In the same month, Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memo to U.S.

attorneys across the country. The memo established eight top priorities for federal

prosecutors enforcing marijuana laws (Cole, 2013).12 Beyond these priorities, prosecution

for marijuana offenses would left mostly to state authorities. Whether this will continue

under the Trump administration is unclear. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has signaled a

desire for the Justice Department to resume crackdowns on the sale and use of recreational

marijuana, even in states that have fully legalized, setting up a possible showdown

between the federal government and state authorities.

        The legal status of medical marijuana is similar. At the federal level, marijuana

remains a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act (National Conference

of State Legislatures, 2015). This means that marijuana has no accepted medical use under

federal law, and its distribution is a federal offense. However, federal enforcement has

been relatively weak.

12
   Cole declared that the Department of Justice would focus on preventing: the distribution of
marijuana to minors; marijuana revenue going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels; the
transportation or diversions of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law to other
states; state-authorized marijuana activity being used as a “cover up” for the trafficking of other
illegal drugs or illegal activity; violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution
of marijuana; drugged driving and adverse effects on public health; the cultivation of marijuana
on public lands; and the possession or use of marijuana on federal property (Cole, 2013).



                                                –9–
           In October 2009, the Obama administration encouraged federal prosecutors not to

prosecute medical marijuana offenses as long as those violations complied with state law

(National Conference of State Legislatures, 2015). In December 2014 Congress quietly

and surprisingly codified this rule, effectively lifting America’s decades-long prohibition

on medical marijuana. Tucked deep inside a 1,600-page last minute federal spending

measure, this provision prohibited federal drug agents from raiding medical marijuana

retail operations in states where medical marijuana was legal (Halper, 2014). This

Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment was renewed on May 5, 2017 with the Rohrabacher-

Blumenauer Amendment. 13 It remains unclear whether the Trump administration will

change this stance; Attorney General Jeff Sessions declared in his Senate confirmation

hearing that he recognized the medicinal benefits of marijuana and did not wish to interfere

in states where it can be medically prescribed.14



III. Data and Estimation

           We analyze individual level data on high school seniors using a restricted-use data

set provided by Monitoring the Future. The data cover the period 1977-2015 and the full

sample includes 10,000 to 16,000 observations per year. MTF uses a multi-stage random

sampling procedure, first sampling particular geographic areas, then selecting one or more

schools in each area, then sampling classes within each school. The sampling procedure

is designed to provide a nationally representative sample; the survey is administered in

120 to 146 public and private high schools. Our estimation method accounts for this

multistage design by incorporating the strata and clustering variables provided by MTF.

           The sample includes the 48 coterminous states, excluding the District of Columbia.

Of the survey states adopting recreational marijuana, Washington appears in the sample

every year, Colorado appears in all except 2014, and Oregon appears in all years except

1995-2001 and 2011-2014. The states lending variation to estimating the effects of

recreational marijuana are primarily Washington and Colorado.                       Not every state is

represented in each year. Populous states are represented every year: California, Florida,

Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,

Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. Less populous states are represented less

often. Of the 39 sample years, some states appear in ten or fewer years: Delaware (9),

Montana (5), Nevada (7), New Hampshire (7), North Dakota (9), and South Dakota (8).

The MTF samples up to about 350 twelfth graders in each school.15 Schools participate

for two consecutive years with half the sampled schools replaced in any given year. In

states with representation, we observe, on average 332 students; a state’s sampled students

plausibly all attend the same school.

           Table 1 indicates the policy variation available in our sample. 16 Students are

randomly assigned to complete one of six possible forms. Some variables are available on

all forms; we focus on these because they include the main variables on substance use.

Other variables are available on a more limited number of forms, reducing the sample size.

Given the limited variation in recreational marijuana laws, these form-specific questions

may limit the power of our estimates.

           One concern about MTF data, as with other surveys, is that respondents may

underreport their smoking, drinking, and substance use even though the poll is


15
     http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/pubs/monographs/mtf-vol2_2014.pdf.
16
     Privacy concerns with the data sample prohibit state-specific plots of data.

anonymous. The survey is administered in the classroom, by University of Michigan staff

members, on paper forms in the spring of each year. Surveys are anonymous, with twelfth

graders’ names and addresses collected separately from the survey forms to allow

surveyers to administer follow-up surveys in later years.17

          We note that most individuals in MTF’s sample are too young for legal marijuana

laws to apply directly, since every state with legalized recreational marijuana requires that

consumers be at least 21. Even decriminalization laws generally apply only to those 21

and over. 18 High school students might nevertheless rely on older friends, siblings, or

parents to purchase legal marijuana, or they might access it via underground channels or

by obtaining fake IDs. In many states, laws against youth marijuana use are poorly

enforced, so the risk of being disciplined remains low. Thus, even though recreational

marijuana laws are not directly relevant for most high school seniors, liberalizations might

still impact their consumption and behavior in meaningful ways. In addition, many

concerns about marijuana liberalizations focus especially on youth access and

consumption.

          To examine the impacts of state marijuana liberalizations, we estimate equations

of the form

              𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑖𝑠𝑡 = 𝛽𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑗𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑎 𝑙𝑎𝑤𝑠𝑡 + 𝑋 ′ 𝛿 + 𝜃𝑠 + 𝜏𝑡 + 𝜑𝑠 𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑠𝑡

where outcomeist is an outcome such as marijuana use for individual i, living in state s, in

year t. We denote marijuana laws in three ways. First, we include two variables: one

indicating whether the state has decriminalized marijuana and one indicating whether the



17
     http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/pubs/monographs/mtf-overview2015.pdf
18
  Medical marijuana laws are an exception. Generally speaking, patients with a doctor’s prescription need
not be 21 to legally procure medicinal marijuana.


                                                – 12 –
state has either adopted a medical marijuana law or legalized recreational use. This

specification is driven by our data use agreement with Monitoring the Future, which

precludes estimating the effect of recreational laws separate from the other legal changes

until a larger number of states have adopted recreational marijuana laws. All states

adopting recreational marijuana laws had adopted medical marijuana laws first. In our

second specification, we include a binary variable indicating whether the state has passed

any form of marijuana liberalization law (decriminalization, medicalization, full

legalization, or any combination thereof). In our third specification, we include variables

indicating how many such laws the state has enacted. Significant heterogeneity exists

within these legal classifications; marijuana policy resembles a spectrum more than a set

of rigid categories.19 By grouping laws under a common label, we treat marijuana policies

in a given classification as equivalent despite differences in the leniency and inclusiveness

of state laws.

        The vector X includes individual respondent characteristics and state-level, time-

varying characteristics. We include state fixed effects, s; year dummies, t and state-

specific linear trends, st. The errors, ist, account for the multi-level sampling structure of

the MTF survey data.

        The outcomes we consider are measures of marijuana and other substance use,

disapproval of substance use, perceived riskiness of substance use, self-reported health

behaviors, self-reported driving under the influence, and self-reported criminal activity.




19
  Mississippi, Nebraska, and New York, for example, have all formally decriminalized marijuana,
but residents in each of those states are authorized to possess different amounts of marijuana and
face different punishments for consuming the drug. In short, though any two states may be coded
similarly, there are nuances among states.


                                             – 13 –
       The individual-level controls are respondent’s race, sex, whether over or under 18,

urbanicity of their residence, and socioeconomic background. The state-level measures

are the percentage of the population age 14 and under, age 25 to 54, age 55 and over,

white, and black. We include indicators for whether the state has the death penalty, a shall-

issue gun law, a zero tolerance law, graduated drivers’ licensing and whether the state

lowered its maximum legal blood alcohol content to 0.08. We also include real per capita

personal income, the minimum legal drinking age, and the real state beer tax.




IV. Results

       Tables 2 through 16 present our main results, displaying the estimated impact of

marijuana liberalizations on marijuana and other substance use, driving under the

influence, healthy behaviors, driving safety, the ease of obtaining various substances,

illness and perceived self-esteem, friends’ substance use, friends’ disapproval of substance

use or DUI, self-reported criminal behavior, perceived riskiness of substance use, and

disapproval of substance use.

       For every outcome we examine, the estimated coefficients on marijuana

liberalizations tend to be small and statistically insignificant, with few consistent patterns

of positive or negative effects. We examine 132 outcomes. Bear in mind that, with this

many outcomes, we would expect roughly 13 of the coefficients to be statistically

significant at the 10 percent level, even if the true effect is zero. We estimate that

medicalization and legalization statistically significantly improved 8 outcomes and



                                           – 14 –
worsened 9 outcomes; decriminalization statistically significantly improved 20 outcomes

and worsened 4 outcomes.20

         We comment briefly on a few specific results.

         Marijuana liberalizations appear, if anything, to have reduced the use of cocaine

and heroin. They do not appear to have significantly impacted the consumption of

marijuana itself, even if liberalization may have made marijuana easier to obtain in some

places. Marijuana liberalization seems to have slightly increased ease of obtaining

psychedelics, amphetamines, and sedatives and barbituates. Liberalization, particularly

decriminalizatioin, if anything, has increased the perceived riskiness of crack cocaine, the

hallucinogen salvia, and narcotics; however, liberalization policies have had no consistent

or significant effect on the perceived riskiness of marijuana or other drugs.

         Marijuana decriminalization has tended to increase friends’ perceived disapproval

of substance use, particularly with regards to heavy alcohol consumption and occasional

or regular marijuana use. Decriminalization is also associated with lower self-reported

disapproval of crack cocaine and higher disapproval of heavy alcohol consumption.

         Liberalizations appear, if anything, to improve traffic safety, though the share of

accidents involving marijuana or hashish does not change significantly following

medicalization/legalization or decriminalization. Decriminalization seems to reduce days

of illness. Medicalization/legalization shows some association with increased petty crimes

such as shoplifting; decriminalization may have reduced adolescent fighting at school or




20
  For ease of exposition, we label as “improved” the outcomes that most policy discussions would regard
as desirable, such as decreased drug use, setting aside discussion of whether policy should attempt to reduce
drug use.


                                                  – 15 –
work. Otherwise, liberalizations have had little impact on self-reported criminal or healthy

behaviors.

         Estimates using either an indicator for whether a state has any liberalization or a

count of the number of liberalizations paint a similar picture. Under a null hypothesis or

“no effect”, we observe slightly more than the expected number of improvements post-

liberalizations and slightly fewer than the expected number of declines. These results are

presented in the Appendix.21



V. Discussion

         As multiple states have legalized the possession and sale of marijuana for medical

and/or recreational purposes, the debate over the merits and pitfalls of legalization has

witnessed strong claims from both supporters and opponents. Results in the existing

academic literature remaind mixed. We add to this literature with the use of a difference

data set, Monitoring the Future’s surveys of high school seniors, and the examination of a

wide variety of outcomes. Our analysis provides little support for either side’s claims,

especially for the views that liberalizations generate substantial increases in youth

marijuana or other alcohol and drug use, or in outcomes potentially related to use.

         While we provide no evidence here for why the policy changes have not had more

substantial impacts, we speculate briefly on the underlying explanation. The most obvious

hypothesis is that, despite substantial resources devoted to enforcement, marijuana laws

exert only minor impact on use, so removal of these laws merely ratifies de jure what is


21
  We estimate the full set of tables using indicators for medicalization and for decriminalization for only
the years prior to the first recreational marijuana law in 2013. These results are similar to the ones presented
here. We find that medical marijuana laws and decriminalization laws had little or no effect on a wide variety
of adolescent outcomes.


                                                    – 16 –
already true de facto.      This is particularly likely if adoption of liberalizations is

endogenous, so that states where enforcement is waning are also states that liberalize these

laws.

        Under this interpretation, our results do not imply that marijuana prohibition can

never have a substantial impact on marijuana use and related outcomes; perhaps vigorous

enforcement would have larger effects. Our results do suggest that, given current attitudes

and enforcement toward marijuana, further liberalizations seems unlikely to have dramatic

affects in any direction.

whole days of school have you missed because of illness?" Columns (2) analyzes the sum of the number of days the
respondent reported having each of 14 symptoms in the last 30 days. The fourteen illnesses asked about are: headache,
sore throat, sinus congestion, coughing, chest colds, coughing up phlegm or blood, shortness of breath, wheezing or
gasping, trouble remembering things, difficulty thinking or concentrating, trouble learning new things, trouble
sleeping, trouble getting started in the morning, stayed home most or all of a day because you were not feeling well.
Column (3) uses the first principal component of the 14 symptom questions. Column (4) uses the first principal
component of 8 questions relating to self-esteem.

days; 6=10 or more days. Variables are recoded to the midpoint of the category to generate a continuous
variable. The two principal components variables use all of the variables in these two tables on self-reported
criminal behavior.

weeks, how many whole days of school have you missed because of illness?" Columns (2) analyzes the sum of the number of days the
respondent reported having each of 14 symptoms in the last 30 days. The fourteen illnesses asked about are: headache, sore throat, sinus
congestion, coughing, chest colds, coughing up phlegm or blood, shortness of breath, wheezing or gasping, trouble remembering things,
difficulty thinking or concentrating, trouble learning new things, trouble sleeping, trouble getting started in the morning, stayed home most or all
of a day because you were not feeling well. Column (3) uses the first principal component of the 14 symptom questions. Column (4) uses the
first principal component of 8 questions relating to self-esteem.

Regressions include year dummies, state fixed effects, and state-specific linear trends. All regressions also include the
percent aged 14 and under, the percent aged 25-54, the percent aged 55 and over, the percent white, the percent black;
indicators for whether the state has the death penalty, shall issue gun law, BAC legal limit of 0.08, zero tolerance law,
graduate driver's licensing; real per capita personal income, and the real state beer tax. Standard errors account for the
survey sampling strategy. Most questions have five possible answers: 1=Not at all; 2=Once; 3=Twice; 4=3 or 4 times; 5=5
or more times. The responses for the carrying a weapon to school question differ slightly: 1=None; 2=one day; 3=two
days; 4=3-5 days; 5=6-9 days; 6=10 or more days. Variables are recoded to the midpoint of the category, when applicable,
to generate a continuous variable. The two principal components variables use all of the variables in these two tables on
self-reported criminal behavior.
