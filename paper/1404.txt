                       An Empirical Evaluation of the
                Disequilibrium Real Wage Rate Hypothesis 1

                                  Summary

     The rise in the share of labor costs in value added and in the

unemployment rate in many industrial countries during the 1970s and

early 1980s has led many observers to conclude that real wages are now

too high and a source of "classical" unemployment. These conclusions

are not necessarily valid The increase in the labor share could be

warranted by long—run changes in production techniques, in the price of

energy, or in the relative availability of labor and capital. Moreover,

the observed unemployment could be structural or Keynesian, rather than

classical. In this paper, a production function approach is used to

examine these possibilities and to subject the disequilibrium real wage

hypothesis to a more rigorous empirical test than has been conducted in

the past. Both the capital stock and the exchange rate are taken as

given and the study focuses only on the manufacturing sector.

     The results indicate that for France, the Federal Republic of

Germany, and the United Kingdom, there are indeed strong reasons to

believe that real wages in the manufacturing sector are now too high, in

the sense of being incompatible with "high employment.' In particular,

the study did not find any evidence that a large part of the actual

increase in the share of labor costs in value added was warranted by

long—run changes in production techniques, in the price of energy, or

in the relative availability of labor and capital. On the other hand,
                                  —2—

f or Canada and the United States, the results indicate that there is no

real wage problem for the manufacturing sector as a whole, although there

may of course be a problem in specific industries.   For Japan and Italy,

the conclusions have to be more nuanced. For Japan, the results indicate

that the large increase in the share of labor costs in value added is not

fully warranted by concomitant changes in the factors considered in the

study. At the same time, the initial labor share was so small that this

increase may be less of a problem than in France, the Federal Republic

of Germany, and the United Kingdom. For Italy, the results suggest that

there is no real wage problem, but poor data prevent a firm conclusion in

this regard.

                            I. Introduction

     The present paper examines the validity of the hypothesis that the

level of the real wage rate, inclusive of employers' expenditures for

social insurance and employment or payroll taxes, is a major obstacle to

a return to "high employment" in industrial countries. 2 It does this

by estimating a production function, solving it for the real wage rate

that would be consistent with the high—employment level of labor input

given the existing capital stock, and comparing this "warranted" wage

to the actual real wage. This exercise is carried out for the manu-

facturing sector of the seven largest industrial countries (the United

States, Canada, Japan, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy,

and the United Kingdom). In each country, the estimate of the high—

employment level of labor input makes due allowance for regional and
                                  —3—

skill mismatches between labor supply and demand. As a by—product, the

study casts some light on the relative contribution of low capital

formation and high energy prices to the decline in the growth of labor

productivity during the 1970s and early 1980s.

     The disequilibrium real wage rate hypothesis is largely based on the

observation that, at least in manufacturing, the real wage rate defined

from the employer's standpoint——that is, the nominal wage rate deflated

by the value added deflator rather than the consumer price index——has

tended to grow faster than labor productivity during the past decade and

a half, leading to a rise in the share of labor costs in value added and

a corresponding decline in the capital share. 3 (See Table 1.) However,

while suggestive, this development can hardly be viewed as a proof that

the real wage rate is now too high. It could be that the increase in the

labor share was warranted by long—run changes in production techniques,

in the price of energy, or in the relative availability of labor and

capital. The production function approach allows us to examine these

possibilities and to subject the hypothesis to a more rigorous test. 4

     The purview of the paper is limited in three respects. First, only

the manufacturing sector is considered. Obviously, conditions in that

sector are not necessarily indicative of conditions in other sectors.

Furthermore, the narrow focus on only one sector leads to a number of

conceptual problems. For example, it is difficult to define precisely

the high—employment level of labor input for the manufacturing sector.

Second, the capital stock is viewed as an exogenous variable and no

 attempt is made to explain investment. It is possible that a disequi—

 librium real wage rate reduces investment, which would in turn reduce the

growth of the warranted real wage rate.   The result could be a vicious

circle with higher and higher unemployment. In the absence of an expla-

nation of investment, these dynamic considerations are outside the scope

of the present paper. 5 Third, prices in the goods markets, including

prices of manufactures, intermediate inputs used in the manufacturing

sector, and consumer goods, are also viewed as exogenous variables.

This last assumption implies that the exchange rate is taken as given,

a point to which we return in the concluding section.

     Section II of the paper describes the theoretical framework that is

used in the empirical investigation. Section III discusses the empirical

results. Some concluding remarks are presented in Section IV.

                      II. The Theoretical Framework

     In the first part of this section, a simple production model is used

to clarify the main issues under consideration. Then two more complex

models are derived to provide a realistic framework for the empirical

analysis. Model A is limited to two factors of production, labor and

capital, while Model B views energy as a complement to capital. Finally,

the major difficulties inherent in the measurement of the actual flows

of labor and capital services, as well as in the measurement of the

high—employment flow of labor services, are considered.

1.   A simple model

     The main production characteristics of a large and diversified

manufacturing sector can be represented by the following aggregate CES
                                        —6—


(Constant Elasticity of Substitution) production function with constant

returns to scale:

(1)            y =   y eAt [(1 -    )L    +

where          Y =   net   output (real value—added)
                t   = time trend for disembodied productivity change
               L =    flow   of labor services
               K =    flow   of capital services.

        This specification assumes that the marginal rate of substitution

between labor and capital is effectively independent of the amount of

raw materials (N) and energy (E) being used, that is, it assumes that a

change in the price of N or E does not call for a change in K/L. Under

such conditions, N and E are said to be "weakly separable' from K and L,

and one can study the relation between K, L, and the value—added Y with-

out taking account of N and E. (See Leontieff (1947).)

        Aside from the weak separability assumption, function (1) is fairly

general. In particular, it allows the elasticity of substitution between

labor and capital (n, rj =       1/(1 + )) to   take any value except for the

exact value of one for which the function is not defined. The function

approaches the Cobb—Douglas function as             approaches zero. It does

assume that technology is the "putty—putty" type with the same possi—

bility to choose among different ratios of labor to capital services at

the time of purchase of equipment and throughout the working life of the

 equipment, rather than the "putty—clay" type with the choice becoming

more limited after purchase. However, this assumption does not seem to

 do too much violence to the facts. Even after purchase, there is often
                                  —7--


considerable room for variations in the ratio of labor to capital ser—

vices, so that, whenever there is a sudden decline in the economically

useful capital stock, the demand for labor does not necessarily decline

as assumed in the "putty—clay" model.

     The assumption of constant returns to scale is also acceptable

because in the seven countries under consideration here the manufacturing

sector is already so large that a further increase in its size does not

per se entail important economies of scale. As new products and new

production techniques appear, there is often an opportunity for further

economies of scale. However, such changes occur gradually over time and

are unrelated to the levels of capital and labor in the manufacturing

sector. Thus, these changes are more appropriately taken into account

by the rate of disembodied productivity change, A, than by the intro-

duction of economies of scale in the aggregate production function. 6

     To simplify the theoretical analysis as well as the future econo-

metric estimation, it is convenient to work with a linear approximation

to equation (1). This approximation is obtained by writing equation (1)

in log form, applying a Taylor's series expansion to in Y about a value

of   which is then allowed asymptotically to approach zero, and dropping

the terms involving powers of   higher than one. This simplification

involves no loss of economic realism because the new function provides

a good approximation to the CES function over the relevant range of

variations for L, K, and the various parameters (Kmenta (1967)). The

new function is:
                                                 —8—

(2) in Y =   in   y + A t ÷ (1 -          ) in L +      in K — 1/2 $(1 —   )ó   [in (K/L)]2

      If K is given, entrepreneurs will recruit labor up to the point

where the marginal product of labor is equal to the real wage rate, that

is,

(3)
             aL     p

where w is the money wage rate and p the deflator of value added.

      Given that:

(4)
         alnYYL
         BlnL 3LY
the equilibrium condition (3) is equivalent to:

(5)       alnY..wL.sL =i—sK
          alnL pY
where SL is the "labor share of income' and SK the capital share. We

refer to SL as the labor share of income becauseit is the expression

used in most of the economic literature. However, as noted above,

what really matters from the standpoint of the demand for labor is the

cost of labor so that employment or payroll taxes have to be included

in w and SL, even though they do not represent an income for labor.

      After carrying out the partial differentiation of (2), equation (5)

can be written:

(6)           SL =      1 —     S   +   5 (1 —   6) in (K/L)

      To have equilibrium in the labor market, L must correspond to its

high—employment value, L. The corresponding equilibrium labor share is:

              SL =          —   6   +   6 (1 — 6) in (K/L)

        The high—employment real wage rate (w/p) is obtained by calculating

the high—employment level of output (Y) from equation (2) and inserting

Y and L in equation (5). In log form, the result is:

(8)      in (7) = in       (Y/i)     + in (L)
                  =   in   y +   A   t + in (K/L) — 1/2   (1 —   )S [in   (K/L)]2

                      +   in (FL)

        From equations (7) and (8), we conciude that an increase in the high—

employment labor share (SL) resulting from a rise in the real wage rate in

excess of the rise in labor productivity is at times warranted. In this

simple model, it is the evolution of K/L and the value of             that determine

if it is warranted. More precisely, L is positively related to K/L if

      is positive (that is, if Ti < 1) and negatively related to this ratio if

  is negative (that is, if ri > 1). The high—employment equilibrium real

wage rate (w/p) is positively related to Y/L and to SL. More funda-

mentally, w/p is increasing at a rate which corresponds to the rate of

disembodied productivity change only if K/L is constant. If K/L is

rising, this will boost up the increase in w/p, especially if              is

positive and large.

       The other conclusion to be derived from this simple model is that,

while the gap between the actual real wage rate (wlp) and the warranted

rate (w/p) is a meaningful indicator of the magnitude of the disequi-

librium, the gap between the actual and the warranted labor share can be

misleading. Looking back to equation (6), it is clear that an undue rise

in the real wage rate that leads to a decline in the demand for labor,
                                 — 10 —



and therefore a rise in K/L, could ultimately result in a decline rather

than a rise in the labor share. This will be the case whenever    is

negative (i.e., n > 1). In the more likely case where    is positive, the

labor share will rise, but only by a small amount if    is small. Thus,

neither the sign nor the magnitude of the deviation between the actual

and the warranted labor share can be taken as reliable indicators of a

real wage rate disequilibrium. When focusing on the share, one should

compare the warranted share (SL) to the "normalized" share (SL) cor-

responding to the actual real wage rate and the labor productivity at

high employment (i.e., L =LwIYp). The information provided by this

latter comparison is, of course, the same as the information provided by

a comparison of the actual and the warranted real wage rate.

2.   Two more complex models

     The above model, while providing a useful introduction to the con-

cepts of a warranted labor share and a warranted real wage rate, needs

to be extended considerably before becoming usable for empirical work.

First, we will retain the weak separability assumption for both raw

materials and energy and extend the above model to take account of the

variability in some of the parameters of the production function and

the econometric problems raised by its estimation. Mter developing

this new model, named "model A," we will relax the assumption of weak

separability with respect to energy. The resulting model, which assumes

energy—capital (E—K) complementarity, will be named "model B."
                                   — 11 —




Model A

     While in the short run all the parameters in equation (2) can be

assumed to be constant, the rate of disembodied productivity change

(X) and the factor weights (cS) and (1 —    are likely to change in the

longer run. The parameter    is a "catch a11' parameter that represents

the multitude of factors that explain why output tends to grow faster

than measured inputs; thus, it would be surprising if it did not change

as these factors evolve. This is well recognized in the economic liter-

ature. What is less well recognized, but possibly even more important

in the present context, is that   may also change over time and affect

the high—employment equilibrium labor share as the production techniques

and the pattern of production become more, or less, labor intensive. In

fact, the evolution of the labor share over the past three decades

suggests that the change in ô may have been sizable. The labor share

remained roughly constant in most major industrial countries througout

the second half of the 1950s and the whole of the 1960s, despite a

doubling or tripling of the ratio of capital to labor. Equation (6)

indicates that such a development is consistent with firm equilibrium

and a constant 5 only if the production function is of the Cobb—Douglas

type ( = 0).   But if   is zero and 6 is constant, then all of the change

in the labor share experienced in the 1970s and early 1980s should be

viewed as a move away from equilibrium because the equilibrium labor

share would be constant. This does not seem plausible.

    Allowing A and 6 to change without using many degrees of freedom

is not an easy task. For A, in particular, it is difficult to impose
                                              — 12 —




any a priori restriction, so that one cannot avoid a systematic search
for statistically—significant shifts despite the cost in terms of degree

of freedom. For this reason, this parameter will hereafter be written

as At. For S, the change should be fairly gradual, and over the

plausible range of variation one can assume a simple linear function of

time ( =      + i t).

      Even with this restriction on the way 5 can change over time, the

number of parameters in equation (2) is too large for reliable econo-

metric estimation from a single equation. .With periods of observation

limited to twenty to thirty years, there is simply too much multicol—

linearity among the main variables. Frequently, this problem is solved

by jointly estimating the production function and the demand for labor.

In the present context, however, this method has to be modified for two

reasons. First, the demand for labor corresponding to a CES production

function with A and            =    +     t is:

(9)      ln L =       1       (in (5 + 5 1 t) — 8 in y) —    1    in (wlp)
                  1+8               0                       1+8
                  -       8     At+lnY
                      1+8
      It is apparent that there are two trend elements in equation (9)

and that the equation would therefore fail to contribute anything to

the estimation of either             or At.

      Second, the demand for labor is derived under the assumption that

labor is paid its marginal product. Most studies do take into account

that this assumption is plausible only in the longer run by considering
                                    13 —




equation (9) as a long—run demand for labor. The lagged value of ln L is
then added to the right—hand side of equation (9) to reflect the gradual

adjustment of the actual demand for labor to its longer—run equilibrium

value. The problem is that this specification does not differentiate

between the adjustment of L to Y over the cycle, which is often rapid,

and the adjustment of L to w/p, which may be quite slow. 8 Furthermore,

as the cyclical movement in Y is usually the dominant factor, the esti-

mated coefficient of adjustment may exaggerate the rapidity with which

the equilibrium between the real wage rate and the marginal product of

labor is re—established. Thus, imposing equation (9) on the data is

nearly equivalent to imposing the constraint that deviations of the real

wage rate from the equilibrium value corresponding to the amount of

employed labor cannot last more than a few years. Therefore, the change

in the labor share of income experienced in most industrial countries

over the past ten to fifteen years would have to be viewed as a pheno—

menon fully warranted by factors such as changes in production techniques

and in the relative amounts of labor and capital within firms. Such an

assumption would hardly be appropriate in the context of the present

study. 9

     The approach adopted here to solve the multicollinearity problem

is to use the share equation (6) rather than the normal demand for labor

equation. The major advantage of equation (6) is that the rate of dis-

embodied productivity change (At) does not enter into it, while the

relative weight of capital (o + i t) does. Thus, this equation is
                                                 — 14 —




a powerful tool to obtain an estimate of 6-j and ó1. As it is also

derived under the assumption that labor is paid its marginal product, it

will be assumed to hold only on a cyclically adjusted basis, rather than

in each phase of the cycle. Furthermore, it will only be assumed to have

held during 1955—69 for the European countries and 1955—73 for the United

States and Canada, periods for which there is no reason to expect that

the real wage rate was out of equilibrium. 10 For Japan, equation (6)

will also be assumed to have held during 1955—73, even though the

extremely low labor share during this period suggests that labor was

possibly paid less than its marginal product as a result of an implicit

social consensus that a high profit rate was the best way to rebuild the

capital stock.

       After taking account of the considerations discussed above, we

obtain the two functions which comprise model A:

(10)       in Y =   in    'r   + At   t   + (1
                                             -
                                                 —        —i   t)   in   L +   (o   +   i   t)   in   K
                    —    1/2      (i —                   t)    +         t) [in     (K/L)]2


(11)            S = (1    -       —
                                           t) ÷      6   ( + 1t) (1       -     — 1t) in         (K/L')

where SL = the trend—through—peaks value of SL adjusted downward so

                that the average of SL is equal to the average of SL

         L' =   the trend—through—peaks value of L adjusted downward so that
                the average of L' is equal to the average of L.

       As just mentioned, equation (ii) is imposed on the data only through

1969 in European countries, and 1973 in the United States, Canada, and

Japan.
                                                  — 15 —




       Once the parameters of the model have been estimated from equations

(10) and (11), the labor share and the real wage consistent with high—

employment equilibrium can be derived from the modified versions of

equations (7) and (8), namely,

(12)          SL =   (l — o      —
                                     51t) +         (ô0 + cS1t)    (1 —    — S1t)   in (K/i:)



(13) in (7) = in (Y/L) + in (L)
                 =   in   (SL)       in   y       Xt +   (o +     S1t) in (K/L)

                     —   1/2     (1 —         —
                                                      t) (ô0 + '51t) [in (K/L)]2

       The most noticeable difference between model A and the simpler model

discussed above is that model A recognizes that a trend increase in the

real wage rate that exceeds the increase in labor productivity at high

employment (YIL) is warranted when there is a reduction in the capital

weight 5, that is when            < 0. Such a situation arises when the

pattern of production is shifting toward iess capital—intensive indus—

tries, or when technical innovations are favoring less capital—intensive

production techniques. An evolution in the opposite direction would call

for a growth of the real wage rate that is below the growth of Y/L.

Model B

       Weak separability is broadly accepted as a realistic assumption for

raw materials (N), but whether it is a realistic assumption for energy (E)

is open to debate. Berndt and Wood (1979) and others have argued that in

many instances energy and capital must be viewed as complements. Namely,

once entrepreneurs have optimized the energy efficiency of their capital

stock on the basis of the relative price of capital and energy, they are
                                          — 16 —




largely   unable to change K/L without changing E/L. Under such conditions,

the relevant production model would involve the following two—level

production function:

                   =   y*(L    K*)

(14)

              K*   =   K*(K,   E)

where Y = value—added corresponding to L, K and E

        K* = a composite variable reflecting the joint input of capital

             and energy.

       With E—K complementarity, a marked increase in the relative price

of energy, as in 1973—74 and in 1979—80, would lead entrepreneurs to

increase their demand for labor and decrease their demand for both energy

and capital. Assuming that the functional form for the Y*_levei remains

as assumed in equation (10), the labor share and the real wage rate con-

sistent with high—employment equilibrium would still be determined by

equation (12) and (13), respectively, but after substituting K* for K.

The labor share would now be the share of labor income in Y, and the

real wage rate would be defined in terms of p, the deflator of Y. In

equations (10) and (11), S11 would have to be replaced by S (the

cyclically adjusted share of labor income in y*), while Y would have

to be replaced by Y. An increase in the price of energy leading to a

decline in K*/L would shift the distribution of incomes corresponding to

1* against labor if           > 0, and in favor of labor if   < 0.

       As the practical relevance of E—K complementarity is still in doubt,

we will derive estimates of the warranted real wage rate under each of
                                      — 17 —




the two polar assumptions, namely E—K complementarity (model B) and weak
separability of energy (model A). In model B, the composite variable K*

will be derived by using the linear approximation to the CES functional

form (as for output in equation (2) but without the time trend), namely,

(15)       in K* =    ln   E + (1 —     in   K —   1/2 EK1 —   [ln(E/K)]2.

3.     Measurement issues

       The first part of this subsection considers the measurement of

L and K, while the second part considers the measurement of L. The

measurement of the other variables is relatively straightforward and is

described in the Statistical Appendix. The only point that needs to be

noted here is that for France and Italy the national accounting figures

on nominal value added in manufacturing include inventory appreciation——

an element that should not be regarded as either an income to labor or

to fixed capital. For France, we adjusted the figures by using data on

inventory appreciation for the whole nonagricultural economy. For Italy,

we made an even rougher adjustment on the basis of the observed relation

between inflation and inventory appreciation in the other six countries.

For both countries, but especially Italy, the distributional labor and

capital shares are thus subject to possibly sizable errors.

Measurement of L and K

       There is no generally accepted way to measure the flows of labor and

capital services. In this paper, we can only provide a brief analysis of

the measurement problems and an explanation of what we did. As in most
                                                                        11
other studies, the present analysis uses series on man—hours worked
                                   —18—


and on the gross capital stock 12 as proxies for the unavailable series

on the flows of labor and capital services. As well known, this proce-

dure requires that an additional variable be inserted in the production

function to pick up cyclical movements in the intensity of use of labor

and capital. 13 The reason is that fluctuations in output corresponding

to unanticipated changes in aggregate demand do not immediately result

in corresponding changes in either the number of man—hours worked or the

level of capital stock. Initially, unexpected variations in demand lead

to changes in the intensity of use of labor and capital, that is, the

amount of services obtained from a given number of man—hours and a given

capital stock varies. Gradually, however, the number of man—hours and

the level of capital stock are changed, and their intensity of use is

brought back to normal. As in Artus (1977), we will assume that the

cyclical variable, to be denoted as D and introduced with a coefficient

of one, is a lagged function of the actual rate of change of output, net

of the expected long—run rate of change (ji).   More specifically, it

will be assumed that:

(16)           in D = p [in (/-i) —

where the notation (——)L indicates a geometrically distributed lag

operator. The expected long—run rate of change of output will be

approximated by a ten—year lagged moving average of in (Y/Y_1).

       Even with D in the production function, there are still various

measurement problems that must be considered. For L, the main problem

is that the available data on man—hours do not reflect the level of
                                 — 19 —




education and technical expertise of the work force. In the present
context, however, It is likely that the problem is not too severe because

those changes occur only gradually. Even when demographic and economic

developments lead to a marked increase in the growth of the work force

and a decline in its mean age, there is no strong reason to assume that

the average level of education and technical expertise is affected.

While new entries in the labor force tend to be younger and better edu-

cated, they also have less on—the—job experience. 14 Thus, the measure-

ment error in L can be assumed to be highly collinear with a simple time

trend. It could lead to a bias in the econometric estimates of the

trend coefficients (Xt and      but the estimates of the other

coefficients would be unaffected. Even more importantly, the estimates

of Sj and w/p would also be unaffected.

     For K, the remaining problems are more severe. All of them result

from the fact that currently the only practical method to obtain an esti-

mate of the gross capital stock is the rather mechanical one of cumu-

lating past investment flows, net of discards. This method, if applied

carelessly, may lead to a growing measurement error which, this time,

would not necessarily be collinear with the trend rates already in the

model. Three considerations are especially important.

     First, the cumulation of real investment flows does not take proper

account of the fact that a piece of machinery bought in year t + 1

embodies more technical knowledge and is thus more efficient than one

bought in year t. The reason is that the price series used to deflate
                                 — 20 —



the investment flows tend to exaggerate the amount of inflation because
the price increases that reflect the efficiency increases are not properly

separated from the prices increases reflecting inflation. When there is

a decline in the growth of investment, as after 1973, it is likely that

this will be followed by a temporary decline in the growth of the average

efficiency of the capital stock because of the temporary reduction in the

proportion of relatively new equipment in the total stock of equipment.

Such a decline in the growth of the average efficiency of the capital

stock will not be reflected in the capital stock series obtained by cumu-

lating investment flows. To reduce this type of measurement error, the

capital stock series used in this study were adjusted by an efficiency

scalar that is function of the mean age of the capital stock. A detailed

description of how this adjustment was carried out can be found in the

Statistical Appendix.

     Second, voluntarily or as a result of government regulation, firms

purchase equipment that produces products that are omitted from the mea-

sured GNP. In particular, firms purchase equipment to reduce environ-

mental pollution. As long as the proportion of such investment in total

investment is constant, the problem is not severe because the rate of

growth of the "productive" capital stock is unaffected. However, in the

United States, Canada, and Japan, new government regulations led to an

upward shift of that proportion in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The

data published by the U.S. Department of Commerce indicate that the

proportion of pollution abatement investment in total U.S. investment
                                     — 21 —




in   manufacturing rose from about 1 per cent in the mid—1960s to about

8 percent in the mid—1970s, then declined gradually to around 5 percent

in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 15 A series for expenditure on

pollution abatement was derived from these data, and it was subtracted

from the U.S. investment series to get a measure of "productive" invest-

ment. No precise data are available for Canada and Japan, but, as a

rough adjustment for the jump in pollution abatement expenditures, the

investment figures for these two countries were reduced by 5 percent

from 1969 onwards. If anything, this adjustment is probably on the low

side.

        Third, the major unanticipated structural changes that took place

in the aftermath of the 1973—74 and 1979—80 oil price increases are

likely to have caused the premature obsolescence of part of the capital

stock. Capital is heterogeneous and specialized. Sudden changes in the

structure of demand faced by firms and the relative costs of using speci-

fic energy—intensive equipment leave some equipment without any economic

value even though it may be relatively new. Even in less extreme cases,

there may be an incentive for firms to speed up the replacement of some

equipment by more energy—efficient equipment. Of course, a one—time loss

of equipment does not lead to a permanent decline in the capital stock

because normal obsolescence would, in any case, eventually lead to the

discard of this equipment. Unless premature obsolescence is taken into

account, however, the capital stock can be seriously overestimated in the

first few years that follow the demand or supply shock.
                                  - 22   -




     The extent of this phenomenon in the aftermath of the 1973—74 and

1979-80 oil price increases is still an unsettled issue. Economists

such as Baily (1981) take the large decline in the market value of cor-

porations relative to the replacement cost of tangible assets, Tobin's q,

as an indication that a large part of the capital stock (perhaps 20 per-

cent) was prematurely discarded just after the first wave of oil price

increases, and presumably as much after the second wave. Others, such as

Bosworth (1982), compare the historical cost valuation of gross stocks

derived from surveys conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census with the

results derived from the perpetual—inventory valuation method with a

fixed discard pattern, and conclude that only a small part of the capital

stock (perhaps 2—3 percent) was prematurely discarded. Both methods have

major weaknesses. Tobin's q is likely to reflect many factors that have

little if anything to do with the effective size of the gross capital

stock and the flow of services that can be derived from it. As to the

historical cost valuation of gross stocks derived from surveys, it is

notoriously unreliable. The estimates of gross capital stock used in the

present study assume that 10 percent of the existing capital stock was

prematurely retired during 1974—76, and that the same proportion was pre-

maturely retired during 1980—82. As this estimate is highly tentative,

a sensitivity analysis was carried out with a 5 percent and a 15 percent

estimate.

Measurement of L

     To obtain an estimate of the high—employment labor input in manufac-

turing (L) that is consistent with the definition of high employment for
                                       — 23 —




the whole economy, we use the method developed in Artus and Turner (1978).
This method is based on the estimation of the following simple equation

relating the actual labor input in manufacturing (L) to a nonlinear time

trend and to the unemployment rate in the whole economy (U):

(17)           ln(L) = a0 + a1 t + a2     t2     + a3   t3   —
                                                                 a4 U
       At cyclical peaks, the value of L is calculated as

(18)           ln(1) =   ln(L) + a4   (U — iS)

where U is the unemployment rate corresponding to a situation of high

employment in the whole economy, and a4 is the estimated value of a4.

       In between peaks, the value of L is calculated by fitting log—linear

trends between the successive peak values of L obtained from equation (18).

After the last cyclical peak, the assumed growth rate of L is an extrapo—

lation of the estimated rate between the last two observed cyclical peaks.

The extrapolated figures are adjusted when necessary for changes in

demographic factors and in the length of the normal work week.

       The most difficult task is to estimate the high—employment rate U,

that is, the rate where labor shortages become widespread because the

residual unemployment is due to the normal turnover in the labor market

and to regional and skill mismatches between labor supply and demand.

In the present study, the estimate of U is derived from the "Beveridge

Curve," a graphical presentation of the inverse relationship between

unemployment and vacancies. 16 More specifically, U is defined as the

unemployment rate where the curve becomes nearly vertical, with large

increases in vacancies associated with only small reductions in the
                                  - 24   —




unemployment rate. Allowance is made for shifts in the curve and there—
f ore shifts in U that reflect changes in the amount of frictional and

mismatch unemployment. Over the past decade, however, some of the coun-

tries considered here experienced few, if any, years where the number of

vacancies was high, so that it is difficult to draw complete Beveridge

Curves for this period. In such cases, we examine whether the unemploy-

ment rates corresponding to relatively low numbers of vacancies have

changed from the 1960s to the l970s and early l980s, and we assume that

the vertical part of the curve has shifted by the same amount as the part

corresponding to relatively low numbers of vacancies. For Italy, where

there is no data on vacancies, U was derived by using a more ad hoc

method (see the Statistical Appendix).

     Table 2 presents the main results related to the estimation of L.

A striking result is the large value of a for Japan, which reflects

the effect of labor—sharing arrangements and the apparent greater ease

with which the service sector absorbs the increase in labor force during

periods of slow growth in the manufacturing sector. Another striking

result is the marked reduction in the growth rate of    in Japan and in

European countries during the past decade and a half. This reduction

reflects a marked increase in the value of U during this period (see the

Statistical Appendix), as well as an acceleration of the historical trend

in the allocation of the labor force in favor of the service sector, pos-

special factors such as North Sea oil in the United Kingdom. Despite

the reduction in the growth rate of L, we find that at the cyclical peak

in 1979—80 there were still sizable gaps between L and L in Japan, France,

the Federal Republic of Germany, and Italy. By contrast, the gaps were

fairly small in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom because

in these countries the residual unemployment, even though very high,

seemed to correspond to frictional and mismatch unemployment. By 1982,

the gaps were large in all seven countries.

     These estimates of L are of course subject to a large margin of

error. In particular, they assume that: (1) at each cyclical peak, the

relation between aggregate unemployment (in excess of U) and man—hours

worked in manufacturing is the same; (2) the change in the distribution

of employment among sectors between two cyclical peaks is due to long—

run changes in comparative advantage and in the pattern of demand, rather

than real wage problems in manufacturing; (3) the rate of change of U

and the rate of change in the distribution of employment among sectors

between the last two cyclical peaks, 1973—74 and 1979—80, can be extra-

polated to the early 1980s. On balance, it is much more likely that

these assumptions lead to an underestimation, rather than an overesti-

mation, of L during the late 197Os and early 1980s, at least in Japan

and in European countries. Mainly, one cannot but wonder whether the

marked shift in the distribution of employment toward the service sector,

especially government services, that took place in Japan and in European

countries between 1973—74 and 1979—80 was really warranted by long—run
                                   — 27 —




 growth considerations. In part, this shift may itself be the result of

 an excessive real wage rate in manufacturing. Some of the persons that

 could not get a job in this sector because labor contracts prevented

 entrepreneurs from offering them a wage corresponding to their marginal

 product were probably recruited in the government sector to limit the

 rise in unemployment, or absorbed by the private service sector in occu-

pations involving very low marginal product and very low real wages. In

addition, it may be unduly pessimistic to extrapolate into the early

1980s the rapid rise in U observed between 1973—74 and 1979—80. In fact,

the evidence does not suggest a further shift of the Beveridge Curve in

the early 1980s, except possibly in France and the United Kingdom.

                         III. Empirical Results

     Parameters of models A and B were estimated for the seven largest

industrial countries by using nonlinear least—squares methods and annual

observations. For the production function, the observation sample is

1961—82 for the Federal Republic of Germany and 1955—82 for the other six

countries. 17 For the share function, the observation sample is 1961—69

for the Federal Republic of Germany; 1955—73 for the United States,

Canada, and Japan; and 1955—69 for France, Italy, and the United King-

dom. 18 In the estimation, the share functions for the United States,

Canada, France, and Italy had to be adjusted for first—order autocor—

relation by using the Cochrane—Orcutt method, and a systematic search

was made for significant changes in the value of the rate of disembodied

productivity growth (At). The estimated values of the parameters were

then used to calculate the warranted labor shares and real wage rates.

1.   Parameter estimates

     The parameter estimates for model A are presented in Table 3. We

find that the rate of disembodied productivity growth increased during

the 1960s and then fell back during the l970s and early 1980s. The only

exception is the Federal Republic of Germany, where the rate of dis—

embodied productivity growth was constant throughout the period 1961—82.

An examination of the regression residuals for 1981 and 1982 suggests

that productivity growth may have picked up again in the United Kingdom

in recent years, but it is still too early to say. These results cor-

roborate the findings of Denison (1982), Bosworth (1982), and others,

that a significant part of the decline in the growth of labor produc-

tivity during the last decade is not accounted for by the decline in the

rate of capital accumulation. This is true even when, as in the present

study, the rate of capital accumulation is adjusted downward to take

account of the rise in pollution abatement investment and premature

obsolescence. 19

     Aside from the evolution of X over time, it is striking how much X

varies across countries and how stable the cross—country differences are.

For the past three decades, X has tended to be about 3 percentage points

higher in Japan and 2 percentage points higher in France and Italy than in

the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The Federal Republic

of Germany, by avoiding a decline in X, has moved from the low group

during the l960s and early 1970s to the middle group during the last ten

years. These large and persistent differences have obvious implications

not   only for the growth of the real wage rate, but also for employment

and capital formation. During the last ten years, manufacturing produc-

tion had to grow by more than 4 percent per year in Japan and more than

2—3 percent per year in France, the Federal Republic of Germany, and

Italy to lead to an increase in the demand for labor and capital services

in manufacturing. In the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom,

the same result could be achieved with an increase in production of only

slightly more than 1 percent.

       We find that in most countries the weight on the capital stock (5)

is increasing over time, that is,      is positive. Again this is not a

surprising result; the tendency for a gradual increase in the capital

intensity of production techniques has been in evidence for a very long

time. For Japan, however, the data suggest that the tendency for an

increase in      was interrupted during 1971—82. A possible reason for

this development is that Japan experienced a marked change in its struc-

ture of production during this period as a result of a deliberate policy

to move away from industries involving a high level of raw materials and

energy imports. Many of these industries, such as the steel industry,

were also capital intensive. In addition, it can be noted that the

value of      was already very high during the second half of the 1950s and

during the 1960s; much higher than in other industrial countries.

       The parameter    is positive for all countries; the corresponding

 elasticity of substitution between labor and capital (ri,   ii   = 1/(1 + ))

 is   thus lower than one. For most countries, r is between 0.5 and 0.8, a
                                      31 —




result   which matches the finding of other studies such as Griffins and

Gregory (1976) and Pindyck (1979). The important implication of this

result is that a rise in the capital/labor ratio tends to increase the

equilibrium labor share of incomes. (See equation (12).) In periods

where the capital/labor ratio rises rapidly, this effect may dominate

the effect of the gradual rise in the weight on the capital stock, and

the equilibrium labor share may increase. In other periods, the weight

effect may dominate and the equilibrium labor share may decrease.

     The estimates of the parameter p are between 0.4 to 0.5 for most

countries. This means that a sudden decline in the rate of growth of

output of 10 percentage points is normally accompanied by a decline in

the intensity of use of labor and capital resources within firms cor-

responding to a decline in total factor productivity of 4 to 5 percent.

Then, the intensity of use of labor and capital is gradually brought

back to normal as firms reduce their work force and their capital stock

(see equation (16)). In the second year, assuming no further shock, the

apparent total factor productivity is only 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 percent below

what it would have been without the output decline. In Japan, the adjust—

ment is significantly slower; factor productivity is cut by 7 percent the

first year and it takes four years for the reduction in productivity to

become less than 2 percent.

     Practically all the parameter estimates have low asymptotic standard

errors. However, this result should not be viewed as an indication that

the estimates are highly precise and reliable. First, from a statistical
                                     — 32 —




standpoint,   we are working with fairly small samples so that the asympto—

tic standar errors have very limited relevance. Unfortunately, the small

sample properties of estimates for parameters in these non—linear models

are unknown. Second, slight changes in the choice of the subperiods for

the A parameters often lead to significant changes in the estimates

of the cS and     parameters. The problem is particularly severe for the

United Kingdom, where there is a high positive covariance between the

estimates of      and   because during the 1955—69 period SL is nearly

constant and the ratio K/L is growing at a stable rate. Third, the esti-

mates for Sç, , and          are for all practical purposes determined by

the share function. When both equations are estimated separately, the

estimates of Sij, 'Si, and      derived from the share function are prac-

tically identical to the estimates presented in Table 3, 20 while the

estimates derived from the production function have often implausible

values and high standard errors. Therefore, the estimates presented in

Table 3 must be viewed as highly dependent on the assumption that during

the estimation period S was in fact the equilibrium labor share cor-

responding to the cyclically adjusted level of employment.

     The above results are based on the assumptions that during 1974—76,

and then again during 1980—82, 10 percent of the existing capital stock

was prematurely retired. When the assumption was changed from 10 to 15

percent (to 5 percent), the estimated values of X for the l970s and

early 1980s were raised (lowered), but only by 0.1 to 0.2. All the other

estimates remained roughly unchanged.

        The first step in the estimation of model B is the estimation of
                                                                         3EK
 and E. parameters that are needed to calculate the flow of services

 corresponding to the K* input (see equation (15)). In the present study,

 the parameter 5E is assumed equal to the share of energy cost in the

 total of energy and capital costs in 1972, the last year before the first

wave of oil price increases. To obtain an estimate of 8EK' we have

used the following equation:

(19)             SE   1    (S + 8EK (S (1 —   5) ln(K/E)

which is the equivalent of equation (6) for the competitive allocation of

income between capital and energy. Focusing on the 1972—82 period of

doubling real energy prices, we have solved equation (19) for the value

of 13EK corresponding to the observed changes in SE and ln(K/E). 21 The

results in Table 4 indicate that the value of EK is in the order of 2

to 3, which corresponds to a relatively small elasticity of substitution

        of 0.25 to 0.35. 22 For purposes of the present study, we have

taken a value of EK of 2.5 for all seven countries. As this estimate

is subject to a large margin of error, exp?riments with estimates ranging

from 1.5 to 3.5 were carried out with little effect on the estimates of

the other parameters of model B, or the estimates of the equilibrium

labor shares and real wage rates.

       The estimated values of the other parameters of model B are presented

in Table 5. The results are similar to those obtained for model A with

two exceptions. First, as could be expected, the estimated value of

is now significantly larger. In all cases, it is approximately equal to

  1/   In this table, SE refers to the share of energy cost in the total of energy and capital
costs, while    Erefers to the weight of energy in the CES function defining the composite E—K
input.   The value of  E is approximated by the value of SE in 1972.  The symbol 72—825E
refers  to the change in SE from 1972 to 1982.
  2/ For Canada, the estimate refers to the change in ln(K/E) from 1972 to 1982, net of the change
from 1962 to 1972. The adjustment was made to take account of what appeared to be a long—run trend
in ln(K/E).

the   share of capital and energy cost in the total value added corre-

sponding to capital, energy, and labor in the mid—1950s. Second, the

reduction in the value of X from the l960s to the l970s and early 1980s

is now smaller, but generally not by much. Thus, even when the reduction

in energy use achieved during the past ten years is explicitly taken

into account as it is in model B, there is still a sizable unexplained

reduction in the rate of growth of disembodied productivity.

2.    Warranted Labor shares and real wage rates

      A comparison of the normalized and the warranted labor shares derived

from model A corroborates the disequilibrium real wage rate hypothesis

(see Chart 1). By the early 1980's, the normalized share is well above

the warranted share in all seven countries except Canada. The gap

between the normalized and the warranted shares is particularly large

in France, the Federal Republic of Germany, and in the United Kingdom,

where it reaches about ten percentage points. The gap is smaller, but

still about five percentage points, in the United States, Japan, and

Italy.

      The date at which this gap appears differs among countries. In

France and Italy, the normalized share starts to move above the warranted

share in the late 1960s and early l970s, and the move accelerates with

the first wave of oil price increases in 1973—74. During the second

half of the l970s, the gap stabilizes in France and declines in Italy.

In both countries, the second wave of oil price increases in 1979—80 is

absorbed without much change in the gap. In the United States, the gap

becomes sizable only with the second wave of oil price increases. In

Japan, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the United Kingdom, the gap

emerges with the first wave of oil price increases, stabilizes or even

starts to contract, then increases again with the second wave. For

Japan, the growth of the gap from 1978 to 1982 reflects an average

increase in the nominal wage rate of close to 7 percent per annum coupled

with an average decrease in the value added deflator of 0.5 percent.

With an estimated growth rate of labor productivity at high employment

(YIL) of 5 percent, the Japanese case illustrates how adjustment can

be extremely successful in nominal terms (in the sense of eliminating

inflation), without being fully successful in real terms.

     These results are broadly similar to those derived by looking at

the deviations of the actual labor shares from their historical averages

during, say, 1955—69 as measures of the disequilibrium in income distri-

bution. (See Chart 1.) The reason is twofold. First, the evolution of

the normalized shares is not all that different from the evolution of

the actual shares. Differences have a tendency to appear during periods

of recession such as 1974—75 and 1982, when the actual shares often move

above the normalized shares because the reductions in the amounts of

employed labor lag the reductions in production. However, except in

Japan, the lag is relatively small so that these differences are quickly

resorbed. Moreover, the estimated elasticities of substitution between

labor and capital are not very different from one so that even in recent

years it does not matter too much if we consider the actual labor share,
                                  — 38 —




which corresponds to K!L, rather than the normalized share, which corre-
sponds to K/L. 23 Second, the estimates of the warranted shares for the

1970s and early 1980s are rather similar to the estimates of the war-

ranted shares for 1955—69, which on average are themselves similar to

the actual shares during 1955—69. Again the main reason is that the

estimated elasticities of substitution are not very different from one,

so that the warranted shares remain relatively stable despite sizable

changes in the rates of increase of KIL.

     Even though the new results are broadly similar to those derived

from simple comparisons of actual shares, the differences between the

two sets of results are far from negligible, suggesting that at times

comparisons of actual shares are misleading. For example, for the

United Kingdom and, especially, for Italy the warranted labor share is

estimated to be higher during the l970s and early 1980s than during

1955—59, so that a simple comparison of actual shares exaggerates the

magnitude of the disequilibrium in recent years. For Japan, the com-

parison of actual shares is even more misleading. The actual labor

share jumps up in the first half of the l970s, mainly in 1974—75, and

then stabilizes, suggesting that Japan adjusted much better to the second

wave of oil price rises than to the first. What the new results show,

however, is that the jump in the labor share that took place in the first

half of the l970s was not a severe problem. First, it started from a

position where the actual share was significantly below the warranted

share. Second, it was largely related to the presence of temporary labor
                                   — 39 —




hoarding,   as evidenced by the much smaller increase in the normalized

share. And third, there was a gradual increase in the warranted share

during that period because of a rapid increase in K/L. (See Tables 1 and

2.) By contrast, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, labor hoarding

was slowly reduced and the stability of the actual share hides a further

rise in the normalized share. Moreover, the warranted share stopped

rising because the growth of K/L decelerated sharply.

     The normalized and the warranted labor shares derived from model B

are depicted in Chart 2. All the shares are now in percent of the total

of labor, capital, and energy costs, rather than only the total of labor

and capital costs. For the United States, Canada, and Italy, the E—K

complementarity hypothesis leads to results that differ from those

derived from the traditional production model. Focussing on the l980s,

the normalized share is now found to be roughly equal to the warranted

share in the United States and Italy, and actually smaller than the

warranted share in Canada. For the other four countries, on the other

hand, the estimates of the gaps between the normalized and the warranted

shares remain roughly unchanged.

     To understand why the results of model B differ from those of model

A, one must consider the effects of E—K complementarity on both the

warranted labor shares and the normalized labor shares. The warranted

shares tend to rise less, or decline more, in model B than in model A

during the past ten years because, with the decline in the use of energy

 (Table 6), K*IL rises less rapidly than K/L. As the coefficients of

K*IL   and K/L are larger for the United States, France, and the United

Kingdom than for the other four countries, the warranted shares of the

former countries are more affected than those of the latter countries.

However, these differences are small because the coefficients of K*/L

and K/L for the former countries are still relatively small. Turning

to the normalized shares, they also tend to rise less, or decline more,

in model B than in model A during the past ten years because of the

increase in the cost of energy used (included in Y*p* but not in Y p).

But in this case there are relatively large differences among countries.

The share of the cost of energy in the total cost of production rose

significantly more in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Italy, than

in the other three countries during the past ten years (see last column

of Table 6). Furthermore, as the effect of a given rise in the share of

energy costs on the normalized labor share is proportionate to the rela-

tive size of labor and capital costs, the resulting reduction in the

normalized labor share was much larger in the United States, Canada,

and Italy, than in Japan.

       Chart 3 depicts the wage gaps corresponding to the two models. As

noted above, these gaps are equal to the corresponding gaps between the

normalized and the warranted labor shares scaled by the ratios of value

added (inclusive of energy costs for model B) over warranted labor costs

under conditions of high employment. For France, Japan, the Federal

Republic of Germany, and the United Kingdom, the two models yield a wage

gap of 12 to 16 percent for the early 1980s. For the United States and
                                   — 42 —




Italy,   model A gives a gap in the order of 5 percent, while model B gives

no significant gap. For Canada, model A suggests no gap, while model B

suggests that the real wage rate is, if anything, on the low side.

     A sensitivity analysis indicates that the wage gaps are relatively

robust to variations in the estimates of the gross capital stocks and the

high—employment labor inputs. For example, we recalculated the wage gaps

for 1982 from model B after reducing our estimates of the gross capital

stock by 10 percent. This change decreased the warranted real wage rate

and increased the wage gap to 16 to 18 percent in Japan, France, the

Federal Republic of Germany, and the United Kingdom; to 3 to 5 percent

in the United States and Italy; and to about zero percent in Canada.

When we recalculated the wage gaps after raising our estimates of the

high—employment labor input by 10 percent, rather than reducing capital

by 10 percent, the estimates of the wage gaps were increased by a further

2 to 3 percentage points.

     Finally, we recalculated the wage gaps after reducing our estimates

of the high—employment labor input for 1982 to the level of the actual

labor input. Even under this extreme——and quite unrealistic——assumption

that all the unemployment observed in 1982 was due to regional and skill

mismatches between labor supply and demand, we still found a wage gap of

5 to 8 percent in France, Japan, and the Federal Republic of Germany, and

about 3 percent in the United Kingdom. This finding is worrisome because

it implies that in the four countries concerned the level of the real

wage rate may be an obstacle not only to a return to high employment, but

even to the maintenance of the 1982 level of employment.

    An analysis of the factors that led to the emergence of these gaps

is outside the scope of the present study, but the evolution of the rates

of growth of warranted real wage rates provides an insight into this

question. Table 7 gives the estimates corresponding to model B, both in

terms of the deflator of output, p, and in terms of consumer prices, Pc

The estimates corresponding to model A would be similar, except that for

the United States, Canada, and Italy, the post—1973 rate of growth would

be somewhat lower. The most noticeable result is the extremely sharp

deceleration in the rate of growth of the warranted real wage rate in

terms of p* in all seven countries after 1972. This deceleration was

attributable partly to a decline in the growth of disembodied produc-

tivity (A), and partly to a decline in the growth of the ratio of

the composite capital—energy input to the labor input (K*/L). The

deceleration attributable to this ratio was especially marked during

the period 1979—82, when energy use fell sharply and investment was

depressed. Generally, the change in the terms of trade between manu-

factures and consumer goods (p*/pC) was positive during 1973—78 and

negative during 1979—82; thus, it reduced the deceleration of the

growth of the warranted real wage rate in terms of consumer prices at

first, then increased it. During 1979—82, the rate of growth of the

warranted real wage rate in terms of consumer prices was negative in

the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom. In the other four

countries, it was only 1 to 2 percent.

    In   all seven countries, except the United Kingdom, the adjustment

to the deceleration in the growth of the warranted real wage rate in

terms of consumer prices was considerable, with the rate of growth of

the actual real wage rate declining by 2 percentage points or more from

1956—69 to 1979-82. 24 Thus, it would be an exaggeration to say that

the rate of growth of the real wage rate was rigid. In fact, there was a

great deal of flexibility, but not always enough. The two most obvious

cases where flexibility fell short from what was needed in recent years

were Japan and the United Kingdom, where the actual real wage rate in

terms of consumer prices has kept growing at a 2 to 3 percent rate,

instead of declining in line with the warranted rate.

     For France and the Federal Republic of Germany, the other two coun-

tries where there is currently a large gap, it is really in the early and

mid—1970s that the gap emerged, at a time when the rate of growth of the

warranted real wage rate was still relatively high. But, in recent

years, the growth of the actual real wage rate was nearly kept in line

with the low growth of the warranted rate. These findings suggest that

in these two countries the problem is not so much a systematic tendency

for inertia in the adjustment of real wages to supply shocks as argued

by Branson and Rotemberg (1980), Sachs (1979, 1983), and others, as a

failure to reverse the unwarranted increases in real wages of the early

and mid—1970s. Increases that, at least for France, had as much to do

with the wage explosion of the early 1970s as with the supply shocks of

the mid—1970s.

                         IV.   Concluding    Remarks

     We began this study by noting that the marked increase in the share

of labor costs in value added that took place during the 1970s and early

1980s in the manufacturing sector of most major industrial countries

does not necessarily imply that the real wage rate is now too high and

is causing unemployment. The increase could be warranted by long—run

changes in production techniques, in the price of energy, and in the

relative availability of labor and capital. After taking into account

these considerations, we conclude that, as far as the manufacturing

sector is concerned, there are indeed strong reasons to believe that in

France, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the United Kingdom, the

real wage rate is too high, in the sense of being incompatible with high

employment. In particular, in these three countries, we did not find any

evidence that a large part of the actual increase in the share of labor

costs in value added was warranted by long—run changes in production

techniques, in the price of energy, or in the relative availability of

labor and capital. On the other hand, for Canada and the United States,

the results indicate that there is no real wage problem. For Japan and

Italy, the conclusions have to be more nuanced. For Japan, the results

indicate that the large increases in the share of labor costs in value

added is not fully warranted by concomitant changes in the factors con-

sidered in the study. At the same time, the initial labor share was so

small that this increase may be less of a problem than in France, the

Federal Republic of Germany, and the United Kingdom. For Italy, the
                                   — 47 —




results   suggest that there is no real wage problem, but poor data

prevent a firm conclusion in this regard. These findings are derived

from an analysis in which the capital stock and the exchange rate are

assumed to be exogenous. Moreover, they apply only to the manufacturing

sector as a whole; there can obviously be a real wage problem in specific

industries even when the average real wage for the manufacturing sector

is not unduly high. 25

    While derived from a model that is more elaborate than previous

ones, the estimates of the warranted real wage rates on which these con-

clusions are based must still be regarded as tentative for at least

three reasons. First, it is difficult to measure the actual flows of

labor and capital services and, a fortiori, the high—employment labor

supply in manufaturing. The sensitivity analysis carried out in the

present study indicates that the order of magnitude of the warranted real

wage rate is relatively robust to plausible variations in the values

taken by these variables; nevertheless, the resulting uncertainty is far

from negligible. To reduce this uncertainty would require an extension

of the study to other sectors of the economy so as to estimate simul-

taneously the warranted allocation of labor among the various sectors

and the warranted real wage rates in all sectors. This extension would

be especially useful for countries such as the United Kingdom which have

recently experienced a major break in the historical pattern of relative

growth of their manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors. Reducing

uncertainty would also require better data on the flow of capital
                                   — 48 —




services.   The main problem in this context is the lack of reliable

information on the extent of premature obsolescence resulting from

the two waves of oil price increases.

     Second, the estimates suffer from a number of country—specific

problems. For Italy, and to a lesser extent France, the data on nominal

value added in manufacturing are somewhat unreliable because of the lack

of adequate information on inventory appreciation. Possible errors in

our own estimate of inventory appreciation is as likely to have led to

an undervaluation as an overvaluation of the wage gap in the early 1980s.

For Japan, the main problem arises from the possible inadequacy of the

base period. The extremely low share of labor costs in value added

during the 1950s and 1960s——20 to 30 percentage points lower than in

other industrial countries——may have partly resulted from an implicit

social consensus that a high profit rate was the best way to rebuild the

capital stock, rather than exclusively from a low marginal product of

labor. In this case, our estimate of the wage gap in the early 1980s

could be too high.

     Third, an aggregate production function for a whole economic sector

is an inherently crude empirical tool because the conditions necessary

for aggregation over firms and industries are never fully satisfied,

particularly if workers are not paid their marginal products. Not much

can be done about this, short of confining studies at the firm or indus-

try level. However, there are some aspects of the production function

approach used here that are susceptible to further improvements. The
                                  — 49 —




two that are particularly worth singling out concern the complementary

between capital and energy and the evolution of the relative weights of

labor and capital over time. More work is needed to determine how much

of the energy input should be viewed as a complement to capital and how

much should be viewed as weakly separable. More work is also needed to

test our assumption that the evolution of the relative weights of labor

and capital was the same during the 1970s and early 1980s as during the

1950s and 1960s.

     These limitations mean that the estimates are far from precise.

They do not mean that the estimated wage gaps for France, the Federal

Republic of Germany, and the United Kingdom merely reflects statistical

artefacts. There is more uncertainty in the case of Japan because of

the possible problem with the base period, but even there we doubt this

can completely explain the measured gap.

     A major factor that reinforces us in our belief that the order of

magnitude of the gaps is right is the evolution of the unemployment

situation. Unemployment can be classical (caused by an unduly high real

wage rate), structural (caused by turnover and by regional and skill

mismatches), or Keynesian (caused by a deficiency of aggregate demand).

Thus, one should not expect a close cross—country correlation between the

unemployment rate and the size of the wage gap. However, as of early

1984, the unemployment rate in France, the Federal Republic of Germany,

and the United Kingdom is between 5 to 7 percentage points above our

estimate of the structural rate for the early 1980s (see the Statistical
                                  — 50 —




Appendix) and this gap does not seem to be declining. 26 In contrast,
the unemployment rate is only 2 to 3 percentage points above the struc-

tural rate in the United States and Canada, and the spread is decreasing

from month to month. In Japan, the economic and social system is such

that the rise in unemployment has been quite moderate; nevertheless,

employment in manufacturing fell 4 percent from early 1974 to 1982. This

is striking, partly because the total labor force increased by 9 percent

during this period and partly because, as recently as the 1960s, employ-

ment in manufacturing was rising three times faster than the whole labor

force.

     Last but not least, we regard our findings as particularly worrisome

because of the exchange rate developments of recent years. The extremely

sharp appreciation of the U.S. and Canadian dollar vis—à—vis, the other

major currencies has had major effects on the relative international

price competitiveness of the corresponding countries and has probably

affected the profitability of their exports of manufactures, decreasing

export profitability in the United States and Canada and increasing

export profitability in the other countries. It is not a good omen

that, despite these developments, there still seems to be a real wage

problem for the manufacturing sector as a whole In most of the large

industrial countries outside North America.

                           STATISTICAL APPENDIX


Value added and labor cost in manufacturing

     The data on value added in manufacturing at factor cost in nominal

and real terms were obtained from national account statistics. The

national account data in nominal terms are net of inventory appreciation,

except for France and Italy. For France, we adjusted these data by using

an estImate of inventory appreciation derived from the data on inventory

appreciation for the whole nonagricultural economy. For Italy, we had

to make an even rougher adjustment on the basis of the observed relation

between inflation and inventory appreciation in the other five countries.

     A problem with the data on value added in real terms is that they

are derived by using the double—deflation method. As Bruno (1984) has

shown, double deflation may introduce a downward bias in the measurement

of the growth rate of real value added when the average price of raw

materials and energy changes monotonically relative to the price of out-

put. Actually, there is little risk of a double—deflation bias because

of changes in raw material prices as far as the whole 1973—82 period is

concerned. In relative terms, the average price of raw materials used

in manufacturing declined slowly from 1955 to 1972, rose sharply in

1973—74, declined sharply in 1975, then entered a new period of slow

decline interrupted by a brief rise in 1978—79. Thus, as long as the

weights used for recent years are not based on the abnormal relative

price of 1973—74, which is not the case in any of the seven countries

considered here, the bias due to the change in the relative price of
                                    - 52   -              APPENDIX



raw materials will be small. The doubling in the real price of energy

from 1972 to 1982, coming after a period of gradual decline, is a more

serious problem. Whenever possible, we have sought to avoid this poten-

tial source of bias by using series of real value added based on post—

1973 weights from 1972 onwards and on pre—1973 weights for 1955—72. But

for four countries, the United States, Canada, France, and Italy, this

could not be done because national account statistics based on post—1973

weights are not yet available. For these countries, therefore, the esti-

mate of X in model A for the post—1972 period may be downward biased.

However, a comparison of the data on real value added based on post—1973

weights with the data based on pre—1973 weights for Japan, the Federal

Republic of Germany, and the United Kingdom suggests that the bias is not

very large (say, an average of 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points per annum for

the whole period 1973—82). There is no problem in model B because the

cost of energy is not subtracted from gross output.

     The data on labor cost were also obtained from national account

statistics. Labor costs include not only the wage bill, but also all

fringe benefits, employers' social security contributions, and employment

and payroll taxes.

Man—hours worked in manufacturing

     For all countries except France, the data were provided by the U.S.

Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Office of Productivity

and Technology, hereafter referred to as the BLS. The data are for man-

hours worked, except for the United States where the only data available
                                  — 53 -                   APPENDIX



are for man—hours paid. For France, the series for the whole manufactur-

ing sector were derived by aggregating the series for the food, interme-

diate, capital, and consumer goods industries provided by the Institute

National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques (INSEE).

Overall unemployment and vacancy rates

     The data on unemployment and vacancies were obtained from Main

Economic Indicators, OECD, Paris, various issues. The data on unem-

ployment are in percent of the civilian labor force, except for Japan,

France, and the United Kingdom, where they are in percent of the total

labor force. The data on vacancies are in percent of the civilian labor

force for the Federal Republic of Germany; in percent of the total labor

force for Japan, France, and the United Kingdom; and in index form for

the United States and Canada.

     The unemployment rate corresponding to a situation of high employ-

ment in the whole economy was estimated by using the Beveridge—Curve

method (see main text). The estimates are: for the United States,

3.4 percent for 1955—69, 4.8 percent for 1972—74, and 5.7 percent for

1977—80; for Canada, 3.4 percent for 1955—68, 5.5 percent for 1972—74,

and 7.2 percent for 1977—80; for Japan, 1.1 percent for 1955—71, 1.3

percent for 1972—78, and 1.6 percent for 1978—80; for France, 1 percent

for 1955—68, 2.6 percent for 1972—78, and 3.6 percent for 1979—80; for

the Federal Republic of Germany, 0.7 percent for 1961—71 and 2.2 percent

for 1975—80; and for the United Kingdom, 1.2 percent for 1955—66, 1.8

percent for 1969—71, 2.6 percent for 1973—76, and 4.6 percent for
                                               — 54 -            APPENDIX



1978—80. No estimate is made for years for which the observations fell

in between two Beveridge curves. (In the present study, an estimate is

required only for years corresponding to a cyclical peak for the number

of man—hours worked in manufacturing.) For Italy, the Beveridge—Curve

method could not be used because there is no data on vacancies. From

1955 to 1974, we used a "trend—through—peaks" method, with the unemploy-

ment rate at each cyclical peak in employment assumed equal to U. For

the 1980 peak, we assumed somewhat arbitrarily that U was equal to 6.5

percent, about 1 percentage point above the unemployment rate reached

at the 1974 cyclical peak.

Gross fixed capital stock in manufacturing

           First, estimates of gross fixed capital stock in manufacturing

without adjustment for changes in its mean age were derived from data

on gross fixed capital formation in constant prices by employing the

perpetual inventory method, which consists of cumulating past investment

flows and deducting the equipment discarded from the stock. Except for

Japan, the calculation starts from a benchmark estimate of the capital

stock at the beginning of 1920. For Japan, the calculation starts from

a 1950 benchmark estimate. The capital stock at the beginning of year

t, K', was calculated by the formula:
       t


(20)                 =   K"   ert + E (1 —   4)1 At_i
                 t        0        i=1

where ert is the proportion of the initial (1920) capital stock that

remains at the beginning of year t, At_i is the capital stock installed
                                    — 55 —                  APPENDIX




in   year t—i;    is the proportion of the capital stock corresponding

to At_i that has been retired by the beginning of year t; t is zero at

the beginning of 1920; and At_i is set equal to zero before 1920.

       In the calculation, it is assumed that the capital stock installed

in year t is a lag function of the investment flows,

(21)         At = 0.30   It + 0.50 It_i + 0.20 1t—2

where the coefficients take into account the average time needed for

new projects to be completed and become fully productive. 27

       The calculations were made separately for machinery and equipment,

and for structures, with an average service life of 15 years for machinery

and equipment and 35 years for structures. 28 Actual retirements from

capital stock accumulated after 1920 were calculated following a Winfrey

S—3 distribution, with discards starting at 45 percent of the average

life. 29 Special adjustments were made for damages suffered during World

War II. Moreover, the energy price increases of 1973—74 and 1979—80 were

estimated to have brought about the early discard of, respectively, 10

percent of the capital stock of early 1974 during 1974—76 and 10 percent

of the capital stock of early 1980 during 1980—82. (For further expla-

nation on these adjustments for energy price increases, see main text.)

     Data on investment for 1982 were obtained from various published

and unpublished sources or were based on Staff estimates; they must be

considered very preliminary.

     In the calculation of the series on capital stock, the post—1965

data on investment for the United States were adjusted by netting out

the pollution abatement investment obtained from the June issues of the

Survey of Current Business, U.S. Department of Commerce, various years.

For Canada and Japan, the post—1969 data on investment were cut by 5

percent to take into account that, with the intensification of the

efforts to reduce pollution, there had also been a marked increase in

the proportion of investments that do not contribute to value added in

these two countries. (See main text for further explanation.)

     Second, estimates of the mean age of the capital stock were obtained

from the same investment data, with the same adjustments for war, energy
                                       - 58   -              APPENDIX




price   increases and the drive to reduce pollution. Here also, the cal-

culations were made separately for machinery and equipment, and for

structures. The mean age (Z) was calculated by the formula:
                         /        n
(22)          Z =   (t.K0    ert + i (1 —     4j) A...)/K

                                 i=1

       For each of the two types of capital goods, the estimate of the
capital stock adjusted for deviations of the mean age from the 1967 level

was then defined as:

(23)          Kt = K1    et —    Z1967)
                     t


where the rate of embodied technical progress (4) is equal to 0.02

for machinery and equipment, and 0.05 for structures. 30

        Finally, data on the total capital stock were obtained by summing

the adjusted stocks of machinery and equipment, and of structures.

Energy use in manufacturing

        Data on total final consumption of energy in manufacturing in mil-

lion tons of oil equivalent were obtained from Energy Balances of OECD
                                                                         31
Countries, International Energy Agency, OECD, Paris, various issues.

The data excludes the consumption of energy products for purposes other

than energy generation.

        Indices of the average price of energy inputs in the manufacturing

sector were provided by the International Energy Agency. Estimates of

average prices in units of local currency were derived by using these

  1    am indebted to Joshua Felman, Morris Goldstein, Mohsin Khan,

Malcolm Knight, and many colleagues in area departments for helpful com-

ments and suggestions. Gertrud Windsperger provided invaluable research

assistance.

  2 Malinvaud (1977, 1982) presents an updated theoretical analysis of

the relation between inappropriate real wages and unemployment. Sachs

(1979, 1983), Branson and Rotemberg (1980), Drze and Modigliani (1981),

Bruno and Sachs (1982), Giersch (1982), Kouri, Braga de Macedo, and

Viscio (1982), Grubb, Jackman, and Layard (1983), Knight (1983), Stein—

herr (1983), and Lipschitz and Schadler (1984) are some of the main

advocates of the view that the level of the real wage rate is a major

obstacle to a return to high employment in European countries. Sachs

(1983) and others found evidence of inappropriately high real wages in

the United States and in Japan, but they did not detect marked effects

on unemployment in these two countries.

  3 There is also some evidence that in a number of countries the share

of labor costs in value added has risen in other sectors during the past

decade and a half, but this evidence is difficult to interpret. Sectors

such as transport, communication, and utilities are largely under public

control in most industrial countries so that the profit motive does not

play an important role in determining their demand for labor. In the

private service sector, it is difficult to define the share of labor

costs because of the high proportion of persons working on their own

account.

 4 Among the studies listed in footnote 1 on p. 1, Knight (1983) and

Llpschitz and Schadler (1984) use a production function approach to allow

for the effect of changes in the relative availability of labor and capi—

tal on the warranted share of labor costs in value added, but they ignore

the possible effect of changes in production techniques and in the price

of energy on this share. The other studies assume that any sustained gap

between the growth of the real wage rate defined from the employer's

standpoint and the growth of labor productivity implies a disequilibrium

situation. Basevi et. al. (1983) have rightly stressed the drawbacks of

such an assumption and the need for a comprehensive production function

approach.

  5 A discussion of these dynamic effects can be found in Malinvaud

(1977, 1982) and Bruno and Sachs (1982).

  6 The assumption of constant returns to scale was tested as part of

the empirical study by adding a scale parameter to equation (1). This

parameter was not found to be significantly different from unity.

  7 The demand for labor is derived under the assumption that the flow

of capital services is given. To derive it, it is more convenient from

a mathematical standpoint to use equation (1) rather than its linear

approximation represented by equation (2).

  8 A possible solution would be to have a separate distributed lag on

w/p and Y, but here again there would be a problem of multicollinearity.

The major change in w/p took place in the early 1970s and it would be
                                  — 66 —




                          FOOTNOTES (Continued)



difficult to disentangle its effect on the demand for labor from the

effect of the likely concomitant change in the rate of technical progress.

  9 Consideration of the conditions in the steel and shipbuilding indus-

tries in European countries during the 1970s and early 1980s suggests that

a disequilibrium situation involving low or negative profitability and

an excess of labor can at times last more than a decade.

  10 In European countries, it is the wage explosion of late 1969 that

is usually considered to mark the beginning of the real wage problem. In

the United States and Canada, the beginning of the problem Is usually

traced to the 1973—74 oil price increase.

  11 For the United States, the only data available are for man—hours

paid.

  12 The gross capital stock refers to the equipment that has not been

discarded. In this context, if some equipment has lost x percent of its

initial efficiency, then x percent of the equipment is considered to have

been discarded. By contrast, the net capital stock excludes not only

discards, but also the depreciation of the equipment that has not been

discarded. This depreciation reflects the fact that while the equipment

still has its original efficiency, its remaining expected life expectancy

is shorter than on the date of purchase. In the main, the net capital

stock can be viewed as the discounted value of the expected stream of

capital services to be derived from the existing capital stock. Thus,

normally, the net value of equipment will start declining well ahead of

any decline in the flow of services that can be derived from that equip-

ment. For that reason, no attempt is made to use the net capital stock

in the present study.

  13 The other equations involve variables such as SL, SL, w/p, and L

that are not influenced by cyclical developments.

  14 It has been argued that various other factors, especially the male—

female ratio, should be taken into account in the calculation of the

amount of labor input. This has led Perry (1971), Perloff and Wachter

(1980) and others to calculate weighted indices of man—hours, with the

weights based on the relative pay scales for the various components of

the labor force. However, for the manufacturing sector, these indices

have usually been found to deviate little from simple indices based on

the unweighted man—hours. A good review of issues related to the

measurement of labor services can be found in Baily (1981).

  18 The estimation was carried out with the minimum—distance estimation

routine of the Research Analysis Language (RAL) program. In order to

make possible the estimation of the production and share functions as a

system of two simultaneous equations, the variables in the share func-

tions were set at zero during 1970—82 or 1974—82, depending upon the

group of countries. The estimation was then carried out for the period

through 1982. The standard error of estimate of each equation was

recalculated after reducing the number of degrees of freedom for the

observations in the share functions corresponding to 1970—82 or 1974—82.

  19 As explained in the Statistical Appendix, in the United States,

Canada, France, and Italy, the estimated value of At for 1973—82 in

model A may be biased downward to a small extent because the data on real

value added for this period are calculated on the basis of the pre—1973

relative price of energy.

  20 The estimates are as follows (with a star indicating those that

are significant at the 5 percent level):

      As these estimates are based on the ordinary least squares method,

they have the usual statistical properties. The standard errors are

often much larger than those presented in Table 3, but most of them are

still relatively small.

  21 This method assumes that SE and ln(K/E) were relatively stable

during the pre—1972 period. For Canada, where K/E was declnng at a

marked rate during the l96Os and early l97Os, the 1972—82 change in

ln(K/E) was calculated in terms of deviations from the 1962—72 tendency.

  22 This estimate of      can be compared to the E—K gross substitu-

tion elasticities of 0.133 for the U.S. manufacturing sector, 0.501 for

Canadian manufacturing in Ontario, and 0.650 for Canadian manufacturing

in British Columbia, obtained by Berndt and Wood (1979) on the basis of

pre—1972 data. It Implies that an increase in the price of energy may

lead to a decline in the demand for capital services. For example, a

100 percent increase in the price of energy could lead to an increase

in pK* of 15 percent (assuming that energy represents initially 15

percent of the total energy and capital cost), an increase in p* of

5 percent (assuming that energy represents initially 5 percent of the

total labor, capital, and energy cost), and a decline in the demand for

K* of 7 percent (assuming an elasticity of substitution of 0.7 between

K* and L and a fixed amount of L). With an elasticity of substitution

of 0.3 between K and E, the ratio of E to K would change by 30 percent.

The final result would be a drop in the demand for E of 32 percent and a
                                  — 70 —




                          FOOTNOTES (Continued)



drop in the demand for K of 2 percent (averaging to the drop in K* of 7

percent given the 15 percent weight on E and the 85 percent weight on K).

   23 From equation (12), we see that if L is one percent greater than

L, the equilibrium share corresponding to K/L will differ from that

corresponding to K/L by 8(o +     t) (l— —        t) percent. Based on the

estimates presented in table 3, this difference ranges from plus 0.2 per-

cent in the United States to 0.05 percent in Canada.

  24 It can be noted that this adjustment is more sizable than it

appears because in France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Japan, payroll

taxes rose sharply during 1979—82 so that the growth of the take—home

wage was even lower than the growth of the gross wage considered here

(see Steinherr (1983)). By contrast, in the United States, payroll taxes

were reduced during this period, decreasing the need for a cut in the

take—home wage.

  25 The present study ends in 1982; however, the preliminary data

available for 1983 suggest that, except in the United Kingdom, little

progress was made toward adjustment during that year. The share of labor

costs in value added in manufacturing may have declined by 1 to 2 per-

centage points in the United States, Canada, France, and the Federal

Republic of Germany, and risen by 1 to 2 percentage points in Japan and

Italy. Account being taken of cyclical developments, this represented

probably a small decline in the wage gap, by say 2 percentage points,

in France and Germany, a small rise in Japan, and not much change in the
                                  - 71   -




                         FOOTNOTES (Continued)



other countries. In contrast, the share of labor costs may have declined

by about 4 percentage points in the United Kingdom which, once taken

account of the modest economic recovery, may represent a decline in the

wage gap of 4 or 5 percentage points.

  26 A comprehensive empirical analysis showing that increases in labor

shares (or in product wages) have had a negative effect on employment

growth in Europe can be found in Steinherr (1983).

  27 Extensive studies of the lag from start of construction to comple-

tion have been made by Mayer (1960). The coefficients of equation (21)

are based on Mayer's result and an assumed start—up period of two quarters.

  28 These estimates are based on the 1942 edition of Bulletin F of the

U.S. Treasury Department, which remains standard for calculations of

capital stocks in the United States. A recent survey by Blades (1983)

found that calculation of capital stocks made in other industrial coun-

tries are normally based on discard rates similar to the U.S. rates. The

two major exceptions are Japan, with more rapid discard rates, and the

United Kingdom, with slower discard rates. Given that most capital goods

are similar throughout the industrial world, however, there was little

reason in the context of the present study to assume that their economic

efficiency" changed persistently at markedly different rates in the

various countries.

  30 The estimates of 0.02 and 0.05 were initially suggested by Solow

in his pioneering article (1957). Econometric results consistent with

these estimates were obtained in Artus and Turner (1978).

  31 The data published by the International Energy Agency refer to the

industrial sector, but the definition of the industrial sector used by

this Agency is comparable to the normal definition of the manufacturing

sector in national account statistics.
