                                          ABSTRACT

This paper studies how health behaviors and investments are shaped through family spillovers.
Leveraging administrative healthcare data, we identify the effects of health shocks to individuals
on their family members' consumption of preventive care and health-related behaviors. Our
identification strategy utilizes the timing of shocks to construct counterfactuals for affected
households using households that experience the same shock but a few years in the future. We
find that spouses and adult children immediately increase their health investments and improve
their health behaviors in response to family shocks, and that these effects are both significant and
persistent. Notably, we show that these spillover effects are far-reaching and cascade to siblings,
stepchildren, sons and daughters in-law, and even ‚Äúclose‚Äù coworkers. While some responses are
consistent with learning new information about one's own health, evidence from cases where
shocks are likely uninformative points to salience as a major operative explanation. Our results
underscore the importance of one's family and social network for models of health behaviors and
have potential implications for policies that aim to improve population health.

1 Introduction
    Health behaviors, broadly dened as any action, investment, or consumption choice that can aect

health and mortality risk, are a key input in the production of individuals' health (McGinnis and

Foege 1993; Mokdad et al. 2004; Cutler et al. 2009). These behaviors take a variety of forms including

both adverse habits, such as smoking and drinking, and positive actions, such as the consumption of

risk-reducing preventive care. The importance of identifying what determines health-related behaviors,

which are notorious for being hard to change, has led to an active literature on a range of potential
                                                                                                          1
factors, with some particular focus on nancial incentives and health education.                              Still, we lack a clear

understanding of the channels through which health behaviors and habits evolve over the life cycle.

    A long tradition of economic research has underscored the importance of family interactions in

determining individual behavior, particularly in the context of consumption and labor supply choices

(Becker 1991; Browning et al. 2014). Similarly, there could be a role for the family in forming health
                                                                                                                        2
behaviors, via the ow of information, awareness, and the creation of habits and norms.                                     Yet, iden-

tifying causal relationships of family spillovers that can aect health behaviors is challenging due to
                                                                                                                    3
the possibility of correlated unobservables across and within generations of the family.                                Moreover, it

requires large data sets on health and consumption of healthcare with linkages across family members.

    In this paper, we study how family spillovers, both within and across generations, shape health

behaviors over the natural course of the life cycle. Specically, we estimate the causal eects of health

shocks to individuals on their family members' consumption of preventive care and health-related be-

haviors, focusing on spouses and adult children. Our estimation strategy relies on the timing of shocks,

constructing counterfactuals for aected households using households that experience the same shock

but a few years in the future. We leverage a long panel of administrative data, which covers the entire

adult Danish population from the years 1980-2011 and includes medication prescriptions, contacts with

medical-care professionals, inpatient and outpatient hospitalizations, and death records. An important

advantage of our setting is the ability to link across dierent family and social connections, which

enables us to investigate the scope of spillovers within one's network.

    Put together, our ndings identify intra- and inter-generational family spillovers as a prevalent

causal channel through which health behaviors evolve. Spouses and adult children immediately increase

their health investments and improve their health behaviors in response to shocks. We show that these

eects are economically signicant and exhibit a high degree of persistence: a single family shock can

explain 28% and 15% of the growth in consumption of preventive care over a nine-year period around

the event by younger adult children and prime-age spouses, respectively. We further nd that these

spillovers in healthcare consumption are far-reaching across one's network with a meaningful implied

evidence from randomized evaluations in developing countries.
   2 A series of papers documents correlations among peers and family members, mostly across spouses, in a variety of health-related
behaviors (as reviewed in, e.g., Meyler et al. 2007 and Cawley and Ruhm 2011).
   3 Some interesting recent studies aim to address this challenge.    Cutler and Glaeser (2010) exploit smoking bans at the workplace

to study spousal smoking behavior; Fletcher and Marksteiner (2017) analyze spouses' behavior in clinical interventions to reduce

individuals' smoking and alcohol consumption; and Cawley et al.          (2017) study eects across siblings in weight and obesity by

instrumenting for a sibling's obesity using genetic risk scores.




                                                                   1
multiplier: the eects cascade to siblings, stepchildren, sons and daughters in-law, and even close

coworkers, who exhibit responses of the same order of magnitude as spouses. In contrast, there are no

eects (precisely estimated) on distant coworkers with likely weaker social ties. Overall, our analysis

reveals spillovers in consumption within the context of healthcare that are signicant in magnitude,

far-reaching, and long-lasting.

    Studying the multiple network layers and the heterogeneity in their responses allows us to also

probe into mechanisms.           Guided by the literature and the empirical patterns, we conceptualize two

major classes of mechanisms by which network shocks can trigger changes in health behaviors. The

rst channel is potential learning and revelation of new information about one's                            own   risk.    Adult

children may be induced to learn of their genetic risk, for example, whereas spouses may be exposed to

information on joint risks attributed to similar lifestyles and habits. The second channel is the shock's

salience itself, where one's attention may be drawn to the health domain even when shocks are unlikely

to reveal new information.

    With these channels in mind, we investigate responses by the dierent network circles and exploit

the richness of the data to proxy for the degree of exposure to a shock, the scope of pre-shock knowledge

of one's own health risks, and the extent to which the shock may bear new information.                                     While

dierent mechanisms seem to be at play, including learning information about one's own health, there

is consistent evidence in support of salience as a key operative explanation. The ndings suggest that

agents' attention is specically drawn to the local nature of the shock so they take actions particular

to that risk's domain.

    To study how health behaviors are shaped through family spillovers, our core analysis focuses on

the eects of non-fatal heart attacks and strokes. Heart attacks and strokes are commonly studied as

sudden and severe events whose particular timing is likely unpredictable, and are therefore particularly

well-suited for our empirical strategy (see, e.g., Chandra and Staiger 2007; Doyle 2011). These cardio-

vascular shocks also naturally t our research question as they are directly tied to disease-specic risk-

reducing preventive care, i.e., the cholesterol-lowering medication statins, the consumption of which we

study as our main outcome. Moreover, the prevalence of these health shocks and of statin consumption
                                                                                                                       4
as preventive care render this application directly relevant for a large share of the population.

    We begin with intra-generational analysis of spouses, where spillovers cannot be attributed to

biological channels.       We show that prime-age individuals immediately increase their consumption of

statins by 15% in response to their spouse's cardiovascular shock, and that this increased take-up

persists for the duration of our analysis horizon. The eects on statin use are accompanied by a prompt

increase of 30% in blood tests for cholesterol levels that determine cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, we

show that spouses with higher predicted risk are much more likely to increase their statin consumption.

However, we nd no such risk gradient in spouses' information-seeking behavior through cholesterol

testing. This implies that spouses across predictable risk types are similarly prompted to take actions


   4 Cardiovascular   shocks are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the developed world (WHO 2014). They

account for 1 in every 3 deaths among adults in the U.S. (with similar rates across the developed world), and every year more than

1.5 million Americans experience either a heart attack or a stroke. Statins are among the most widely prescribed and best-selling

medications, with the global market for statins estimated to be $20 billion annually in the last decade (Redberg and Katz 2016).




                                                                2
related to cardiovascular risk (through data gathering), but those with higher predicted risk end up

having larger statin responses in practice, consistent with learning induced by the family shock. We

additionally show that spouses in couples with more similar risk proles, who are presumably more likely

to learn from the shock about their own health risks, exhibit stronger statin consumption responses.

    We next refer to the medical literature, which asserts that the relevant information for receiving

cholesterol-reducing treatment is observable risk factors and cholesterol levels.                        Hence, spouses (and

other non-blood relatives) who had been tested for cholesterol levels in the pre-shock period, have

already gained access to the risk-related information set pertinent to statin consumption. Still, even

such spouses exhibit similar-magnitude responses; so while the evidence points to a likely role of

family shocks in inducing learning of own health risks, it simultaneously suggests the salience of the

health condition as a likely channel. Alternative explanations, such as supply-side responses of family

physicians who aggregate information across household members or greater valuation of spouse's health

(who could become the main earner or caregiver), do not appear to be operative.

    We then turn to study how parental shocks spill over to health behaviors in the next generation.

For both younger and older adult children we nd large and persistent statin consumption increases

in response to parental cardiovascular shocks. We show that their responses are immediate and grow

stronger over time, so that by the end of the analysis period of four years they amount to 36% and 16%

for younger and older children, respectively. We nd comparable patterns and response magnitudes by

siblings, who are likely subject to similar impact mechanisms.

    To take a step toward isolating potential mechanisms in the spillovers among the next generation, we

study network circles for whom dierent channels may be at play. First, to abstract from the biological-

risk channel, we analyze spillovers to stepchildren whose responses in statin consumption average to

an 11% increase, which is half as large as that by biological children. To additionally abstract from the

spillover channel of a family environment shared in childhood, we study the potential spillovers to sons

and daughters in-law. We show that they exhibit an average increase in preventive-care consumption

that amounts to about a quarter of that by their spouses, i.e., the biological children. Consistent with

exposure intensity, we nd that the eects on sons and daughters in-law are entirely driven by those

who live closer to their in-laws. Lastly, we move on to study individuals who are connected only through

social ties. We show that close coworkers, as dened by similarity of ages and occupations, exhibit

prompt responses, with spillover patterns that are very similar in their dynamics and magnitude to

that of prime-age spouses.

    To increase our understanding of spillovers, we next analyze the eects of fatal family shocks,

focusing on spouses.           We rst show that fatal shocks increase family members' general awareness

regarding their own health. We nd increased rates of hospitalizations for suspected conditions that are

ruled out upon examination and of urgent-care doctor visits. Likewise, we show signicant behavioral

improvements in the form of decreases in key harmful habits, which we nd even when the shock
                                                                                               5
does not bear new information on the risk involved in these behaviors.                             Specically, we show that


   5 Existing   related work studies quality of care and health behaviors following spousal bereavement, mainly to test whether they

can account for corresponding declines in health (see a review in Stahl and Schulz 2014). These papers use designs dierent from

ours and generally compare outcomes before and after bereavement or around the event, or compare widowed to non-widowed

individuals. In contrast to our analysis, their comparisons mostly nd no changes or some declines in quality of care or in healthy




                                                                  3
family members immediately engage in consumption of medications prescribed to assist in cessation of

smoking or excessive drinking. We also nd reductions in consumption of addictive harmful medication

by studying prescription opioids, which account for the greatest share of deaths linked to prescription

drug abuse.
                                                                            6
    Spousal death can have signicant direct health eects.                     To take a step toward isolating behavioral

responses in this context, we study heterogeneity among treated spouses only, with the idea that

they all face the main eects of the shock. We exploit variation in exact causes of spousal death to

study consumption of dierent condition-specic preventive care, both within and across conditions,

in the contexts of cardiovascular disease and cancer. We show that individuals whose spouse died of

cardiovascular disease persistently consume statins at higher rates compared to those whose spouse

died of other causes. In the same vein, individuals whose spouse died of cancer as compared to other

causes, signicantly increase their expenditure on diagnostic radiologists, who specialize in screening

for major types of cancer. Importantly, we nd similar responses in the case of husbands whose wives

died of female cancers, where the spouse's cancer type is not likely informative of own cancer risk

(which we verify in the data), consistent with a salience channel.

    These ndings highlight that family members' behavioral responses target the domain of the par-

ticular experienced risk. To stress this point, we further show that the behavioral changes are local

to the vicinity of the experienced risk's domain, by studying cross-condition responses.                               We nd no

dierential expenditures on diagnostic radiology by individuals whose spouse died of cardiovascular

disease.     Moreover, in the context of fatal cancer, we even nd declines in spouses' consumption of

preventive care against cardiovascular disease.                Consistent with the notion of limited attention, this

result raises the possibility of crowd out. Namely, it is not only that individuals increase their take-up

of preventive care specic to the family shock, even in cases that are likely uninformative, but they

may also reduce their take-up of preventive care that pertains to other, non-salient health risks.

    In addition to the literature already mentioned, our ndings also contribute to the theoretical work

on health-related habits and choices (e.g., Grossman 1972; Becker and Murphy 1988; Orphanides and

Zervos 1995; Laibson 2001; Bernheim and Rangel 2004). The results point to a role of one's network

in health-related habit formation and underscore the importance of incorporating inter-personal inter-

actions across dierent family generations and peers in analyzing health behaviors, investments, and

the consumption of healthcare. The response patterns also highlight learning and, specically, salience

and attention as key modeling components (as in, e.g., DellaVigna 2009, Bordalo et al. 2012, 2013,
                         7
and Gabaix 2017),            and point to event-driven responses, in line with frameworks such as Bernheim


behaviors, where an exception is Jin and Christakis (2009). Relatedly, Khwaja et al. (2006) study associations between smoking

and spousal health in the Health and Retirement Study.
   6 Previous literature (see Stroebe et al. 2007 for a review) and our own investigation based on hospitalization data nd meaningful
eects on spouses' physical health. This is in contrast to non-fatal cardiovascular shocks, where we nd no evidence for such eects

on family members. We provide this analysis later in the paper.
   7 Our   work is consistent with recent ndings from interventions in developing economies. In their review of randomized evalu-

ations that involve peer inuences on health behaviors, Kremer and Glennerster (2011) argue that while some of the ndings are

potentially driven by learning, others likely reect alternative channels such as salience, as in the case of the work by Zwane et al.

(2011) who nd that the act of being surveyed aects behavior. Our work is also related to the growing evidence of how limited

attention and salience aect economic behavior in a variety of settings; see DellaVigna (2009) and Gabaix (2017) for reviews.




                                                                  4
and Rangel's (2004) cue-triggered decision making model. More generally, the results can additionally

advance our understanding of the nature and scope of broader network eects in consumption, here
                                                      8
through the lens of healthcare utilization.

    Lastly, the ndings could also have implications for policies that aim to promote population health.

They emphasize that health behaviors are not immutable and suggest the leveraging of family events

as a window of opportunity for intervention, involving the required intrinsic motives for persistent

behavioral changes. One could exploit these events to provide family members with individual-specic

information on risks; or to introduce policies that leverage salience of health to actively oer preventive

care. However, the evidence also suggests more broadly that salience should be used with caution as a

policy tool. Agents' attention can be drawn to specic risks even in the absence of relevant information,

which could end in excessive healthcare consumption; and, at the same time, their attention may be

diverted away from conditions of which they might be at higher risk.

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe our empirical strategy

to estimate the eects of adverse health shocks on family and network members' health behaviors.

Section 3 outlines the data sources we use, the analysis sample, and the institutional environment.

The empirical evidence on spillovers in health behaviors is presented in Section 4. Section 5 discusses

the implications of our ndings and concludes.




2 Research Design
    The goal of our analysis is to identify the dynamic causal eects of severe health shocks on family

members' consumption of preventive care and health-related behaviors. In this section, we describe

the empirical strategy that we use to overcome the selection challenges inherent in the identication of

these eects and state our estimating equation. We also outline the specications we employ to analyze

heterogeneity in treatment eects to shed light on the nature of spillovers and underlying mechanisms.



2.1 Primary Quasi-Experiment
    The ideal experiment for identifying the short- and medium-run eects of health shocks would

randomly assign shocks to families and track responses in health behaviors over time. Therefore, we

need to compare the ex-post responses to shocks of aected households to a counterfactual behavior

of ex-ante similar unaected households.                  This requires comparing households with similar expecta-

tions over the distribution of future paths, but with dierent realizations, to isolate the unanticipated

component of the shock. The access to a long panel of administrative data on the universe of Danish

households allows us to utilize a quasi-experimental research design to mimic this ideal experiment,

by exploiting the potential randomness of the timing of a severe health shock within a short period of

time.

    To do so, we look only at households that have experienced the shocks that we consider at some

point in our sample period, and identify the treatment eect from the timing at which the shock


   8 De   Giorgi, Frederiksen, and Pistaferri (2016) provide a brief review of the work on consumption within the network and study

consumption network eects (analyzing total spending) by exploiting interactions between one's household and coworker networks.




                                                                 5
was realized. Specically, we construct counterfactuals for aected households using households that

experience the same shock but a few years in the future. As such, our two experimental groups consist

of a treatment group, composed of family members in households that experience a shock in year                                   œÑ,
and a matched control group, composed of family members from the                          same   cohorts in households that

experience the same shock but in year                œÑ + 4.     We then recover the treatment eect by performing

traditional event studies for these two experimental groups and combining them into a straightforward

dynamic dierence-in-dierences estimator. That is, we identify the treatment eect purely from the

change in the dierences in outcomes across the two groups over time.

     The trade-o in the choice of          4,   which captures the main limitation of the design, weighs compa-

rability against analysis horizon. On the one hand, we would want to choose a smaller                               4    such that

the control group is more closely comparable to the treatment group, e.g., those who experienced the

shock a year apart which corresponds to               4 = 1.    On the other hand, we would want to choose a larger

4   in order to be able to identify longer-run eects of the shock, since for each chosen                           4   the estima-

tion strategy provides estimates for up to period                4 ‚àí 1.    For example, using those who experienced a

shock ten years apart (4            = 10)   will allow us to estimate the eect of the shock for up to nine years.

However, this entails a potentially larger bias since the pre-trend in the behavior of this group might

not be tightly parallel to that of the treatment group. Our choice of                    4   is ve years, such that we can

identify eects up to four years after the shock.                 We assessed the robustness of our analysis to this

choice and found that local perturbations to                4   provide very similar results.

     The identifying assumption is that, absent the realization of the shock, the outcomes of the treat-

ment and control groups would run parallel. The plausibility of this assumption relies on the notion

that within the window of time of length               4,   the particular year at which the shock occurs may be as

good as random. To test the validity of our assumption, we accompany our empirical analysis with

the treatment and control groups' behavior in the four years prior to the (actual or assigned) shock

year (period 0) in order to assess their co-movement in the pre-shock periods. We consistently show

throughout the analysis that there are virtually no dierential changes in the trends of the treatment

and control groups before period 0. This validates the design and alleviates concerns that the groups

may dier by, for example, their expectations over the                  particular   year of the shock within our chosen
                                9
ve-year window of         4.

econometric models.

down into two steps. The rst step constructs our treatment and control groups and, in the second

step, estimation and inference are conducted using traditional methods.                          We describe the two steps

successively.

     Fix a group of cohorts, denoted by               ‚Ñ¶,    and consider estimating the treatment eect of a shock


    9 The   empirical strategy allows for behavioral adjustments in expectation of a shock among treated households, as well as for

baseline time trends in outcomes that could be attributed to assortative matching across spouses or to genetic correlations across

parents and children. By construction, the strategy aims to provide a control group with non-dierential expectations and time

trajectories in the pre-shock years, as manifested by the parallel pre-trends across the two experimental groups.




                                                                  6
experienced at some point in the time interval                      [œÑ1 , œÑ2 ]     by individuals whose family members belong to

group     ‚Ñ¶.     We refer to these individuals' family members as the treatment group and divide them into

sub-groups indexed by the year in which the shock was experienced,                                     œÑ ‚àà [œÑ1 , œÑ2 ].   We normalize the time

of observation such that the time period,                   t,   is measured with respect to the year of the shockthat is,

t = year ‚àí œÑ , where year               is the calendar year of the observation. As a control group, using only timing,

we match to each treated group                   œÑ   the family members from the same cohort group                                 ‚Ñ¶   of individuals

who experienced the same shock but at                     œÑ + 4,    for a given choice of              4.        For these households we assign

a placebo shock at           t=0        by normalizing time in the same way that we do for the treatment group,

i.e.,   t = year ‚àí œÑ       (where, by construction, their actual shock occurs at                                 t = 4).10
        Denote the mean outcome of the treatment group at time                                    t   by   ytT   and the mean outcome of the

control group at time              t       C
                                       by yt , and choose a baseline period prior to the shock (e.g., period                                t = ‚àí1)
which we denote by              p      (for prior).    For any period            r > 0,        the treatment eect           Œ¥r      can be simply

recovered by the dierence-in-dierences estimator


                                                      Œ¥r ‚â° yrT ‚àí yrC ‚àí ypT ‚àí ypC .
                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                  (1)

The treatment eect in period                   r    is measured by the dierence in outcomes between the treatment

group and the control group at time                   r, purged of the dierence in their outcomes at the baseline period
p.    The choice of        4   puts an upper bound on               r   such that              r < 4       (since the control group becomes

treated at        t = 4).
        Estimating Equation.             To study the evolution of household responses, we estimate the regression

counterpart of the dynamic dierences-in-dierences estimator of equation (1). The regression speci-

cation allows the inclusion of controls which increases precision, and further balances the treatment

and control groups in a systematic way in cases where the studied utilization codes appear in dierent

calendar years (due to institutional changes in reporting). For visualizing our empirical strategy, we

also provide within our initial set of results a graphical analysis of the raw data. We do so in the main

analysis of spouses and biological children, for whom ties are strongest and samples are largest. Our

main regression specication is of the form:
                                                     4
                                                     X                             4
                                                                                   X
                  yi,t = Œ± + Œ≤treati +                      Œ≥r √ó Ir +                          Œ¥r √ó Ir √ó treati + ŒªXi,t + Œµi,t .                  (2)
                                               r6=‚àí1;r=‚àí4                    r6=‚àí1;r=‚àí4
In this regression,         yi,t    denotes an outcome for household                       i   at time     t; treati   denotes an indicator for

whether a household belongs to the treatment group;                              Ir     are indicators for time relative to the assigned

shock year (actual shock for treatment and placebo shock for control); and                                             Xi,t   denotes a vector of

potential controls. The key parameters of interest are                             Œ¥r ,   which estimate the period            r   treatment eect

(r   > 0)      relative to the pre-period           p = ‚àí1.11    Validation of the parallel trends assumption requires that


     10 The   same household can appear both in the treatment group and in the control group, but is never used as a control to itself.

For example, if treated households that experienced a shock in 1990 (who are matched with households that experienced a shock

in 1995 as controls) are included also in the control group, it is only since households that experience a shock in 1985 are included

in the treatment group as well. We repeated our main analysis using treatment and control groups that do not overlap, either by

including in the treatment group (and matching them with the corresponding control group) households that experience shocks

in every other year, or by randomizing overlapping households to only one experimental group. The results remain similar (both

qualitatively and quantitatively) and are available from the authors on request.
     11 With   no controls and with the same choice of pre-period       p,   the   Œ¥r     estimates of the dynamic treatment eect for      r>0   from

(2) are identical to those from (1).




                                                                         7
Œ¥r = 0         for all   r < 0.   Unless otherwise indicated, we include in                    Xi,t    age xed eects, calendar year

xed eects, gender, and education, and we report robust standard errors clustered at the household

by experimental-group level.

       To quantify mean treatment eects, we estimate the standard dierence-in-dierences equation of

the following form, which averages over years before and after the shock:

                                yi,t = Œ± + Œ≤treati + Œ≥posti,t + Œ¥treati √ó posti,t + ŒªXi,t + Œµi,t .                                                   (3)

In this regression,          posti,t denotes an indicator for whether the observation belongs to post-shock periods.
The parameter            Œ¥   represents the average eect of shocks on family members' outcomes.



2.2 Response Heterogeneity
       There are two related strategies that we employ when analyzing the nature of the main treatment

eects.

       Heterogeneity Specication 1 .            We use the rst strategy when we are interested in estimating a

mean baseline eect and how it varies by some dimension or household characteristic of interest,                                                      zi
(which can be a vector). This regression simply augments the baseline dierence-in-dierences model

of equation (3) in the following way:

                               yi,t = Œ± + Œ≤treati + Œ≥posti,t + Œ¥i treati √ó posti,t + ŒªXi,t + Œµi,t ,                                                  (4)
       where
                                                            Œ¥i = Œ¥0 + Œ¥1 z i .
We adjust the basic dierence-in-dierences design by allowing the treatment eect,                                         Œ¥i ,   to vary across

households and model it as a function of the household's characteristic                                  zi .    Our parameter of interest

is   Œ¥1 ,    which captures the extent to which the family member's response correlates with                                       zi .12
       Heterogeneity Specication 2 .           We use the second strategy when we are interested in directly study-

ing how responses vary by some dimension or household characteristic,                                     zi ,   among treated households

only. Exploiting variation within the treatment group, the regression that follows the dynamics of the

heterogeneous responses around the event is of the following form:
                                                4
                                                X                             4
                                                                              X
                         yi,t = Œ± + Œ≤zi +                Œ≥r √ó Ir +                      Œ¥r √ó Ir √ó zi + ŒªXi,t + Œµi,t ,                                (5)
                                            r6=‚àí1;r=‚àí4                 r6=‚àí1;r=‚àí4
Equation (5) is similar to equation (2) but where                     treati     is replaced with         zi ,   so that the treatment and

control groups are now dened as households with dierent values of                                     zi   within the group of treated

households.           Consequentially, the same identifying assumption is required in the analysis of these

experimental groups, i.e., that absent the shock the outcome of households with dierent values of

zi    would run parallel.          As before, an implied necessary condition is that                             Œ¥r = 0   for   r < 0.       Similar

to equation (2), the key parameters of interest are                         Œ¥r   for   r > 0,       which estimate how the outcomes

for treated households with varying levels of                  zi    dierentially evolve around the event relative to the

omitted time category (period -1). Lastly, the corresponding equation that estimates how responses

vary on average across treated households with dierent levels of                              zi   takes the form:


                                  yi,t = Œ± + Œ≤zi + Œ≥posti,t + Œ¥ √ó zi √ó posti,t + ŒªXi,t + Œµi,t ,                                                      (6)


     12 In   the estimation of (4) we always include in the vector   Xi,t   the variables in   zi   as well as their interaction with       treati   and

posti,t .


                                                                      8
where   Œ¥   is the parameter of interest.




3 Data and Institutional Background
   In this section we describe our data sources and analysis sample, and provide relevant institutional

background.      The Danish setting that we study is a well-suited environment for identifying family

spillovers in health behaviors in the context of developed economies.       First, it provides us with the

required long panel of detailed administrative healthcare records for linked family members (and other

network circles). Moreover, the exact utilization codes included in the data allow us to identify health

investments and behavior proxies, and the large scale provides sucient statistical power for studying

dierent utilization outcomes.      Second, a key institutional feature of the Danish healthcare system

is the provision of near-complete and universal healthcare coverage. Importantly, this enables us to

identify eects that are not confounded by the availability of health insurance.



3.1 Data Sources
   Studying family members' health-related behavioral changes in response to severe health events

requires information on healthcare utilization outcomes and on health shocks, for the dierent members

of a household. We therefore combine several administrative Danish registers that include individual-

level records with family linkages from 1980 to 2011, which allow us to identify all families of married

and cohabiting couples and their adult children's households, as well as other layers of their family and

social network.

   For utilization outcomes that measure health behaviors, we use three databases that encompass

both primary and secondary healthcare utilization records with exact dates and codes. These include:

(1) the   Prescription Drug Database , covering all prescribed drugs that were purchased from 1995-2011
(where 90% of all medications are subject to prescriptions in Denmark), with detailed information on

doses prescribed and medication classication (using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] clas-

sication system); (2) the   Health Insurance Registry , covering all individual contacts with primary-care
physicians and     medical-care specialists outside of hospitals from 1985-2011; and (3) the National Pa-

tient Registry , covering all inpatient hospitalizations (from 1980-2011) and outpatient hospitalizations
(from 1994-2011), in both private and public hospitals, with detailed diagnoses (using the Interna-

tional Statistical Classication of Diseases and Related Health Problems [ICD] system). The specic

outcomes that we study are described within the empirical analysis in Section 4.

   For identifying family health shocks and their timing, we use the latter hospitalization dataset (the

National Patient Registry ) as well as the Cause of Death Registry , which includes exact death dates and
specic causes from 1980 onward. Lastly, we extract demographic variables such as gender, age, and

level of education from the    Integrated Database for Labor Market Research .   This dataset also includes

register-based matches across employers and employees, from which we construct coworker linkages.

   All monetary values of healthcare expenditure are reported in nominal Danish Kroner (DKK) de-

ated to 2000 prices using the consumer price index. In that year the exchange rate was approximately

DKK 8 per US $1.




                                                      9
3.2 Analysis Sample
     To construct our sample, we start from the universe of households in which an individual experi-

enced one of the shocks that we consider between the years 1985 and 2011, where all of our matches

across household members are based on the pre-shock period                        t = ‚àí1.    Our primary sample of non-fatal

health shocks is comprised of all households in which one individual experienced a heart attack or a

stroke (for the rst time) and survived for the four-year analysis horizon (that corresponds to                         4 = 5).
The main family circles that we study are spouses and adult biological children. Our sample of spouses

is based on all married and cohabiting couples among families in which one spouse experienced a shock.

The registers provide such spousal matches across all individuals born between 1910 and 1970, who

are the cohorts covered in our data. For children, the registers provide matches to biological parents

for individuals born after 1960.              Our sample of adult biological children is based on these matches.

Naturally, the age composition of spouses and adult children substantially dier, so that the age splits

in our analysis (which show eects for younger and older individuals within each sub-sample) will be

guided by the data and will dier accordingly across these groups.                            In a supplementary analysis we

also investigate the eects of shocks on siblings. This sample is based on parental linkages, such that

siblings are dened as individuals who share biological parents.

     For the more distant circles of family members and peers, we increase the statistical power by

reducing the data requirement to include individuals who survived for at least three years after the

cardiovascular shock (instead of four). This strengthens the ability to look at dynamics, not only at

averages, in cases where samples become naturally much thinner (as in the case of stepchildren), or

when the potential eects, if at all present, are expected to be smaller (as in the case of sons and

daughters in-law). Doing so implies that we can only investigate the three-year dynamic causal eects

but enables us to signicantly increase sample sizes due to fatality rates of cardiovascular shocks. For
                                                                                                    13
example, the sample increases by 20 percent in the stepchildren application.

     We construct these additional samples as follows. Stepchildren are dened as any child with a non-

biological link to the individual that experienced the shock. We establish these links by combining the

spousal linkages and the biological parent linkages. Specically, we dene as a stepchild any person

for whom neither biological parent is the individual that experienced the shock but for whom one

biological parent is the spouse of that individual. Sons and daughters in-law (to whom we collectively

refer as children in-law) are simply the spouses of the biological children. Finally, we proxy for peers

using coworkers based on matched employer-employee register data, where we dene workplaces using

physical establishment units. To approximate peers with whom individuals are more likely to interact,
                                                                    14
we focus on close coworkers in the following way.                      From our sample of individuals who experience a

health shock, we identify those who, during the pre-shock periods from                          t = ‚àí4 to t = ‚àí1,   have worked

in smaller workplaces where the number of employees was equal to or lower than the sample's 25th


  13 Our    choice of the degree to which power should increase, as determined by the number of required years of survival, was

governed by balancing the decrease in the analysis horizon with the rate of change in standard errors as sample sizes increase.

As benchmarks, the shrinkage in standard errors was compared to the impact magnitudes of spouses and children. For example,

conditioning on three years of survival enables identication of mean eects on stepchildren that are at least 48% of that on

biological children.
  14 This   is in the spirit of denitions used in De Giorgi, Frederiksen, and Pistaferri (2016).




                                                                   10
percentile (of approximately 20). We then study the eects on coworkers who have been employed in
                                    15
a similar occupation class,              and who are close to these individuals in terms of age (with an age gap
                         16
of 5 years or less).          We exclude from this sample any coworker who is also a family member.

    Our secondary sample of fatal shocks includes all families in which one member died between 1985

and 2011.       For these shocks we study spouses and biological children, whose respective samples are

constructed in the same way as before. Appendix Table 1 summarizes the various analysis samples for

each shock and for each network circle that we analyze and reports summary statistics.



3.3 Institutional Details
    Overall, health insurance in Denmark is a universal scheme in which almost all costs are covered

by the government. The few exceptions that entail a limited degree of out-of-pocket expenses include

medical services provided by dentists, physiotherapists, psychologists, and chiropractors, as well as

prescription drug co-insurance payments for prescriptions outside of hospitals as we describe below. The

provision of public health insurance in Denmark is decentralized to the local government, specically

regions, that engage in common agreements with primary-care professionals and with non-hospital

medical specialists and also fund public hospitals in the secondary healthcare sector. We describe the

primary-care and the secondary-care sectors successively.

    Primary Care.             The main providers in the primary-care sector are general practitioners (GPs),

who act as gatekeepers to the healthcare system, e.g., in terms of referring patients to hospitals and

specialists. GPs are organized in private self-employed businesses and are reimbursed according to a

fee-for-service schedule. The union of general practitioners (   Praktiserende l√¶gers organization ) and the
regional administration          (Regionernes L√∏nnings- og Takstn√¶vn ) negotiate the annual fees for specic

services, which are funded by regional and state taxes.

    Each patient is assigned one GP, whose main responsibilities include medical consultations, non-

specialized treatments, and provision of preventive care. For doing so, GPs are eligible to prescribe

drugs for both treatment and prevention purposes. Patients pay no out-of-pocket costs for standard ser-

vices provided by the GP, but there is some degree of co-insurance payments for medication prescribed

by GPs. Specically, until March 2000 patients paid 50% of pharmacy sale prices, with a reduced rate

of 25% for drugs that treat life-threatening or chronic conditions. In March 2000 the payment scheme

introduced a deductible with decreasing marginal co-insurance rates beyond the deductible amount.

International Standard Classication of Occupations (ISCO). This method classies employees into managers and non-managers

and, among non-managers, it further classies employees into occupations by their required skill level (low/medium/high).

                                                                  11
dent units with their own budgets funded via taxes by the regional government. Until the late 1990s

hospitals were entirely funded by block grants and fee-for-service reimbursement schedules. From 1999,

however, inspired by the American healthcare system, the funding gradually switched toward a scheme

based on Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs). Within this scheme each patient's case is categorized into

a DRG, and each DRG has prospectively set payment rates based on the average resources used to

treat patients in that DRG. Initially, 10% of hospitals' budgets were funded through the DRG system.

This share increased to 20% in 2004 and is today between 50% and 70% depending on the region.

   The main challenge within the hospital sector in recent decades has been long waiting lists for

specialized treatments, which through the 1990s was addressed by increasing the degree of exibility in

individuals' hospital choice. Specically, in the early 1990s patients were oered exible hospital choice

within regions, which was later extended to exible choice nationally, and was nally expanded to the

eligibility to choose private hospitals in case there were no availabilities in public hospitals. However,

private hospitals account for only 2.5% of all hospital beds in the secondary sector and provide only

very specialized services. Visits to private hospitals that are not due to public hospitals' unavailability

are paid out-of-pocket on a fee-for-service basis.    Still, patients rarely pay the full amount of these

expenses, as many are covered by supplementary private insurance through their employers (who have

tax incentives to provide these policies).




4 Spillovers in Health Behaviors
   We now turn to our analysis of how health behaviors are shaped through family spillovers, which

has two complementary parts.      In the core part of our analysis, we study the eects of non-fatal

heart attacks and strokes on family members' consumption of preventive care that is specic to these

cardiovascular conditions. The analysis is conducted at two main levels for which dierent potential

mechanisms can be at play: intra-generational analysis of the eects on spouses and inter-generational

analysis of the eects on the next generation of adult children. To further study the breadth of shock

spillovers, we analyze whether and to what degree the eects cascade to siblings, to the children's

households (by studying sons and daughters in-law), to stepchildren, and to coworkers. In the second

part of the analysis, we study the eects of general fatal shocks on family members' behaviors. In this

part, we begin by analyzing overall changes in consumption of healthcare that is indicative of health

behaviors and awareness, and then proceed to studying utilization of condition-specic preventive care

by exploiting variation in causes of death.    We focus on reporting the estimated eects in relative

terms compared to the counterfactual, in order to account for the baseline prevalence of the healthcare

utilization outcomes we analyze within each sub-population.

   Whereas our goal is to identify the main eects of family shocks, we additionally investigate their

nature and potential sources.   To reiterate, we conceptualize two main classes of spillover channels:

learning about one's own health risks and the salience of shocks. Our focus on these channels is guided

by the literature and the empirical patterns; but, of course, alternative mechanisms could be at play,

some of which we show can be likely ruled out.




                                                     12
4.1 Eects of Severe Non-Fatal Health Shocks
    To study how health shocks spill over to family members' health behaviors and consumption of

preventive care, we focus on heart attacks and strokes.                      These shocks are directly tied to a disease-

specic risk-reducing medication, so we focus on its consumption as a main behavioral outcome. This

class of medication, called statins, is composed of prescription drugs taken to lower cholesterol that
                                                                        18
are pervasively used to prevent cardiovascular disease.                       We therefore proceed with analyzing how

individuals' cardiovascular shocks aect the consumption of statins by members of their network.


4.1.1 Eects on Spouses
    We begin with an intra-generational analysis of spouses, to identify family spillovers that cannot

be attributed to biological channels. To visualize the estimation strategy, we provide in this subsection

gures that plot the raw data, and we then proceed to regression estimations which quantify the eects.

Panel A of Figure 1 plots the average responses in statin consumption by prime-age spouses of ages 25-

55. The structure of this and subsequent gures is as follows. The x-axis denotes time with respect to

the shock, normalized to period 0. For the treatment group, period 0 is when the actual shock occurs;

for the control group, period 0 is when a placebo shock occurs (while their actual shock occurs in

period 5).     The dashed gray line plots the behavior of the control group.                        To ease the comparison

of trends, from which the treatment eect is identied, we normalize the level of the control group's

outcome to the pre-shock level of the treatment group's outcome (in period                         t = ‚àí1).    This normalized

counterfactual is displayed by the blue line and squares. The red line and circles plot the behavior of

the treatment group.

    Panel A of Figure 1 rst provides a visual verication of parallel trends across the treatment and

control groups prior to period 0, as required by the design. Then, analyzing the eect of the shock, the

gure reveals that prime-age individuals immediately increase their consumption of statins in response

to their spouse's cardiovascular shock, and that this increased take-up persists for at least four years

after the shock. Note that, once taken, this medication should be consumed indenitely for the purpose

of reducing the risk of experiencing a heart attack or stroke, so the displayed degree of adherence is

a key element of the response pattern. Column 1 of Table 1 estimates the corresponding regression

using equation (2) and shows that the treatment eect grows over time, so that by the fourth year after

the shock the increase in spouses' statin consumption amounts to 15%an increase of 1.17 percentage

points (pp) on a base of 7.86 pp.

    Older spouses have much more frequent interactions with the medical system (see Appendix Figure

1), which include routine checkups that are more common as individuals age. As the main risk factors

for cardiovascular disease (beyond age and gender) are commonly screened for by individuals' primary-

care providersincluding hypertension, cholesterol levels, and diabetesolder spouses are presumably

more informed of their personal risk.              Still, even for spouses between the ages of 55 and 85 we nd


  18 We further   verify that family members' statin consumption responses are prevention related, and hence take the form of health

investments, as they are not driven by managing own conditions that might have been induced by the family shock. There is no

increase in the incidence of cardiovascular disease (and of hospital contacts of any type) among spouses or children following the

non-fatal cardiovascular shocks that we analyze. See Appendix Table 7 for details.




                                                                 13
that similar-magnitude spillovers are present, albeit on a larger baseline as statin consumption rates

are higher for this group due to their older age; see column 2 of Table 1 (and Appendix Figure 2).

     For a subset of our sample, specically those who reside in Greater Copenhagen, the data also

consist of indicators for blood tests of cholesterol levels. As these tests are used to determine cardio-

vascular risk and precede statin consumption, their patterns can shed additional light on the dynamics

of spousal responses. Panel B of Figure 1 and column 3 of Table 1 report the eects of cardiovascular

shocks on spousal cholesterol testing. Promptly at the year of the shock, spouses respond with a large

increase in their rate of cholesterol testing which amounts to about 30%. This response is consistent

with the corresponding increase in their statin take-up within the immediate years following the shock.

Compared to the counterfactual, cholesterol testing remains somewhat higher also in the following

years. This is likely due to continuous monitoring tests that are common in medication maintenance

for those who have started consuming statins, and it can also mirror the growing post-shock share of

spouses who take up statins, as manifested by the gradual growth in the estimated statin consumption

eect.   The pattern of response in cholesterol testing additionally suggests we should focus on the

year just after the shock (period 1) as the initial response period when analyzing statin eects, due

to potential transitional delays: this is the rst data period in which all individuals are fully exposed

to the shock and have been already able to engage in the required medical testing that precedes the

medication consumption.

     To understand the nature of these spousal spillover eects, we proceed by investigating response

heterogeneity using dierent sources of variation. We rst ask the following natural question: does the

event-driven consumption response interact with underlying risk? That is, while all treated families are

faced with a cardiovascular shock, we want to study whether they trigger more action among spouses

whose baseline risk of own cardiovascular events is higher. To do that, we rst calculate an annual

measure of cardiovascular risk using population data.         Our prediction relies on risk factors used by

medical practitioners (De Backer et al. 2003; Pencina et al. 2014), constrained to those observable in

our data. These include age and gender, as well as the presence of hypertension and diabetes, for which

we proxy by lagged indicators for condition-specic prescribed medications. Since smoking is also used

for risk predictions by medical professionals, we include education as the best predictor included in our

data that has been shown to strongly correlate with this behavior (see, e.g., Cutler and Lleras-Muney

2010). Then, we match to each spouse a measure of his or her underlying risk based on the predicted

probability of a cardiovascular shock in the baseline period     t = ‚àí1,   and split the sample into high and

low risk using the population median.

     Column 1 of Table 2 estimates equation (4), where   zi   denotes an indicator for whether the spouse's

predicted risk is above the median, and the post-shock periods for which           posti,t   assumes the value

1   are periods 3 and 4 when the response levels out (as seen if Figure 1).          We nd that even low

risk spouses increase their take-up of statins as preventive care in response to the family shock (by

0.43 pp). However, at the same time, high risk spouses are much more likely to increase their statin

consumptionby an additional 1.08 pp.      Nonetheless, we nd no such risk gradient in the spouses'

information-seeking behavior through cholesterol testing. This suggests that the shock uniformly drives

spouses across predictable risk types to take actions related to cardiovascular risk (in the form of



                                                   14
gathering data), whereas those with higher predicted risk end up having larger statin responses in

practice, consistent with learning of own health risks induced by the family shock (see columns 1 and 2
                             19
of Appendix Table 2).             We nd additional support to the learning hypothesis by providing evidence

consistent with the idea that individuals who are more likely to learn from spousal shocks, due to more

similar risk proles across them, exhibit stronger responses. Columns 3 and 4 of Appendix Table 2

show that spouses with closer predicted underlying risk tend to increase their consumption of statins

to a larger extent following the family shock.

    Next, we further exploit the data on cholesterol testing to probe into mechanisms. A large body

of medical research and the corresponding clinical guidelines indicate that the information on risk

pertinent to receiving cholesterol-reducing treatment is a combination of one's LDL (bad) cholesterol

levels and the predicted cardiovascular risk we discussed in previous paragraphs, which is based on

observables (see, e.g., De Backer et al. 2003 and Pencina et al. 2014).                       Accordingly, spouses, whose

cholesterol levels had been tested for in the periods prior to the shock, already have access to the

information regarding their own cardiovascular risk by which statin eligibility is determined. This is

not the case for family circles with rst-degree biological links, such as children or siblings, for whom

eligibility should also incorporate family history.                We are therefore interested in studying whether

such spouses respond to the shock in their statin consumption in any way, and we nd that they do

(see column 2 of Table 2).            Consistent with a salience channel, spouses increase their consumption

of preventive care in response to the family shock even when the relevant information set had been
                                               20
available to them prior to the event.

    The analysis so far suggests both a likely role of family shocks in inducing learning about own health

and that salience and attention are likely operative channels. We additionally show that several leading

alternative explanations do not appear to be operative in the responses we estimate. Specically, the

evidence does not support the hypothesis that the spousal health investments are driven by greater

valuation of the spouse's health due to realized household income risk, child rearing considerations, or

caregiving needs. First, due to generous social insurance, households are well insured and experience

very small income losses to begin with (taking into account all income sources and transfers). Moreover,

while households in which the sick person was the primary earner experience larger income losses,

spousal health investments do not vary by this dimension. Second, spouses in households with younger

children do not exhibit larger investments in health.                  And, third, while individuals who experience

more severe shocks, as measured by hospitalization days, are more likely to drop out of the labor force

and potentially require more caregiving, spouses' investments do not vary by this dimension either (see

Appendix Table 3). In addition, the evidence does not support the hypothesis that the spillover can be

explained by supply-side responses of family physicians who aggregate information across the dierent

members of the household. Analyzing households in which husbands and wives do not share the same
                                                                                                                         21
doctor (dened in several ways), we nd similar-magnitude responses (see Appendix Table 4).

  19 We   increase power to get informative standard errors on interaction terms in this small sub-sample of residents of Greater

Copenhagen by including spouses of all individuals who survived for at least three years following their cardiovascular shock.
  20 We   nd similar results when studying spouses with more updated information (those who have been tested in period -2 or -1).

See column 5 of Appendix Table 2.
  21 In   this table, we also reach similar conclusions from an analogous exercise for adult children, whom we study in the next

subsection.




                                                                15
4.1.2 Inter-generational Eects
    We next turn to analyze households in which adult children are present at the time of the shock, to

study how parental shocks spill over to health behaviors in the next generation. We begin by analyzing

the statin consumption responses of biological children to parental heart attacks or strokes at dierent

stages of the life cycle.

    Biological Children.    Panel A of Figure 2 plots the average response in statin consumption by

the younger adult children in our sample, who were between ages 25 and 40 at the time of their

parent's health shock. As before, the gure provides a visual verication of parallel pre-trends across

our treatment and control groups, in validation of the estimation strategy. Studying the eect of the

shock, the plot reveals an immediate response by children which grows stronger over time. Estimating

equation (2), column 4 of Table 1 shows that by the fourth year after their parent experiences a heart

attack or stroke, adult children increase their take-up of statins by 36%.     Analogously, panel B of

Figure 2 plots the spillovers to the older children in our sample, who were between ages 40 and 65 at

the time of the parental shock. This group reveals a similar pattern of an immediate increase in statin

consumption that amounts to 16% by the fourth year after the shock (see column 5 of Table 1).

    Per the convention of the medical profession, premature parental cardiovascular shocks are viewed

as revealing more information on a child's biological risk (and are therefore incorporated into cardio-

vascular risk predictions; see De Backer et al. 2003 and Pencina et al. 2014). Accordingly, we study

whether children whose parents were younger at the time they experienced the cardiovascular shock,

who are hence more likely to learn new information about their own risk, are also more prone to

increase their consumption of preventive care.    Column 3 of Table 2 estimates equation (4), where

we interact the treatment eect with both the child's own age and the parent's age at the time of

the parental shock. Consistent with a learning channel, we nd a strong negative partial correlation

between children's statin consumption responses and their parent's age at the time the shock occurs.

    The causal spillovers to health investments by biological children involve several channels. These

channels could include revelation of information about biological risk as we just discussed, learning

information on own risk that could pertain to shared environmental risk growing up, and salience and

increased awareness. Subject to a similar set of channels, we also nd comparable response patterns

by siblings in Figure 3. In fact, this turns out to be an important route through which family spillovers

operate. Among the dierent family circles we study, siblings seem to display the largest spillovers,

consistent with a stronger signal regarding one's own risk from a shock to a rst-degree family member

of the same generation. Specically, their increases in consumption of preventive care amount to 41%

and 24% for younger (25-40) and older (40-65) siblings, respectively (see columns 6 and 7 of Table 1).

    With the aim to shed light on the nature of the estimated spillovers to the next generation, we

focus in the rest of this subsection on family connections that can enable us to isolate response chan-

nels. Accordingly, we rst abstract from the biological-risk channel by proceeding to analyze potential

spillovers to stepchildren.

    Stepchildren.   Column 1 of Table 3 estimates the mean treatment eect of cardiovascular shocks

to non-biological parents on stepchildren's consumption of statins, using the dierences-in-dierences

specication of equation (3). We nd that the spillover in health behaviors cascades to non-biological



                                                   16
children and amounts to an 11% increase in their consumption of statins.                             To compare magnitudes

across non-biological and biological children, we estimate the mean-eect equation (3) for the sample

of comparable biological children, so that we include individuals of all ages (25-65) whose parent

survived for at least three years.              Column 2 of Table 3 estimates an average eect for this sample

of biological children that represents a 19% increase from a baseline similar to that of stepchildren.

Hence, the results imply that stepchildren exhibit responses that are half as large as those by biological

children. While the standard errors are more than twice as large in the analysis of stepchildren, the

dynamic regression is nonetheless able to provide estimates with sucient precision.                               Column 1 of

Table 4 estimates specication (2) and shows that the qualitative pattern of the dynamic eects of

parental shocks on non-biological children bears a close resemblance to that on biological children. The

responses come into eect in the year just after the shock (when all individuals are already exposed to

it for a full period) and grow over time, so that by the end of our analysis' horizon adult stepchildren

increase their consumption of statins by 17%.

    Sons and Daughters In-Law.                After abstracting from the biological-risk channel, we seek to addition-

ally abstract from the spillover channel by which children may respond to learning information on joint

risks attributed to sharing the same environment with their parents when growing up. This includes

several dimensions such as the immediate physical surroundings, similar lifestyles, and nutrition habits

across generations within the household.                  To take a step in this direction, we constrain our sample

to married children, and study the potential spillovers to their spousesi.e., to sons and daughters

in-law. Column 3 of Table 3 estimates the average treatment eect using equation (3). It shows that,

following the cardiovascular shock to their spouse's parent, children in-law exhibit an average increase

that amounts to about a quarter of that of their spouses, i.e., the biological children (for whom the

estimate is reported in column 4 of Table 3). While this eect is small in magnitude, its importance

lies in revealing the breadth of the spillovers that we identify. That is, family health shocks not only

aect the behavior of the next generation of biological and non-biological children, but they also spill

over to the next generation's households.

    To further investigate the spillover to sons and daughters in-law, we test whether distance across

households matters. As the simplest measure for distance that may capture the degree of exposure to

the shock and its prominence, we look at variation in geographical distance based on municipality of

residence in the baseline period              t = ‚àí1.22   We divide the sample into children in-law who live closer

to or further from their parents in-law using the median distance. Column 5 of Table 3 rst replicates

the overall average eect on in-laws from column 3 but for the sample of families for whom we have
                                         23
non-missing data on residence.                Then, in column 6 we provide the average eect for each sub-sample

split by distance, calculated using a regression of specication (4). The results reveal that the eect on

in-laws is fully attributed to the next generation households who live closer to their parents. Cutting


  22 Specically,   our analysis is based on post-2007 denitions, which divide Denmark into 98 municipalities. Distance is measured

as the length of the straight line between municipality centroids. The median distance in our sample between parents and children

in-law is 22 kilometers (14 miles).
  23 We   additionally constrain the sample to include only parents and children in-law who do not share the same doctors to verify

a distance gradient would not be attributable to that.




                                                                 17
the sample further, we can see (in column 7) that these are actually children in-law whose distance from

their spouses' parents are shortest, less than the 25th percentile, who drive the results. In fact, because

of that, the time pattern of their responses in statin consumption can be precisely estimated using the

dynamic regression of specication (2) (see column 2 of Table 4). They exhibit immediate responses
                                                                                                                               24
following the shock with a 15% increase by the end of the analysis' period (similar to spouses).


4.1.3 Eects on Coworkers
    In the nal empirical exercise of this section, we study how far the spillovers of health shocks to

improved health behaviors can reach, by analyzing the eects on coworkers. To approximate peers with

whom individuals are more likely to interact, we focus the analysis on close coworkers (as dened in
                 25
Section 3.2).         Column 1 of Table 5 displays the average treatment eect of health shocks on close

coworkers' consumption of preventive care. The results indicate an increase of 1.39 pp, which amounts

to an average eect of 13%.

    As this eect is economically considerable, it also clearly shows up in the dynamic regression in

column 3 of Table 4.            With no dierential trends in the pre-period, coworkers' take-up of statins

exhibits a prompt increase in the years following a peer's cardiovascular shock, which persists for the

full analysis period. This evidence highlights a meaningful spillover that is transmitted through ties

which are purely social, and is on the same order of magnitude as the estimated spillovers to prime-age

spouses.

    Our setting also provides us with the opportunity to illustrate the limit of spillovers. While spillovers

are present among close coworkers, they are absent when we study distant coworkers within the same

workplace, for whom we nd no causal eects with precisely estimated zeros. In particular, we rst

show there are no spillovers to coworkers in larger workplaces, in which the average frequency of

interactions between any two coworkers is likely lower (column 2 of Table 5). More interestingly, we

nd no eects on coworkers within smaller workplaces (so that they are still likely exposed to the shock)

when we focus on those with greater age gaps or on those with similar ages within the same physical

establishment but with dierent occupation classes, who may therefore represent peers with weaker
                                                    26
social ties (see columns 3-4 of Table 5).                Put together, the patterns of spillover impacts on healthcare

consumption among close coworkers, and the lack thereof among distant coworkers, are consistent with

the strength of the social tie (and the likely corresponding degree of shock exposure and prominence)

as operative channels.

  24 Another   potential explanation for a distance gradient could be environmental health risks (such as air pollution). In such a

case, one may expect a similar distance gradient in the responses of the biological children married to these sons and daughters

in-law, for which we nd no evidence in the data.
  25 Namely,   we look at coworkers within the same occupation class and age range in smaller workplaces. Perturbations to cutos

used in these denitions are reported in Appendix Table 5 as we mentioned before.
  26 Coworkers within small workplaces, who are close in age but are in a dierent occupation class, still share the same geographical
location and hence also environmental risks; so the absence of a spillover to them suggests this type of risk is not likely to drive the

eects on close coworkers. Likewise, the nding of no eect on coworkers in similar location and occupations but with a larger age

dierence suggests that job-related risk (occupational risk, stress, etc) is not a likely channel as well.




                                                                  18

    Benchmarking our estimated spillovers against baseline counterfactual levels has pointed to eco-

nomically signicant impacts on multiple network circles. To further gauge economic magnitudes, we

provide two additional exercises.

    First, we quantify how much of the time pattern in the consumption of preventive care by the

dierent circles of family members and peers can be explained by the spillover of the one shock alone.

Specically, we calculate the overall increase in consumption of preventive care within the full analysis

window (from period          ‚àí4     onward), which takes into account time, life-cycle eects, and the impact of

the spillover, and we then assess the share of the spillover eect out of the overall increase. In order to

evaluate this quantity across dierent network layers of comparable ages, we avoid including the very

old, for whom we have observations only in the spouses sample.

    With this metric, we nd that the spillover eect to adult biological children in our younger sample

accounts for 28% of the growth in their statin use within the entire nine-year analysis period.                               For

older children, this number amounts to 15%, so that on average in the overall sample 22% of children's

growth in consumption of preventive care is attributed to the one parental shock. Similarly, among

siblings, the spillover eect represents 31% and 21.5% of the nine-year growth in statin consumption

for younger and older adults, respectively.

    For prime-age spouses, our estimated spillover explains about 15% of the growth in statin con-

sumption over time.           Notably, we estimate similar magnitudes for individuals in the further circles

that we study. The share of change in health behaviors that is explained by the spillover is 15.5% for

stepchildren, 15.4% for sons and daughters in-law that live close to their in-laws, and 12% for peers

as proxied by close coworkers. These assessments capture the eect of a single shock, of one network

member, and of a particular type of health risk; so that, over the natural course of the life cycle,

spillovers from shocks to dierent circles of family and peers can add up to play an important role in

determining health behaviors more generally.

    To provide a second exercise to put the eect magnitudes in perspective, it may be useful to

compare them to benchmarks that pertain to under-utilization of statins as preventive care and to

the recommended population shares that should consume them. The most straightforward benchmark

that we know of, which provides these exact moments albeit for a dierent population, is the study

by Pencina et al. (2014) in the U.S. context based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination

Survey (NHANES). Pencina et al. (2014) report assessments using dierent sets of medical guidelines

for the treatment of cholesterol, and we use their estimates that are based on the 2004-updated ATP-

III criteria as they are the ones that are relevant for our time period and most closely mirror the Danish
                               27
guidelines of that time.            Their ndings suggest that the ratio of those eligible for statin therapy, who

do not receive it, to those eligible, who do receive it, is 71.4%. Hence, for adults of ages 40-75 who

are included in their study, an eect of this magnitude would close the gap of under-utilization. To

get the most comparable numbers from our application, we calculate as an illustration the medium-


  27 As   we mentioned before, these guidelines use a combination of an assessment of one's cardiovascular risk and the low-density

lipoprotein (LDL/bad) cholesterol level to recommend treatment. For more details, see the appendix of Pencina et al. (2014).




                                                                19
run (year-4) eect for spouses, adult children, and siblings, who are in this age range at the end of
                           28
the analysis period.            For these sub-groups (where a similar exercise can be conducted for the other

circles), we nd that statin take-up increases by 10% for spouses, by 21.5% for adult children, and

by 23.7% for siblings.          If   one is willing to assume that baseline utilization for these family members

requires a 71.4% increase to reach recommended levels, the spillovers close 14% (=10/71.4) of the gap

for spouses, about 30% (=21.5/71.4) of the gap for adult children, and they close 33% (=23.7/71.4) of

the potential under-utilization gap among siblings.



4.2 Eects of Fatal Health Shocks
    We now turn to the second complementary part of our analysis and investigate family spillovers

in health behaviors in the context of the extreme events of fatal shocks.                              The advantages of this

analysis in advancing our understanding of family spillovers are the opportunity to study a variety

of behavioral margins (supplemental to those related to cardiovascular risk), as well as the ability to

explore additional mechanism-related tests. We focus on spouses to identify spillovers that cannot be

attributed to biological channels. Additionally, spouses in our sample are older and hence have higher

baseline levels of healthcare utilization compared to children, which allows clear estimation of spillover

dynamics for any given level of relative response. Still, we replicate the main ndings for the average
                                                                                                  29
spillover impact on the next generation of adult children in the appendix.


4.2.1 Health Awareness and Common Health Behaviors
    Increased Awareness of Health .            We begin by analyzing the eects of fatal shocks on family members'

general awareness of health, using two proxies for the degree to which individuals may pay attention to

health issues. The rst outcome that we study is an indicator for whether spouses are hospitalized for

visits that end up being classied as encounters for medical observation of suspected conditions that

are ruled out ex-post. These hospital contacts can be indicative of greater vigilance to symptoms that

are retrospectively realized as false alarm. For visual clarity of the dynamic patterns that we nd

in this subsection, we report our ndings by plotting the                      Œ¥r   coecients from specication (2) along

with their 95-percent condence interval. We also indicate on the gures the counterfactual outcome

levels for periods       t=0     and    t = 4,   the beginning and end of the analysis period, to gauge response
                                                      30
magnitudes relative to underlying levels.

    Panel A of Figure 4 displays spousal responses using our rst proxy for health alertness.                                    The

gure shows that, in the immediate years just after their spouse's death, individuals' propensity to

visit hospitals on account of suspected health conditions clearly and meaningfully increases.                                    This


  28 Of   course, this exercise for the constrained age range yields dierent conditional age distributions for these three samples due

to their dierent unconditional age distributions. See Appendix Table 1 for unconditional age means.
  29 See   Appendix Table 6.    Our data use agreement excludes some information on drug prescriptions for the sample of adult

children (as opposed to spouses). Drug dosage is part of the excluded data, so that responses in prescription opioid doses are the

one outcome for which we cannot provide the corresponding estimation for adult children.
  30 In   this subsection we analyze a variety of utilization codes that cover dierent calendar years (due to institutional changes

in data reporting).   Therefore, as we mentioned in Section 2.1, we rely here on specication (2) which can further balance the

treatment and control groups in a disciplined way.      That said, the dynamics of spousal responses are visually clear in raw data

gures which are available on request.




                                                                  20
eect seems to dissipate over time, although the increased propensity is still present four years out.

The second outcome that can be indicative of a sense of urgency regarding one's own health is (non-

hospital) urgent care contacts with the medical systemi.e., contacts that are initiated outside of
                                                                                           31
regular working hours with local doctors or nurses who are on call.                             Panel B of Figure 4 reveals

a similar (and more pronounced) response pattern in this outcome: there are signicant on-impact

increases in the propensity of urgent care contacts that then fade out, though do not fully disappear,

in the course of four years after the shock.

    Declines in Harmful Behaviors and Medication .                    A large share of the literature on adverse health

behaviors has focused on smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and drug and medication abuse

(see Cawley and Ruhm 2011).                Guided by this literature, we exploit the prescription drug data to

explore potential changes in such existing harmful behaviors in response to family shocks as additional

measures for improvements in health behaviors. Specically, we study whether fatal family shocks lead

individuals to seek treatments to reduce their smoking or drinking, and whether these shocks induce

individuals to decrease their utilization of addictive medication.

    We rst explore the consumption of medication that treats nicotine or alcohol dependence. This

class of medication is prescribed to individuals engaged in                   chronic    smoking or excessive drinking for

lengthy periods, who wish to cease their unhealthy behavior or to switch to a less damaging substitute
                                               32
(Siu 2015; Swift and Aston 2015).                   As such, evidence of prompt increases in their consumption would

suggest they are likely taken for treating preexisting conditions (rather than for treating newly-acquired

conditions that may have been caused by spousal death). Panel C of Figure 4 displays estimates of

equation (2), where the outcome variable is an indicator for the purchase of a prescription drug within

this class. The estimates show an immediate increase in individuals' consumption of these medications
                                                                                                         33
following spousal death, which amounts to 41% compared to the counterfactual.

    To shed light on potential response channels, we further test whether these eects can be fully

attributed to learning new information regarding the risk involved in smoking or drinking, which

might have been revealed to unaware agents by their spouse's death. We therefore study the mean

eects of fatal spousal shocks for a small class of causes of death that the medical research has not been

able to link to any risky behavior and, in particular, to smoking or drinking: autoimmune diseases

(NIH 2016). We nd that even in these cases, survivors engage in treatments to reduce smoking or

drinking, although the fatal event itself is not directly related to or informative of the risk associated

with these behaviors (see column 1 of Appendix Table 6).

    Next, we move on to study prescription medication abuse, where concerns pertain to the dan-

gers of developing dependence or addiction.                  We analyze a main class of addictive harmful medica-

tionprescription opioids for pain reliefwhich account for the greatest proportion of mortality cases
                                                                                         34
linked to prescription drug abuse (Volkow 2014; Rudd et al. 2016).                            In this case, health-promoting

  31 Each   geographical location is assigned a primary-care provider that is on call outside of the regular working hours of 8 am to

4 pm.
  32 This class of prescription drugs is labeled under ATC codes N07BA and N07BB. For smoking cessation these prescription drugs
include medications and nicotine replacement therapies (such as nicotine chewing gum and patches), which are widely recommended

to all adults as part of cessation regimens.
  33 We   nd similar results when we run separate regressions for sub-classes of this group of prescription medications (that treat

either nicotine dependence or alcohol dependence).
  34 These   medications have been a recent focus of the medical literature and public debate due to the common practice of abuse




                                                                 21
behavioral responses would translate into reductions in consumption.                        Since opioid dose reductions

should be gradual due to withdrawal symptoms (Miller and Kipnis 2006; Volkow 2014), we study a

continuous measure of dosage. We use the standard dened daily dose (DDD) measure of drug con-

sumption (dened by the World Health Organization), which standardizes the amount of the prescribed
                                      35
medication in day equivalents.             Panel D of Figure 4 reveals a pattern that is consistent with improved

behaviors. From a baseline counterfactual level of 9.74 prescription days (in period                           0),   spousal death

induces a decline in the amount of prescription opioids consumed, which is already detectable in the

year the shock occurs and gradually reaches a decrease of 0.93 days by the fourth year after the shock.

Panel E shows that the same results hold when we exclude prescription opioid poisoning as a cause of

death, so that the event itself is not directly linked to the studied behavioral response.


4.2.2 Condition-Specic Preventive Care
    We proceed with the nal portion of our analysis, in which we study the consumption of condition-

specic preventive care by exploiting variation in causes of death among treated households. Recall that

this rst allows us to take a step toward isolating behavioral responses in the context of spousal death,

where the shock can lead to meaningful declines in health (see Appendix Table 7). The underlying

idea is that all spouses among treated households are exposed to the main eects of the shock, but
                                                                                  36
their experience may dier by the cause of their spouse's death.                       Moreover, this analysis enables us

to investigate the directionality of spillover responses and the degree to which they may be local to the

particular nature of the experienced shock.

    Within-Condition Preventive Care .                 Our core question for the current analysis is the following: do

individuals increase their utilization of types of preventive care that are directly-linked to the particular

health condition of the family shock? We answer this question in the context of two main classes of

preventive-care practices that are tied to the two leading causes of death in the developed world:

cardiovascular disease and cancer. For cardiovascular deaths, we study the consumption of statins as

we did before. For cancer deaths, we study expenditure associated with visits to diagnostic radiologists,

who specialize in disease diagnosis and are responsible for screening patients for major types of cancer.

The empirical strategy follows equation (5) estimated on treated households only, where we let                            zi divide
the sample by cause of death; so that             zi   is assigned the value 1 if the family member died of disease              x
and it is assigned the value 0 otherwise. By letting the outcome variable be a measure of preventive

care that is particular to disease          x,   we analyze the utilization of this preventive care by individuals

whose spouse died of disease         x   compared to those whose spouse died of any other cause.

    Starting with the application to cardiovascular disease as the cause of death, the results bolster

our ndings from the analysis of non-fatal cardiovascular shocks.                       Column 1 of Table 6 estimates

equation (5), where the outcome is statin consumption and the main right-hand side variable (zi )

indicates whether the spouse died of a heart attack or a stroke or of any other cause. In support of

the empirical design, there are no dierential pre-trends across the two groups of households, so that


and the high risk of addiction or dependence associated with them.
  35 This   measure is based on the assumed average maintenance dose per day of a drug for adults, and is used to compare drug

usage across dierent drugs or healthcare environments.
  36 Among    dierent alternative explanations, this analysis reduces the plausibility that potential complementarities between

treatment and preventive care explain the ndings of the eects of fatal shocks on spousal health behaviors.




                                                                22
Œ¥r = 0 for r < 0.          Observing the post-shock coecients, a clear pattern emerges: following fatal shocks,

individuals whose spouse died of cardiovascular disease promptly and persistently consume statins at
                                                                                                37
a higher rate compared to those whose spouse died of any other cause.

    Next, we study our second class of preventive care and analyze healthcare costs associated with

visits to diagnostic radiologists in the context of fatal cancer.                         Similar to the cardiovascular deaths

application, we compare individuals whose spouse died of cancer to those whose spouse died of any

other cause.        However, unlike the case of statins whose consumption is for continuous health risk

management, the current utilization outcome of visits to radiologists is for diagnosis purposes only,

so that behavioral responses should translate to transitory eects.                            We estimate the corresponding

regression in column 3 of Table 6, which shows there are no dierential pre-trends across the two

groups of spouses in support of the design. We nd that in the year just after spousal death of cancer,

individuals' healthcare expenditure on diagnostic radiology signicantly increases compared to spousal

death of any other cause.                     This dierential response amounts to an increase of 12.2% and vanishes

by the third year after the shock, in line with eects of family shocks on condition-specic                            diagnostic
                       38
preventive care.             The pattern is also in accordance with the analysis of outpatient hospital contacts

for the reason of having a family member with a history of cancer, which exhibit increased incidence

just after spousal death (column 4 of Table 6).

    The detailed information on causes of death allows us to further investigate how directed the

responses are toward particular risks, by looking into specic types of cancer. The rst high-incidence

type of cancer we investigate is lung cancer and, in this context, we study the consumption of medication

for smoking cessation. If improved health behaviors are more targeted toward the particular risk of

which the family member had died, we would expect stronger responses by those whose spouse died of

lung cancer than by those whose spouse died of non-lung cancer. For this analysis, as we investigate

thinner sub-samples, we estimate the average dierences-in-dierences type specication of equation

(6), where now         zi   further splits the sample by particular cancer types. We nd that individuals whose

spouse died of lung cancer are 24% more likely to engage in smoking cessation following the shock

compared to those whose spouse died of any non-cancer cause (column 1 of Table 7). In contrast, there

are no such dierential responses when we compare spouses of individuals who died of non-lung cancer

to spouses of individuals who died of any non-cancer cause (column 2 of Table 7).

    The second class of cancer types that we study is female cancers, which in our sample include
                                                        39
ovarian, cervical, and breast cancer.                        For this class of cancers, we study husbands' diagnostic radiology

expenditure, comparing those whose wife died of female cancers to those whose wife died of any non-

cancer cause. The advantage of this context is the limited potential for information revelation regarding
                                                                              40
husbands' own risk of cancer, as we verify in the data.                            Still, we nd responses that are very similar


  37 For   this application there is also sucient power to characterize the dynamics for children, for whom we nd a similar pattern

(see column 2 of Table 6).
  38 Guided   by this dynamic specication, our following estimations that study expenditure on diagnostic radiology using equation

(6) assign the value   1    to   posti,t   in periods 1 and 2.
  39 Note   that, while very rarely, men can also die of breast cancer. In our sample, we detect 138 such cases (0.04% of all male

deaths), as compared to 14,541 female deaths of breast cancer (7.6% of all female deaths).
  40 Specically,   we study in the cross section of households with deceased wives whether a wife's (future or experienced) death

of female cancers can be predictive of husbands' contacts with inpatient or outpatient hospital departments for any cancer-related




                                                                         23
in magnitude to what we have found so far, so that husbands whose wife has died of female cancer

meaningfully increase their expenditure on diagnostic radiology in the years just after the shock relative

to those whose wife has died of any non-cancer cause (column 3 of Table 7). In line with no revelation

of information on spouses' own risk and consistent with responses to the health condition's salience,

we nd no evidence of a dierential incidence of cancer diagnoses across these two groups of husbands,
                                                                                                        41
despite their dierential expenditure on diagnostic tests (column 4 of Table 7).

      Cross-Condition Preventive Care .               Whereas the within-condition analysis suggests that spillover

responses target the experienced risk, cross-condition analysis can further indicate how local they are

to the vicinity of the shock. This analysis can also provide placebo tests for the hypothesis of salience

of specic risks as an operative explanation. It addresses alternative hypotheses such as the conjecture

that individuals whose spouse dies of a cardiovascular shock or cancer may be generally more responsive

than others in any preventive care margin, not only in margins related to the experienced condition.

      We run similar specications that analyze the behavior of individuals whose spouse died of disease

x   compared to those whose spouse died of any other cause, but where the outcome variable is a

measure of preventive care that is particular to a dierent disease                        x0 .42   Column 5 of Table 7 nds

that expenditures on diagnostic radiology by individuals whose spouse died of cardiovascular disease

are not dierent from those by individuals whose spouse died of other causes; suggesting that their

increased responses in preventive care (in this case, statins) were local to the particular experienced

shock. Similarly, further strengthening this result, we nd no increases in expenditure on diagnostic

radiology in the context of Section 4.1.1, namely, in response to a spouse's non-fatal cardiovascular

shock. Moreover, for cross-condition responses in the context of fatal cancer, we even nd declines (see

column 6 of Table 7). That is, individuals whose spouse died of cancer exhibit decreased propensity

to consume preventive care against cardiovascular disease following the shock.                               This points to the

possibility of crowd out: it is not only the case that individuals increase their take-up of preventive

care specic to the family shock, even when shocks are likely uninformative of their own risks, but they

may also reduce the take-up of preventive care that pertains to competing, non-salient health risks.

This is consistent with limited attention and, while suggestive, can have implications for pitfalls in

leveraging salience as a policy tool, which we discuss in the next section.


reason (beyond potential diagnostic tests). Regressions that include our set of controls nd quite precise zeros, whether we use

the post-shock period (-0.0003, s.e. 0.0015) or the pre-shock period (-0.0014, s.e. 0.0013); regressions of raw correlations with no

controls actually produce negative estimates (-0.0045 with s.e.     of 0.0012 for post-shock periods; -0.0096 with s.e.   of 0.0012 for

pre-shock periods). Ex-ante, before investigating the data for verication, one could not have precluded some degree of learning

about own cancer risk, since risk factors that lead to a wife's female cancer could potentially lead to a husband's cancer.
    41 We   were unable to conduct any meaningful analysis with male-related cancers (such as prostate cancer). We ended up with

a very small sample size that resulted in standard errors three times as large as those in the analysis of female cancers, which

produced wide and uninformative condence intervals.
    42 Since   both cardiovascular disease and cancer compose a large share of deaths, we have excluded them from the baseline groups

to avoid mechanical correlations. For example, if we neglect to do it and nd that individuals whose spouse died of cardiovascular

shock are less likely to visit diagnostic radiologists, it could be driven by the fact the those whose spouse died of cancer are more

likely to do so and also constitute a large share of the baseline group (of individuals whose spouse died of any non-cardiovascular

cause).




                                                                   24
5 Discussion and Conclusion
    Tying together our set of results, this paper has identied intra- and inter-generational family

spillovers as a causal channel through which health behaviors are shaped over the natural course

of the life cycle.       We have seen that spouses and adult children immediately increase their health

investments and improve their health behaviors in response to family shocks, and that these eects are

economically signicant and long-lasting. We have found that the impacts of shocks can be far-reaching,

as they also spill over to the consumption of healthcare by siblings, stepchildren, sons and daughters

in-law, and even coworkers.            This reveals network spillovers in consumption that are signicant in

magnitude, breadth, and persistence, within the context of healthcare which constitutes a large share

of households' expenditure.           As such, our ndings can also be informative for consumption network

eects and multipliers more generally and for our understanding of their nature and scope.                               Using

dierent strategies, we have additionally highlighted likely mechanisms that may underlie the estimated

spillovers. The evidence supports the hypothesis that shocks within the family or social network act as a

vehicle through which individuals learn information about their own health, and points to salience and

attention as major operative channels, within a variety of cases where shocks are likely uninformative

of one's own risk. While this salience channel seems to lead to overall increased awareness of health,

the ndings suggest that agents' attention is particularly drawn to the local nature of the shock so

that they take actions specic to the realm of that risk.

    Consequently, our ndings also have implications for models of health-related behaviors. The results

highlight the importance of inter-personal interactions, suggesting we should analyze health behaviors,

the demand for health investments, and the consumption of healthcare at the family level; and even

more broadly, in the context of one's social network.                   Our results also inform models with respect

to the ingredients they should suitably include.                They point to event-driven decision processes and

suggest that within-network learning and, in particular, salience and attention should be key modeling

components.

    Finally, our ndings could have implications for policies that aim to improve population health.

While inducing individuals to change their health habits is challenging, the results provide a proof of

concept that health behaviors are not immutable. More concretely, the ndings oer the leveraging

of family events as a window of opportunity for targeted interventions. This can become increasingly

implementable with the growing family-centered approach to healthcare delivery, in which medical

professionals actively involve family members in the treatment process. As family health events induce

responses with a high degree of adherence, they seem to involve the intrinsic motives necessary for

persistent behavioral changes. Building on the likely channels, one could devise policies that provide

individual-specic information on risks in the course of these family events, or even strategies that

exploit salience of health to actively oer preventive care, e.g., by introducing defaults that auto-
                                                                                                                              43
matically opt family members into optional checkups, screenings, or basic risk-reducing treatments.

However, our ndings also point more generally to potential pitfalls in using salience as a policy tool


  43 This   ts the spirit of formal guidelines to reduce cardiovascular risk by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the

American Heart Association (AHA) (Stone et al. 2013), which recommend family screenings of high-risk individuals to identify

additional family members who would benet from assessment and treatment.




                                                                25
(e.g., through information provision or through surveying as in Zwane et al. 2011).      We have found

that individuals' attention can be drawn to particular risks even in the absence of relevant informa-

tion, which can lead to excessive preventive care that may be both harmful and expensive. What is

more, consistent with limited attention, we have seen that increased salience of one risk may come at

the expense of another, which can simultaneously divert individuals' attention away from non-salient

conditions of which they might be at higher risk. Hence, salience-based interventions may be designed

more eectively by taking a broad view of their potential consequences and by using more ne-grained

personal data so that they could be tightly tailored to households' particular circumstances.       Such

interventions may induce greater gains by drawing agents' attention to a pertinent aspect specic to

them (e.g., their most likely health risk), and, at the same time, may reduce the potential loss involved

in unintended crowd out of non-salient dimensions, as these would be made less relevant by design.

Notes: These figures plot changes in consumption of preventive care by spouses in response to family cardiovascular shocks. The x-axis denotes time
with respect to the shock, normalized to period 0. For the treatment group, period 0 is when the actual shock occurs; for the control group, period 0 is
when a ‚Äúplacebo‚Äù shock occurs (while their actual shock occurs in period 5). The dashed gray line plots the behavior of the control group. To ease the
comparison of trends, from which the treatment effect is identified, we normalize the level of the control group‚Äôs outcome to the pre-shock level of the
treatment group‚Äôs outcome (in period ùë° = ‚àí1). This normalized counterfactual is displayed by the blue line and squares. The red line and circles plot
the behavior of the treatment group.

Notes: This table studies the heterogeneity in family responses to cardiovascular shocks along different dimensions. Column 1 estimates equation
(4) and analyzes how spouses‚Äô responses in statin consumption vary by whether the spouse's own predicted cardiovascular risk is above or below
the median. Column 2 estimates equation (3) and analyzes statin consumption responses by spouses whose cholesterol levels had been already
tested for in the pre-shock periods. In column 3 we study whether children whose parents were younger at the time they experienced the
cardiovascular shock are also more prone to increase their consumption of preventive care. Specifically, we estimate equation (4), where we
interact the treatment effect with both the child's own age and the parent's age at the time of the parental shock. We include as controls age fixed
effects, calendar year fixed effects, gender, and education, and we report robust standard errors clustered at the household by experimental-group
level. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Notes: This table reports mean differences-in-differences estimates for family members‚Äô responses to cardiovascular shocks. Columns 1 to 4
estimate equation (3) for different family circles. The comparability of biological children included in column 2 to stepchildren included in column
1 is in terms of ages and data construction considerations, so that we include biological children of all ages (25-65) whose parent survived for at
least three years. Columns 5 to 7 study how the spillover to sons and daughters in-law varies by distance. Column 5 replicates the overall average
effect on in-laws from column 3 but for the sample of families for whom we have non-missing data on residence. In column 6 we divide the sample
into children in-law who live closer to or further from their parents in-law using the median distance, and we report the average effect for each
subsample split calculated using a regression of specification (4). Cutting the sample further, column 7 includes only those whose distance from
their in-laws is shorter than the sample median, and splits the remaining sample according to the 25th percentile of the distance distribution. We
include as controls age fixed effects, calendar year fixed effects, gender, and education, and we report robust standard errors clustered at the
household by experimental-group level. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Notes: This table reports the dynamic differences-in-differences estimates for the evolution of household responses around fatal shocks using
specification (5). The regressions are estimated on treated households only, where we divide the sample by cause of death. The table displays
estimates for the ùõøùëü parameter vector of the interaction between cause of death indicators and the indicators for time with respect to the shock from
-4 to +4, where the baseline period is -1. As such, for each preventive care outcome that we study, the estimates display how the utilization of this
preventive care by individuals whose family member died of some disease x compares to the utilization by those whose family member died of
any other cause. Column 1 studies statin consumption of individuals whose spouse died of cardiovascular disease compared to those whose spouse
died of any other cause. Column 2 provides a similar analysis of statin consumption by adult children around parental death. Column 3 studies
healthcare costs associated with visits to diagnostic radiologists, comparing individuals whose spouse died of cancer to those whose spouse died
of any other cause. Column 4 provides a similar analysis but where the outcome variable is an indicator for an outpatient hospital contact for the
reason of having a family member with a history of cancer (code Z80 in ICD-10 classification). We include as controls age fixed effects, calendar
year fixed effects, gender, and education, and we report robust standard errors clustered at the household level. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Notes: This table reports mean differences-in-differences estimates for spousal responses to fatal shocks using different specifications of equation
(6). Column 1 studies the consumption of medication for smoking cessation by individuals whose spouse died of lung cancer compared to those
whose spouse died of any non-cancer cause. Column 2 studies the consumption of this medication by individuals whose spouse died of non-lung
cancer compared to those whose spouse died of any non-cancer cause. Column 3 studies husbands' expenditure on diagnostic radiology, comparing
those whose wife died of female cancers (ovarian, cervical, or breast cancer) to those whose wife died of any non-cancer cause. Column 4 provides
a similar analysis but where the outcome variable is husbands‚Äô incidence of cancer diagnoses, measured as an indicator for husbands' contacts with
inpatient or outpatient hospital departments for any cancer-related reason (beyond potential diagnostic tests). Columns 5 and 6 study cross-
condition responses. Column 5 studies expenditures on diagnostic radiology by individuals whose spouse died of cardiovascular disease compared
to those whose spouse died of other causes (excluding cancer). Column 6 studies statin consumption by individuals whose spouse died of cancer
compared to those whose spouse died of other causes (excluding cardiovascular disease). We include as controls age fixed effects, calendar year
fixed effects, gender, and education, and we report robust standard errors clustered at the household level. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Notes: This table presents means of key variables in our analysis sample based on data from period t = -1. For each event, the treatment group is
comprised of individuals whose family member (or peer) experienced a shock in some calendar year, to whom we match as a control group
individuals from the same cohorts whose family member (or peer) experienced the same shock but five years later (Œî=5). To construct our sample,
we start from the universe of households in which an individual experienced one of the shocks that we consider between the years 1985 and 2011,
where all of our matches across household members are based on the pre-shock period t = -1. Our primary sample of non-fatal health shocks is
comprised of all households in which one individual experienced a heart attack or a stroke (for the first time) and survived for the four-year analysis
horizon. The main family circles that we study are spouses and adult biological children. Our sample of spouses is based on all married and
cohabiting couples among families in which one spouse experienced a shock. The registers provide such spousal matches across all individuals
born between 1910 and 1970, who are the cohorts covered in our data. For children, the registers provide matches to biological parents for
individuals born after 1960. Our sample of adult biological children is based on these matches. The sample of siblings is also based on parental
linkages, such that siblings are defined as individuals who share biological parents. For the more distant circles of family members and peers, we
increase the statistical power by reducing the data requirement to include individuals who survived for at least three after the cardiovascular shock
(instead of four). Stepchildren are defined as any child with a non-biological link to the individual that experienced the shock. We establish these
links by combining the spousal linkages and the biological parent linkages. Specifically, we define as a ‚Äústepchild‚Äù any person for whom neither
biological parent is the individual that experienced the shock but for whom one biological parent is the spouse of that individual. Sons and daughters
in-law are simply the spouses of the biological children. We proxy for peers using coworkers based on matched employer-employee register data,
where we define workplaces using physical establishment units. From our sample of individuals who experience a health shock we identify those
who have worked during the pre-shock periods from -4 to -1, and we include in the coworkers sample all employees from the corresponding
workplaces. We exclude any coworker who is also a family member. Our secondary sample of fatal shocks includes all families in which one
member died between 1985 and 2011. For these shocks we study spouses and biological children, whose respective samples are constructed in the
same way as described above.

Notes: This table studies the heterogeneity in spousal responses to cardiovascular shocks along different dimensions. Column 1 estimates equation
(4) and analyzes how spouses‚Äô responses in cholesterol testing vary by whether the spouse's own predicted cardiovascular risk is above or below
the median. In this regression, the post-shock years also include period 0, in which the dynamic analysis found a large effect, and the sample
comprises residents of Greater Copenhagen for whom data on blood tests are available. Column 2 provides a similar analysis for this subsample
but where the outcome variable is spouses‚Äô statin consumption. Columns 3 and 4 estimate equation (4) to study how spousal responses in statin
consumption vary by the similarity of their predicted baseline cardiovascular risk to that of their partners who experience the shock. Column 3
interacts the treatment effect with this risk gap, and column 4 also adds an interaction with an indicator for whether the spouse's own predicted
risk is above or below the median. Column 5 estimates equation (3) and analyzes statin consumption responses by spouses whose cholesterol
levels had been already tested for in period -2 or -1. We include as controls age fixed effects, calendar year fixed effects, gender, and education,
and we report robust standard errors clustered at the household by experimental-group level. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Notes: This table studies the heterogeneity in spousal responses to cardiovascular shocks along different dimensions. Columns 1-2 estimate
equation (4) and analyze whether spouses‚Äô responses in statin consumption vary by the presence of younger children. Column 1 interacts the
treatment effect with an indicator for the presence of children younger than 18, and column 2 also adds an interaction with the spouse's own age.
Similar results are found for other age thresholds (12 and 6). In these regressions we include prime-age spouses (ages 25-55) who are more likely
to have younger children. Columns 3-4 estimate equation (4) to study whether spousal responses vary by the severity of the family shock, as
defined by the number of hospitalization days. Similar results are found if severity is defined by hospitalization days being above or below the
median, and if we further interact the treatment effect with the sick spouse‚Äôs age at the time of the shock. Column 3 and 4 jointly show that while
those who experience more severe shocks are more likely to drop out of the labor force (and potentially require more caregiving), spouses‚Äô health
investments do not vary by this dimension. Column 5-8 investigate responses by income losses. First, columns 5-6 estimate equation (3) and show
that the investments in spousal health are present even though households experience very small income losses (taking into account all income
sources and government transfers). Second, columns 7-8 further show that while households in which the sick person was the primary earner
experience larger income losses, spousal health investments do not vary by this dimension. These regressions include prime-age sick spouses (of
ages 25-55) who were more likely to participate in the labor force in the pre-period, but similar results are found when we include all households
and define income shares for each household member using income from any source (not only from labor earnings). We include as controls age
fixed effects, calendar year fixed effects, gender, and education, and we report robust standard errors clustered at the household by experimental-
group level. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

 Notes: This table reports the dynamic differences-in-differences estimates for the evolution of household responses using specification (2). It
 displays estimates for the ùõøùëü parameter vector of the interaction between the treatment indicator and the indicators for time with respect to the
 shock from -4 to +4, where the baseline period is -1. In this table, we analyze only households in which the family members whose behaviors we
 study do not share the same doctor with the person who experiences the cardiovascular shock. We do so to study whether the spillover effects can
 be explained by supply-side responses in the form of family physicians who aggregate information across the different members of the household.
 The data allow matching patients to their general practitioner (GP) since any service provided to a patient by a GP documents the GP‚Äôs identifier
 and whether he or she is the patient‚Äôs assigned GP. The analysis of family members with different matched GPs is reported in column 1 for spouses
 and in column 6 for children. As the different physicians may share clinics which could lead to information flows across doctors, we further
 guarantee the separation of healthcare providers by studying only physicians whose patient overlap is minimal. Specifically, we exclude
 observations for whom the GP of the person that experienced the shock treated a non-negligible portion of the patients of the GP that is assigned
 to the family member. Columns 2-3 and 7-8 include only observations where patient overlap falls below a threshold number (where the average
 number of patients per GP is 1,279), and column 4-5 and 9-10 include only observations where patient overlap falls below a threshold share.
 Overall, we find similar-magnitude effects among these households so that the spillover is unlikely attributed to aggregation of information by a
 family doctor. The regressions include as controls age fixed effects, calendar year fixed effects, gender, and education, and we report robust
 standard errors clustered at the household by experimental-group level. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

 Notes: This table reports mean differences-in-differences estimates for family members‚Äô responses to fatal shocks. In column 1, using equation
 (3), we estimate the consumption of medication that treats nicotine or alcohol dependence by individuals whose spouse‚Äôs cause of death was
 autoimmune disease. Columns 2 to 4 estimate equation (3) for different behavioral outcomes of adult children, which are indicated at the top of
 each column. Columns 5 and 6 estimate specifications of equation (6) for adult children. Column 5 compares statin consumption by individuals
 whose parent died of cardiovascular disease to that by individuals whose parent died of any other cause; column 6 compares expenditure on
 diagnostic radiology by individuals whose parent died of cancer to that by individuals whose parent died of any other cause. We include as controls
 age fixed effects, calendar year fixed effects, gender, and education, and we report robust standard errors clustered at the household level.

Notes: This table reports mean differences-in-differences estimates using equation (3) for the effects of shocks on family members‚Äô hospital
contacts. The outcome ‚Äúcardiovascular disease‚Äù represents an indicator for contacts related to cardiovascular conditions; the outcome ‚Äúany
hospitalization‚Äù represents an indicator for any hospital contact with either an inpatient or an outpatient department; the outcome ‚Äúmajor
conditions‚Äù represents an indicator for a hospital contact related to any severe condition included in the Charlson Comorbidity Index (Charlson et
al. 1987): Acute Myocardial Infarction, Cerebrovascular Disease, Chronic Pulmonary Disease, Congestive Heart Failure, Cancer, Dementia,
Diabetes with chronic complications, Diabetes without complications, AIDS/HIV, Hemiplegia or Paraplegia, Metastatic Carcinoma, Mild Liver
Disease, Moderate or Severe Liver Disease, Peptic Ulcer Disease, Peripheral Vascular Disease, Renal Disease, and Rheumatologic Disease
(Connective Tissue Disease). This index is a weighted sum of the number of specific diagnoses in a given year, which was originally designed to
predict ten-year mortality and is now widely used as a measure of adverse health (see, e.g., Ho and Pakes 2014 and Finkelstein et al. 2016). Similar
results are found when we narrow the analysis to conditions included in the Iezzoni Chronic Conditions (Iezzoni et al. 1994), another widely-
studied set of illnesses (see, e.g., Welch et al. 2011 and Finkelstein et al. 2016), as well as when we study the Charlson numerical index itself
(instead of illness indicators). We include as controls age fixed effects, calendar year fixed effects, gender, and education, and we report robust
standard errors clustered at the household level. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.
