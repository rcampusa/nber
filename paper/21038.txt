1.      Introduction

        The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program was established with the

passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996

(PRWORA). The authorizing legislation for TANF stated four main goals: (i) to provide

assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes

of relatives; (ii) to end the dependency of needy parents on government benefits by promoting

job preparation, work, and marriage; (iii) to prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock

pregnancies and establish annual numerical goals for preventing and reducing the incidence of

these pregnancies; and (iv) to encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families.

To meet these goals the Congress appropriates an annual block grant to states of $16.5 billion,

and because the appropriation is fixed in nominal terms, the real value has declined by over 25

percent since its inception. 1

        In this chapter I provide a brief history of the TANF program, including changes made as

part of the 2005 Deficit Reduction Act. I then present a variety of program statistics, including

trends in aggregate and state-level caseloads and spending, along with changes in the

demographic composition of the program, especially the shift from adult with child cases to

child-only cases. I also highlight the changing composition of spending on the program from

cash assistance to in-kind assistance, and the challenges faced in documenting total (cash + in-

kind) caseloads and spending. I follow this with a discussion of the behavioral issues

surrounding TANF, including the four program goals and possible modifications as part of the

2014 reauthorization legislation, and then I provide a systematic review of the research evidence

on whether those goals have been met. For readers with less formal training in economics, the

more technical material on behavioral issues can be skipped without loss of generality. Several

major surveys have been written on welfare reform, e.g. Blank (2002, 2009), Moffitt (2003), and

Grogger and Karoly (2005), and in my review of the literature I provide a brief summary of the

research covered in those surveys, but direct most attention to new research. I then conclude with

a discussion of future research needs as we approach the 20th anniversary of welfare reform.



2.     Program History and Rules

       The roots of the present day TANF program lie in colonial America where public relief

was the legal responsibility of the local government (town or county) and financed at the local

level, typically via a property tax (Ziliak and Hannon 2006). Eligibility was also determined by

local, or in a few cases, state governments. Assistance was provided both in the form of “outdoor

relief,” i.e. cash payments and in-kind transfers to those living independently, as well as in the

form of “indoor relief,” which generally meant institutionalization into almshouses. The

provision of outdoor relief came under great pressure from groups like the Charity Organization

Society after the deep recessions of the 1870s and 1880s swelled the rolls, and in response

dozens of cities either eliminated or reduced outdoor relief and replaced it with voluntary

assistance from private charities and religious organizations (Katz 1986; Ziliak 2004). By the

start of the 20th century most state and local governments turned away from poorhouses as a

viable form of assistance, owing to the record of deplorable conditions and questionable success

in aiding the poor. Likewise, private charity as a primary means of relief fell out of favor after

the 1893-94 recession, and in its place came the ascendance of state-funded and administered

outdoor-relief programs. One such program was known as Mothers’ Pensions, which provided

assistance to impoverished widowed mothers with young children, and indeed, by 1920 forty
                                                                                                    3


states offered the program (Skocpol 1992).

       The financial burden of these pensions on states surged with the onset of the Great

Depression, and this led to the federalization of the pension program with passage of the Social

Security Act of 1935 (P.L. 74-271), that among other things, created the Aid to Dependent

Children program (ADC). The stated purpose of the ADC program was to “release from the

wage-earning role the person whose natural function is to give her children the physical and

affectionate guardianship necessary not alone to keep them from falling into social misfortune,

but more affirmatively to rear them into citizens capable of contributing to society.” (Green

Book 2008, p. 7-2). Keeping in line with the mothers’ pension program, the ADC program’s

focal target population was widowed mothers with young (pre-teen) dependent children.

However, with passage of the 1950 amendment to the Social Security Act, coverage was

extended to impoverished mothers caring for a child, not just those widowed (Fishback and

Thomasson 2006). Reflecting that expanded reach, ADC was renamed Aid to Families with

Dependent Children (AFDC) as part of the 1962 Public Welfare Amendments. These

amendments also extended, at state option, assistance to those families with a second adult

(usually a father) who was present and unemployed or underemployed (and not necessarily

permanently disabled), creating two streams of assistance, the AFDC-Basic and AFDC-

Unemployed Parent (AFDC-UP) programs.

        Although nominal work requirements were introduced into the AFDC program in 1967,

as well as “rehabilitative services” a decade earlier, the work requirements were rarely enforced

and thus for most recipients the program provided assistance for mothers (and/or families with an

unemployed parent) for care in the home. This emphasis changed, however, with passage of the

Family Support Act of 1988 (FSA), which required most welfare mothers without a child under
                                                                                                    4


age three to engage in education, work, or training under the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills

Training Program (JOBS). The Family Support Act also required all states to participate in the

AFDC-UP program (only about half the states did so until that point), and it also created child

care programs and associated subsidies for those mothers engaging in training or transitioning

from welfare to work (Green Book 2008, p. 7-4). Since the 1960s, states had been granted

authority to request waivers from Federal program rules under Section 1115 of the Social

Security Act to experiment (usually via demonstration projects) with their welfare programs, but

few exercised the option. On the heels of the FSA, however, caseloads began to explode (for

reasons unrelated to FSA, see Ziliak, et al. 2000; Blank 2001), and thus by 1992, twelve states

were authorized to receive waivers. By the end of President Clinton’s first term in 1996, the

number of approved waivers leapt to forty-three states. These state initiatives set the stage for

Congress to act, and on August 22, 1996, Clinton signed PRWORA into law, which eliminated

AFDC and created its replacement, TANF. The authorizing legislation for TANF expired in

2002, and after a series of continuing resolutions, the program was renewed for another five

years with the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. Since 2010, TANF has operated on annual

continuing resolutions. Table 1 contains a timeline of legislation affecting the TANF program,

while Table 2 provides a summary of key differences between AFDC and TANF, including

some amendments to the initial law as part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. See Ziliak and

Hannon (2006) for a historical timeline of major welfare legislation from the 1601 Elizabethan

Poor Laws through TANF, and Moffitt (2003) for ADC through TANF.

       2.1     Financing

       Leading up to the creation of the ADC program, funding for mothers’ pensions and the
                                                                                                       5


precursors of indoor and outdoor relief were strictly a function of local and state governments.

The Great Depression and passage of the Social Security Act of 1935 changed that, but only

slowly. Specifically, in the early 1930s the federal government provided large grants to states to

cope with the swelling rolls of needy families and displaced workers, which was then codified

into the creation of Social Security, Unemployment Insurance, and ADC (Fishback and

Thomasson 2006). Participation in ADC was voluntary among the states, and assistance came in

the form of grants-in-aid. To qualify for federal assistance, states had to submit plans to the

Social Security Board for approval, which required, among other things, that the program be

made available in all political jurisdictions of the state and that the state participate financially in

the program (Bucklin 1939). The grants were capped at one-third of the program cost, up to $6

per month for the first dependent child and $4 per month for each additional child. In the first

year of 1936, twenty-seven states received federal funds covering just 12 percent of total costs,

and this reached forty-one states and 27 percent of total cost by 1939 (Bucklin 1939, Table 4).

Although Congress appropriated roughly $25 million for the ADC program in its first year, it

was essentially an open-ended obligation designed to meet need (Ruggles, et al. 1998).

        Title XIX of the Social Security Act in 1965, which created the Medicaid and Medicare

programs, changed financing of AFDC from a grant-in-aid to an explicit matching formula based

on the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) used in determining a state’s financial

liability for its Medicaid program. Transitioning from the grant-in-aid to the open-ended FMAP

was contingent on the state adopting Medicaid, the latter of which was adopted by all states but

Arizona by 1972 (Gruber 2003). Specifically, the federal share of a state’s AFDC benefit

payments was determined by the matching formula

                                  𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎 𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒   2
(1)     𝐹𝑀𝐴𝑃 = 1 − 0.45 ∗ �𝑁𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎 𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒� ,
                                                                                                       6


or that the federal share is inversely proportional to the square of the state’s per capita income

relative to the national per capita level. 2 If state per capita income is the same as the aggregate

level then the federal share is 55 percent, but if state income exceeds the national level then the

FMAP is set at a floor of 50 percent. In the last full year of AFDC in 1996 the matching rate was

50 percent for eleven states plus the District of Columbia, and averaged about 60 percent across

all states, with Mississippi receiving the largest federal subsidy of 78 percent (Green Book

1998). Because of the relative permanence of a state’s location in the national income

distribution, the FMAPs remained fairly stable across the three decades in use for the AFDC

program. During this period, upwards of ten states devolved some share of their costs to the local

level, reaching as high as 50 percent in both New York and North Carolina.

          One of the most fundamental changes with welfare reform was that the federal open-

ended obligation to states under AFDC, that implicitly rose and fell with the health of the state’s

macroeconomy, was severed with the creation of the TANF program. Funding for TANF is now

provided to states primarily as a fixed block grant (basic block), a grant-in-aid much more in

spirit with funding under ADC, along with a supplemental grant and a recession-related

contingency grant (Green Book 2008; Falk 2012; Schott, et al. 2012). The basic block grant to

states is based on the maximum of federal expenditures on cash assistance, emergency aid, and

job training under AFDC over the four-year fiscal years 1992 to 1995, and totaled $16.5 billion

across all states and DC. The grant is fixed in nominal dollars, and thus the real value of the

grant has declined by over a quarter since 1997. Congress appropriated supplemental grants to

those state’s that were deemed disadvantaged by the reliance on the FMAP in the early 1990s, in

particular those states with high population growth rates and those that provided very low cash

benefits relative to their poverty rates under AFDC. In total seventeen states qualified for

                                                                                                                     7


supplemental grants, which were funded at $319 million per year from 2001-2011, but

subsequently have been dropped (Falk 2012). A $2 billion contingency fund was established

with PRWORA to those states that met an “economic need test,” defined as an excess

unemployment rate or food stamp caseload growth, and spending on TANF out of its own funds

in excess of what the state spent in FY1994. 3 Monthly payments out of the contingency fund are

capped at 1.67 percent of a state’s basic block grant. The contingency fund ran out in FY2010

during the Great Recession, highlighting the lack of buoyancy of the basic block-grant structure

to respond to economic need compared to the matching-grant funding under AFDC. States did

however gain access to an “emergency” TANF fund of $5 billion for FY2009-10 and a new

allocation of $612 million was added to the contingency fund in each of FY2012-FY2014 (Falk

2012; OFA 2014).

         The TANF legislation mandated that states continue to provide financial support for low-

income families as a condition for receipt of the basic block, known as the maintenance-of-effort

(MOE) requirement. Specifically, states are required to spend annually at least 75 percent of the

outlays on cash assistance, emergency aid, and job training incurred as part of their contribution

to AFDC funding in FY1994. 4 In the aggregate this totals to $10.4 billion (Falk 2012). States can

count any state, local, or “third party” spending (e.g. spending by food banks or domestic

violence shelters) directed towards needy families as long as it is tied to at least one of the four

goals of TANF (Schott, et al. 2012). Indeed, states can reduce direct spending on TANF while

simultaneously increasing the use of “third-party” funds to count as MOE, such as Georgia

3
  The specific economic need test is for (i) the 3-month seasonally adjusted unemployment rate to be at least 6.5
percent and at least 10 percent higher than the corresponding 3-month period in either of the prior two years; or (ii)
for the food stamp caseload (renamed Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) after FY2008) over the
prior 3-month period to be at least 10 percent higher than the adjusted caseload over the same three-month period in
FY1994 or FY1995. The adjustment is determined by excluding those cases deemed ineligible for food stamps as
part of PRWORA, e.g. legal immigrants in the country for less than five years.
4
  The state MOE rises to 80 percent of FY1994 AFDC spending if the state fails to meet its work participation
requirement.
                                                                                                  8


where third-party funds now make up 40 percent of MOE while nominal cuts in direct spending

were implemented (Schott, et al. 2012). If it is a new activity beyond prior commitments under

AFDC, then the state needs to demonstrate that it is in excess of FY1995 spending on that

activity. One such example of new spending used by many states to meet MOE is refundable

State Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC)—by 2011 twenty-one states were using TANF/MOE to

fund a state EITC (Schott, et al. 2012). Failure to meet the state MOE results in a dollar-for-

dollar reduction in the basic block grant in the ensuing fiscal year.

       2.2 Uses of Funds

       Broadly speaking, TANF funds (including MOE) may be spent for the purpose of

providing support in the form of “assistance,” i.e. cash and near-cash benefits, and “non-

assistance,” such as child care, transportation, work supports, employer subsidies, refundable

state EITCs, education and training programs, counseling, non-recurrent benefits such as

diversion payments, and Individual Development Accounts (TANF Tenth Report to Congress

2013). As discussed in the next section, states are only obligated to report on the number of

persons served in assistance cases, but do not have reporting requirements on the number of

persons receiving non-assistance. This poses a real challenge for evaluation of program reach

given that two-thirds of current spending in TANF is on non-assistance.

       States have considerable leeway on how to design and distribute program benefits,

including using different eligibility criteria for different programs within TANF. States may

transfer up to a combined 30 percent of the TANF basic grant to the Child Care and

Development Block Grant (CCDBG) and the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG). Transfers to

the SSBG may be available to families up to twice the poverty line, and spending out of the basic

grant on “healthy marriages” and preventing out-of-wedlock pregnancies are potentially open to
                                                                                                                   9


families regardless of income level as long as it is non-assistance spending (Schott, et al. 2012).

Indeed, PRWORA bestowed enough flexibility to states that ten chose to devolve some of these

programmatic decisions to the county-level government.

         The state MOE funds may be “commingled” with the federal block grant, “segregated”

from the block grant but spent on the state TANF program, or “separated” from federal funds

and operated outside of the TANF program (known as separate state programs (SSP)) (TANF

Tenth Report to Congress 2013). The distinction lies in the degree to which the MOE funds are

subject to federal rules. Commingled funds are subject to the full spectrum of federal TANF

rules, while segregated and separated are subject to progressively fewer federal rules. 5 For

example, neither segregated nor separate funds are subject to the federal five-year time limit, but

segregated funds do face federal restrictions for individuals convicted of certain drug felonies,

whereas separate funds are exempt (Lower-Basch 2011, Table 2).

         2.3      Eligibility and Benefits

         Eligibility for AFDC was restricted to needy children under age 18 who were deprived of

parental support owing to parental absence, incapacitation, or unemployment. 6 Funds were also

available for the child’s caretaker (usually the mother), and for another adult deemed essential to

the child’s welfare (usually the unemployed father). It was not possible for an AFDC recipient to

also receive support from Supplemental Security Income (SSI), though families could blend

benefits, with some on AFDC and some on SSI. Undocumented immigrants were ineligible, as

were children that received foster care payments.


5
  Some states operate solely-state funded programs (SSF), which are funded outside of TANF and MOE and thus not
subject to any of the federal rules. They are designed to assist those families facing difficulty meeting work
requirements such as two-parent families or those with significant barriers to employment (but not so severe as to
gain an exemption under TANF). A Government Accountability Office (2010) survey of states indicated that as of
2010 twenty-nine states operated SSFs, most of which began after enactment of DRA 2005.
6
  Children were no longer eligible upon their 18th birthday, unless they were a full-time student, then benefits were
paid until their 19th birthday.
                                                                                                             10


        Economic eligibility under AFDC was determined by the family’s income and liquid and

vehicle assets, the upper limits of which were set by the federal government. Income of all

family members was generally deemed to the child, and the monthly gross income was not

permitted to exceed 185 percent of the state’s monthly “need standard.” 7 Net, or countable

income, was not allowed to exceed 100 percent of the need standard. States did not have leeway

in determining what counted as income without a waiver, but what was left unspecified in federal

law was the definition of “need standard.” Roughly half the states defined need in terms of

minimum subsistence compatible with decency and health, another forty percent defined need in

terms of a budgetary shortfall relative to the state’s assistance standard, and the remainder either

specified need by statutory mandate or simply as having no support (Chief 1979). There was

substantial cross-state variation in need standards, some of which likely reflected differences in

cost-of-living and some political choice, though the real value of the need standard for the

median state by 38 percent over the last three decades of the program (Green Book 1998). TANF

no longer requires that states establish a need standard, though most states continue to do so.

However, only fourteen states in 2012 applied some variant of the “185 percent of need” for the

gross-income limit. Most states under TANF adopted a more stringent test, and in some cases

dropped the gross income test altogether (Kassabian, et al. 2013). For example, in 2012 West

Virginia applied a 100 percent of need for a gross income test, while Alabama applied a 100

percent of the payment standard (see definition below) for the monthly net income limit, which

was only $215 for a family of three.

        States were initially given some latitude in setting real property and vehicle asset limits


7
 Some income sources were exempt. For example, after passage of the FSA in 1988 EITC refunds were no longer
counted as income, and were exempt from treatment as a liquid asset for two months after receipt (Green Book
1998). In addition, the gross income limit was dropped to 150 percent of need for a few years after OBRA 1981,
before returning to 185 percent.
                                                                                                                11


used in determining benefit eligibility under AFDC. Indeed, prior to the Omnibus Budget

Reconciliation Act of 1981, there was substantial state-specific heterogeneity in asset limits, but

by 1984 only five states had vehicle limits below the allowable federal maximum of $1500, and

nine states had non-housing, non-burial personal property limits below the federal maximum of

$1000. By 1994, all states but two had their asset limits set equal to the federal maximum

(California and Iowa had received welfare waivers prior to 1994). Under TANF, states once

again have the flexibility to set the liquid and vehicle asset limits for eligibility. As shown in

Table 3, most states raised the ceiling on liquid assets, and five states eliminated that test

altogether. 8 Moreover, with few exceptions, states now exempt at least one vehicle from the test

if it is used to meet basic needs or to transport a disabled dependent, and nineteen states exempt

all vehicles when determining initial eligibility. For most of the states, the published goal of

increasing asset and vehicle limits associated with TANF was to promote welfare-to-work

transitions and saving among low income households, consistent with TANF goal (ii) listed in

the Introduction.

                                                     [Table 3 here]

        What set TANF apart from its predecessor was the introduction of a host of new

eligibility rules and limits. Most of the new program features evolved out of state-level

experiments conducted in the early 1990s via waivers from federal regulations granted by the

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. For example, as shown in Table 3, thirty-two

states offer formal diversion programs that steer eligible applicants away from the official

caseload and instead toward a lump-sum payment, typically valued at three months of the

maximum benefit for a given family size. This policy is targeted primarily to those potential

resource containing a vast amount of detail on the specific policies adopted by states over time.
                                                                                                     12


cases in need of very short-term assistance, and where the adult caretaker is comparatively “job

ready.” In most states, diversion is voluntary, but also limited to two or three times in a lifetime,

and if accepted, usually entails a period of ineligibility for the regular TANF program of three to

twelve months, though in seven states the client is immediately eligible. In addition, seventeen

states impose a family cap on the size of the benefit, which means that the size of the benefit is

restricted in some form from increasing when a child is born into or enters a pre-existing

assistance unit. In most cases states do not increase the benefit at all, though there are a few

exceptions. Two states (New Hampshire and North Dakota) no longer allow two-parent cases,

two others impose new restrictions if the second parent is not disabled, and nine still require the

additional tests under the old AFDC-UP program, i.e. the hours and work history tests, and a

waiting period (Kassabian, et al. 2013, p. 20).

       The policies that garnered the most attention, and controversy, were work requirements,

sanctions, and time limits. Work requirements came to the fore in AFDC after passage of the

Family Support Act, which mandated that adult caretakers with dependents over age 3 enroll in

JOBS training programs. As summarized in Table 2, the TANF law stipulated that the adult must

participate in work activities, and at least half of the caseload must be engaged in 30 hours of

work-related activity by FY2002 (20 hours if there is a single parent or caretaker relative of a

child under age 6). These activities include, among others, unsubsidized employment, subsidized

private or public sector employment, on-the-job training, job search and job readiness assistance

(for a maximum of 6 weeks), community service programs, vocational educational training (12

months maximum), and education directly related to employment for recipients without a high

school diploma or equivalent. With the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, 50 percent of all adults in

a state receiving assistance in TANF, and 90 percent of two-parent households, must participate
                                                                                                    13


in more tightly specified and counted work activities (Parrott, et al. 2007). Those percentages are

lowered if TANF caseloads fall below their 2005 levels. States have the flexibility to decide what

work activities count, at how many hours per week, and whether certain persons may be exempt

from work requirements. The latter most often involve those working full time in unsubsidized

jobs, the elderly, the ill or incapacitated or caring for such a person, and expectant mothers in

their third trimester. However, states generally may not exclude these persons when calculating

their work participation rates.

       Nineteen states now require some form of mandatory job search at the point of benefit

application, and in fourteen of those states the sanction for noncompliance is to deny the

application. Moreover, if a client is not participating in their assigned work activities, then that

case generally faces sanctions, ranging from the adult being removed from the case for a fixed

period of time, the family benefit being reduced by a fixed percentage, or the whole family being

removed. The initial sanction in twenty states calls for full removal of the benefit and/or case

closure, typically for one to three months. After repeat noncompliance, all but three states either

close the case or remove the entire family from the benefit. In Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi,

Pennsylvania, and Washington the latter sanction is permanent.

                                            [Table 4 here]

       TANF imposed a maximum lifetime limit of 60 months of federal benefits for families

with an adult recipient, though states have the option of imposing more stringent limits, or even

extending assistance beyond the five years provided the support is out of state MOE funds.

Federal law exempts child-only cases from the time limit. Table 4 summarizes state time limit

policies as of 2012. Thirty-four states adhere to the basic 60-month federal policy (with some

deviations, such as benefit receipt in 24 out of every 60 months), six limit assistance to 48
                                                                                                   14


months, two limit to 36 months, and four limit to 24 months or less. After the federal 60 month

limit is reached, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont, and the District of Columbia offer

unlimited benefits out of non-federal funds subject to various restrictions. Moreover, five states

only time limit the adult on the case and continue to provide assistance to the child-only case.

States may also exempt 20 percent of their caseload from the 60 month federal limit. The bottom

panel of Table 4 highlights that nine states have more complicated time limits, such as Nevada,

which staggers 24 months of receipt followed by 12 months of ineligibility.

       Beyond the standard income, asset, work, and time limits, many states also opted to

impose additional behavioral requirements on the children or adults, or both. For example, adults

may be subject to drug testing, while children may be required to maintain a minimum grade

point average or attendance (thirty-six states), to receive immunizations (twenty-four states), and

to receive regular health checkups (seven states) (Kassabian, et al. 2013, Table III.A.1). Failure

to adhere to any of these varied rules and regulations could result in sanctioning of the TANF

case for noncompliance. The form of the sanction depends of the activity where the

noncompliance occurs, but can entail temporary removal of the adult from the benefit allotment

for several months or more, to as severe as permanent removal of the full family from the rolls.

       Like most transfer programs, the basic cash benefit amount in AFDC, and its successor

TANF, is determined by the maximum benefit amount (G), the rate (t) at which the benefit is

reduced as earned and unearned income (Y) increases, and the level and sources of income that

can be excluded (D) from benefit determination:

(2)    𝐵𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑓𝑖𝑡 = 𝐺 − 𝑡 ∗ (𝑌 − 𝐷).

In the AFDC program, the maximum benefit was set at the state level, and as presented in Table

5 there was considerable state variation in generosity, reflecting both income and cost-of-living
                                                                                                                  15


differences and also voter preferences for redistribution (Ribar and Wilhelm 1999). This

variation has continued in the TANF program. Just over half the states increased the nominal

maximum guarantee since enactment of PRWORA, but even still there has been an across-the-

board decline in the inflation-adjusted value of the maximum payment. As seen in the last

column of Table 5 the real benefit declined from anywhere between 24 percent and 70 percent

between 1970 and 2012, and for the median state it fell by 51 percent. Although the need

standard under AFDC was supposed to reflect some minimum monthly threshold of income

necessary to meet basic needs, most states did not tie the maximum benefit to the need standard,

but instead utilized a so-called payment standard, and as of 1996, thirty states had payment

standards below the need standard (Green Book 1996). And in a dozen of these states, the

maximum benefit was below the payment standard. The implication is that even though the

household may have passed the gross and income tests, along with the two asset tests, they may

not have qualified for any positive benefit if there was a significant discrepancy between the

need standard and the maximum guarantee, G. Under TANF, the need standard is no longer

required by law, and only twenty states in 2012 relied on the payment standard to set the

maximum, and utilized the basic formula in equation (2) for benefit determination. 9

                                                 [Table 5 here]

        The statutory benefit reduction rate, t, on earned income after deductions under AFDC

was cut from 100 percent to 67 percent in 1967, only to be raised back to 100 percent as part of

OBRA 1981. The statutory tax rate on unearned income was also 100 percent. These tax rates

were applied to net (countable) income. Earnings of most household members were counted as

gross income, and likewise for nonlabor income, though several sources were exempt such as

9
  Kassabian, et al. (2013), Table II.A.2. As noted on p. 94 in this document, “owing to the complexity of state
programs, identifying the payment standard and maximum benefit is no longer clear. States may include multiple
standards in the benefit calculation, depending on the type or amount of income.”
                                                                                                     16


SSI and food stamps. The monthly deductions allowed included a $90 work expense disregard,

followed by a disregard of $30 and one-third of remaining earnings. After four months of

consecutive earnings, recipients were no longer eligible for the one-third disregard, so the

disregard was simply $120. After eight additional months of consecutive earnings, recipients

were no longer eligible for the $30 disregard, so the disregard was $90, after which earnings

were taxed at 100 percent.

                                                [Table 6 here]

       Under welfare reform most states nominally embraced the “making work pay”

philosophy by expanding earnings disregards so that recipients could retain more of the monthly

benefit if they worked. Table 6 summarizes the state disregard policy as of 2012. There it is

evident that states have adopted a diverse set of policies, ranging from no disregards allowed in

Arkansas and Wisconsin, to 100 percent of earnings disregarded (at least in the early months) in

the case of eight states. Most, however, continue to allow recipients to deduct a flat dollar

amount, and then a certain percentage of earnings thereafter. Across all jurisdictions listed in

Table 6, the average earnings disregard rate is 39 percent, and this rises to 50 percent among

those with nonzero rates. This increased generosity in treatment of earnings was tempered by the

decision to retain statutory benefit reduction rates of 100 percent. In fact, for seven states the

benefit was set at a fraction of the difference between the need or payment standard and net

income, e.g. South Carolina only awards 28.1 percent of the difference.

                                               [Figure 1 here]

       Research by Lurie (1974), Hutchens (1978), Fraker, et al. (1985), McKinnish, et al.

(1999), and Ziliak (2007) indicated that the “effective,” or average marginal, tax rate that AFDC

recipients faced was generally only 40-50 percent of the statutory rate. This gap between
                                                                                                                17


statutory and effective rates could be the result of cross-state variation in disregards stemming

from state policy choices, by caseworker discretion and/or error, or by shifting composition of

income among recipients. Under AFDC states did not have the option of setting disregard

standards absent a waiver from federal rules, and thus the latter two reasons likely account for

most of the statutory-effective gap. As depicted in Figure 1, after passage of PRWORA the

effective rate fell by half in the first five years, whether one considers the rate in terms of the

average state (unweighted) or the average recipient (weighted by number of AFDC/TANF

recipients). Ziliak (2007) shows that the reduction in these rates were most pronounced among

the states that adopted the most aggressive welfare reform policies, suggesting that the observed

decline in effective rates reflected state policy.



3.      Program Statistics

        Figure 2 presents the time series of expenditure on the AFDC/TANF program from its

inception in 1936 until 2012. 10 Real spending, based on the 2012 Personal Consumption

Expenditure Deflator, surged from $6.8 billion in 1960 to $23.8 billion in 1970. Moffitt (1987)

showed that while part of this growth is attributable to the growth of female-headed families,

rising maximum benefit guarantees, and declines in the benefit reduction rate in 1967, the lion’s

share is unexplained by economic forces. The leading noneconomic explanations include

possible shifts in cultural attitudes toward welfare, and a series of court orders that liberalized

access to welfare for cohabiting couples, along with passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that

forbade discrimination in the allocation of federal funds, including access to welfare among

African Americans (Gordon and Batlan 2011). Real spending increased another $12 billion to

SSBG allowed after 1996.
                                                                                                      18


$36 billion in 1977, but then subsequently fell by about $5 billion over the next five years, first

from a growing economy in the late 1970s, and then tightening of eligibility and benefit rules

with OBRA 1981. Real spending flat-lined for the rest of the 1980s, until the run-up in spending

from 1990-93, which we will see below was in response to a strong surge in caseloads. With the

strong economy, implementation of welfare waivers, and then welfare reform, expenditures fell

by one-third in the three-year period after 1994. After that, total spending rebounded by 2000

and then more or less remained flat, though there was a temporary increase in FY2010 when

emergency TANF spending of $5 billion was made available as part of the American Recovery

and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). Real total spending in 2012 of $28.9 billion lies in

between the amount spent between 1971 and 1972, which is in stark contrast to all other

programs in the social safety net that saw significant growth in real spending over the past four

decades (Bitler and Hoynes 2010; Moffitt and Scholz 2010; Ziliak 2014).

                                             [Figure 2]

       The other aspect of Figure 2 that stands in stark contrast with the past is the shifting

composition of spending from cash assistance to in-kind non-assistance after welfare reform.

Although not delineated in the figure as it was not recorded on a regular basis, non-assistance

typically comprised one-fourth to one-third of spending under AFDC. Under TANF, however,

there has been a complete reversal. As early as 2000, one-half of spending was directed to

assistance and the other half to non-assistance, and by the end of the decade two-thirds of

spending was in the form of non-assistance. While states must generally use TANF dollars to

support needy families with children, they are able to set different criteria for assistance versus

non-assistance programs, and as such often direct non-assistance funds to a broader cross-section

of families (i.e. higher income), suggesting the program may be less target efficient. Indeed,
                                                                                                                19


federal and state cash assistance continued its secular decline, even through the Great Recession

(except for FY2010), and total spending was propped up only by non-assistance spending via

state MOE.

        Figure 3 depicts how federal TANF and state MOE funds were allocated in FY2012.

Only 36 percent was spent on basic assistance and work-related activities, in contrast to the 59

percent reported for FY1999 in Figure 5.4 of Moffitt (2003). Moreover, 8 percent of funds were

transferred out to TANF to the CCDBG and SSBG, about 12 percent of funds were allocated to

child care (most in the form of non-assistance subsidies), another 8 percent were allocated to

refundable EITC and child tax credits, 7 percent to address goals (iii) and (iv) of TANF to reduce

out-of-wedlock pregnancy and encourage two-parent families, and a sizable 15 percent of funds

were allocated to “other.” This catch-all category includes child welfare payments and services,

early childhood education, counseling for domestic violence, mental health, and addiction, and

TANF program expenses, among others (TANF Tenth Report to Congress 2013).

                                                [Figure 3 here]

        Figures 4a and 4b provide a glimpse into the trends underlying spending by depicting the

evolution of TANF caseloads and recipients from 1960 to 2013. 11 Also reported are the fraction

of total cases and fraction of total recipients that are designated as “child-only.” This is important

because child-only cases are not subject to federal time limits and work requirements. The trends

in spending in Figure 2 track closely the trends in caseloads and recipients in Figure 4 from 1960

until 1997, but whereas total spending rebounded and then remained relatively stable in real

terms in the ensuing decade, caseloads continued to decline. The disconnect stems from the fact

that post-TANF states are only required to report the number of cases and recipients receiving


11
  The figure includes participants in Separate State Programs starting in FY2000. SSPs contribute only 5.8 percent
to the total caseload in an average year.
                                                                                                     20


assistance, and not the number of persons served in non-assistance. This inhibits greatly our

ability to evaluate welfare reform. Most researchers and members of the policy and advocacy

communities hone in on the caseload trends, but this ignores the fact that scores of individuals

also receive help in the form of non-assistance and do not show up in the caseload counts. Also

of note in Figure 4 is the four-fold increase in the fraction of cases that are child-only from 10

percent in 1990 to over 40 percent in 2013. This has led to a “return to normal” in terms of the

composition of recipients to about 75 percent children found in the 1960s.

                                         [Figures 4a,b here]

       The aggregate caseload trends mask some important heterogeneity in state experiences.

For example, in the mid to late 1980s aggregate AFDC caseloads held fairly steady, but as

documented in Ziliak (2002), this overlooks the fact that nearly half the states experienced

declines in caseloads, and the other half experienced increases, such that in the aggregate they

cancelled out. Figure 5 presents maps depicting caseload change in the welfare reform era, first

from 1993 to 2000, and then from 2000 to 2013. In the boom years of the late 1990s, most states

had declines of 50 percent or more in caseloads, with Hawaii the lone state to see an increase in

caseloads. Over the last decade, however, there is greater divergence across states. Oregon and

Maine, for example, had an increase in caseloads of 120 percent or more, while Illinois and

Texas had declines of over 70 percent. To be certain, what is most notable in the bottom panel of

Figure 5 is the vast majority of states had declines in cash assistance during a very weak

economic period, in sharp contrast to the huge increase in food stamp usage.

                                           [Figure 5 here]

       In light of the substantial declines in the cash assistance, it is important to document

whether the characteristics of the caseload recipients have changed over time. Figure 4 depicted
                                                                                                     21


one such change in the shift toward more child-only recipients. Because the goals of TANF were

geared more towards the adult recipient, Table 7 presents selected characteristics on the adults in

receipt of assistance. It is important to once again recall that this information is only available for

those receiving cash assistance, and is not necessarily reflective of the entire adult caseload on

non-assistance. There has been a marked downward shift in the age composition of adults on

assistance—48 percent were under age 30 in 1996, but this rose to 59 percent by 2010. At the

same time there has been a skill upgrading of adults 25 years and older with a 6 percentage point

drop in the fraction who are high school dropouts. While the fraction of adults employed in 2010

is double the rate in 1996, there has been a decline over the past decade, and since the fraction

unemployed fell as well, there is now a higher percentage not in the labor force. Note that the

employment rate of 22 percent in 2010 seems low given the presence of nominal 50 percent

work requirements, but some activities that count toward work-requirement goals are not

counted as “employment,” and in FY2010 38 states had earned a sufficient number of so-called

caseload-reduction credits to reduce their effective work participation rates below 25 percent

(TANF Tenth Report to Congress 2013). Over the past decade there has been an increase both in

the fraction of adults that are married or never married, and a decline in the fraction separated or

divorced. Perhaps consistent with the decline in the average age of an adult recipient, there has

been a concomitant increase in the fraction of children under age one receiving assistance. Both

trends suggest that cash assistance is reaching a more vulnerable population today.

                                            [Table 7 here]



4.     Research on the TANF Program

       In this section I review research on the TANF program. The thematic emphasis revolves
                                                                                                    22


around the four statutory goals of the program: (i) to provide assistance to needy families; (ii) to

end dependence on welfare by promoting job preparation and work; (iii) to prevent and reduce

out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and (iv) to encourage the formation of and maintenance of two-

parent families. This necessarily leads to a discussion of research on program participation and

caseloads, labor supply, welfare-to-work transitions, consumption and saving, health, fertility,

child well being, and marriage. Congress clearly was most interested in goals (i) and (ii) in the

beginning with the emphasis on caseload reductions, work requirements, and time limits, but by

the time TANF was reauthorized in DRA 2005, there was heightened interest among some on the

secondary goals (iii) and (iv).

       While many of the issues overlap that of the AFDC program, the details of the behavioral

models under TANF necessarily differ because of programmatic reforms, especially those

policies that affect decisions over time such as work requirements, time limits, and expanded

asset tests. Moffitt (1992, 2003) provides a comprehensive review of the AFDC models, and thus

I first review the underlying behavioral issues within the general TANF paradigm, followed by a

survey of results. Organizing the behavioral issues within the context of the TANF goals

necessarily leads to some subjective decisions. For example, I discuss child support and child

care under goal (iv) along with child well being, though the former two could equally fall under

goals (i) and (ii) as policies designed to foster work and reduce dependence.

4.1    Review of Behavioral Issues

       Because the goals of TANF aspire to affect a wide array of family outcomes, and the

various requirements and incentives that underlie those goals affect budget constraints over time,

I begin with a life cycle model under uncertainty. Although much of the research on the TANF

program has been in reduced form, there have been some important developments in structural
                                                                                                          23


models (Swann 2005; Keane and Wolpin 2002(a,b), 2010; Chan 2013) that followed on the heels

of prior static models of AFDC (Moffitt 1983; Hoynes 1996; Keane and Moffitt 1998), and this

section relies on this paradigm as an organizing framework. This is useful because it offers the

chance to highlight where and how the program is likely to affect decision making over time.

Because TANF is restricted to households with dependent children, and historically most adult

caretakers have been single women, it is standard to specify the model from the perspective of

the mother as the householder, and I follow the literature in this modeling approach.

        Specifically, consider a model whereby in each period the woman chooses consumption

of medical (𝑆𝑡 ) and nonmedical (𝐶𝑡 ) goods and services, whether to work and how much (𝑁𝑡 ),

whether to join TANF (𝑃𝑡 ), whether to have a child (𝐹𝑡 ), and whether to marry (𝑀𝑡 ) in order to

maximize the present discounted value of uncertain utility defined over nonmedical spending,

leisure (𝐿𝑡 ), and the stock of health (𝐻𝑡 ). The dynamic optimization problem facing the woman is

(3)     𝑉(𝐴𝑡 , 𝐾𝑡 , 𝐻𝑡 ) = 𝑈(𝐶𝑡 , 𝐿𝑡 , 𝑃𝑡 , 𝐹𝑡 , 𝑀𝑡 , 𝐻𝑡 ) + 𝛽𝐸𝑡 [𝑉𝑡+1 ],

where 𝐾𝑡 is the stock of human capital; 𝛽 = 1⁄(1 + 𝜌) is the discount factor based on rate of

time preference (𝜌); and 𝐸𝑡 is the time t expectations operator reflecting uncertainty over future

income, fertility, marriage, and health. Similar to the health model of Grossman (1972), there is

no direct utility from medical spending, only indirectly via its effect on the stock of health.

        Income comes from four potential sources: interest income on the prior period assets

(𝑟𝑡 𝐴𝑡 ), where 𝑟𝑡 is a time t interest rate on composite assets; labor earnings (𝑤𝑡 𝑁𝑡 ), where 𝑤𝑡 is

the before-tax hourly wage rate; non-welfare, nonlabor income, 𝑌𝑡 (𝑀𝑡 ), that is a function of

marital status and thus may include the earnings of the spouse or other household members; and

welfare benefits 𝑇𝐴𝑁𝐹𝑡 (𝑓𝑡 (𝑎𝑡 ), 𝐹𝑡 , 𝑤𝑡 𝑁𝑡 , 𝑁𝑡 , 𝑌(𝑀𝑡 ), 𝑟𝑡 𝐴𝑡 , 𝐴𝑡 ), which are a function of the current

size and age structure of the family (𝑓𝑡 (𝑎𝑡 )), fertility, labor and nonlabor income (including

interest income), work, and the stock of assets. Age-adjusted family size and fertility are

important as they potentially affect the size of the maximum benefit guarantee and also lead to

study of time limits and family caps. Earnings and nonlabor income enter because of the limits

for eligibility, and likewise for the stock of assets. This presents opportunities for research on

how benefit reduction rates, earnings disregards, and income and asset tests affect the decisions

to work, consume, save, and participate. Moreover, work enters separately from earnings to

capture the influence of work requirements and training programs.

       Income can be spent on nonmedical consumption at price 𝑝𝑡𝐶 , on medical services at the

Consumption is adjusted by an adult equivalence scale, 𝑒(𝑓𝑡 (𝑎𝑡 )), to reflect that there are

potential economies to scale within the household. The resulting asset accumulation constraint is:

In the ensuing subsections I elaborate on the model and how it can be modified to address

specific policies of interest. For parsimony, I do not spell out all possible state variables and

instead focus on those most relevant to focal research questions.

       Goal 1. To Provide Assistance to Needy Families: Income and Asset Tests

       The first goal of TANF is to support needy families, and as such I initially examine how

the basic eligibility structure of the benefit—notably income and asset tests—affects the decision

to participate in the program. Specifically, based on the model above, the decision to participate

in TANF in period t occurs if and only if

(5)      𝑃𝑡∗ = 𝑉(𝐴𝑡 , 𝐾𝑡 , 𝐻𝑡 |𝑃𝑡 = 1) − 𝑉(𝐴𝑡 , 𝐾𝑡 , 𝐻𝑡 |𝑃𝑡 = 0) > 0,
                                                                                                    25


which says that the family participates in TANF if the value from participation exceeds that

obtained from nonparticipation. Implicit in the calculation are the costs of participation that come

in the form of time and money (e.g. queuing for benefits and thus missing work) and psychic

costs such as stigma (Moffitt 1983). The family must be needy as determined by the gross and

net income tests, and the liquid and vehicle asset tests, which implies that the decision to

participate is made jointly with work, consumption, fertility, and marriage decisions.

       To begin, assume that fertility, marriage, and health are exogenous and thus taken as

given. This is consistent with most static models of labor supply and welfare participation, and

permits us to focus on how the benefit structure. In the presence of income and asset limits that

vary by state k in time t the benefit formula for family i can be written as

(6)    𝑇𝐴𝑁𝐹𝑖𝑘𝑡 = 𝐺𝑖𝑘𝑡 − 𝑡𝑘𝑡 (𝑤𝑖𝑡 𝑁𝑖𝑡 + 𝑟𝑡 𝐴𝑖𝑡 + 𝑌𝑖𝑡 − 𝐷𝑖𝑘𝑡 )
                                 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠
       𝑤𝑖𝑡 𝑁𝑖𝑡 + 𝑟𝑡 𝐴𝑖𝑡 + 𝑌𝑖𝑡 < 𝑌𝑘𝑡

                                        𝑛𝑒𝑡
       𝑤𝑖𝑡 𝑁𝑖𝑡 + 𝑟𝑡 𝐴𝑖𝑡 + 𝑌𝑖𝑡 − 𝐷𝑖𝑘𝑡 < 𝑌𝑘𝑡

       𝐴𝑖𝑡 < 𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑚
              𝑘𝑡

                  𝑙𝑖𝑚
       𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡 < 𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑡

where the maximum guarantee varies by family size within a given state and year, and labor

income, interest income, and other nonlabor income are all subject to benefit taxation after

deductions that vary by family, state, and year (𝐷𝑖𝑘𝑡 ). In order to qualify, gross income must be

below the state-specific gross limit, net income must be below the net limit, the stock of liquid

wealth must be below the state-specific limit, and the market value of the car (𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡 ) must be

below the limit.

       In the absence of TANF (and taxation) and other interest and nonlabor income, the

within-period budget line facing the mother is depicted in Figure 6 as the line segment 𝑎𝑒
                                                                                        ���. The

percent benefit reduction rate and no deductions, the budget constraint facing the mother is the

     �����. If the mother does not work and thus has zero net income, she qualifies for the
line 𝐺𝑏𝑒

                                                                   ���� then her TANF
maximum benefit, G. If she combines welfare and work along segment 𝐺𝑏

benefit is reduced dollar for dollar. Once she reaches point b, her benefit is zero, and earnings

above this point makes her ineligible and she returns to her original budget line. As noted

previously, all states except Arkansas and Wisconsin have set 𝑡𝑘𝑡 = 1; however, with the

exception of the latter two states, all allow earnings deductions of some form. Arkansas and

Wisconsin each offer a flat grant amount that goes to zero once the family reaches the income

                                                               ����. In those two states, TANF has a
limit in the state, which creates a “notch” in the budget line 𝑑𝑑′

                                                                                       ����

in Medicaid. The more typical scenario is similar to that facing a mother in California where the

                                             ���� --and then 50 percent of earnings thereafter is
first $112 per month are disregarded—segment 𝐺𝑑

disregarded along segment ���
                          𝑑𝑐 until she reaches the state’s income limit. Even though the

statutory benefit reduction rate is 100 percent, the effective rate in California is half that amount

so that for each dollar earned the benefit only declines by 0.5. Variations on this schedule are

found in most states, which helps account for the trend decline in effective rates shown in Figure

1. However, whether this tax cut stimulates labor supply is not known a priori because of

potentially offsetting substitution and income effects among the eligibles. Moreover, the lower

effective tax rate makes previously ineligible persons along segment ���
                                                                     𝑏𝑐 newly eligible, and in

this case the substitution and income effects work in tandem to reduce the incentive to work on

the margin. The nonconvexity of the budget constraint Gdc also opens up the possibility that
                                                                                                          27


workers just above the income limit at point c may reduce effort and join the program. Of course,

once one layers additional transfer programs on top of TANF, some of which may interact with

TANF such as food stamps, the budget constraint becomes considerably more complex (Moffitt

2014).

                                                 [Figure 6 here]

         Cash assistance in TANF offers families insurance against income shocks, which means

that there is a consumption floor, 𝐶, below which spending will not fall. In a model with

uncertainty, this floor on consumption can then result in a reduced need to self-insure for

precautionary reasons. Moreover, the explicit limits placed on liquid and vehicle assets may also

discourage families from saving (Hubbard, et al., 1995; Powers 1998; Ziliak 2003; Hurst and

Ziliak 2006). Both of these effects can lead to “over consumption” and suboptimal asset

accumulation over the life cycle.

                                            [Figure 7 here]

         To see the possible implications of the consumption floor on intertemporal consumption

choice, consider a simple two-period model in Figure 7. Ignoring equivalence scales and setting

the price of consumption to 1, the mother will choose to consume more in periods with low

interest rates, and thus the tradeoff between current and future consumption is reflected by the

               ����� with slope – (1 + 𝑟). Suppose that in period one the mother has no assets at
budget segment 𝑎𝑑𝑏

the start of the period and her only source of income out of which to consume is labor earnings,

𝑤1 𝑁1. She is notified at the start of the first period that with certainty she will be laid off at the

end of the period. In the absence of welfare, her optimal consumption choice is found at point c*,

which means that 𝐶1 < 𝑤1 𝑁1 and she will carry savings forward to period two so that 𝐶2 =

(1 + 𝑟)(𝑤1 𝑁1 − 𝐶1 ). Now suppose that TANF is available that offers a consumption floor 𝐶 for
                                                                                                                28


those with low earnings. In period 1 her earnings are too high to be eligible, but with no earnings

in period 2 she is income eligible. This implies that instead of a potential decline in income flow

                   𝑟∗(𝑤1 𝑁1 −𝐶1 )                                      𝑟∗(𝑤1 𝑁1 −𝐶1 )+𝑇𝐴𝑁𝐹2
in period 2 of (       𝑤1 𝑁1
                                    − 1) percent, it only falls by (                          − 1) percent.
                                                                              𝑤1 𝑁1


However, suppose that TANF also imposes asset limits that make the mother categorically

ineligible in period 2 if the stock of wealth (𝐴2 = (𝑤1 𝑁1 − 𝐶1 )) is too high. This asset limit

creates incentives to consume more in period 1 than otherwise would be the case in the absence

of the limit, and thus the mother may instead opt for point c** in Figure 7. In the more general

case of uncertainty over earnings, say because of employment volatility over the business cycle,

the life cycle model predicts that the mother will self-insure in order to protect against an income

shock. However, the presence of 𝐶2 reduces the need to save for precautionary reasons, and the

presence of the asset test only serves to reinforce that disincentive to save. 12

        State policy choices before and after welfare reform may have further affected the

intertemporal consumption and saving decision. For the better part of three decades most states

have allowed the real value of the maximum benefit to erode (see Table 5), which means that in

Figure 7 𝐶2 has shifted down toward the origin, reducing consumption insurance and making c**

suboptimal compared to c*. At the same time states liberalized asset tests (see Table 3),

including six states that eliminated it altogether, which means the mother is no longer indifferent

between c* and c** because c** results in too low of saving. On top of this there is a potentially

important interaction between the asset tests and income tests. Under uncertainty and a 100

percent benefit reduction rate, if the mother knows that any dollar carried over from one period

to the next results in a dollar for dollar reduction in benefits then there is little value in saving in

12
  The fact that interest income gets taxed by the TANF program also creates a time nonseparability in the household
budget constraint, complicating identification and estimation of consumption and labor supply choice. This has not
been addressed in the welfare literature, though see Blomquist (1985) for theoretical treatment and Ziliak and
Kniesner (1999) for estimates in the general case of income taxation.
                                                                                                   29


the event that she needs to join the program. After PRWORA the statutory tax rate on interest

income remains 100 percent, and most states do not provide exemptions to this saving unless it is

in a certain class (e.g. Individual Development Accounts are untaxed in most states). However,

Ziliak (2007) shows that the effective tax rate on unearned income plummeted after welfare

reform, suggesting that there might be more exemptions than official policy would dictate.

Moreover, as depicted in Figure 6 and detailed in Table 6, most states increased earnings

disregards, making higher income (and wealth) individuals potentially eligible for benefits.

Taken together—lower real guarantees, higher asset limits, and higher earning disregards—all

suggest that saving and the asset position of the typical mother on welfare should be higher in

TANF than under AFDC.

       Goal 2. To End Dependence on Welfare: Human Capital, Work Requirements, and Time

       Limits

       The second goal of TANF is to end dependence on welfare by promoting job preparation

and work, and to achieve this goal states shifted TANF resources away from cash assistance and

toward in-kind job training and other basic skills training, and at the direction of Congress,

established work requirements and time limits. What activities count as work-related varies

greatly across states and time, but most states allow at least 10 hours of weekly education and

training to count toward the established work-related activity requirement (Kassabian, et al. 2013

Table III.B.2). Moreover, a typical guideline is that non-exempt adult caretakers are required to

work at least 30 hours per week as soon as possible after entering the system, and no later than

after 24 months of benefit receipt.

       In the static model of labor supply, minimum work requirements are generally expected

to increase aggregate hours among the adult welfare population. Take, for example, a non-
                                                                                                  30


exempt single mother with two children living in California in 2012. The budget constraint

facing the family is depicted in Figure 8, under the assumption that there is no other nonlabor

income. California offers a $638 maximum monthly guarantee, a fixed monthly earnings

disregard of $112, and a variable earnings disregard of 50 percent that makes the effective

benefit reduction rate (brr) 50 percent. This means that the “break-even” income level—the point

at which income eligibility stops—is $1,388 per month (=$638/0.5 + 112). California requires a

minimum of 32 hours of work activity per week, or 128 hours per month. This means that

anything to the right of Nmin is infeasible if she wishes to be on the program. The state minimum

wage in 2012 was $8 per hour, so that if the mother has a minimum wage job and works the

mandated 32 hours per week her monthly earnings are $1,024. She is income eligible for TANF

and qualifies for a benefit of $182 per month. However, if she earns above $10.84 per hour and

meets the work requirement by spending all her hours in paid employment then she is income

ineligible. If she works 40 hours per week then the maximum wage she can receive is $8.67 per

hour in 2012. The implication then is that if the mother is not exempt from work requirements

then only low-wage workers are eligible for TANF, and if they sign up for the program then

aggregate hours of work will increase under the work requirement. However, if they do not sign

up, but enter the labor force, then we again would expect aggregate labor supply to rise. The

exception to this prediction could occur if a sizable fraction do not join TANF and do not

work—so-called disconnected mothers—then it is less clear whether the state will realize higher

labor supply under work requirements.

                                             [Figure 8 here]

       Because the goal of reducing dependence brings time to the forefront, the life cycle

model can provide additional insight into how work requirements might affect labor supply
                                                                                                    31


choice over time. The key modeling decision is whether to characterize subsidized and/or

unsubsidized work, as well as job training and education programs, as “learning-by-doing” skill

formation as in Weiss (1972) or as “on-the-job training” as in Ben Porath (1967). As elucidated

in Heckman, Lochner, and Cossa (2003) the distinction between the two models is important to

our understanding of the effects of policies like work requirements (their application was to the

EITC). In the Weiss model, training and work are complements because skill is acquired by

virtue of doing your job. Following Shaw (1989), suppose we specify the observed wage (𝑤𝑡 ) as

the product of a human capital stock (𝐾𝑡 ) and the unobserved rental rate on human capital (𝑞𝑡 ),

𝑤𝑡 = 𝑞𝑡 𝐾𝑡 . In each period the mother inherits a stock of human capital which depreciates at rate

𝛿𝐾 . New investment occurs on the job through learning-by-doing that depends on hours

worked and the level of human capital, 𝑥(𝑁𝑡 , 𝐾𝑡 ). Human capital evolves according to the law of

motion

(7)      𝐾𝑡+1 = (1 − 𝛿𝐾 )𝐾𝑡 + 𝑥(𝑁𝑡 , 𝐾𝑡 ),

and using the wage equation to replace the capital stock in equation (7) yields

         𝑤𝑡+1                𝑤             𝑤
(8)             = (1 − 𝛿𝐾 ) 𝑞 𝑡 + 𝑥 �𝑁𝑡 , 𝑞 𝑡 �.
         𝑞𝑡+1                  𝑡            𝑡


Equation (8) shows that wages tomorrow are a function of wages today along with new human

capital investment. The introduction of work requirements pulls nonworkers into the labor force

(assuming they remain on TANF), and work today feeds directly into higher wages tomorrow.

That is, work requirements create a nonseparability in the lifetime budget constraint in the

learning-by-doing model. Returning to Figure 8, note that if the mother would choose to work

Nmin in the absence of TANF, then the introduction of TANF will reduce labor supply and skill

formation both from the income effect induced by the provision of the transfer and the

substitution effect given that the marginal wage rate in TANF is only 0.5*w. Thus, work
                                                                                                    32


requirements only lead to higher future wages for those induced to work more in the current

period in the learning-by-doing model.

        In the standard Ben Porath model, work and skill formation are substitutes in the current

period because each hour in training implies a forgone hourly wage. That is, in equation (7) we
                       𝑛           𝑛
replace 𝑁𝑡 with (1 − 𝑁𝑡 ), where 𝑁𝑡 is the fraction of time spent in training. Increasing the amount
                           𝑡           𝑡


of time in training reduces fraction of time in work. If the mother would choose Nmin in the

absence of the work requirement, then introducing TANF with the requirement will make

training relatively more attractive. This is because the opportunity cost of training is lower under

TANF due to the 50 percent benefit reduction rate lowering the net wage compared to the no-

TANF constraint. Moreover, if this human capital development generates higher future wages

placing the mother above the break-even income level, then training is that much more attractive.

Whether and to what extent work requirements are complements or substitutes hinges on the

state of residence and the extent to which training substitutes for work. For example, in Utah if

the children are at least 6 years old then the mother is required to work 30 hours per week, 10 of

which may be in the form of education. This means that two-thirds of the work requirement is

complementary with work, and one-third rivalrous. If the children are under age 6 then the work

requirement is 20 hours per week and all hours must be spent in work and thus training is

complementary via learning by doing.

        Like work requirements, the study of time limits is most conducive in the life cycle

framework. As noted in Table 4, the federal lifetime limit for benefits is five years, though in 18

states the limit is either less than five years and/or clients face intermittent limits prior to

reaching the maximum. As a consequence the timing of work and benefit receipt is closely

linked to the age composition of the children in the family, and ultimately, fertility decisions
                                                                                                    33


(Grogger and Michalopoulos 2003; Swann 2005; Chan 2013). The value function in equation (3)

now must be modified to include a fourth state variable, the stock of years on welfare, 𝐷𝑡 , that

evolves as

(9)    𝐷𝑡 = 𝐷𝑡−1 + 𝑃(𝑎𝑡 ),

where 𝐷𝑡−1 denotes the total number of years on TANF leading up to time period t, and 𝑃(𝑎𝑡 ) is

a modified indicator variable of whether the family is on welfare in time t as a function of the

age composition of the children in the family (𝑎𝑡 ). Equation (6), which describes the TANF

                                                                   𝑙𝑖𝑚
benefit formula, now requires the additional constraint that 𝐷𝑡 ≤ 𝐷𝑘𝑡  , which says that total time

on welfare cannot exceed the state- and year-specific time limit.

       Most of the research on time limits have not incorporated asset tests, and thus TANF only

distorts saving via its effect as a consumption floor. Indeed, it is generally assumed that the

mother survives hand-to-mouth so that there is no self insurance and thus TANF is the sole

means of support in the event of a negative employment shock. This means that the timing of

benefit receipt hinges crucially on the age of the youngest child. Since eligibility ends when the

age of the youngest child reaches age 18, this means that the five-year time limit is not binding if

the youngest child is age 13 or older (but this is raised to age 16 and older in the five states with

a two-year or less time limit). However, if the child is younger than age 13 then there are

incentives for the mother to “bank” her benefits. That is, we expect counter-cyclical participation

in TANF to be greater in families with young children compared to families with only

adolescents. Holding business-cycle conditions constant, we also expect labor supply to be

higher when the child is younger.

       This benefit-banking effect is tempered, however, in the presence of work requirements,

learning-by-doing, saving, and asset tests. First, with work requirements there are technically no
                                                                                                                       34


periods with nonemployment coupled with TANF benefits since work, or at least work-related

activities, are a prerequisite of benefit receipt. The exception is that in most states mothers are

exempt from work requirements when the child is young (usually age 1 and under), and this

creates countervailing incentives to deplete benefits when the child is young. Second, as the

benefit-banking model predicts greater work effort when young, this also means that there will

be future wage growth via learning-by-doing à la equation (8), and this wage growth could

render the family income ineligible when it comes time to apply. Third, if the mother saves then

we expect self-insurance to be greater when the child is young under benefit banking because

this is the period of highest labor supply, though this self insurance will be attenuated by the

consumption floor of TANF. Moreover, with asset tests, this self insurance may render the

family ineligible when the time comes to join the program. All told, we expect benefit banking

effects to be strongest in states with relatively lenient work requirements, income limits, and

asset limits. Because child-only cases are not subject to time limits, benefit banking should not

apply to these assistance units. 13

         Goal 3. To Prevent and Reduce Out-of Wedlock Pregnancies: Family Caps and Maternal

         Health

         The rise of out-of-wedlock childbearing came to national attention with the publication of

the Moynihan Report in 1965 (U.S. Department of Labor 1965). The report focused on the

challenges facing the black family, where it was noted with alarm that nearly one in four black

children were born out-of-wedlock in 1963. This trend continued over the next two decades,

rising to 60 percent by the early 1980s, and today stands at 71 percent (Child Trends 2014). At

the time of the Moynihan Report, only 4 percent of births to white mothers were out-of-wedlock.


13
   The other approach to avert the time limit is via the diversion program, if available in the state. Two-thirds of
states have formal diversion programs, and only 3 of those count the payment against the life time limit.
                                                                                                       35


This percentage increased dramatically by the early 1980s, and by 2013 was over 7 times the rate

five decades earlier with about 30 percent of births outside of marriage. The comparable rates in

2013 are 53 percent among Hispanics and 17 percent among Asians and Pacific Islanders.

          This significant change in child bearing led some commentators to lay blame squarely on

the doorstep of AFDC (Murray 1984). The critique of the program focused on the fact that since

eligibility was restricted to those families with children, and benefits were provided with

relatively few strings attached, it created a viable option for child birth outside of marriage.

                                                              𝜕𝑇𝐴𝑁𝐹𝑡
Indeed, the structure of the benefit formula is such that               < 0; that is, income from a spouse

(or noncustodial parent via child support) increased net income and thereby reduced the size of

the benefit, all else equal. At the same time, because need standards and thus potential benefits

more children.

          As shown in Figure 3, 6 percent of total TANF and MOE spending in 2012 was targeted

to programs that are aimed at reducing out-of-wedlock child birth. Some of these efforts are

“sticks” and some are “carrots.” The most obvious stick is the introduction of family caps.

Nearly 40 percent of states at some point under TANF have introduced family caps that limit or

restrict the size of the benefit increase when an additional child is born so that effectively

𝜕𝑇𝐴𝑁𝐹𝑡
          = 0. In the context of the asset accumulation constraint of equation (4), lifetime wealth

                      𝑡


partially offsetting the loss in assets, but typically well below a full offset. Many states also

imposed new behavioral rules that increase the effective cost of children, and therefore reduce
                                                                                                                    36


the demand. These rules include requiring that the children meet attendance quotas at school

and/or a minimum Grade Point Average, that the children receive all required immunizations,

and that the children meet health screening requirements.

         Most of the spending on efforts to reduce out-of-wedlock births are carrots, coming in the

form of home visiting programs, education programs, media campaigns, family planning,

abstinence education, and youth services (Green Book 2008). Within these categories, many can

be characterized as investments in mothers’ health. This is underscored further when considering

the 15 percent “other” spending category in Figure 3, which includes, among others, mental

health services, drug and alcohol addiction treatment, and domestic violence counseling and

prevention. Returning to the life cycle model in equations (3) and (4), which includes the stock

of health, assume that in each period the mother inherits a stock of health capital which

depreciates at rate 𝛿𝐻 . Health can be replenished by devoting leisure time (𝐿𝑡 ) to exercise,

purchasing medical services (𝑆𝑡 ), and receiving in-kind services from TANF. Health capital then

evolves according to

(10)     𝐻𝑡+1 = (1 − 𝛿𝐻 )𝐻𝑡 + 𝑦(𝑆𝑡 , 𝐿𝑡 , 𝑇𝐴𝑁𝐹𝑡 ),

where 𝑦(𝐿𝑡 , 𝑆𝑡 , 𝑇𝐴𝑁𝐹𝑡 ) is the health investment production function that is akin to the standard

Grossman (1972) model but modified to include the services received in TANF. 14 Equation (10)

makes explicit that participation in TANF can offer an additional channel to improve lifetime

well being beyond providing a consumption floor via health promotion. These health services

may interact positively with human capital, thereby increasing lifetime earning potential.

         Goal 4. To Encourage the Formation and Maintenance of Two-Parent Families: Child

         Support and Child Well Being

14
  The concept of leisure in this framework differs from leisure in the standard labor supply model, where leisure
represents nonmarket time. The Grossman (1972) model separates total time into time for work, time for health,
time for producing the household good, and time for sickness.
                                                                                                                 37


        In the original ADC program, benefits were confined to the child, and then the 1950

amendment to the Social Security Act allowed the mother to be part of the assistance unit as well

(technically the caretaking parent). This was then extended, at state option, to the second natural

parent with the advent of the AFDC-UP program in 1961. In the late 1960s there were several

Supreme Court decisions that implicitly extended eligibility to cohabiting couples. One decision

eliminated so-called man-in-the-house rules that disqualified otherwise eligible mothers from

receiving AFDC because of co-residence with a man who was not the natural father of the child,

while another decision ruled unconstitutional the inclusion of income from the cohabiting male

in benefit determination without proof that his income was used to support the mother and

children (Moffitt, et al. 1998). The Family Support Act of 1988 extended the 1961 Amendment

by no longer making the AFDC-UP optional and mandated all states implement it by 1990. Each

of these changes were designed to promote family unity, and this goal was codified as one of the

four pillars of TANF.

        The promotion of marriage (or at least cohabitation) and family stability is built on the

belief, backed up by evidence, that children (and adults) do better on average in two-parent

families than in single parent families—higher incomes and wealth, and lower poverty and

mortality (Waite 1995)—and ultimately from the policymakers perspective, lower transmission

of welfare across generations. 15 This is most readily captured in the framework of the Becker-

Tomes (1979) model of intergenerational mobility whereby during childhood the parent(s)

allocates income between their own consumption and investment in the human capital of the

child. The more income that is invested in the child the more economically mobile the child will

be in adulthood. In a simple regression context we get


15
 Whether marriage causes these positive outcomes or whether there is self-selection of better qualified parents into
marriage is still an active line of inquiry.
                                                                                                  38

            𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑
where 𝑙𝑛𝑇𝐴𝑁𝐹𝐴𝑑𝑢𝑙𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑑 is the natural log of TANF income that the child receives in adulthood,
      𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡
𝑙𝑛𝑇𝐴𝑁𝐹𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑑 is the natural log of TANF income that the parent receives while the child is

growing up, X is a vector of family and child control variables, and u is an error term. The

coefficient 𝛽 is the intergenerational correlation of TANF incomes—as 𝛽 → 0 the

intergenerational link of welfare is broken. Children growing up in two-parent families, all else

equal, receive proportionately more investment in terms of time and money in their human

capital, and thereby have greater odds of economic mobility in later life.

          In terms of the life cycle model of Equations (3) and (4), in any given period the mother

will choose to marry if and only if the value function while married exceeds that not married.

Whether or not she also combines marriage with TANF will be made with the knowledge that

the income and asset limits are the same whether she is married or not, and given that the

prospective spouse is expected to bring both income and assets into the family, this will make

eligibility for TANF less likely. Moreover, her spouse’s income, 𝑌(𝑀𝑡 ), will count against the

size of the benefit if they qualify. Under TANF, depending on state of residence, she may not

qualify for benefits if she is married (New Hampshire and North Dakota), or eligibility may be

confined to only those fathers with less than full-time attachment to work (Maine, Mississippi,

South Dakota, and Tennessee). These features either create disincentives to marry or to marry

“well.”

          In most states the resources used to meet this goal were directed toward responsible

fatherhood initiatives, which often are in the form of employment and training services for

noncustodial fathers (Green Book 2008). The idea here is that if that the father has steady

employment and earnings, there will be a greater chance of regular child support payments to
                                                                                                     39


assist the family, and that there will also be positive role model effects passed from father to

child (e.g. a lower 𝛽 in equation (11)). Under AFDC only $50 per month in child support was

disregarded from the benefit (known as the child-support pass through) and the remainder was

retained by the state and thus effectively taxed at 100 percent. This high tax rate created strong

disincentives both to paternity establishment and to formal child support, conditional on

paternity being established. This disincentive is exacerbated by the fact that recipients are

required to surrender their child support income to the state, and then states determine how much

to pass through. States adopt this policy in part because they are required to return a percentage

(based on the state’s FMAP) of this income to the federal government (Kassabian, et al. 2013).

After PRWORA, seven states retained the basic $50 pass through, seven others raised the pass

through to anywhere between $75 and $200 per month, and seven additional states no longer

explicitly count child support (100 percent pass through). The remainder adopted some other

policy, including not passing through any child support. In short, only a small number of states

made a concerted effort to align their TANF program with enhanced child support payments.

This cross-state variation offers an opportunity to test whether child well being is higher among

the TANF population in those states with more generous pass through policies.

       Arguably the most significant investment in child well being under TANF is the

expansion of child care subsidies. As documented in Figure 3, 12 percent of TANF funds were

directly spent on child care in 2012 (1 percent on cash subsidies; 11 percent in-kind), and an

additional 4 percent of TANF funds were transferred to the Child Care Development Fund. The

latter are less restrictive in terms of income eligibility and thus are more likely to assist children

in two-parent families than TANF child-care funds (though in both cases the subsidies are only

for children under age 13). Whether received directly as cash, or in-kind, child care assistance
                                                                                                   40


can be viewed as a wage subsidy, such that the net wage of the mother on TANF is 𝑤𝑡 (1 −

𝑏𝑟𝑟𝑡 + 𝑡𝑡𝑐 ), where 𝑡𝑡𝑐 is the effective hourly subsidy rate from child care. The child care subsidy

attenuates the disincentive to work from the benefit reduction rate, which should increase labor

force entry and hours of work provided that the substitution effect dominates the income effect.

The evidence from the child-care literature seems to confirm both of these predictions (e.g.

Berger and Black 1992; Blau and Currie 2006; Tekin 2007). Moreover, this literature shows that

children do better in model, center-based care than informal (home-based) care on a host of

cognitive and non-cognitive measures (Morris, et al. 2009; Blau and Currie 2006; Bernal and

Keane 2011). However, it was estimated that in FY2009 only 1 in 6 children eligible for CCDF

or TANF childcare received assistance (TANF Tenth Report to Congress 2013). This helps

explain why in calendar years 2012-2013, out-of-pocket child care costs ate up nearly 20 percent

of the median annual earnings of single mother families with children under age 5, and upwards

of one-third in states like Massachusetts (Ziliak 2014).

4.2    Review of Results

       Across the spectrum of programs in the social safety net, AFDC was historically the most

heavily researched. This stemmed in part because it was the primary means of cash assistance for

low-income families with young children from the 1960s through the 1980s, coupled with the

fact that it was one of the few programs that provided cross-state variation in key design

parameters such as the maximum benefit guarantee and effective benefit reduction rates that was

crucial for non-experimental evaluation. In the aftermath of welfare reform, research on the

program exploded as depicted in Figure 9. This research activity persisted for a full decade after

reform and has only tapered off in recent years. The figure only captures part of the story,

however, because it only covers peer-reviewed books and journal articles and omits the scores of
                                                                                                  41


unpublished working papers as well as technical reports written by evaluation firms, think tanks,

and government agencies (and undoubtedly published works overlooked by the author). The

growth in research was spurred on by the vast breadth of reforms, funding for demonstration

projects, the advent of new datasets such as the Three City Study and Fragile Families, annual

conferences such as Association of Public Policy and Management, National Association of

Welfare Research and Statistics, and the Welfare Research and Evaluation Conference, and the

democratization of research effort. The research during the AFDC era was heavily dominated by

economists, and while economists continued in this tradition after welfare reform, there was a

large influx of new research by demographers, development psychologists, political scientists,

sociologists, and social workers pulled in by opportunity to study outcomes beyond participation

decisions and labor supply such as child development, health, immigration, and the political

economy of program implementation.

                                          [Figure 9 here]

        In this section the primary focus is on TANF research not covered in Moffitt (2003),

though there will be some overlap of material as well as from the surveys of Grogger and Karoly

(2005) and Blank (2009). It is not possible to review all the papers identified in Figure 9; instead,

emphasis is on a subset of papers representative of the broad range of research topics spanning

participation and caseloads, labor supply and welfare-to-work, income and poverty, consumption

and saving, health, fertility and marriage, and child development.

       4.2.1   Participation and Caseloads

       The adoption of AFDC waivers that introduced time limits, work requirements, sanctions,

expanded earnings disregards, and asset limits in the early 1990s spawned a flurry of research

focused primarily on the decline in welfare participation between 1993 to 1996 as this was the
                                                                                                       42


key policy outcome of interest at the time (Council of Economic Advisers 1997; Figlio and

Ziliak 1999; Moffitt 1999; Bartik and Eberts 1999; Ziliak, et al. 2000; Blank 2001). Research on

participation prior to this had mostly emphasized the roles of demographic factors, along with

cross-state variation in maximum guarantees and effective tax rates, in predicting welfare use,

and relied on cross-sectional data (Barr and Hall 1981; Moffitt 1983; Robins 1986; Hoynes

1996). When a time dimension was incorporated, it was most often in the context of estimating

the determinants of welfare spells (Blank 1989; Fitzgerald 1991; Hoynes and MaCurdy 1994).

       Economy-vs-Policy Debate

       This new research took a more macro approach, utilizing administrative data on the

number of AFDC cases (or recipients) per capita in each state over time to estimate the relative

roles of the business cycle versus welfare waivers in accounting for the large decline in

participation. These nonexperimental studies took advantage of the differential timing and types

of welfare waivers implemented by states, along with state and regional differences in business

cycles as measured by unemployment rates and/or employment growth. There was agreement

that the strong macroeconomy in the mid 1990s was the most important factor behind the decline

in caseloads, but there were considerable discrepancies across studies in whether and to what

extent welfare waivers affected the decline.

       For example, the CEA (1997) and Blank (2001) attributed between a quarter and a third

of the decline to welfare waivers, while Ziliak, et al. (2000) attributed none. Ziliak, et al. found

that states with time limits and behavioral responsibility waivers experienced declines in

caseloads, while other states with work requirements and expanded disregards and asset limits

had increases, and in the aggregate they canceled out. The studies differed in several respects.

The CEA and Blank each used annual state panel data, while Ziliak, et al. used monthly state
                                                                                                   43


panels. Moreover, the former studies only admitted dynamics in the model via lags of the

business cycle (the CEA also had policy lead variables), while the latter study included lags in

both the business cycle and the dependent variable. In their reconciliation study, Figlio and

Ziliak (1999) attributed the majority of the difference to the inclusion of lagged caseloads, which

were found to be highly significant both economically and statistically and with the effect of

heightening the influence of the business cycle and attenuating the influence of policy. In most of

the caseload studies around 25 percent of the variation was left unexplained by the business

cycle and state welfare policy choices. The remainder was attributed to other policies such as the

expansion of the EITC that made work more attractive relative to welfare (Meyer and

Rosenbaum 2001) and enhanced child-support enforcement (Huang, et al. 2004).

       In the wake of these early studies several others followed up with a deeper examination

of caseload dynamics. Grogger, Klerman, and Haider (2003) used household-level data from the

SIPP to ask the question of whether the decline in the 1990s came via reduced entry and/or

increased exit. That is, at any given time the caseload is a function of the stock of caseloads from

the prior period along with the flows on and off between periods. They found that exits increased

during the 1990s, but nearly half the decline was driven by a reduction in entry. Hoynes (2000),

Klerman and Haider (2004) and Haider and Klerman (2005) used rich micro caseload data from

the state of California to examine caseload flows. Because the data come from a single state they

were not able to address the economy-vs-policy issue directly, and instead focused on the local

economy alone. Hoynes found that local labor demand conditions at the county level—lower

unemployment, higher employment per population, higher average wages—were a key driver of

exits off AFDC spells.
                                                                                                  44


       Klerman and Haider utilized the data to estimate Markov-chain models to pin down the

proper dynamic structure of the caseload. Their theoretical model predicted that static models

need to include many lags of regressors along with interactions among them to be consistent with

the Markov model, suggesting that the models of the CEA and Blank were insufficient in their

controls for dynamics. As for dynamic models, Klerman and Haider found that a single lag of the

dependent variable is also not sufficient, and these models must include long lags of explanatory

variables for the model to be consistent with duration dependence in welfare spells. For example,

Ziliak, et al. included three lags of the dependent variable, six lags of the economy, and four lags

of welfare waivers in their model, using the Schwarz criterion to select the lag structure.

Applying their results to California, Klerman and Haider found that local unemployment rates

explained about 50 percent of the decline in caseloads, about double the estimate they obtain

from a standard static model like the CEA. Haider and Klerman go further in finding that the

caseload decline in California was due more to declining entry rates than exits. Frogner, Moffitt,

and Ribar (2009) use longitudinal data from The Three City Study, which followed 2,400 low-

income women with children from 1999-2005 in Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio, and found

that exit rates from TANF were high, and that entry and re-entry rates were very low, consistent

with Haider and Klerman.

       Most of the participation research examining the economy versus policy debate focused

on the years leading up to passage of PRWORA. Grogger and Karoly (2005), in their survey of

the literature, concluded that of those studies examining the first few years after PRWORA,

TANF policies accounted for about 20 percent of the decline in caseloads, and that the

macroeconomy remained the main driver. There were a couple of exceptions using more recent

data. Fang and Keane (2004) used repeated cross-sections of the CPS from 1980-2002 to
                                                                                                    45


estimate a host of welfare reform policies interacted with several household demographic

characteristics on the decision to participate in AFDC/TANF. They found that policies mattered

much more than the economy for the 1993-2002 period, especially work requirements. However,

they only included static controls for the economy (state unemployment rate, average wage at the

20th percentile) and thus fall into the critiques of Ziliak, et al. (2000) and Klerman and Haider

(2004). Danielson and Klerman (2008) used monthly state caseload data from 1990-2005,

focusing on time limits, diversion, sanctions, and financial-incentive policies. While they do

include a lag structure for both the macroeconomy and welfare policies, they do not include lags

of the dependent variable. However, they do a more careful job of accounting for differential

reporting of separate state programs in construction of the dependent variable caseloads. They

found that from 2000-2005 welfare policies accounted for more of the caseload change than the

economy; however, over 80 percent of the variation is left unexplained by these two factors. This

was not the case in the first generation caseload research on the waiver period. Perhaps part of

the weakening of the models stems from the fact that take-up rates of cash benefits have

plummeted from 79 percent in the last year of AFDC to 36 percent in 2007 (Loprest 2012),

which itself is a likely policy outcome that is not adequately captured. Moreover, with the surge

in child-only cases, many on the rolls are not subject to the same macroeconomic and policy

forces as under the adult with child norm with AFDC.

       There are only two caseload studies that I am aware of that include years of the Great

Recession. Bitler and Hoynes (2010) use both monthly administrative data on state caseloads

from 1980-2009, as well as annual survey data from the Current Population Survey, to examine

the effect of the economy and welfare reform on AFDC/TANF (along with other outcomes).

Their estimates from static models suggest that TANF (assistance) caseloads are no more
                                                                                                    46


responsive to business-cycle conditions after welfare reform, though in some specifications the

caseload is less responsive to the economy. In a follow-up analysis, Bitler and Hoynes

(forthcoming) extend the data through 2012 where they confirm the lack of responsiveness of

TANF to the Great Recession, especially expenditures, and as a consequence extreme poverty is

more cyclical than in past recessions. They do not offer a decomposition analysis of economy-

vs-policy, which is perhaps the correct choice given the identification challenges of evaluating

TANF as a bundle (see below). However, it remains an open question as to whether the models

with the additional variation induced by the Great Recession can account for changes in TANF

more akin to the waiver studies, or whether the more pessimistic assessment of Danielson and

Klerman (2008) carries the day.

       The Bitler and Hoynes (2010, forthcoming) papers also shed light on a related, but

distinct, literature that examines fiscal-federalism incentives facing states in the provision of

social assistance (Gramlich and Laren 1984; Moffitt 1990; Chernick 1998; Chernick and

McGuire 1999; Powers 1999; Ribar and Wilhelm 1999; Brueckner 2000; McGuire and

Merriman 2006). Specifically, under the basic block grant of TANF, states are responsible for

the full marginal cost of additional spending once the grant is exhausted, whereas under the

matching-grant system of AFDC they only covered a fraction of additional spending as

determined by the FMAP. Thus, under TANF the “price” of welfare is higher, and all else equal,

we expect state spending on cash assistance to fall relative to AFDC. At the same time, states

that rely heavily on a progressive income tax to support spending tend to have more volatile

revenue streams, and in the event of a downturn, revenues fall creating an income effect that also

depresses spending on welfare just as the need for assistance accelerates. The price effect

suggests that there should be a (secular) decline in state spending on cash assistance after welfare
                                                                                                     47


reform, while the income effect suggests that states should be less willing to increase spending

during recessions under the block grant. Chernick (1998) predicted such effects, though the early

evidence in McGuire and Merriman (2006) was not conclusive. Part of this might be due to the

fact that states accumulated surpluses in the first half dozen years after welfare reform and could

carry these forward to future fiscal years, and part due to state MOE requirements. McGuire and

Merriman also argued that TANF has become an increasingly smaller share of state spending and

thus is less elastic as a consequence. However, with an additional decade of data the evidence in

Bitler and Hoynes is quite persuasive that both price and income effects have lead to a reduced

responsiveness of TANF to economic need compared to AFDC. That said, the financing models

focus on state spending, and since Bitler and Hoynes did not direct their attention to this

literature, they did not separate out state-only spending from spending commingled with federal

dollars, and thus future work should separate these funding streams to more accurately examine

the model predictions from block grants.

       Specific Policy Studies

       One of the challenges facing evaluation of TANF as a complete package is that the policy

was implemented across all states within roughly 18-months. This is distinct from the waiver

period when policies were implemented over a four-year period, with some states not adopting

waivers at all, and thus offering more variation to separate the effect of the economy versus

policy on participation (Bitler, et al. 2003). While most of the first-generation papers estimated

disaggregated policy effects—sanctions, time limits, work requirements, incentives—and some

included interactions between the economy and policy (e.g. Bartik and Eberts 1999; Ziliak, et al.

2000) or the economy and demographics (Moffitt 1999), this was crucial for identification in the

TANF era. That is, it became necessary to either utilize qualitative differences in the stringency
                                                                                                     48


of program rules or to exploit variation over the business cycle or demographic groups to

identify policy effects post PRWORA. This in turn makes it more challenging to aggregate up to

a total “welfare reform effect,” leading some to instead focus on the contributions of individual

policies on the decline via counterfactual simulations (Fang and Keane 2004; Danielson and

Klerman 2008).

       The most prominent of these policy-centric papers are on time limits. For example,

Grogger (2003, 2004) implemented a reduced-form version of the dynamic model proposed by

Grogger and Michalopoulos (2003) using data from the CPS from 1979 to 2000. He exploited

the prediction of the federal five-year lifetime limit that single mothers with only older children

(age 13 and older) should exhaust their benefits more rapidly than mothers with younger children

since the latter have an incentive to “bank” their benefits in case of a (more) rainy day in the

future. He implements this by interacting the time limit variable with a variable that equals 0 if

the youngest child is age 13 or older and equals the deviation of the age of the youngest child

from 13 if the child is under age 13. Grogger finds no overall effect of time limits on welfare use,

but significant effects on the age-dependent interaction term such that a mother whose youngest

child is 10 years old reduced participation by 2 percentage points. His estimates suggest that time

limits accounted for about one-eighth of the decline in welfare participation between 1993 and

1999. Mazzolari (2007) extended the Grogger model to account for the fact that his specification

is valid only at the point of implementation, but as time passes one also must control for the

stock of remaining benefits (see equation (9) above). She also attempted to disentangle

behavioral from mechanical effects of the limits (Ashenfelter 1983), the latter of which can arise

from state variation in exemptions from the limits. Using data from the 1990 through 2001

panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), she estimated that from 1996-
                                                                                                     49


2003 time limits reduced welfare use by 25 percent, 5 percentage points of which (i.e. 20 percent

of the total) was from behavioral effects. This is perhaps not surprising in that Loprest (2012)

reports that only 2 percent of cases were closed in FY2009 for reaching the time limit.

       The forward-looking aspects of time limits have also led to a few attempts at estimating

structural models of life cycle behavior (Keane and Wolpin 2002b, 2010; Swann 2005; Fang and

Silverman 2009; Chan 2013). These papers are distinct from the others in the literature because

the welfare decision is made jointly with labor supply decisions, and perhaps marriage and

fertility choices. As such they will be mentioned in later sections under those respective topics.

All the papers use exclusively pre-welfare reform data (Panel Study of Income Dynamics from

1968-1992 for Swann; National Longitudinal Survey of Youth from1979-1991 for Keane and

Wolpin and Fang and Silverman) except for Chan, who uses data both pre- and post-welfare

reform (SIPP panels for 1992, 1993, and 1996). However, by formally modeling the structural

preferences and budget constraints facing the women they are able to conduct detailed

counterfactual simulations of how behavior likely changed under TANF. For example, Swann

(2005) estimated that a five-year time limits leads to a 9 percent reduction in the caseload, but a

60 percent reduction in the number of person-years on welfare, one-third of which is a behavioral

response from forward-looking behavior. Although Chan (2013) estimated a smaller 37 percent

reduction in person-years within ten years of implementation, he also attributed at least a third of

this effect is behavioral response. Thus, incorporating forward-looking behavior has the effect of

increasing the importance of time limits on the welfare decisions of mothers.

       Beyond time limits, sanctioning policy took renewed prominence in the research

literature. For example, Wu, et al. (2006) used administrative longitudinal caseload data

spanning 1997-2003 from the state of Wisconsin to examine the extent and consequences of
                                                                                                    50


sanctioning policy. They found that nearly two-thirds of women on welfare faced a

noncompliance for work requirement sanction over a 4-year period, but because most of the

sanctions were short-term and partial, the most common transition for this group was back to

welfare within a month or two after a sanction. They also found that Hispanics and African-

Americans were more likely to be sanctioned than whites. This racial gap in sanctioning was also

found in Schram, et al. (2009), who used a hypothetical “audit study” of case managers in

Florida. Their audit study is unique in this literature, and involved a Web-based survey of Florida

Welfare Transition case managers whereby the managers were presented with various rule-

violation scenarios and randomly assigned client characteristics. The authors found that African-

American mothers, more so than Latinas, were likely to face sanctions compared to white

mothers. This result was corroborated in actual administrative data outcomes in Fording, et al.

(2007), especially for longer spells on welfare where black clients faced sanction rates of 22 to

35 percent higher in month 9 of a spell compared to white clients.

       PRWORA limited access to assistance for legal immigrants arriving after passage of the

law until after five years of residence, and left it to state discretion on whether current legal

immigrants would be eligible (illegal immigrants have always been denied benefits). This

provision stemmed from a concern that the large increase in low-skilled immigration in the

1980s and early 1990s might be in response to generous welfare benefits (Haskins 2009). Such

concerns with welfare migration have a long history with welfare, starting at least with the Law

of Settlement and Removal of 1662 whereby local officials in England could force individuals

and families to return to their home parishes if they became dependent prior to proof that they

contributed to the well being of the community (Hansan 2011). The evidence on whether there is

such endogenous immigration or internal migration in response to welfare generosity in the U.S.
                                                                                                   51


is mixed (Borjas 1999; Gelbach 2004; Kaushal 2005; McKinnish 2007; Kennan and Walker

2010).

         Several studies examined trends in welfare participation among immigrants before and

after passage of PRWORA, including testing whether there was a “chilling effect” on

participation among immigrants, i.e. a voluntary withdrawal from the program even though

eligible owing to misinformation or perhaps fear (Fix and Passel 1999; Lofstrom and Bean 2002;

Haider, et al. 2004; Kaestner and Kaushal 2005; Capps, Fix, and Henderson 2009). While most

of the studies examining the early years after reform found evidence that immigrants reduced

participation more than native-born after welfare reform, this may be due more to differential

response of immigrants to the strong labor market of the late 1990s (Lofstrom and Bean 2002;

Haider, et al. 2004). However, in a recent paper, Bitler and Hoynes (2013) compared immigrant

and native-born participation rates in TANF in 2008-2009 to AFDC rates for comparable groups

in 1994-1995, and while the difference-in-difference estimates suggest lower participation rates

of 2-3 percent among immigrants than natives, the differences are not significant.

         Because there are so many possible policy variables that capture different aspects of

welfare reform, attempts to include them all, or even a sizable subset, has been met with little

success owing to collinearity problems. As a consequence, some have attempted to summarize

the policies in a more parsimonious manner, such as the aggressiveness of the reforms ranging

from ‘lenient’ to ‘severe’ (Ellwood 1999; Meyer and Rosenbaum 2001; Soss, et al. 2001;

Grogger and Karoly 2005; McKernan, et al. 2005; De Jong, et al. 2006). Ellwood (1999)

proposed a measure of aggressiveness that captured the changing odds that people of a given

earnings level in a given state would receive public assistance. To construct the measure he used

data from the Current Population Survey over the period 1984–1992 to estimate a probit model
                                                                                                      52


of AFDC participation among single parents in each state as a function of age, education, race,

state unemployment, earnings, and a linear trend. Then he predicted the likelihood of receiving

aid using the same demographic and state level variable but with data from the 1997 and 1998

CPS under the proviso that AFDC program rules were the same as in the base period of 1984–

1992. The difference between the actual and predicted decline in AFDC participation between

1991–1992 and 1997–1998 is used as the metric of aggressiveness.

       Meyer and Rosenbaum’s (2001) approach consists of whether (1) the real AFDC benefit

fell at least 25% between 1986 and 1997; (2) whether the state imposed a time limit waiver; (3)

whether the state imposed full family sanctions for failure to comply with JOBS requirements;

and (4) whether any persons were terminated for failure to meet a requirement under AFDC

waivers. States that satisfied at least three of the four criteria were defined as most aggressive.

Grogger and Karoly (2005) considered several alternative metrics of aggressiveness, including

where (1) a state is deemed aggressive if it had one or more waivers implemented between 1992

and 1996 (Table 4.1), (2) a state is deemed aggressive if it had three or more waivers

implemented between 1992 and 1996 (Table 4.1), or (3) a state is deemed aggressive if all four

studies on state sanctions policies summarized in the Table 4.2 agree that the state’s (full family

benefit) sanction policy is stringent during the 1992 to 1996 period. De Jong, et al. (2006) coded

78 policies from the Welfare Rules Database from lenient to stringent, and then applied factor

analysis that identified 15 leading policies. In a bid for greater parsimony they conducted a

second-order factor analysis that resulted in three broad categories of policies: eligibility

requirements, behavioral responsibilities, and eligibility limits and exemptions.

       There have only been limited attempts to use these indices to predict welfare caseloads.

The Council of Economic Advisors (1999) updated their earlier study to include two years post-
                                                                                                            53


TANF and found that states with more stringent job sanctioning policies had larger declines in

caseloads than those employing more lenient policies. Schmidt and Sevak (2004) used data from

the CPS for calendar years 1987-1996 and found that states that implemented more aggressive

reforms saw a 21 percent increase in participation in Supplemental Security Income (SSI),

suggesting that states partially shifted burden from their budgets to the federal budget. Cadena, et

al. (2006) used data from the CPS for the years 1994 to 2003 to construct three-year moving

averages of TANF participation among single mothers with at least one dependent child and with

no more than high school for each state. They then estimated the effects of the De Jong, et al.

indices on participation, finding that they have no predictive power once one controls for state

fixed effects. They present some suggestive evidence that the lack of power in the De Jong, et al.

measure might be due to its omission of the AFDC/TANF maximum benefit guarantee, which

has historically been a key proxy of state generosity.

        4.2.2    Labor Supply and Welfare-to-Work

        Concomitant with the surge of research on participation in TANF was research on

employment. This follows hand-in-hand with the second goal of TANF to end dependence and

promote work. While several studies were national in focus, much of this research was fueled by

area studies on welfare leavers or eligibles from demonstration projects, focused surveys, and

administrative data. The demonstration projects, several of which were conducted during the

welfare waiver era, included the California Greater Avenues for Independence (GAIN), Florida’s

Family Transition Program (FTP), Connecticut’s Jobs First, Minnesota’s Family Investment Plan

(MFIP), Milwaukee’s New Hope program, and Wisconsin’s Child Support Demonstration

Evaluation (CSDE). 16 The most prominent focused surveys were fielded after welfare reform,


16
  Canada’s Self-Sufficiency Project (SSP) was conducted at the same time. SSP was a randomized control trial
conducted in New Brunswick and British Columbia that provided earnings supplements (akin to the U.S. EITC) for
                                                                                                                  54


including the Three-City Study, the Fragile Families and Child Well Being Survey, and the

Women’s Employment Study (WES). And in a relatively new turn of events, several states such

as California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North and

South Carolina, Tennessee, Washington, and Wisconsin opened up their administrative records

to academics and evaluation firms to evaluate how former welfare recipients were faring in the

labor market. In this section I first discuss observational studies, both reduced-form and

structural, followed by leavers studies and demonstrations. Both of these research strands follow

rich histories on AFDC starting in the 1960s as national household surveys such as the CPS, the

NLS, and PSID were coming on line at the same time as the negative income tax experiments

were fielded in Gary, Indiana, New Jersey, and Seattle and Denver (SIME/DIME).

         Employment

         In the wake of welfare reform, most of the new observational studies on employment

with a national focus were reduced form, and they relied heavily on the pre-TANF period for

identification. Instead of emphasizing the effects of maximum benefit guarantees and benefit

reduction rates as was typical with the earlier AFDC research, these studies examined the overall

effect of welfare waivers (or TANF) on the extensive and intensive margins of employment.

Moffitt (1999) used CPS data from 1977-1995 and found that only less-skilled mothers (i.e.

those with a high school diploma or less) responded to welfare waivers. Mothers who dropped

out of high school increased work by 68 hours annually, while those with a diploma increased

annual hours by 41 hours. Schoeni and Blank (2000) extended the CPS data four more years

through 1999, and found that waivers increased employment rates high school dropout mothers

by 2 percentage points on a baseline rate of 53 percent, the number of weeks worked increased

up to three years to long-term welfare recipients if they found full-time work and left welfare within one year of
random assignment. 36 percent of the treatment group found full-time work, and had an employment rate that was
61 percent higher than the control group at the three-year follow up. See Michalopoulos, et al. (2002) for details.
                                                                                                   55


by one week, and weekly hours increased by one (the mean hours per week were 16). They

found no labor supply response among the less skilled in the three years after TANF was passed.

       Grogger (2003) used the same CPS data and a slightly modified model as he also

included the time limit and time limit interacted with the age of the youngest child, along with

the overall reform variable and controls for the EITC. He found that employment rates overall

increased by 2.6 percentage points by non-time-limit welfare reforms, and the time limit boosted

the employment rate of mothers with children by 0.34 percentage points for each year the child

was under age 13. And while time limits did not boost annual weeks worked, the non-time-limit

reforms did by about 2.6 weeks. Kaushal and Kaestner (2001) use just four years of CPS data

spanning 1995-1999 and employ a difference-in-differences estimator. They found that

employment rates of less-skilled unmarried mothers increased about 7 percentage points in

response to time limits, or about 14 percent over the baseline. This larger effect from time limits

compared to Grogger may result both from a different specification of time limits (Kaushal and

Kaestner only use a dummy variable, not a direct function of age of child as in Grogger) and

their use of a comparison group of married women, which may impart bias if there are

endogenous marriage responses to welfare reform. Fang and Keane (2004) attribute more of the

growth in employment between 1993 and 2002 to the EITC and macroeconomy than welfare

reform, but still a sizable 27 percent to the combined effects of work requirements (17 percent)

and time limits (10 percent).

       Meyer and Rosenbaum (2001) employ a quasi-structural approach to estimating

employment rates, again using CPS data but for years 1984-1996. Their approach is considered

“quasi-structural” because they model the employment decision as a function of the difference

between expected income from work and from nonwork, where income is specified as a detailed
                                                                                                   56


function of the parameters governing the tax and transfer system and thus affecting the woman’s

budget constraint. They also use a difference-in-differences estimator, but in this case use single,

childless women as the main comparison group, again under the assumption that fertility

decisions are unrelated to welfare. While they found that expansions of the EITC accounted for

over 60 percent of the growth in employment over their sample period, they also found that

welfare waivers accounted for about 15 percent, and even more if the counterfactual period is

restricted to 1992-1996. This larger effect is consistent with Kaushal and Kaestner, and perhaps

reflects the use of a comparison group. Indeed the effect of any termination waiver on the

employment decision is about 25 percent lower when they exclude a comparison group (compare

their Table IV, column(5) to Table V, column (6)).

       As discussed in the last section, the introduction of time limits spurred on the estimation

of structural models of labor supply to capture the joint decisions of welfare and work when

mothers are forward looking. Although these studies, with the exception of Chan (2013),

restricted estimation to the pre-welfare waiver era, and thus do not incorporate key elements of

reform in the budget constraint, they simulated how employment was expected to change under

stylized scenarios resembling welfare reform. For example, Swann (2005) conducted

counterfactual simulations of cutting the effective benefit reduction via earnings disregards,

introducing a five-year lifetime limit on benefits and a two-year work-requirement time limit,

and the latter two combined. He found that a 10 percent reduction in the benefit reduction rate

had little effect on employment choices, consistent with the AFDC literature, but the introduction

of a five-year time limit lead to a 67 percent reduction in the probability of being on welfare with

no work, and a 46 percent reduction of combining welfare and work. Interestingly, though, the

group with the largest increase was single mothers neither working nor on welfare. This estimate
                                                                                                   57


is consistent with the rise of so-called disconnected women (Blank and Kovak 2009). However,

when he combined the benefit time limit with the work requirement time limit his model

predicted that the most common “state” for the mother is to be single, working, and not on

welfare. Keane and Wolpin (2010), in their simulations, found that a five-year benefit time limit

likewise had a smaller effect on the probability of working than a 25-hour per week work

requirement after six months, but they also found that most of these women remained eligible for

welfare because the higher earnings did not offset the lower welfare, a result found in earlier

work by Moffitt (1983) and Hoynes (1996).

       Chan (2013) extended the prior two structural papers by explicitly modeling the rules

affecting AFDC and TANF, including work requirements and time limits, along with food stamp

rules, federal and state taxes (inclusive of the EITC), and the payroll tax. Like Meyer and

Rosenbaum (2001) before him, he used repeated cross sections over time (from the SIPP, not

CPS), and thus allowed the welfare and tax parameters to change across states over time,

assisting in the identification of model parameters beyond cross-state variation alone. His model

is quite complicated, allowing for multiple program participation, with and without work, state

dependence in those program/work decisions, a distribution of job offer arrival probabilities, and

a version of learning-by-doing such that lagged work status (not the stock of experience as in

Keane and Wolpin (2010)) affected the wage and job-offer arrival. Interestingly, his model

predicted that the employment response to job offers was ten-times larger than the elasticity of

employment with respect to the wage, and likewise, program participation responses were much

larger for job offers than actual wages. This suggests demand-side conditions matter greatly for

the welfare and work decisions of mothers, a result that Hoynes (2000) found in her analysis of

welfare spells in California. When he used the structural estimates to decompose changes in
                                                                                                  58


welfare and employment from 1992-1999, he found that the macroeconomy was the most

important reason for the increase in employment, accounting for nearly half, and that the time

limit accounted for about 6 percent of the increase, followed by the EITC, and then work

requirements. His estimates yielded a larger “total” effect of welfare policy on employment

compared to the modal estimate surveyed in Grogger and Karoly (2005) with the exception of

Fang and Keane (2004). The latter study’s large estimate of work requirements likely stemmed

from their parsimonious specification of the macroeconomy.

       Welfare-to-Work

       The “Riverside Miracle” framed much of the debate surrounding welfare reform, and

how to transition mothers from welfare to work. In 1988 the evaluation firm MDRC was

contracted to conduct a randomized control trial of the effectiveness of the California GAIN

program in six counties (Riccio and Friedlander 1992; Riccio, et al. 1994). The GAIN program

was the official JOBS program for the state, and depending on how the participant scored on a

basic reading and math test, they were assigned either to programs emphasizing additional

human-capital development (HCD) if the score was below a threshold or to programs

emphasizing “work first” such as job search assistance. Counties were given great leeway to

design programs that suited their needs, and as such, Riverside tended to emphasize work first,

while Alameda, Los Angeles, and San Diego counties emphasized HCD. Three years after

random assignment, treatment group members in Riverside experienced 63 percent more quarters

of employment and a comparable gain in earnings compared to control-group members. This

treatment effect was three times larger than that found in the counties focused on HCD. The

miracle of Riverside served as a platform for many states (and countries) as they designed their
                                                                                                  59


TANF programs. Indeed the tension of work-first versus HCD is found in Goal (ii) of TANF

where the aim is to end dependence by promoting at once “job preparation” and “work.”

       Hotz, Imbens, and Klerman (2006) noted that the treatment effects across these sites

could differ because of differences in populations served, how treatment was assigned, and in

local economic conditions. They proposed a new method of how to evaluate differential effects

of alternative treatments such as HCD and work first. Using these methods they then re-

examined the results of GAIN by focusing on impacts nine years after random assignment,

which should be a sufficiently long period for HCD to have an effect. They found that much of

the “Riverside Miracle” was not due to the work-first strategies of the GAIN program in the

county, rather it seemed to be an anomalous result of a very strong local economy three to five

years post assignment. Moreover, by six years after assignment the longer-run gains in

employment were more pronounced for those treated with an HCD approach than work-first,

suggesting that HCD programs may impart long-term benefits for mothers leaving welfare.

       Dyke, et al. (2006) applied some of these ideas to administrative data in Missouri and

North Carolina to examine the effects of assessment, job search and readiness training, and

intensive training on employment outcomes for up to 16 months after entry into TANF. Those

individuals receiving intensive training gained skills more akin to HCD than the more work-first

oriented assessment and job search training. They employed both matching estimators, as well as

difference-in-differences with matching as recommended by Smith and Todd (2005) to sweep

out individual fixed effects, and found that work-first strategies fade out over time while HCD

programs increase in effectiveness on labor-market outcomes.

       Mueser, et al. (2009) followed up on this work, but instead relied on administrative data

from the states of Missouri and Maryland. They examined the demographic composition,
                                                                                                    60


employment, and welfare recidivism of three cohorts of welfare leavers—leavers in FY1993,

FY1997, and FY2002. Using the three separate cohorts permitted the authors to compare welfare

recipients before welfare reform, during its implementation, and six years later, which is an

advantage over prior work such as Cancian, et al. (2002) who followed a single cohort of leavers

in Wisconsin at the time of TANF implementation. The data from Missouri and Maryland are not

nationally representative, but the trends were strikingly similar to national trends in welfare,

employment, and economic growth. Mueser, et al. found little change in the demographic

composition of the caseload across cohorts, but employment rose and persisted even into the

2001 recession not only among leavers but also current recipients and new entrants, the latter of

which was consistent with work requirements and perhaps states adopting a more work-first

strategy. That the demographic composition at a point in time was little changed is not

incongruent with the results from the Three-City Study by Frogner, et al. (2009). They found that

from 1999-2005 the group of mothers who stayed on TANF became much more select—they

worked less, had lower rates of marriage, and reported worse health and higher rates of disability

than other mothers. Moffitt and Stevens (2001) found similar results in an earlier analysis of CPS

data. This suggests that stayers face particular disadvantages well beyond the typical recipient.

       Indeed, Danziger, et al. (2000) brought the issue of barriers to employment for welfare

leavers to the fore after reform in their analysis of data from WES, which is a longitudinal survey

of 753 women on welfare in an urban county in Michigan that was collected in five waves from

1997-2003. They reported that women unable to transition quickly in a work-first environment

generally faced multiple barriers including physical and mental health problems, victimization

from domestic violence, and lack of access to (any) reliable transportation. Of the 14 barriers that

they assessed, 37 percent of mothers had 2-3 barriers, and 24 percent had 4-6 barriers. Their
                                                                                                     61


regression estimates suggested that a mother in the latter category had a 20 percentage point

lower odds of working at least 20 hours per week than a mother in the former category of 2-3

barriers.

        Bloom, et al. (2011) reported on a series of random assignment demonstration

evaluations of programs adopted in various states over the past decade designed to address some

of these barriers to employment. The programs reflected a mix of approaches to address the

barriers, with some emphasizing a “learning-by-doing” philosophy where work experience is the

key to overcome barriers, and others emphasizing assessment, training, and counseling in a more

HCD approach. They concluded that the evidence across the 10 programs reviewed was mixed,

some positive short-run impacts on employment, but not so positive or unknown impacts in the

longer term. In fact the work-first models tended to exhibit poor employment results over time,

and while the HCD models emphasizing treatment suggested that service use increased, the

corresponding employment effects are not known. One potentially promising model was

implemented in rural Nebraska (“Building Nebraska Families”) that involved home visits every

week or two by a highly trained professional with a Masters degree. The overall employment

effect was zero, but it was positive for the hardest-to-serve facing multiple barriers, suggesting

the need for future evaluation of more intensive and targeted strategies on the most

disadvantaged.

        4.2.3    Earnings and Income

        Does work “pay” for former welfare recipients? This was an oft-raised question in the

aftermath of welfare reform. The record of earnings gains of welfare leavers under the former

AFDC program was not encouraging. However, the 1996 reform was being implemented in one

of the strongest periods of economic growth in the post-WWII era, and there were
                                                                                                   62


complementary reforms that occurred simultaneously; notably, the expansion of the EITC in

1993-1996 and the introduction of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in

1997 that provided insurance to children in families whose income is low but too high to qualify

for Medicaid. It was hoped that the strong economy and other policy reforms, combined with the

pull of liberalized earnings disregards and asset limits as well as the push of work requirements

and time limits, would lead to earnings and income gains of single mothers, both those on the

program and at risk.

       The initial results of the welfare-reform bundle on earnings and income were not

especially promising. In a descriptive study, Primus, et al. (1999) examined changes in the

earnings and disposable income (inclusive of EITC, food stamps and housing assistance, less

federal and state tax payments) of female-headed households from 1993 to 1995 and again from

1995 to 1997 from the March CPS. They found that among families in the bottom 20 percent of

the single-mother family disposable-income distribution, earnings increased by one-third and

disposable income by 14 percent during welfare waiver/pre-TANF era, but then disposable

income fell an average of $580, or 7 percent, after passage of PRWORA. Of the decline, 20

percent was lower earnings and 80 percent was lower means-tested transfers. Among those

mothers in the second quintile of the income distribution, their earnings continued to rise from

1995-1997, but total disposable income was unchanged due to the clawback of transfers.

       The Primus, et al. study did not control for any confounding factors, but both Moffitt

(1999) and Schoeni and Blank (2000) did control for other factors such as the state business

cycle, demographics, and welfare reform. Moffitt (1999) found that in the pre-PRWORA period

(1977–1995) the state-specific welfare waivers led to an average increase in annual earnings of

$274, or about 2-3 percent above the mean, but all of this gain was among mothers with a high
                                                                                                    63


school diploma or more. He found no effect on family income. Schoeni and Blank (2000), who

used CPS data through 1998, found a significant welfare-reform induced increase in own and

family earnings for women with less than high school in the waiver period; however, there was

no additional increase after the passage of PRWORA. They did find evidence that welfare

reform both in the waiver period and the TANF period reduced the incidence of poverty for the

subpopulation of less-skilled women. It is not clear whether the difference between the Moffitt

and Schoeni and Blank studies comes from the extra three years in the latter study, or the fact

that they exclude those with zero earnings and incomes and use logarithms instead of levels.

While Grogger (2003) finds no specific effect of time limits, or age-adjusted limits, on earnings

and income, he did find a modest overall reform effect on both, especially if he drops 0s and uses

logs of the dependent variable.

       Several early studies highlighted the importance of heterogeneity of welfare reform

effects, whether by place in the income distribution or education attainment. These ideas were

formalized in a few recent papers, most prominently in Bitler, et al. (2006a). They used data

from MDRC’s random assignment evaluation of Connecticut’s Jobs First program, which was

implemented between January 1996 and February 1997 and in the field until the end of 2000.

Jobs First features a 21-month benefit time limit—the shortest in the nation (see Table 4)—along

with one of the most generous earnings disregards policies (see Table 6). In the static model of

labor supply Jobs First generates heterogeneous predictions across the distribution, ranging from

no effect at the bottom, to positive effects in the middle, to possibly negative effects at the top of

the distribution resulting from behavioral-induced reductions in labor supply. They test these

predictions using an inverse probability weighted quantile treatment effects estimator, where the
                                                                                                                    64


weights are based on propensity score model of the probability of assignment to Jobs First. 17

Bitler, et al. (2006a) find results on earnings consistent with theory, and when they apply the

estimator to total income, they find significantly negative effects at the 20th-40th quantiles, and

positive effects between the median and 75th quantile. 18 Bollinger, et al. (2009) generalized the

Bitler, et al. estimates in their study of single-mother families in the March CPS from 1979-2004.

They estimated the effects of welfare reform, the business cycle, and interactions of the two, as

well as with education attainment of the mother, for various quantiles of both the earnings and

disposable income distributions. They found that TANF raised disposable incomes an average of

eight percent among higher skilled mothers, and raised earnings among low skilled mothers in

the lower half of the distribution by as much as 20 percent, but also resulted in a significant

equal-sized loss of after-tax total income among the low-skilled. The earnings gains among the

low skilled a decade after the implementation of TANF have been more than offset by losses in

transfer income.

         Leaver Studies

         Adding to the mixed signals of the effects of reform on earnings and income are the

findings from leaver studies. Cancian, et al. (2002) used two cohorts of leavers in the state of

Wisconsin, one from AFDC in 1995 and a second from TANF in 1997, and examined the

mother’s own earnings and incomes as well as family-level outcomes. Although they found that

earnings were substantially higher in the quarter one year after exit compared to the quarter prior




17
   Even though assignment to Jobs First was random, Bitler, et al. (2006) used weights because of some evidence of
pre-treatment differences in earnings and welfare income across treatment and control groups.
18
   Lamarche and Hartley (2014) test the robustness of Bitler, et al. by admitting person-specific latent heterogeneity
and re-estimating with a panel-quantile estimator. They confirm the results, except at the top of the distribution of
earnings where they do not find evidence of fade out, perhaps suggesting that latent preferences for work (or stigma
of welfare) induces these women to not pull back effort in the presence of Job First.
                                                                                                 65


to leaving, these earnings gains were wiped out by losses in other income so that total income

(both own and family) was lower and poverty rates higher.

       This is contrasted with the results in Danziger, et al. (2002), who used data from WES

and thus followed a single cohort of leavers in a Michigan county from 1997-1999. They found a

substantial 63 percent increase in net income for “wage reliant” mothers who were working and

not on welfare compared to “welfare reliant” mothers who stayed on welfare and were not

working, though even among the former nearly half remained in poverty. Moffitt and Widner

(2005) used the first two waves of the Three City Study (1999 and 2001) to look at the same

issues, but found a much smaller gain (14 percent) among working leavers. They argued that this

was due to lower receipts of “other family income” among their sample participants compared to

those in WES. This was also true among disconnected leavers (not in work or on welfare), but

again this group is better off in the WES. Moreover, mothers who combined welfare and work

were no worse off than those strictly wage reliant, again contrary to Danziger, et al. In response,

Danziger and Wang (2005) wrote a rejoinder and found that their earlier results from WES were

largely robust, though smaller in magnitude, if the contributions of other members were

excluded. While likely not the last word on the issue, Frogner, et al. (2009) added the 2005 wave

of the Three City analyses of Moffitt and Widner and concluded that (p. 169):

       “On the critical issue of whether "work pays," which we define as having occurred when
       the increase in a leaver's own earnings after leaving welfare exceed the loss of benefits,
       we find that it does so for employed leavers. However, it does not do so overall; when
       leavers as a whole are considered, employed and nonemployed combined, increases in
       average own-earnings are completely offset by declines in TANF and Food Stamp
       benefits. Incomes for leavers rise, on average, but this is because of increases in other
       household members' earnings and increases in disability payments. But, on average,
       going off welfare does not result in sufficient work to compensate for the loss of
       benefits.”
                                                                                                   66


Where there is evidence that work pays for low skilled women, it comes from demonstrations

that involved intensive training of both clients and case managers, assistance finding full-time

work, and generous wage supplements such as in MFIP, New Hope, and SSP (Knox, et al. 2000;

Michalopoulos, et al. 2002; Duncan, et al. 2008, 2009).

       Anti-Poverty Effects

       Taken together, the results from leaver studies, demonstrations, and from national

samples suggest that many women were worse off financially after welfare reform, especially at

the bottom of the distribution. But this result becomes clear only if data post-2000 are brought to

bear. Recall that Schoeni and Blank (2000) found that both waivers and TANF resulted in lower

family poverty in CPS data through 1998. The latter result was corroborated in Gundersen and

Ziliak (2004), who used CPS data from 1980-1999 and found that the depth and severity of after-

tax and (in-kind) transfer poverty among female-headed families was lower after welfare reform.

Mills, et al. (2001) used semi-parametric density estimators to compare the 1993 income

distribution of single mothers in the CPS to the 1999 income distribution, finding that single

moms were better off across the distribution in 1999 (though this is mostly due to the economy).

       When post-2000 data are brought into the analysis, the longer-term effects of welfare

reform are less encouraging, especially at the low-end of the distribution. This is seen

descriptively in the fact that (i) TANF fills a smaller share of the so-called poverty gap—the

distance between a family’s income and their family-size adjusted poverty line—as demonstrated

in Ziliak (2008) and Moffitt and Scholz (2010); (ii) there was an increase of over one-third

between 2000 and 2005 in the fraction of single mothers disconnected from work and welfare

(Blank and Kovak 2009); (iii) there was a 50 percentage point reduction from 1996 to 2011 in

the number of households with children lifted out of extreme poverty of $2 per day by TANF
                                                                                                   67


(Shaefer and Edin 2013); and (iv) the evidence of a tempered response by TANF to changing

business-cycle conditions (Bitler and Hoynes 2010; forthcoming). This dire set of facts is cause

for concern, and also is cause for renewed research to identify the extent to which these

relationships are causal. Such work must also confront the challenge of measurement; namely,

that reporting rates of TANF have declined over time, especially in the CPS, and the fact that

since 70 percent of TANF is non-assistance, we do not as yet have an understanding of whether

survey respondents include an estimate of the cash-equivalent of some of this in-kind support.

       4.2.4    Consumption, Saving, and Material Well Being

       Compared to the voluminous literature on the effects of welfare reform on participation,

work, and earnings, research on the consumption, saving, and material well being of welfare

families is limited. As discussed in the theory section, the presence of a consumption floor and

asset tests reduces the incentive to save and thus can lead to “over consumption.” Hubbard, et al.

(1995) suggested that this was important within their calibrated dynamic programming model,

but as yet these ideas have not been taken directly to the data in the context of estimating an

intertemporal consumption function. There was one notable paper that showed that the AFDC

program functioned well as a buffer against consumption losses (Gruber 2000), and a couple of

others on the transfer system overall as a partial consumption insurance mechanism (Kniesner

and Ziliak 2002; Blundell, et al. 2008), but nothing using data from the post welfare reform era.

There have, however, been a few papers on saving, as well as on consumption levels and

material hardships more generally, which are discussed below.

       Saving

       Powers (1998) offered the first formal test of how saving responds to asset limits, though

in her case she focused on the period when limits were federalized as part of OBRA 1981. Prior
                                                                                                   68


to this legislation there was considerable variation across states in asset limits, but by 1983 only

a few states deviated from the federal liquid asset limit of $1,000. Powers tested how changes in

the net wealth of female heads in the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women changed

between 1978 and 1983, concluding that saving decreased by $0.25 for each $1 decrease in the

asset limit in 1981.

       After the 1996 welfare reform, lower real guarantees, higher asset limits, and higher

earning disregards all suggest that saving and the asset position of the typical mother on welfare

should be higher in TANF than under AFDC. Hurst and Ziliak (2006) used data from the wealth

supplements to the 1994 and 2001 waves of the PSID to test how liquid assets, as well as certain

subcomponents such as ownership of checking and saving accounts and vehicles, changed in

response to higher liquid asset limits, vehicle limits, and time limits. They found that the saving

of female-headed households with children was unresponsive to the welfare-reform induced

changes as part of PRWORA. The upper bound saving response from the 95 percent confidence

interval to a $1000 increase in the liquid asset limit was $40, and the average response was

between –$80 and $10. Because nearly 85 percent of single mother families held liquid wealth

below one half of the pre- welfare-reform limit, it suggests that they are rarely binding for most

of these families. However, Ziliak (2003), using PSID wealth data for 1984 and 1989, showed

means-tested transfers reduce liquid-asset accumulation and precautionary saving motives of

those at risk for welfare. This indicates that the consumption floor aspect of welfare is more

important than the asset limits per se. There is one exception—welfare reform had a small

positive impact on vehicle ownership. This result was corroborated in Sullivan (2006) and

McKernan et al. (2008), though in the latter only from liberalized food stamp vehicle limits.

Because car ownership has been shown to be an important causal channel behind the labor
                                                                                                 69


market success of low-income workers (Raphael and Rice 2002), the liberalization of vehicle

limits may potentially have a long run benefit, but this has yet to be established.

       Consumption and Material Hardship

       Meyer and Sullivan (2004) used data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) and

the PSID from 1984-2000 to estimate the effects of welfare reform at the mean and selected

quantiles of the income and consumption distributions. They specified a difference-in-

differences model where the treatment group was single women with children and the

comparison group was either single childless women or married mothers, and the periods of

study were 1984-90, 1991-93, 1994-95, 1996-2000. They found that the level of inflation-

adjusted total consumption increased for single mothers, and with a relative increase near the

bottom of the consumption distribution for less-skilled single mothers. Some of these gains in

consumption occurred after 1995, but these changes were smaller and in many cases not

statistically significant. Overall, they concluded that the material well being of single moms did

not decline in the five years after PRWORA. However, as highlighted below in Bitler, et al.

(2006b), the living arrangements of welfare families is quite complex, and focusing solely on

single mother families may miss important changes in overall household material well being.

       In a follow-up paper, Meyer and Sullivan (2008) used CE data from 1993 to 2003, along

with data from the American Housing Survey, the National Time Use Survey, and the American

Time Use Survey, to document trends in total spending and separate components. They found

that total consumption increased across the distribution by 7 to 12 percent, with most of the

increase at the low end of the distribution coming from increased outlays on housing and

transportation, with some modest improvements in the quality among the former category.
                                                                                                   70


       Kaushal, et al. (2007) also used CE data on consumption among single-mother

households to compare pre-reform (1990-1995) years to post-reform (1998-2003). They

separated the families by education attainment, which is generally deemed to be a fixed

characteristic of adults that serves as a good proxy for permanent income, instead of estimating

quantiles of the consumption distribution pre- and post-reform as in Meyer and Sullivan (2004)

because there may be an endogenous change in sample consumption composition in response to

reform. They then compared the difference-in-differences in consumption of low-skilled to high-

skilled single mothers to that of married mothers who are assumed to be unaffected by reform.

The triple-difference estimates suggested that there was no response of total spending after

welfare reform among single mothers at-risk of welfare, though they did find significant

increases in spending on transportation, food away from home, adult clothing, and footwear. The

increased spending on “work supports” is consistent with the 2008 paper by Meyer and Sullivan,

as well as the vehicle saving response in Hurst and Ziliak (2006) and Sullivan (2006).

       Beyond actual outlays on goods and services, there is interest in measuring material

hardships associated with welfare reform. These hardships are intended to capture not only the

quality dimension of material well being, but also the volatility, such as having utilities shut off,

pawning items or engaging in illegal activities to acquire necessary goods and services, and

perceptions of economic anxiety. Kalil, et al. (2002) used the first two waves of the WES and

found that sanctions were significant correlates of these types of material hardships, along with

the mother’s mental health. Heflin (2006) extended this work to five waves of the WES and to

six forms of hardships: food insufficiency, telephone disconnection, utility disconnection, unmet

medical needs, improper winter clothing, and housing problems. She reported high levels of

hardships, ranging from 20 percent for improper winter clothing to 56 percent for an unmet
                                                                                                  71


medical need, and that experiencing the hardship was common (only 10 percent never experience

one of the six over a 5-year period) and recipients typically faced multiple hardships at the same

time (2.6 on average). Cancian and Meyer (2004) in their leaver study of TANF participants in

Wisconsin reported that 44 percent of long-term recipients (defined as receiving welfare for at

least 18 months) faced one or more hardships, though this was not qualitatively different from

those shorter-term recipients, 41 percent of whom faced at least one hardship. It is a concern that

much of our evidence on hardships comes from a couple of area studies, though in an

examination of the link between income and material hardship, Sullivan, et al. (2008) reported

that the results from WES are comparable to those found in a national sample from the SIPP. To

date, however, there is no direct evidence on the role that welfare reform has had on material

hardships.

       4.2.5   Health

       The concept of “job lock” is most associated with workers unwillingness to change jobs

for fear of loss of health insurance. The corollary facing low-income single mothers was

“welfare lock”—the fear of loss of health insurance via Medicaid upon exiting welfare.

Categorical eligibility for Medicaid was bestowed upon recipients of AFDC, and this group

comprised the largest share of the Medicaid caseload (though spending was higher for poor

elderly residing in nursing homes). TANF, however, severed the direct link to Medicaid, except

for those whom met AFDC eligibility standards as they existed in 1996 remained eligible for

Medicaid. Welfare leavers under TANF whose earnings place them above Medicaid eligibility

thresholds retain access to transitional insurance for 12 months after exit. After transitional

assistance, the mother is either covered by private insurance (her own policy or employer’s) or

not at all, and her children are either covered on her plan or by Medicaid or SCHIP, the latter
                                                                                                   72


distinction depending on the state of residence, age of children, and income level. If the mother

qualifies for Supplemental Security Income upon exit from TANF then at state discretion she

qualifies for Medicaid, and if she is awarded Social Security Disability Insurance then coverage

comes from Medicare after a two-year wait. In short, the anxiety over health coverage can create

incentives for long spells on welfare, but these potential spells then confront time limits and

work requirements.

       Health Insurance

       Several authors have examined the effect of welfare reform on health insurance coverage.

This research is comprehensively surveyed in Bitler and Hoynes (2008), and briefly summarized

here. Kaestner and Kaushal (2003) were the first to systematically assess this issue, where they

estimated a difference-in-difference model of health insurance coverage of the family as a

function of welfare waiver and TANF implementation, state caseloads, and person-level and

state-level socioeconomic controls. The primary treatment group was low-skilled single mothers

(12 or fewer years of schooling) and the comparison group was either low-skilled single childless

women or low-skilled married women. Using data from the March CPS for 1992-1999 they

found that Medicaid coverage of single mothers fell 7-9 percent after welfare reform, and private

insurance rose 6 percent, which on net left fewer mothers insured. They attributed just a small

portion of these changes to welfare reform and more to other factors that caused caseloads to

decline.

       This basic result of lower insurance coverage is corroborated in Bitler, et al. (2005), who

used data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 1990-2000, and

in Cawley, et al. (2006), who used data from 1992-1999 in the SIPP. Bitler, et al. applied double-

and triple-difference estimators to identify the effect of welfare reform on health insurance
                                                                                                 73


coverage, where the former models on single women relied solely on state variation over time in

policy changes and the latter also utilized married women as an additional comparison group.

They found most of the reduced coverage was from Hispanic mothers. Cawley, et al. also

compared low-skilled (never-married) mothers to low-skilled married mothers, but because they

also followed the same family over time they controlled for individual fixed heterogeneity. They

found a larger overall effect of TANF, leading to an 8 percent increase in mothers being

uninsured post welfare reform, though they did not provide estimates separately by race and

ethnicity. Borjas (2005), using the 1995-2001 March CPS and a triple-difference estimator,

found a sizable reduction in Medicaid coverage among immigrants relative to natives, but that

coverage overall was stable or even increased because of a large increase in labor supply (and

presumably employer-sponsored insurance) among those immigrants most likely affected by the

reforms. Holl, et al. (2005), however, found that Hispanics had significantly higher odds than

blacks of being uninsured or having a gap in coverage two years after leaving welfare in a

random panel of welfare leavers in Illinois, suggesting greater volatility of coverage in this

population.

       Ham, et al. (2009) used data spanning 1989-2003 in various panels of the SIPP to re-

examine the effect of welfare reform on health insurance coverage among single mother families.

They conducted a battery of tests and actually rejected the use of all previously adopted

comparison groups—single childless women, and married women either with or without

children. This has important implications for many non-experimental papers adopting the

differences-in-differences estimation strategy as most use the comparison group approach

without actually verifying whether or not the treatment and comparison groups have similar

“pre-treatment” trends in the outcomes of interest. Ham, et al. thus estimated their models
                                                                                                   74


separately for each group, but also admitted heterogeneity in the effect of reform on insurance

coverage by education level of the mother, and whether the mother was an immigrant or native

to the United States. The authors found evidence that welfare reform reduced Medicaid coverage

among less skilled single mothers, though this loss was somewhat offset by a rise in private

coverage. These effects were heavily concentrated among the Hispanic immigrant population,

perhaps reflecting the so-called chilling hypothesis. These estimates overall, and for Hispanics,

differ from DeLeire, et al. (2006), who also estimated models separately by demographic group,

and for a similar time period, but used March CPS in lieu of the SIPP. Ham, et al. (2009)

attempted to replicate the DeLeire, et al. results in the SIPP, but were unsuccessful. They

conjecture that the difference may lie in the timing of questions between surveys—they used

monthly data in SIPP while DeLeire, et al. used annual data in CPS—and the reference period

may be important. Clearly, reconciling these differences in estimates merits research attention.

       Mother’s Health

       To date there has been much less research on mother’s health after welfare reform (child

well being is discussed below). Bitler, et al. (2005) found evidence in the BRFSS of a

substantively and statistically significant reduction in health-care utilization of single black and

Hispanic women compared to married women, as measured by wellness check-ups, pap smears,

and breast exams. Kaestner and Tarlov (2006) also used data from the BRFSS, but the

identification strategy employed by Kaestner and Kaushal (2003) in their study of health

insurance coverage. Specifically, they identified the effect of welfare reform on health outcomes

via its effect on the welfare caseload. They focused on four health behaviors (smoking, binge

drinking, diet, and exercise) and four self-reported measures of health (body mass and obesity,

days in poor mental health, days in poor physical health, and general health status). Overall, they
                                                                                                    75


found little effect of reform on these health outcomes, with the exception of a reduction in binge

drinking. Corman, et al. (2013) used a variety of data sets to estimate the effects of welfare

reform on illicit drug use among low-skilled single mothers. They found that welfare reform led

to a 10–21 percent decline in illicit drug use, and a 7-11 percent decline in hospital emergency

department episodes. Whether these declines are the result of increased employment, increased

work-related drug testing, TANF (or SNAP) policies, or some other mechanism is unknown.

       Bitler and Hoynes (2008) used data from five random-assignment demonstrations

projects—MFIP, FTP, Jobs First, Iowa’s Family Investment Program, and Vermont’s Welfare

Restructuring Project—that were conducted during the waiver era. Some of these demonstrations

had policies like time limits and work requirements, but none are fully translatable to the current

TANF structure. Most of the evaluations of health outcomes were conducted three to five years

after random assignment, offering a medium-term glimpse of the policy effects. In three of the

four experiments they identified increases in the ability to afford a dentist ranging from 2-16

percent, and in four of the five experiments they saw increases in the ability to afford a doctor

ranging from 6-16 percent. None of these effects, however, were statistically different from the

control group. They also reported that in four of the five demonstrations there was a reduction in

the risk of the mother facing depression, with a statistically significant 20 percent effect relative

to the baseline in the MFIP program with work incentives only (and not work requirements).

       Overall, our knowledge of health effects of welfare reform on the caregiver is limited,

both in experimental and nonexperimental settings. The latter arises in part because of the lack of

public survey data on health outcomes that provide geographic identifiers necessary to map

welfare policies to outcomes, and in part due to relatively small samples in the major health

surveys such as NHANES.
                                                                                                   76


       4.2.6   Family Structure

       All four goals of TANF touch upon family structure, ranging from providing assistance so

“children may be cared in their own home,” marriage preparation and maintenance, and out-of-

wedlock childbearing. This emphasis by policy makers was not because of strong social science

evidence that the AFDC program had significant impacts on family matters. Indeed, in his 1992

review Moffitt concludes “the welfare system does not appear capable of explaining most of the

long-term trend, or any of the recent trend of increasing numbers of female-headed families in the

United States.” (p. 57) Instead, the focus on the family irrespective of the evidence was an

example of what Burtless (1990) called “The Economist’s Lament,” where he noted “Hard

evidence about the behavioral consequences of the program evokes at best a shrug outside the

behavioral sciences.” (p. 76) Regardless, or perhaps in spite of this lack of policy responsiveness

to evidence, the research community embraced the cross-state over time changes in the waivers

and TANF to reexamine how welfare reform affected marriage, divorce, cohabitation, and fertility.

       Living Arrangements

       Bitler, et al. (2004) used flow data at the state level to estimate the effect of waivers and

TANF on new marriages and new divorces from vital statistics spanning 1989 to 2000. They

measured waivers as the share of the year that a state had a major waiver in place and/or that

TANF was implemented. Their models controlled for state economic conditions, demographics,

and the generosity of welfare AFDC/TANF benefit, along with fixed state and time effects, and

in some cases state linear trends. They found that during the waiver era flows into marriage were

about 5 percent lower, but this climbed to 20 percent lower during TANF. At the same time, they

found equal size reductions in divorce rates from waivers, and half again the size of marriage

rate reductions during TANF. Their results provide mixed evidence in meeting TANF goals—
                                                                                                                      77


marriages were less likely to dissolve, but also less likely to form. This is somewhat consistent

with Schoeni and Blank (2000), who in their analysis of CPS data found that the stock of married

mothers increased during the waiver period, but only among less-skilled mothers.

         However, Fitzgerald and Ribar (2004), who used longitudinal data from multiple waves

of the SIPP spanning 1989-2000 to estimate the effects of waivers and TANF on rates of and

transitions into and out of female headship, found limited robust effects of welfare reform on any

of the female headship outcomes. Graefe and Lichter (2008) likewise examined transitions into

marriage, though their focus was on mothers whose first birth was nonmarital, a group of key

policy interest. They are unique in their use of 1995 and 2002 waves of the National Survey of

Family Growth, which measures marital and fertility histories of a cohort of women pre-welfare

reform and post. Their difference-in-difference estimates suggest that marriage rates of women

who first birth was out-of-wedlock compared to women with no child prior to marriage were no

higher after welfare reform than before, and those in the later cohort were more likely to marry

men with weaker labor-market potential. Knab, et al. (2009) also tested whether the policy

reforms affected the likelihood of marriage following a nonmarital birth, though in their case it

was marriage to the biological father five-years after the birth and was restricted to the post-

PRWORA period only via the Fragile Families longitudinal dataset. While they found some

evidence that higher welfare generosity and strong child support enforcement was associated

with lower rates of marriage, these results were quite sensitive to inclusion of state fixed effects

because there was little time variation across the fifteen states in the sample. 19

         In a follow-up paper, Bitler, et al. (2006b) used repeated cross-sections from the March

CPS to examine the effect of reform on the living arrangements of children; that is, whether the


19
   Teitler, et al. (2009) also used Fragile Families to examine transitions into marriage after a nonmarital birth, and
find that they are lower if currently on welfare, but past welfare usage has no effect on the odds of marriage.
                                                                                                    78


child lived with an unmarried parent, with a married parent, or neither. Although they employed

similar methods as in their 2004 paper, this project differed not only in the data source but

importantly in that it took the perspective of the child as opposed to the adult caretaker. They do

so because the CPS does not document the whereabouts of a mother’s child if the child does not

reside with the parent. They found that waivers were associated with reductions in the odds that a

child lived with an unmarried parent, increases in the chances they resided with a married parent,

and increases in the probability of living with neither parent (and instead with a grandparent or

nonrelative caretaker). The latter effect was concentrated among black children, while the

increased odds of living with a married parent was found largely among Hispanic children.

White children had lower odds of living with a married parent before PRWORA, and higher

after, painting a mixed picture for this demographic group.

       Cherlin and Fomby (2004) used the first two waves of the Three City Study, which

predominantly consists of black and Hispanic families, to examine this same issue and showed

that the increase in child residence in two-adult households was via an increase of blended

families (biological mother with non-biological father) and not biological families, and that these

blended unions are more unstable and may perhaps lead to long-term challenges for children.

Dunifon, et al. (2009) also examined the living arrangements of children using longitudinal data

from the SIPP for 1992-1999 along with disaggregated welfare policy measures such as time

limits, sanctions, and earnings disregards. Overall, their estimates suggested few consistent

effects of welfare policies on the chances of a child living with married, cohabiting, or single

parents. Some policies affected certain children only in the waiver period, other policies affected

other children only in the TANF period. Perhaps this heterogeneity of treatment is correct, but
                                                                                                    79


until such results are verified in more samples and over longer time periods, they mainly serve to

keep the waters muddied on the effects of welfare reform on marriage.

         Fertility

        There were several papers that examined the effects of welfare reform on fertility, which

have yielded mixed evidence, not unlike in the AFDC research of the 1970s and 1980s. Joyce, et

al. (2003) used data from Detailed Natality Files for 1990 to 1999 and a difference-in-difference

estimator to compare birth rates among high-welfare risk group of unmarried women with 12 or

fewer years of schooling to a comparison group of married women with 12 or fewer years of

school or unmarried women with 13-15 years of school. Their results suggest little effect of

welfare reform on fertility, and if anything, there was a slight increase among white and black

women. Garfinkel, et al. (2003) also used natality files, but spanning 1980-1996. Their focus was

comparing cross-state over time changes in the maximum benefit guarantee to state child-support

enforcement efforts. They found that stricter child support enforcement led to a 6-9 percent

reduction in fertility, and welfare benefit declines to a 2-4 percent reduction.

       Joyce, et al. (2004), Kearney (2004), and Horvath-Rose, et al. (2008) focused on the

specific role that family caps played on nonmarital childbearing. Joyce, et al. employed a triple-

difference estimator to estimate the effect of family caps on birth rates and abortion rates. The

triple difference comes from comparing family cap to non-family cap states before and after

implementation, and within these states, births and abortions among those at risk of the cap (at

least in the short run) by virtue of their having a prior birth compared to those low-skilled

women with no prior birth. They found that birth rates fell and abortion rates rose among women

at risk of the cap, but since this was found also in states with no cap, it was not possible to

attribute the change to this specific policy (though they cannot rule out a wider welfare reform
                                                                                                    80


effect, or no effect at all). Kearney’s (2004) estimates using data from Detailed Natality Files

reinforced this finding of no family cap effect on fertility, and like the earlier paper by Joyce, et

al. (2003), she found a perverse positive effect of family caps on higher-order births among

unmarried blacks and high-school dropout white women. Horvath-Rose, et al. (2008), however,

found that nonmarital childbearing is significantly lower after the implementation of family caps,

but perversely, marital births were significantly higher. Given the lack of evidence discussed

above on the muted effects of welfare reform on marriage, this calls into question the efficacy of

the model identification, perhaps as they argue, due to the endogeneity of the family cap policy.

       Most of the papers examining family caps estimated the models separately for teenagers

and adults. However, there have been a few papers to isolate fertility among teens. Kaestner, et

al. (2003) compared cohorts of 17 year olds and 19 year olds in the National Longitudinal

Surveys of 1979 and 1997, where the difference-in-difference results were mixed. They found

some evidence of increased nonmarital births among 17 year olds, but no effect among 19 year

olds. Hao and Cherlin (2004) also used the NLSY, but only the 1997 survey where they used the

fertility history rosters to separate 14-16 year olds pre-welfare reform and 14-16 year olds post

reform. The difference-in-difference estimates suggested no effects of welfare reform on teen

pregnancy or births. The exceptions are Offner (2005) and Lopoo and DeLeire (2006). Offner

used March CPS data on 16- and 17-year old girls from 1989-2001 and a difference-in-difference

estimator where the treatment group was teenage girls in families below twice the poverty line or

below the 30th percentile of the income distribution, and the comparison group was girls from

higher-income families. He found a decline in teenage out-of-wedlock child-bearing of 1.4

percentage points, or 17 percent of the baseline rate. Lopoo and DeLeire used birth data from

Detailed Natality Files, to compare birth rates for 15-17 year olds to 18 year olds before and after
                                                                                                    81


welfare reform. The specific policy they isolate is “minor parent rules,” whereby teen parents are

required to stay in school as a condition of benefit receipt and to reside in a home maintained by

an adult caretaker. During the waiver era 15 states implemented such rules, and thus they

exploited the differential timing across states in order to identify the effect. They found a 22

percent decline in annual fertility rates among 15-17 year olds following implementation of these

minor parent provisions.

       It is notable that all the evidence to date on the effect of welfare reform on family

structure comes from data within 5 years of implementation of TANF, and thus future research

utilizing changes over the past decade is needed.

       4.2.7   Child Well Being

       The origins of TANF via the AFDC program, and ADC and Mothers’ Pensions before

that, lie in improving the well being of children. Perhaps it is surprising then to close out the

review of TANF with research on child-focused outcomes, rather than leading with the topic.

Part of this stems from the fact that in the years surrounding welfare reform, most of the policy

and research lenses were focused on caseload reductions and employment gains at the expense of

broader issues of child and family well being. Part of it also stems from the fact that the main

national surveys that have been employed to conduct observational studies of welfare reform

lack child-focused questions (e.g. CPS) or only ask them intermittently (e.g. SIPP). This led

many researchers to study the topic using data from demonstration projects, specialized surveys,

or to field new longitudinal surveys such as Fragile Families, the Three City Study, and WES.

       Morris, et al. (2009) synthesized results on child outcomes from seven random

assignment experiments covering over 30,000 children in the 1990s as part of MDRC’s Next

Generation Project. They also used the experimental nature of the data to test how welfare
                                                                                                   82


policies designed to discourage welfare and encourage work affected children’s achievement and

school performance. They found that programs with earnings supplements that boost both

maternal employment and income improved pre-school children’s achievement; however, if the

program only raised employment and not income then no discernible effects for pre-K children

were found. Moreover, programs that supported center-based child care also resulted in

improved achievement for pre-K children relative to children in home-based or other care.

Adolescents age 11 and older, on the other hand, experienced worse academic outcomes relative

to children in control groups, while no conclusive pattern of effects were found among children

ages 6-10. The worse outcomes for older adolescents seem to be linked with maternal

employment and the attendant increase in home responsibilities for the older child.

       This positive result for young children was recently corroborated in national data by Dahl

and Lochner (2012), who showed that the EITC program boosts child achievement among young

children, and in the negative corollary result in Heflin and Acevedo (2011), who found lower

cognitive achievement among young children on TANF in Fragile Families. Heflin and Acevedo

argued that the pathway for this result was from worse mental health of the mother on welfare,

which seems to coincide with Herbst’s (2013) finding that mothers subjective well being was

higher after welfare reform via increased attachment to work. These positive results for young

children are to be contrasted to the non-results reported in Jacob, et al. (2015) for a housing-

voucher experiment in Chicago and in Chase-Lansdale, et al. (2003) from the Three City Study.

Moreover, the negative results on adolescents in Morris, et al. contrast to the positive mental-

health gains for this age group in Chase-Lansdale, et al. when the mother transitioned to work

after welfare. The difference in the young children results across studies may lie in the fact that

mothers transitioning into work in the Three City Study, while likely eligible for an earnings
                                                                                                    83


supplement like the EITC, may not have taken up the benefit and thus these outcomes look more

like those from mothers with employment but no supplement in the Morris, et al. (2009) study.

The latter do not report on mental health outcomes of adolescents, so these results are not easily

reconciled, and also conflict with the positive results from observational studies on schooling

outcomes among teenagers discussed below.

       In related leavers studies, Kalil and Dunifon (2007) reported results from five waves of

the WES that mother’s employment had no deleterious effects on children’s behavior. Osborne

and Knab (2007) used a cross-section of Fragile Families at the 3-year follow up survey after the

child’s birth, and they reported that child outcomes were better after the mother transitioned to

work, but this stemmed from positive self selection of the types of mothers who choose paid

work, and not a result of paid work per se. Slack, et al. (2007) reported from the Illinois Families

Study that children of mothers who were unemployed and off welfare were in better health than

similar children whose mothers were working and off welfare, and the latter were comparable to

those on welfare regardless of work status. This result is surprising as this is the group generally

defined as “disconnected mothers,” and it holds even controlling for confounding factors,

including higher rates of marriage among the no work/no welfare group. Since their study is

based on a small sample in a single state, it is premature to draw any generalizations.

       There are several negative child health outcomes from studies using national surveys and

standard difference-in-differences estimators. For example, Haider, et al. (2003) found rates of

breast feeding to be 5.5 percent lower overall after welfare reform, and as much as 22 percent

lower among mothers receiving WIC and residing in states with stringent work requirements on

new mothers with children 6 months of age. Kaestner and Lee (2005) reported reductions in first

trimester prenatal care, the number of prenatal care visits, and an increase in the fraction of low
                                                                                                   84


birth weight babies. Paxson and Waldfogel (2003) reported that in states with stricter lifetime

welfare limits and sanctions for noncompliance there was an increase in substantiated child

maltreatment. Kalil and Ziol-Guest (2009) found that the gap between low-income children of

non-citizens versus natives in terms of children’s health and family access to care widened up to

30 percent over the baseline, suggesting that immigrant families face barriers, whether real or

perceived, to health care after PRWORA. The exception here is Dunifon, et al. (2006), who used

two waves from the SIPP to examine pre- and post-welfare reform effects and found no

consistent effects on child outcomes. This study, however, only employed a difference estimator

and thus did not net out potentially confounding trends that could be controlled with a

comparison group.

       There is a potential bright spot for adolescents (beyond the couple of studies that found

lower teen births) in recent work on education attainment. Offner (2005), in the same paper on

teen fertility, examined drop-out rates among teens. He reported that drop-out among 16- and 17-

year old teens declined 3.2 percentage points after welfare reform, or 24 percent of the pre-

reform baseline. Dave, et al. (2012) used the schooling supplement of the CPS fielded in October

of each year , but restricted attention to the years 1992-2001. They employed a triple-difference

estimator that compared pre- and post-welfare reform periods (waivers and TANF separately) for

a group at high risk of welfare (unmarried females ages 15-20 living with one or no parent who

has less than a college education) versus a group at low risk (males of similar SES background).

They found that welfare reform reduced the odds of a teen girl dropping out of high school by 15

percent. Miller and Zhang (2012), who used a difference-in-difference estimator applied to both

October CPS and to administrative data from the Common Core of Data from 1991 to 2005,
                                                                                                   85


found a reduction in high school drop-out rates of males and females combined of 20 percent

after welfare reform.

5.      Summary

        Welfare reform spawned a flurry of new research—observational studies, demonstration

projects, and surveys—that stemmed both from the broad reach of the new TANF program

across multiple domains of family life, and from extensive variation in program features across

states and over time that facilitated nonexperimental program evaluation. Nearly two decades

after passage of the landmark legislation, are we in a position to draw firm conclusions on the

effects of welfare reform? With few exceptions, it is still premature to make definitive claims on

TANF.

        Work and welfare use were the focal research interests in the early days of welfare

reform, and to date remain the most widely studied outcomes. The weight of research evidence

seems to indicate that welfare reform reduced participation in the TANF program, increased

employment and earnings, and decreased total after-tax and transfer incomes, at least in the

lower half of the income distribution of single mothers. To be certain there is wide disagreement

in the literature on the magnitude of effects vis-à-vis the business cycle and other policy changes

such as the expanded EITC, but there is agreement on the direction. This is perhaps as close to

consensus as we get at this stage. Within the bundle of welfare reform policies, time limits and

work requirements are the two leading reforms that contributed to the decline in welfare use and

rise in employment rates, but what role they had on broader measures of earnings and disposable

incomes is as of yet unsettled.

        Beyond work and welfare, our confidence begins to wane, either because of scarcity of

evidence or wide discrepancy of estimates. There is some limited evidence that welfare reform
                                                                                                   86


had no effect on saving (except for increased vehicle wealth) or total consumption, and it

reduced health insurance coverage and lowered health outcomes (especially among Hispanics).

There are also a few studies that show that flows into marriage, teen births, and teen drop-out

rates are all lower after welfare reform, but again we are limited on the number of studies using

national data and rigorous identification methods to draw firm conclusions.

       The areas in which I believe the evidence to date is too mixed, or even nonexistent,

includes consumption and labor supply decisions over time, the interaction of work requirements

with human capital development and subsequent earnings, health and fertility outcomes of

mothers, living arrangements of children, and welfare use across generations. A key argument

made by policymakers in favor of the TANF program, especially the introduction of time limits

and work requirements, was to break the dependence on welfare not only for the current cohort

of recipients, but also for their children. To my knowledge there has been no study on the

intergenerational transmission of welfare post TANF. I would add to this list a need to sort out

some of the current conflicting evidence on child well being that arises from demonstrations,

leaver studies, and observational studies —young children versus adolescents—in terms of

physical and emotional health. The historical underpinning of TANF is on improving child

welfare, and yet some of our weakest causal evidence to date on welfare reform is in this

domain. Some of this is due to lack of national data on child outcomes, some due to

underreporting in surveys, and some due to lack of access to geocoded data necessary to link

outcomes to local policy environments. This is an area where more widespread access to secure

data sites, such as Census Research Data Centers that also house major health surveys, would

foster new research on welfare reform.
                                                                                                 87


       Our knowledge base of the effects of welfare reform is also limited by the fact that with

very few exceptions all the evidence comes from the first five years after the introduction of

TANF. This is a real shortcoming because many of the outcomes of interest are likely to be

realized only after many years. It is also disconcerting because as depicted in Figure 9, the flow

of new research on welfare reform has tapered off significantly in recent years, and how low-

income families and their children have fared during the Great Recession across these domains is

largely unknown. Some of this reduced research flow may be from the misguided perception that

TANF is now a “small” program in the safety net and thus less interesting to study. To be

certain, programs like SNAP, SSI, and the EITC are larger in terms of annual appropriations, but

at $30-$35 billion per year, TANF is still a significant player in the safety net, and touches many

more American families than caseload figures indicate because the latter only capture cash

assistance whereas two-thirds of spending today is on nonassistance. Moreover, there is ongoing

discussion among some members of Congress to block grant SNAP and Medicaid, using TANF

as a model. The limited evidence to date suggests that TANF did not respond to the Great

Recession, and this lack of business-cycle response contributed to the growth of deep poverty.

There has been scant research in the last decade on the implications of TANF financing for state

budgets and family well being. Thus, an expanded research base is needed to not only assess

TANF, but also to offer guidance for evidence-based policy discussions on the wider safety net.

                                         benefits, and subsidized employment. The law also permitted
                                         states to “freeze” caseload reduction credits at pre-recession
                                         levels, allowed states to use TANF reserve funds for any
                                         benefit or service (before it was restricted to assistance), and
                                         extended supplemental grants through the end of FY2010.

                                         fund and provided supplemental grants only through June 30,
                                         2011. Also required some additional reporting on work
                                         activities and TANF expenditures.
September      Short-Term TANF           Extended basic TANF funding for three months, through

                                         strip clubs; states would be required to prohibit access to
                                         TANF cash at Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) at such
                                         establishments. It also required states to report TANF data in
                                         a manner that facilitates the exchange of that data with other
                                         programs' data systems.

* Note: Illinois diversion payments.
    WRD (2014) indicates Illinois has a diversion payment program but lacks information on the
    maximum amount, how often one can receive it, or period of ineligibility after payment; it only
    indicates “Yes” for program, “Cash” for form of payment, and “No” for payment counts toward time
    limit. Footnote 17: “An applicant who has found a job that will make him or her ineligible for cash
    assistance, or who wants to accept a job and withdraw his or her application for assistance, is eligible
    for a one-time payment to begin or maintain employment.”
    <http://www.cfs.purdue.edu/cff/documents/family_data/abt_associates_repor.pdf> indicates no
    diversion program.
    <http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/resource/tanf-financial-data-fy-2012> shows Illinois has no
    expenditures for non-recurring benefits in 2012, but it did in 2005, 2010, 2011.

* Only adult benefits are terminated; otherwise, benefits are terminated for the entire unit.
1 After receiving 36 months of assistance, the case is closed; however, it is possible to receive 24 additional months
of benefits if the unit has not received benefits for at least 24 months and can demonstrate good cause for
reapplying.
2 After 60 months, the unit remains eligible if the net income falls below the Reduced Payment Level. Benefits are
reduced to 80 percent of the payment level for the unit size.

July 2012, OPRE Report 2013-27, published November 2013 (Urban Institute), Table L5 Maximum Monthly Benefit for a
Family of Three with No Income, 1996-2012 (July).
\1\ Data on three-person families were not published or reported before 1975. Thus, the 1970 data were derived by reducing the
reported four-person need standard by the proportional difference between three- and four-person AFDC need standards as
shown in the July 1975 DHEW reports.
\2\ CRS survey data.
\3\ Real percentage change, calculated assuming a 2012 PCE value of 106.01 relative to the 1970 value of 22.325.

Earnings Disregards Notes:
The table describes benefit computation disregards for recipients. If the disregards differ for applicants, it is
footnoted.
1 The earned income disregard cannot be applied to the earnings of an individual receiving assistance beyond the
60th month under an exemption or extension.
2 These disregards also apply to applicants who have received assistance in one of the previous four months.
3 In addition to the 100 percent disregard of all subsidized JOBSTART wages, recipients can disregard the standard
$90 and 30 percent of the remainder for any non-JOBSTART earned income.
4 Recipients are eligible for the one-time 100 percent disregard if they become newly employed or report increased
wages acquired after approval.
5 The six months in which the extra $900 is disregarded need not be consecutive, but the recipient may use this extra
disregard in no more than six months over the course of his or her lifetime.
6 At application to determine initial eligibility, 20 percent disregard is used. Once determined eligible and for
ongoing benefits, a 50 percent disregard is used for benefit computation.
7 Recipients are eligible for the one-time 100 percent disregard if they find employment of 35 hours a week within
the first 30 days of their initial approval for TANF. If work is not found within 30 days, the recipient is ineligible to
ever receive the disregard again. An additional 100 percent disregard is available to units for three months when the
unit’s case is subject to closure because of increased earnings and the individual is employed for at least 25 hours a
week at the federal minimum wage or higher. The recipient may not have already received the six-month disregard,
unless there has been at least a 12-month break in receipt of TANF benefits. The three-month disregard may be
received more than once during the 60-month TANF benefit period provided there is a period of at least 12
consecutive months in which a family does not receive TANF benefits before the family reapplies for assistance.
Two-parent units may disregard 100 percent of earnings for the first six months, $120 and 33.3 percent in the next
12 months, and $90 thereafter. If a recipient marries for the first time, his or her new spouse may receive a one-time,
100 percent disregard for six consecutive months.
8 This policy applies only to recipients who become employed while receiving TANF. Applicants and recipients
who gained employment before receiving TANF are allowed to disregard $120 and 33.3 percent of remainder for
first four months, $120 next eight months, $90 thereafter.
9 The 100 percent disregard is applicable only once every 12 months, even if employment is lost and then regained.
In the first month of benefit computation, applicants may disregard 50 percent of earnings only.
10 These disregards apply to individuals working 20 or more hours a week. Individuals employed fewer than 20
hours a week may disregard 100 percent in the first month of employment and 50 percent thereafter. However, if an
individual’s hours increase to 20 hours during the first six months, he or she may disregard 75 percent for the
                                                                                                                   128

remainder of the six-month period. The 100 percent disregard is only applicable once every 12 months, even if
employment is lost and then regained.
11 Two-parent units may disregard all earnings in excess of 35 hours a week for one parent and 24 hours a week for
the other parent, $225, and 50 percent in the first 24 months. Thereafter, they may disregard $225 and 50 percent of
the remainder. The disregard for earnings in excess of the participation requirement only applies to recipients for the
first 24 months of benefit receipt, for both single and two-parent units.
12 Two-parent units may disregard $225 and 50 percent of the remainder.
13 The 100 percent disregard is available only once in a lifetime and may be received only if the recipient is newly
employed at a job that is expected to be permanent for more than 20 hours a week.
14 (NOTE: The full entry for North Dakota includes extra disclaimers before the actual footnote. “$180 or 27%
(whichever is greater) and 50% of remainder unless the household has already received the 50% disregard for six
months during a previous TANF eligibility period14”) FOOTNOTE: If a parent marries while receiving assistance,
the income of his or her new spouse is disregarded for the first six months. The disregard for the new spouse only
applies if his or her needs were not previously included in the unit.
15 These disregards apply to individuals working full time, defined as 20 hours a week for recipients caring for a
child under age 6 and 30 hours a week for all other recipients. Individuals working less than full time may disregard
$120 and 50 percent of the remainder.
16 The 50 percent disregard is available only once in a lifetime and may only be applied to consecutive months.
17 If a parent marries while receiving assistance, and the new spouse’s gross income (minus any court-ordered child
support) is less than 185 percent of the consolidated need standard for the entire assistance unit including the spouse,
the unit may choose to include the new spouse in the unit. If the spouse is included, all his or her income is excluded
for eligibility purposes and benefit computation. If he or she is not in the unit, all the spouse’s income and resources
are excluded for eligibility and benefit computation.
18 If a parent marries while receiving assistance, the unit may choose to exclude the new spouse from the unit for
three months. At the end of the three-month period, however, the new spouse becomes a mandatory member of the
assistance unit, and his or her income is counted in benefit computation calculations.
19 Once the recipient has received four months (they need not be consecutive) of the 90 percent disregard, he or she
is not eligible to receive the disregard again until the TANF case has been denied and remains denied for one full
month, and 12 calendar months have passed since the denial. The 12-month ineligibility period begins with the first
full month of denial after the client used the fourth month of the 90 percent disregard.
20 Once the recipient has received four months (they need not be consecutive) of the 90 percent disregard, he or she
is not eligible to receive the disregard again until the TANF case has been denied and remains denied for one full
month, and 12 calendar months have passed since the denial. The 12-month ineligibility period begins with the first
full month of denial after the client used the fourth month of the 90 percent disregard. The earnings of a TANF
recipient’s new spouse are disregarded for six months if the total gross income of the budget group does not exceed
200 percent of the federal poverty level.
21 These disregards apply to recipients with income from unsubsidized employment or a combination of subsidized
and unsubsidized employment. For recipients with earnings from subsidized employment only, the disregard is $90.
22 The disregard varies by family size; for one to four family members, the disregard is $134. For five members, the
disregard is $157; and for six or more family members, the disregard is $179.
23 The disregard varies by family size; for one to three family members, the disregard is $147. For four members,
the disregard is $155; for five members, the disregard is $181; and for six or more family members, the disregard is
$208.
24 Married couples with a child in common may disregard $400.
