                                       ABSTRACT


         With the mounting U.S.        trade deficit, much attention has

  centered on the role of U.S.         macroeconomic policy and economic

  structure as contributing factors.

         This paper contends that the economic structure and     policies

  of Japan have also done much to contribute to the trade       imbalance.

  Institutional   features of Japan's macroeconomy and          industrial

  structure which have promoted her large trade surplus are      discussed

  and industrial policies evaluated.

         Given the nature and magnitude of the role played by Japan in

  causing the bilateral trade imbalance, the next question the paper

  addresses is how Japan might best act to alleviate this imbalance.

  This section of the paper examines fiscal, monetary and other policy

  initiatives Japan might take to reduce the trade imbalance.          The

  evidence stresses the desirability of expanding Japan's services

  industries, particularly leisure—related services.

I.    Introduction

      In recent months there has been considerable debate over

how to cut the U.S. trade deficit. Perhaps because a deficit is

viewed as something "bad" and a surplus as something "good", much

attention has been focused on what the U.S. might do to improve

the situation.    There is some sense to this.   After all, if a

surplus really is desirable, countries like Japan which enjoy a

substantial surplus can hardly be expected to take the initiative

in altering the status quo.

      Yet, it is dangerous to focus on potential U.S. actions

while relegating Japan's response to the background.   The trade

imbalance is in fact a problem for Japan as well as the U.S. air

countries have grown so economically interdependent that trade

problems in the U.S. can have disastrous consequences for Japan

and vice—versa.

      It is imperative to understand the Japanese perspective on

how the trade imbalance emerged, and Japan's likely role in

resolving this imbalance.     These are the issues we wish to

address here.     More specifically,    we examine and discuss

objective features of Japan's economy and economic policies which

have contributed to the trade imbalance, and evaluate Japan's

subjective assessment of its responsibility for this problem. We

then discuss what Japan's likely response to the trade imbalance

issue will be,       and the implications for Japan—U.S. trade

imbalances and trade friction.
II.     Japan's    Role in the   Trade   Imbalance

        Japan's role in the current trade imbalance is the result

of several        economic factors buttressed by an eclectic and
sometimes questionable economic philosophy.                  Before discussing
Japan's rationale for its role in the trade imbalance, however,
we examine        those features of Japan's economy and the economic

policies which have contributed to this problem.


        Macroeconomic Structure


        Japan's   economy differs in         important respects from that of the

U.S.    Factors such as Japan's high savings rate and weak domestic
demand have served to promote a Japanese trade surplus vis—a—vis the

U.S.     The high rate of saving and weak domestic demand reflect in

part the high cost of housing and education relative to income.

        To the extent that Japan's pattern of saving and domestic

demand reflect structural factors like housing and education costs,

they are likely to persist unless the Japanese government takes

active steps to induce structural change.                However, to the extent
                                        2
that   they reflect cultural factors,                   expansionary       government

initiatives may be less effective and less appreciated than they

would be in a more consumption—oriented society.

       One    the surface, Japan's tax structure does             not appear to be

responsible for its sluggish personal consumption.                       As Table   1



indicates,       taxes on individual income account for a smaller

percentage      of tax receipts      in Japan (36.1%) than in the U.S.

(118.3%).      This is rather surprising         in   view of'   the   fact that the
U.S.    is   by far the more consumption—oriented society. However, the

damaging     effect of Japan's tax structure on personal consumption has

                                         2
come from what has not been taxed rather than from what has been

taxed.      In particular, the tax exempt status of                        private      savings has

raised saving relative to personal consumption.

    Other    factors are also important.                      Paltry increases in real

earnings have kept consumption in check. As Table 2 indicates, real

cash earnings in Japan rarely increased by more than two percent per

annum over 1979—1985, in spite of annual productivity gains which

rarely increased by less than two percent                               (and which usually

increased by substantially more). Other structural features, such as

Japan's longer working hours, have also served to strengthen
savings and dampen demand.

              Nor          consumption increases driven by economic growth a
       likely outcome.              Investment growth has been trending downward in

       Japan for years (see Figure 1).                                  This pattern is to be expected for

       a maturing economy.                  The alarming fact, however, is that in recent

       years, investment and saving have diverged.                                                       Figure 2 indicates

       that, from about 1983 onward,                              saving           rose sharply as a percent of

       GNP,    while investment leveled off.                                      This divergence,                       in turn, has

       induced a capital outflow, resulting in a weaker yen and a larger

       trade surplus for Japan.

        Private consumption     has become an increasingly important

component of domestic demand in Japan over the past 15 years.

For instance, while buriness investment accounted for 21% of
                                                          3
dorestie demsnd     in 1970, it now accounts for only 16% .     While
public sector     spending increased substantially after the first

oil shock, its share of domestic demand today is roughly the same

as it was in 1970, around 17%. For this reason, sluggish private

consumption is of particular concern today.



         Macroeconomic Policy


         Japan's macroeconomic policies have tended to reinforce the

effects of its macroeconomic structure on the trade imbalance.

Where      expansionary fiscal policy might have       significantly

increased domestic demand, redressing the need to expand exports,

Japan has instead pursued a course of fiscal restraint over the

past several years.     Given current Japanese sentiment, it may be

difficult to implement expansionary fiscal policy.            In the

business conmiunity, fiscal expansion is viewed as an avenue of

last resort.     For example, Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Japan

Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), has emphasized

that      government should explore other possibilities       before

resorting to expansionary fiscal policy via a construction bond

issue:


         Some people argue that construction bonds to finance
         social infrastructure building are different from
         deficit—covering bonds, but in reality they share the
         same effect of leaving debts to future generations.4




                                   6
         Monetary growth har been moderate for the past decade or
 so.     This pattern may have come in      response to the unprecedented
 inflation    Japan experienced in the early 1970s following the Bank

 of Japan's failure to control the money supply during that

 period.

         Recently,    the   money supply (M2 + CDs) has crept upward,

growing at a rate of about 9 percent from          late   1985 to mid 1986.

However,       much    of   this growth      reflects,     not   government

expansionary efforts,       but weak investment. According to Bank of

Japan analysts,

           Such high money supply growth is attributable to
           increased corporate preference for putting idle funds
           into money management instead of investment in plant.5

         Given Japan's low interest rates, it is unlikely that

monetary policy could play a strong expansionary role.               Larger

increases in the money supply would primarily serve to increase

inflation.


         Industrial Structure


        Over the past ten years, Japan has made strong efforts to

increase      production     in its       manufacturing    sector,   which

constitutes the major portion of its exports.             Evidence of this

restructuring effort is striking.            Table 3 indicates that total

manufacturing output has increased at an average annual rate of

5.5 percent in Japan over 19751981l, well in excess of the U.S.

(14.0   percent),     and much further ahead of other major industrial

countries.      These manufacturing increases have been concentrated

in the more advanced industries, such as electric machinery and

processing industries, rather than in heavy industries.

             Japan's industrial structure today is the outcome of a

concerted effort to become more energy—efficient in response to

the oil shocks of the 1970s.                                                  Besides increasing productive

efficiency, Japanese industries have successfully advanced into

those fields having a high income elasticity of demand.                                                                       Table L

indicates that the income elasticity of Japan's exports exceeds

that of most. other major industrialized countries, particularly

if      one      includes the 1980s.                              Although it is not shown, Table L

 first quarter of' 1980 to the second quarter of 1983 were           a

 Whopping 2.31.       Such a dramatic increase simply could not have

 happened   without   a strong effort by Japanese industry to change

 its industrial structure.

        By contrast, the income elasticity of Japan's imcorts are

 far lower than in most other industrialized countries, as Table 14

 also indicates.      The relatively low income elasticity of' Japan's

 imports can be explained in part by Japan's import structure,

which includes a high share of' raw materials and fuels.        Income

elasticities are fairly low for these kinds of imports.


       Industrial Policy

       Just as Japan's macroeconomic policies have cocnplemented

structural features of its macroeconomy, Japan's industrial

policies have complemented its industrial structure. In response

to the havock wrought by the first oil crisis,               Japanese

industrial policy sought to promote R & D investment in high

technology industries and to assist stagnant industries in

downscaling operations.

       It should be noted, however, that Japanese industry, moreso

than    Japanese government,      was responsible for changes in

industrial structure.      To be sure, government provided guidance

and incentives, but it was industry which made the decisions

altering Japan's industrial structure.       Adherence to government

directives was largely elective.       Coninenting on the relationship

between government and industry during this period, Suzumura and

Okuno—Fujiwara have remarked that:



                                   9
          • . .private firms did not have much reason to comply with
          administrative     guidance   unless such    compliance
          was mandatory and/or doing so was consistent with the
          firrnts private motives.   Thus, the character of
          industrial policy became mostly passive, indicative
          and intermediary rather than active, interventionist
          and regulatory.6



          Trade Barriers

          In terms of actual tariffs and quotas, it is difficult to

 argue that Japanese protectionism has meaningfully contributed to

 its trade surplus. The supporting evidence simply is not there.

 Table 5 indicates, for example, that nominal tariff rates are low

 in Japan relative to other major industrialized nations.

          Some      complaints have been voiced, however, to the effect

that       unduly stringent and even discriminatory                                        non—tariff

barriers,            such      as health and safety                      requirements,             have

effectively limited exports to Japan.                            Given the difficulties in

obtaining reliable quantitative evidence on either side of this

argument, available evidence is anecdotal in nature. Thus, this

is likely to remain a controversial issue for some time.                                          Since

the Japan—U.S. trade imbalance occured quite rapidly and is of



                                               10
 relatively reoet    vinta±, however,    it is unlikely that this

 pattern was strongly driven by long—standing non—tariff barriers.

 Nor do there appear to have been substantial recent changes in

 non—tariff barriers which might have caused a large trade
 imbalance.


       Capital Mobility and Japan's Capital Markets


       For the past several years, the United States has been

 clamoring for increased liberalization of Japan's capital markets

 and increased capital mobility.    This pressure culminated in the

 so—called Yen/Dollar Agreement reached at the sumit meeting in

Tokyo in November, 1983.

      The      intent of this agreement was to eliminate       yen

depreciation allegedly caused by a combination of artificially

low interest rates in Japan and restrictions on capital flows ——

restrictions    which were particularly discouraging to capital
inflow into Japan.

      The actual importance of these factors for the yen/dollar

exchange rate and, ultimately, the Japan—U.S. trade imbalance, is

a matter of considerable dispute.     Some have argued that in the

past Japan has deliberately tried to depreciate the yen by

keeping domestic interest rates artificially low.        At first
blush, there seems to be some evidence to support this claim. As

Table 6 indicates, interest rates tended to be substantially

lower in Japan than in the U.S. Furthermore, while interest rates

for long—term government bonds declined in both Japan and the

U.S. over 1982—1985, the spread actually increased.

         No    does this pattern appear likely to change any time soon.

This is particularly unfortunate since capital market liberalization

may     be     the most significant measure Japan can take, not only in

terms of appreciating the yen, but in the interest of greater equity

and efficiency:


          .domestic liberalization (of capital markets) might be
        considered the most likely (measure) to have a significant
        upward effect on the yen, and to have beneficial
        implications for the efficient and equitable working of
        the Japanese economy.    But domestic liberalization is
        already taking place at a deliberate pace and is the
        category of policy measures least susceptible to being
        speeded up in response to U.S. pressure. 7


        In terms of actual exchange rate outcomes, however, the

case against Japan is much weaker.                                Frankel demonstrates that,

when currency values are measured in terms of a weighted average

among   trading         partners, the effective exchange values of European

currencies decreased over l980_l9814, but the effective exchange

value of the yen actually increased. Frankel concludes from this
that:




                                                     12
         .the Drimary problem is with the strong appreciation of
       the dollar and the roots of that appreciation within
       U.S. economic policy, not with yen appreciation or Japanese
       ecenonc policy.8

       Fvrn ii Frankel's conclusion n true, it does not follow

 that Japanese policy towards its domestic capital markets poses

no significant problems for the Japan-JJ.S. trade imbalance and

trade friction. First, the economic problem remains. While the

effective exchange value of the yen appreciated over l980_198L1,

the questions is, would this measure of the yen's value have

appreciated even more if Japan had fully liberalized domestic

capital markets?        There is no quantitative answer to this

questior,    but   as     Frankel himself      has   noted,   domestic

liberalization is perhaps the most significant capital market

action Japan can take    to   appreciate the yen.

      Second, the political problem remains.         Regardless of the

objective effect of domestic liberalization on exchange rates,

Japan's failure to fully liberalize domestic capital markets is

perceived as a malicious effort to depreciate the yen. Hence, it

serves as a convenient scapegoat for her trading partners when

they find themselves running a trade deficit with Japan.

      Furthermore, while Japan has taken greater strides in

promoting capital mobility, such measures, unaccompanied by

meaningful domestic liberalization, have served to promote a

capital outflow bias. As long as this situation persists, Japan's

capital market policy will remain a festering sore to her trading

partners.


     Synthesis

    While it is undoubtedly the case that the factors mentioned


                                   13
above have made the Japan—U.S.                        trade imbalance greater than it

otherwise        wo'id have beer., it does not necessarily follow that
Japan     has been primarily responsible for this                                           imbalance.

The high U.S. trade deficit and interest rates, as well as brisk

consmer        spending, were significant contributing factors.                                     In
fact,   the pattern of trade between Japan and her major trading

partners provides some evidence fnich suggests that the U.S.

trade deficit may be primarily a U.S. problem. Table 7 shows the

five leading countries from which Japan imports 1nile Table 8

shows the five leading countries to which Japan exports.                                         While

the U.S. is Japan's leading source of imports by a substantial

amount, its lead in purchasing Japan's exports is truly enormous.

          Now if Japan's industrial structure (which largely produces

machinery and equipment) were significantly responsible for the

Japan—U.S. trade imbalance, we might expect to observe a similar

pattern between Japan and other countries which import a large

share of manufactured goods from Japan. No such pattern emerges,

however.          For example, although at least 50% of Japan's exports

to China, Korea and Australia are in manufactured goods, these

countries have only modest trade imbalances with Japan; indeed,

Australia enjoys a modest trade surplus vis—a—vis Japan.




III. Japan's Perceived Responsibility for the
      Trade Imbalance
                                                                                —
          Given         the structural features arid policy measures in Japan

which have contributed to the trade imbalance, the next question

we as< is: to what extent do the Japanese view themselves as

responsible for this imbalance?                                   To answer such a question

requires an understanding of both traditional Japanese values and

more    recent adaptations in response to changing                                               economic

realities.


       Why Japan Does Not Feel Culpable


       Traditionally, Japan has been a hardworking, team—oriented

society. The Japanese work longer hours than do                                               workers in

other major industrialized countries.                                      Table 9 indicates that

Japanese     labor works substantially more hours than                                             their

counterparts in the U.S., the U.K., France and West Germany. If

anything, this gap appears to be increasing over time.

          Japan's   commitmer to achievement through     individual.

 sacrifc       ai collective cooperation makes it        a   nation

 rrti2ul2rly reluctant t:' accept the blame when trade imbalances

 arise.      This reluctance is exacerbated when the cplaining

trading partn'viz., t'n U.S.) enjoys a higher standard of
living (especially if leisure and housing are included) with

apparently less sacrifice.

          A predilection for cooperation and individual sacrifice

makes Japan less likely to feel responsible for the trade

imbalance for two reasons. First and more obviously, Japan tends

to view its economic achievements as a direct result of sweat and

sacrifice. As such, Japan takes a dim view of' pressure by other

nations to relinquish what it regards as its "just desserts."

     Second, the team—oriented nature of Japanese society makes

it difficult to point an accusing finger at any one segment of

the society.        In the U.S., perhaps the antithesis of a team—

oriented society, there is no shortage of accusing fingers.

Consumers point to ill—advised U.S. macroeconomic policy as

contributing to the trade imbalance while government is quick to

cite spendthrift consumers as the main culprits. In a team—

oriented society, however, it is more difficult to point an

accusing finger at the poor performance of one or two members of

that team. To function smoothly, a team must collectively accept

blame or collectively reject blame. While Japan may privately

acknowledge that some of its sectors have contributed           to

increasing the trade imbalance, collectively, Japan does not feel

significantly responsible for it. "Team Japan" does not feel that

it has commited any foul play.


                                 17
        In addition to traditional and cultural factors, adaptations

in Japan's attitudes and philosophies have helped promote its

industrial restructuring following the first and second oil

crises.      The most important adaptation was inspired by Professor
                                           9
Thurow's      "Zero—Sum Society" doctrine .      According to this
doctrine, if one economic entity gains, the other must inevitably

lose.

        Published in 1980, Professor Thurow's ideas were enormously

popular      in Japan,     especially among the Japanese business
community. The appeal that such a doctrine held for the Japanese

during this time is not surprising.        In response to the oil

crises of the 1970s, greater energy efficiency in production and

increased exports to pay for the high cost of oil imports were

objectives of top priority in Japan.       While these goals held

great promise for Japan, it was apparent that they could lead to

trade deficits and/or loss of international competitiveness for

Japan's trading partners, most notably the U.S.       The Zero—Sum

philosophy argued that such outcomes, while perhaps unfortunate,

were inevitable.      Now if a Zero—Sum world were as inevitable as
                      'I

the most hard—boiled laws in economics, then such a rationale for

Japan's industrial restructuring efforts would seem even better

than appealing to cultural and traditional factors unique to

Japan.       Cultural and traditional explanations for Japanese

industrial     retrenchment could always be attacked as being

outdated and inappropriate for a major economic power like Japan.

But .fno could dispute the "inevitable"?

 There is, in fact, a much older (and perhaps more enduring)
 doctrjnc than the Zero—Sum doctrine to characterize possible
 trade   outcomes between Japan and the U.S.            This is the classic
 Prisoner's Dilema.           According to the Prisoner's Dilemma, either

 both parties can cooperate, and each become better off, or each

 can try to deceive the other, in which case both become worse
off.

        Given thc large and growing economic       interdependence     between

Japan and the U.S., the potential harm that either country can

inflict upon the other and the potential benefit                  that either
country can bestow on the other are considerable.                  These are
precisely the conditions under which              the    Prisoner's Dilemma
arises.
    Aside        from    Japan's    cultural     factors    and     political

philosophies which mitigate feelings of responsibility for the

current trade imbalance, there is genuine sentiment in Japan that

the U.S. is largely responsible for the current trade deficit and

is trying to "slough off" responsibility for it onto                   Japan.

Expressing the Japanese view on this issue, Komiya           states:
       That     the
                 fundamental sources of the Pxnerican current
       account deficit lie principally in the American economy
       and a correction of the (trade) deficit depends on
       improvement in macroeconomic policies of the United States
       itself, must be very clear to people who understand just
       a little economics.1O


       To many Japanese, U.S. accusations of Japan's responsibility


                                      19
 in the trade imbalance is little more than the irrational ravings

of a bested competitor:


       When a country falls into a difficulty, the domestic
       reaction is often to emphasize that it is caused by
       unreasonable and unfair actions of foreign countries.
       Criticism of Japan is partly to be understood in this
       context, and is thus not something which will drift away
       of its own       accord.11

       To be sure, the official stance of the Japanese government

on Japan's role in the trade imbalance is considerably more

diplomatic.           On numerous occasions, Prime Minister Nakasone has

declared that Japan should promote international harmony by

cooperating to reduce the trade imbalance.

       The official government position almost certainly results

from Japan's concern over potential U.S. protectionism, not

because Japan feels responsible for the trade imbalance.               One

need not look too far beneath the surface before evidence of'

Japan's resentment and concern over U.S. protectionist measures

to redress the trade imbalance clearly emerges.             For example,
                                                              12
MITI Chief Michio Watanabe labelled as "outrageous"                a bill
passed in the U.S. House of Representatives designed to


          toughen laws against unfair trade practices and
       force        other nations to reduce "excessive"        trade
       surpluses with United States.13

Foreign    Minister Shintaro Abe also voiced strong disapproval of
               11
this   bill.        Behind a veil of soothing   diplomatic oaths, Japan's
government          seems no happier about U.S. pressure to reduce the

trade imbalance than do her constituents.           The difference is the

government has a better appreciation of the political realities.


                                      20
        Thus far, we have discussed objective features of the
Japaree        econcey which have contributed to the trade imbalance
and Japan's perception of its responsiblity for that imbalance.
While we have isolated a number of features of Japan's economy
which have contributed to the trade imbalance, there is scant
evidence       that Japan feels at fault for this pattern.         In fact,

quite   the opposite seems to be the case.



IV. What Will Japan Do?



        That     Japan does not feel responsible for the trade
imbalance and     resents   U.S. pressure to help alleviate it seems to

suggest    it will do little       more than pay lip service to U.S.

demands for active involvement in reducing the trade imbalance.

Such a conclusion, however, is inaccurate. It is inaccurate for

the simple reason that Japan has too much to lose by failing to

cooperate with the U.S.         Strong protectionist measures by the

U.S. would be disastrous for the Japanese economy, and Japan

would much sooner cooperate, albeit grudgingly, than deal with

U.S. protectionism. There are a variety of measures Japan might

take to alleviate the trade imbalance, and we turn now               to an
examination of these possibilities.

     Exchange Rate Realignment

     Exchange rate realignment has already taken place on a
grand scale, with the yen appreciating from a low of

2140 U$ in September, 1985          to   about 160   L'$ by   July, 1986.



                                    21
Altriouh the conventional wisdom holds that yen appreciation

alone will not resolve the U.S.—Japan trade imbalance, the U.S.

must recognize that the yen appreciation which has already

occurred has had a substantial and negative impact on the

Japanese economy.         Estimates indicate that Japan's export—

oriented industries will sustain a 30% drop in profits in fiscal
             15
year 1986.

     Indeed, yen appreciation has already made itself felt at the

macroeconomic level.       Japan's seasonally—adjusted GNP dropped by

0.5 percent in real terms in the first quarter of 1986. This was

the first such drop in Japan's GNP since 1975.        In light of the

adverse effects of yen appreciation, Japan is most reluctant to

allow the yen to appreciate further, and in fact has taken active
                                                        16
steps to prevent a further rise in the yen.                  That yen
appreciation appears to have had little effect over the short run
                                   17
in reducing the trade imbalance         will probably not induce Japan

to embark on further efforts to strengthen the yen.           Exchange

rates are about as realigned as they are going to get.


     Domestic Demand Expansion


     This is the most potent and controversial measure Japan can

take to alleviate the trade imbalance.         In spite of its great

promise, domestic demand expansion will proceed more slowly than

did exchange rate realignment. Japan is concerned about possible

adverse effects of' fiscal stimulus, and is likely to implement

substantial       fiscal stimulus only if U.S. pressure to do so
increases.

    Japan's reluctance to implement domestic demand expansion


                                  22
 results fro: several factors. First, there is the problem of the

 "greying'     c Japa —       the ever—increasing number of Japanese who
 must be supported by social security.                To support their retirees


           .many    in Japan deem vital the present buildup of
        foreign assets through the current account surplus.18

        Second,      there    is concern that fiscal stimulus               will

 substantially increase government deficits.                 It is also feared
 that  such deficits will limit policymakers' ability to set
 interest rates and will ultimately be inflationary. Another
concern is that, given Japan's low propensity to import, fiscal
stimulus will have little effect on imports and will not
substantially improve the trade imbalance.


        Upon closer inspection, however,                these arguments are not

compelling.         Relying on a current account surplus to support

retirees amounts to Japan's supporting its retirees at the
expense of other nations. To the international trading community

this is hardly a good reason for Japan to continue                   running a
current account surplus.

        Inflationary fears in the wake of a moderate government

deficit in Japan seem groundless, precisely because domestic

demand is relatively low while saving is relatively high.                   The

argument     that government deficits may decrease policymakers'
ability      to set interest rates will not be received
sympathetically         by   Japan's        trading     partners.    This    is
particularly       true of the U.S., which has been pressuring Japan to

liberalize its capital markets for years.                Finally, concern that



                                       23
fiscal stimulus will be ineffective in reducing the trade

imbalance simply because it may          fail to increase imports

conveniently ignores other potentially beneficial effects of

fiscal      stimulus,   such as increasing domestic demand        for

manufactured goods which are typically exported, or increasing

the demand for services.

        Generally speaking, there is some agreement as to the value

of domestic demand expansion in a broad, abstract sense.        There

are considerable differences, however, as to how such stimulus

might best be implemented. Given Japan's high saving rate (which

is largely due to high personal saving) and low personal

consumption, an ideal policy would be one directly aimed at

reducing saving and increasing personal consumption.       Government

could help achieve this goal by removing the tax exempt status of'

personal saving and by reforming tax and finance policies to

promote housing investment and demand.

        Furthermore, there can be little doubt that shorter working

hours      would significantly expand demand in      the     services

industries.     This is so because (1) Japanese work much longer

hours than do their counterparts in other industrialized nations

(see Table 9) and (2) while many Japanese have already acquired

manufactured goods, there seems to be strong pent—up demand for

servies.

        Figure 3 shows the dramatic rise in Japan's consumption of'

durable goods in the past fifteen to tenty years.     Today, nearly

all households in Japan own washing machines, vacuum cleaners and

color TV sets. Sizable proportions own stereos and automobiles as

well.


                                 24
       3y contrast,       consumption of services seems to have lagged

behind.      This   pattern     does not, however, reflect consumer apathy
                                                                                      19
toward     services.      Indecd, 198t public opinion survey data

indicates that         Japanese gave top priority to enjoying their
leisure activities.             This rated ahead of'                housing, which had
received top    priority    each time the public opinion survey had been

conducted prior to 198i. By contrast:


      ...'durable goods' and 'clothing', for which most
      families have already attained satisfaction to a
      level, (did) not play important roles in planning or
      wishes concerning future living.20


It   is also interesting to        note that, from 1970 to 198'4, the share

of   consumption expenditures devoted to reading and recreation
                                                                         21
activities actually decreased from 9.2% to 8.7%.                              The overall
impression     is that potential       demand in            the     services industry —
particularly     recreation—related servies —                       is a major untapped
source    of economic growth.

     It will not be easy to translate potential             demand for

services into actual demand, however. 1ajor Japanese firms and

their subcontractors have already suffered from yen appreciation,

and they are hardly likely to respond to this setback by asking

their employees to work shorter hours. Another unhappy result of

Japan's sluggish industrial sector is that wage hikes will
                         22
continue to be low,           which will also adversely effect    demand

for services.       Additionally, substantial increases in the demand

for services will require a shift in industrial structure from

manufacturing industries to service industries.         Some industries

will surely suffer from such restructuring, and they will
naturally resist.

     From a society—wide perspective,            increased demand for

services and a corresponding industrial restructuring would be

desirable, for it would improve the quality of life and induce

structural changes which would make Japan less dependent on

exports   for   economic growth. Furthermore, since services tend to

be consumed frequently relative to manufactured goods, once
domestic demand for services has been firmly entrenched and
industry restructured to accomodate it, domestic demand for
services could provide a boost to the Japanese economy for a long
period of time.      In the absence of strong governmental actions,
such as regulations on length of the week and incentives for
expansion in the services industries, however, this type of
domestic demand expansion will probably not occur.               Sc far,

                                    26
 policmkers have shown little inclination to provide a strong

 stiv1s to domestic demand for services.

        Domestic demand stimulants, such as a shorter work week and

 elimjnatjon of tax exempt status from personal savings, could

 also increase the demand for manufactured goods. This would help

 divert some Japanese exports to domestic markets.            Furthermore,

 those government initiatives specifically aimed at                increasing

domestic demand for manufactured goods (as opposed to services)

may be more politically feasible to implement, since industrial

restructuring requirements to meet higher domestic demand for

manufactured goods would probably be lower. Unfortunately, Japan

does not appear inclined to take the initiative in expanding

demand by these means, either.

        Another way to expand domestic demand is by increasing

public expenditures.       Here Japan has shown some progress.           For

example, the government is committed to implementing increases in

construction     bonds     to     finance     improvements    in     Japan's

infrastructure, though Prime Minister Nakasone has stressed that
                                              23
such increases       should be kept to a minimum.            As Table 10
indicates,    both government       deficits and bond issues have been

trending steadily downward relative to GNP since 1979. Thus,
there   appears to be a good deal of       room for this type of dc*nestic

demand    stimulus    without inviting adverse consequences. Such
expansion    will indirectly     reduce   the trade surplus by reducing
aggregate saving     in Japan,   thereby decreasing capital outflow and

                            The direct                         effects of this type of expansion on Japan's

        trade surplus are less clear.                                                                    Will an increase in public

        spending to improve Japan's infrastructure increase Japan's

        imports? Possibly, but probably not enough to significantly

        affect the Japan—U.S. trade imbalance.                                                                              While Japan imports a

        substantial amount of the raw materials needed for construction

        from the U.S. (see Table 7), this figure pales in comparison to

        Japan's exports to the U.S. (see Table 8). It is equally unclear

        that                  increased                          expenditures on public                                          construction                           will

        appreciably divert Japanese exports to the U.S.—Japan exports

        manufactured goods to the U.S., not lumber and cement.

                            friother drawback to this type of demand stimulus is that it

        can only last over a short to midterm horizon.                                                                                   Government can

        only incur so much debt before the public will call for

        austerity.                            Precisely because the effects of this type of

        domestic demand stimulus are only temporary, it is not likely to

        induce an appreciable change in Japan's industrial structure away



                                                                                          28
from expert    or -atioi.
     ALt.      t. best. th can be        said for this type of domestic
dei      expansion is that it may help Japan to            weather the
damaing     effects of yen e;preciation on her export sector without

sliding into a    recession.


     Alternative Possibilities


     Aside from exchange rate realignment and domestic demand

stimulus,     there is   the possibility of improving the bilateral

tade   deficit between Japan and the U.S. by diverting some
Japarese exports to developing countries rather than to the U.S.
market. The import capa :ity of these        developing countries would
be   enhanced by directing the Japanese saving surplus to finance

the deficits of developing countries.         Such a proposal was made

in a report by a study group of the World Institute for
                                                             214

Development    Economics Research (WIDER), in April, 1986.

     While creative and        novel, this appears nonetheless to be a
plan whose time has not yet come.              When the economies of

developing    nations are sufficiently mature to    provide markets and

investment opportunities that are reasonable substitutes for

those available in the U.S., then one can meaningfully speak of

resolving U.S.—Japan trade imbalances by diverting                 Japan's

exports and capital outflow to places other than the U.S.

     For the next several years at least, it is most unlikely

that developing countries will be able to absorb Japanese exports

on a scale large enough to significantly reduce the Japan—U.S.

trade   imbalance. Looking back at Table 8,       we see that the value



                                    29
  oi Japan's cxporL to th U.S. are more than twice        the   value of
  Japan's   exports to its next four largest markets combined. It is

 also unclear why      capital   should suddenly flow from Japan to
 developing countries when the current flow from Japan to the U.S.

 indicates that better investment opportunities exist in the U.S.

        Speaking of capital outflows,         another alternative for

 reducing the U.S.—Japan trade imbalance is simply to restrict

 capital outflows from Japan. To the extent that such outflows

 tend to depreciate the yen, their elimination should decrease the

 U.S. trade deficit.      This solution, however, is at odds with

 long—standing U.S. efforts to deregulate and liberalize Japan's

 capital markets.      It could also lead to substantially higher

 interest rates in the U.S., and even a recession.        This policy
 would be so negatively received in the U.S. that it is            most

 unlikely to be implemented. Even if this were not the case, Japan

 appears unwilling to undertake actions which might further

appreciate the yen, as noted above.

       Exchange rate real igninent and domestic demand stimulus

emerge as the two options Japan may resort to in redressing the

trade imbalance. Since exchange rate realignment has apparently

been implemented to the extent feasible, however, fiscal stimulus

to expand Japan's domestic demand looms as the lone viable option

for Japan to help further reduce the trade imbalance.

       There is every reason to believe that such a policy can

succeed. That Japan must depend on exports for growth is a myth.

As Table ii indicates, only over 1980—19814 did exports account

for a substantial proportion of Japan's overall growth in real

GNP.    There is no reason why   the   pattern in earlier years, when


                                  30
real CThJP growth was driven domestically, cannot be repeated in

the future.

     Despite its seeming promise, strong fiscal stimulus remains

an option     that   Japan will resort to only if sufficiently

pressured by the US. Whether such U.S. pressure arises depends,

in turn, on the success of U.S. policy initiatives like Gramm—

Rudman in reducing government spending and, ultimately, the trade

imbalance.

V.   Conclusion: Implications for the Trade Imbalance and
     Trade Friction


     The U.S.           is hell—bent on reducing its trade deficit with

Japan.      This will be accomplished, one way or another.                  The most

benign scenario would be that the policy initiatives of Gramm—Rudman

are spectacularly successful in reducing the U.S. trade deficit, so

that the trade imbalance is resolved without further                   U.S. pressure
on Japan.

     On the other hand,              if' Gramm—Rudman fails to significantly

reduce the trade imbalance, protectionist sentiment will flare up

in the U.S.            Even when Gramm—Rudman was in its early stages of

promise, Congress demonstrated its willingness to consider strong

protectionist legislature when the House of Representatives

passed a bill calling for a variety of protectionist measures

including some new definitions of unfair trade practices.                    One

can only conclude that protectionist sentiments will be much


                                              32
stronger should Granrn—Rudman fail.
        If'   Graum—Rudman fails, Japan will   respond to mounting U.S.
pressure      by playing its last card—substantial fiscal stimulus.

Most likely, this stimulus will first come in the form of greater

efforts to expand public works.

        Tax cuts, removal of the tax exempt status of personal

saving and the like may follow if' the public works expansion

fails to abate mounting U.S. protectionist sentiment.             Under

either scenario, the trade imbalance will be substantially

reduced.

        More ominous, however, are the implications for trade

friction.       It is probably true that, other things remaining the

same, a decline in a trade imbalance results in a decline in

trade friction.        But, in reducing the large trade imbalance

between Japan and the U.S., "other things", such as mutual trust

and respect and a sense of international economic cooperation,

may fall by the wayside. It is even conceivable that, in reducing

the trade imbalance, Japan and the U.S. will intensify their

trade friction.

        Many of the factors which could induce this unhappy result

are already present. On the one hand, we see the U.S. pressuring

Japan to open its goods and capital markets while at the same

time threatening Japan with increased protectionist measures.

While   this may be an expedient way to reduce the trade imbalance,
it is glaringly hyprocritical and hardly conducive to mutual
trust and respect.
      For its part, Japan seems too slow to realize that:


                                  33
        If one country's economic performance moves against
        the interest of the world economy, that country will
        be   asked to   change course.25


 Rather      than aocepting small trade surpluses as an exogenous
political constraint in formulating domestic policy, Japan
decides domestic policy as it sees fit, making significant

changes      only -ien countervailing actions by its trading partners

 seem imminent.

        Exacerbating these basic problems is the fact that                yen

appreciation has apparently not been a strong force in reducing the

trade imbalance. Masaya Miyoshi of the Keidanren (Japan's Federation

of    Economic Organizations) has remarked that

             the
               United States attaches importance to the
       results (while) Japan ... places importance on
       good intention more that anything else.26

If there is some truth to Miyoshi's observation, the salient

effect    of exchange rate realignment might lie, not in decreasing
the trade imbalance, but in increasing trade friction.

       In fact, aside from harming Japan's export sector directly, it

is becoming increasingly clear that the strong       yen   is prompting many

3apanese comPanies)Particularly those in the critical automotive and

electronics industries) to establish plants at locationS abroad,

including the U.S.          From the standpoint of economic theory, these

responses result from firms' desire to maintain international

competitiveness.         From the perspective of     the average rker,
however, this means fewer jobs.            Hence, the popular terms for
relocation of'     Japanese   plants abroad are "deindustrialization" and
the    "hollowing out"       of Japanese industry.   To    the   extent that


                                     314
relocation is viewed as "hollowing out," it is likely to increase
                                              28
friction       between Japan and the   U.S.

        Likemany trading partners, however, Japan and the U.S. have
been    conducting business under less than ideal circumstances for
a      number    of years,      and will likely continue to do so.
Interestingly, the very fact that there remains much roan for
improvement      in cooperative   efforts and      freeing of markets between

the two nations helps prevent trade friction fran really getting

out of hand.        As long as trade imbalances and trade friction can

be blamed on relatively benign factors like policy coordination

failure,      closed markets and the like, the possibility of mutually
beneficial trade remains.          But imagine what might happen if the
U.S.,   for example, incurred substantial trade deficits with Japan

in a world where both countries behaved cooperatively, policies

were prefectly coordinated and all markets were open.              In such a

world, U.S. deficits would be seen as due to a pervasive lack of

competitiveness.       Trade friction on a scale we have not yet
observed      would ensue.

       This   does not imply that we should not seek to reduce the
trade      friction which is present today through policy
coordination,       open markets and the like. Nor does it imply that
substantial trade friction is inevitable.                We merely wish to
point   out that, while Japan and the U.S. should work together to

achieve better coordinated macroeconomic policies and more open

markets, each country must remain acutely aware that maintaining

the     international competitiveness of its industries is                 a

fundamental        ingredient     in healthy        trade   relations.    If




                                       35
international competitiveness is not maintained,   very serious
trade friction will emerge.

17. The standard explanation for this pattern is
     the so—called "J—Curve" effect. According to this
     theory, foreign goods ordered before a plunge
     in the value of the domestic currency but paid for
     after the drop in that currency increase the cost
     of imports, temporarily increasing that country's
     trade deficit. This has surely been part of the
     reason why yen appreciation did not reduce the
     Japan—U.S. trade imbalance in the first half of
     1986. Eventually, however, yen appreciation
     should bring some improvement in the Japan—
     U.S.trade imbalance. How much improvement depends
     upon factors such as Japanese firms' determination
     to maintain export market shares by avoiding price
     increases. Another important factor is that,
     while the dollar has depreciated substantially
     against the yen, the dollar's trade weighted
     decline against 25 currences dropped by only 5
     from September 1985 — July 1986 (see Business
     Week, July 28, 1986). Thus, even if yen
     appreciation eventually improves the Japan—U.S.
     trade imbalance, the U.S. may remain in deficit
     vis—a—vis other trading partners.

     Economic Journal, June 7, 1986, p. 14

     This article indicates that, for all industries other than
     the information sector, wage hikes in 1986 were lower than
     in 1985. This pattern was attributed to the hardship wrought
     by yen appreciation.

27. For example, a recent survey of 63 presidents of major
     Japanese companies indicated that approximately 80% of them
    believed   that

    ...there will be a hollowing—out of the nations's manufacturing
    industry as a result of the shift to overseas production....
    ("Corporate Heads See Hollowing—Out of Industry Due   to hift
    Overseas," Japan Economic Journal, June 7, 1986, p.1).

    In addition, the leading candidates cited for such hollowing
    out were the automotive and electronics industries.

28. An additional factor driving Japanese firms to loeate abroad,
     particularly in the U.S., is the threat of U.S. protectionist
     measures. As an example, a recent article in the JaDan
     Economic Journal describes Toshiba's decision to produce VCRs
    in the U.S.

         Only a year ago, most producers were cautious about making
         VCRs   in the U.S.,     citing difficulty in     procuring
         components locally. Political considerations, arising
         from increasing bilateral trade friciton, however, have
         prompted them to enter into local production ventures
         that are apparently costlier than in Japan
         ("Toshiba   to Start Making VCRs in U.S.         Following
         Hitachi," Japan Economic Journal, August 16, 1986, p. 13).
