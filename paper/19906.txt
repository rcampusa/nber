                                              ABSTRACT

Occupational licensing laws have been relaxed in a large number of U.S. states to give nurse practitioners
the ability to perform more tasks without the supervision of medical doctors. We investigate how these
regulations may affect wages, employment, costs, and quality of providing certain types of medical
services. We find that when only physicians are allowed to prescribe controlled substances that this
is associated with a reduction in nurse practitioner wages, and increases in physician wages suggesting
some substitution among these occupations. Furthermore, our estimates show that prescription restrictions
lead to a reduction in hours worked by nurse practitioners and are associated with increases in physician
hours worked. Our analysis of insurance claims data shows that the more rigid regulations increase
the price of a well-child medical exam by 3 to 16 %. However, our analysis finds no evidence that
the changes in regulatory policy are reflected in outcomes such as infant mortality rates or malpractice
premiums. Overall, our results suggest that these more restrictive state licensing practices are associated
with changes in wages and employment patterns, and also increase the costs of routine medical care,
but do not seem to influence health care quality.

Introduction

       Occupational licensing is among the fastest-growing labor market institutions in the U.S.

economy. Estimates developed by Kleiner and Krueger (2013) show that the proportion of all

workers covered by occupational regulations grew from about 5 percent in the early 1950s to

almost 29 percent in 2008. Licensing also can be a restriction on the type of labor that can be

used in the production of a good or service. In some situations, members of more than one

licensed occupation may be capable of producing a particular good or service. Under a standard

licensing procedure, the government determines which of the occupational groups will be

permitted to do certain work-related tasks (Friedman and Kuznets, 1945, Friedman, 1962). The

broad growth of occupational regulations over the past 60 years has created some situations in

which licensing regulations created overlaps in the legally sanctioned tasks performed by

occupational groups and in these situations occupations may compete for the same kind of work.

       Recent analysis of occupational licensing has shown the influence of licensing when

regulations are introduced or become more stringent (Cox and Foster, 1990; Kleiner and Todd,

2009; Cathles, Harrington, and Krynski, 2010). The objective of this study is to show the

influence of occupational licensing on wages, employment, and prices when regulations are

changed in ways that alter the boundaries and shared work space between two occupations.

Economic theory implies that changes in occupational boundaries and tasks may influence wages

and prices, but the specific outcomes of such regulations are not well understood. The health

sector is particularly subject to occupational regulations. The core health occupations (e.g.,

physicians, nurses, and dentists) are universally licensed, and over 76 percent of non-physician

health workers also work in licensed occupations (Kleiner and Park, 2010). Occupational

regulations in the health sector go beyond the conventional licensing restrictions that form the



                                                 2
basis of most microeconomic models of occupational regulations. In addition to licensure, it is

common for regulations to limit the scope of practice of particular occupational groups, and

require a formal supervisory relationship between members of two different occupational groups.

A model using a basic production function with regulation suggests that licensing provisions

could lead to health service markets with higher wages, higher service prices, and a less diverse

range of options for receiving a particular service. These effects could reduce access to health

services among some segments of the population. The effects of occupational regulations are

particularly salient in the health sector: in 2009 the health sector accounted for about 18 percent

of U.S. GDP, and expenditures on provider services represented about 21 percent of total

expenditures on health services (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2010). If

regulations have even small effects on wages and prices, then the aggregate cost of the

regulations could be large in an absolute dollar amount.

       In the health sector, it is not uncommon for two or more occupational groups to consist of

members with an overlapping set of skills and productive capacities. In some cases, it is natural

to think of pairs of occupational groups in which one group is trained to perform a subset of the

services that also may also be performed by another more highly trained group. Dentists and

dental hygienists, for example, may have this relationship. But the subset analogy breaks down

in other cases. Medical doctors (MDs) with different sub-specializations may have overlapping

competencies without one group possessing a skill set that encompasses the skill set of the other

group. The situation is even more complex when there is variation in the context of service

provision that is important to consumers. Advanced practice nurses (i.e., nurse practitioners

(NPs), physician assistants (PAs), midwives, and nurse anesthesiologists (NAs)) may provide

services that are very similar to those provided by MDs, but with a greater emphasis on factors



                                                 3
such as convenience, personal attention, or specialization that are important to some patients.

Under these conditions, members of different occupational groups may operate as both

substitutes and complements in markets for a particular service. Government regulations that

limit the independence and scope of practice of these alternative health providers may cause

economic harm by limiting the ability of the market to provide a flexible array of health service

options which could lead to a misallocation of resources. On the other hand, regulations may

reduce uncertainty about quality and effort in the eyes of the consumer (Arrow, 1963; Leland,

1979; Shapiro, 1986).

       In this study, we analyze the influence of regulations that apply to NPs. NPs are

registered nurses (RNs) who have acquired more advanced education and clinical training than is

required by standard nursing licensing regulations. The typical NP receives additional training

through a master’s or PhD degree program (Harper and Johnson, 1998; Dueker et al., 2005).

Such programs train NPs to diagnose and treat common illnesses and injuries, manage chronic

illnesses, prescribe medications, and provide counseling. In most states, voluntary certification

programs are in place and NPs do not require an additional license beyond the RN designation.

Across different situations, the services of an NP may function as both a complement and a

substitute for the services of other medical professionals such as RNs and MDs. NPs face a

variety of occupational regulations that have varied across states and over time. Three important

regulations for NPs are those that involve limitations on prescription authority, independent

practice, and independent reimbursement.

       Our empirical work shows that occupational regulations that require NPs to be supervised

by MDs when prescribing controlled substances reduce NP wages by about 14 percent and

increase physician wages by about 7 percent. We also find that prescription restrictions lead to a



                                                 4
reduction in hours worked by NPs of between 6 to 14 percent per year. Depending on the

empirical model used in the estimation, the regulations are also associated with increases in

physician hours worked of between 6 to 9 percent. Our analysis of insurance claims data shows

that the regulations increase the price of a well- child medical exam by 3 to 16 percent. In

contrast, we find no evidence that the changes in regulatory policy are reflected in infant

mortality rates or malpractice premiums. Overall, our results suggest that more restrictive state

licensing practices increase the costs of medical care, change wages and employment patterns,

and do not appear to influence health care quality as measured by changes in the infant mortality

rate and in malpractice insurance premiums. In the rest of the paper we detail how we developed

these results.

Medical Doctor and Nursing Licensure

        The first physician licensing laws were passed in the 1870s by the states in order to stem

what was viewed by physicians as uncontrolled access to the market. By 1881, half of the states

had physician licensure. However, enforcement became more serious in the 1890s (Baker,

1984). Unlicensed medical practice was to be punished by fine or imprisonment. The

publication of the Flexner report in 1910, sponsored by the American Medical Association

(AMA), eventually led to AMA control of medical education and regulation of physicians and

auxiliary workers. The main consequence of the rise of physician licensing is that MDs were

required to pass additional exams after graduation from medical school in order to practice

medicine. Relevant to our study, a large part of the restrictions for other health related

occupations was that physicians also control what non-physicians can do to deliver medical

services under state law or administrative rules established by state administrative boards.




                                                  5
         In contrast, nursing licensure developed initially as certification or titling regulations

imposed by state governments. By 1923, all of the then 48 states had legislation that required

nurses to hold certain qualifications in order to use the title of nurse (Comer, 2007). New York

enacted the first mandatory licensure legislation for nurses in 1947. Currently, all states require

that nurses be licensed. The terms “registered nurse” and “licensed practical (vocational) nurse”

are now legally protected titles. One must pass a pass a licensing examination and meet the

requirements set by each state in order to practice as a nurse in that state (Eberly and Rooney,

2012).

      NPs receive training to provide a range of health services, including the diagnosis and

treatment of common acute and chronic conditions, the prescription of treatments including

medication and medical devices, and the counseling and education of patients (ONet, 2013). The

first nurse practitioner graduate program opened at the University of Colorado in 1965. There

are about 325 NP programs offered at universities across the United States, and there are about

140,000 practicing NPs (Comer, 2006). Currently, there are no additional licensure requirements

for NPs. National and state-level certification regimes are in place, and the American Academy

of Nurse Practitioners estimates that 97 percent of practicing NPs maintain a national

certification (Comer, 2007). Although licensure beyond the RN designation is not required, state

governments regulate the activities of NPs in a variety of other ways by restricting which

occupations may prescribe medication, receive direct reimbursement for services by public and

private health insurers, and by requiring formal supervision relationships between NPs and

physicians in certain types of practice environments.

         In this paper we focus on regulations that affect the ability of NPs to practice

independently and to provide a flexible array of health services to their clients. We mainly work



                                                    6
with regulations that limit the ability of NPs to prescribe medications that are controlled

substances, and with regulations that limit the ability of NPs to practice without the supervision

of a medical doctor.

Policy Assessments of Nurse Practitioner Regulations

       Several states have changed their laws during the period of our analysis to allow a greater

number of tasks and more sophisticated tasks by NPs. It, however, can be difficult to assess the

practical consequences of specific regulatory changes. That is, some restrictions do not affect

the daily practice of an NP and so it is likely nonbinding because of the regulations. In contrast,

other restrictions might have greater consequences for NPs if the restrictions make NPs a less

desirable option for consumers or employers.

       There are regulatory differences across states that lead to meaningful differences in the

way that NPs do their jobs and interact with patients and other health professionals. For

example, NPs who live on the border of Illinois and Missouri find that they are allowed to

perform more tasks in Illinois than Missouri. One illustration is provided in the following

comments:

       As an advanced nurse practitioner with offices in Illinois and Missouri, I have a unique
       perspective. … Treatment for bronchitis can include cough syrup with codeine, and
       back pain may require a pain medication. In Illinois, after examination and diagnosis, I
       can write prescriptions (for drugs such as cough syrup with codeine.) In Missouri, I need
       to delay the patient and interrupt the physician to have him prescribe the medications.
       This creates unnecessary delays and may require extra trips for the patient. (McQuaide,
       2007)


Physicians have generally opposed broadening the scope of tasks that NPs are allowed to

perform. The following comments reflect some of issues surrounding the debate on relaxing MD

control of prescription benefits. For example, the Missouri State Medical Association was




                                                 7
largely opposed to providing NPs with the ability to prescribe controlled substances. It

supported alternatives in which NPs had only partial or short-term prescription rights:

       The medical association wants limits on how much nurse practitioners could prescribe
       capping the amount of medicine to enough for three to five days, for example, just to fill
       an immediate need before the patient could see a physician (Lieb, 2008).


This policy stance may be problematic in several ways. One concern involves the public health

implications of emerging resistance to antibiotic medications. The obvious risk under a

regulation that forces NPs to prescribe only small doses of antibiotics is that patients who see an

NP for convenience reasons may be likely to forgo a second follow-up visit to an MD. The

chances that they complete a partial dose of antibiotics are high. Besides the public health

concern, the two-visit approach would seem to substantially diminish any efficiency gains from

granting more authority to NPs. Regardless of the policy recommendations, the Missouri State

Medical Association considers NPs to be competition for MDs because at least some patients

would substitute NP visits for MD visits.

       Doctors’ advocacy groups are lobbying state politicians to preserve laws requiring MD

supervision for NPs. For example, in a recent review in the popular press, Elizabeth Dears, a

senior vice president for the Medical Society of the State of New York said in testimony to

lawmakers that removing doctor oversight of NPs “would seriously endanger the patients for

whom they care (Pettypiece, 2013)”.

Prior Analysis of Occupational Regulations in the Health Sector

       Earlier studies have identified the issue of potential complementarity and substitution of

regulated occupations that provide similar services. When occupations are complementary,

members of an incumbent occupation may have incentives to allow more individuals into the

competing occupation. For example, when a patient first visits a nurse and is referred to a


                                                 8
medical doctor, the two occupations are complements in the production of service functions

(Persico, 2011). For simple procedures, however, doctors and nurses also can be substitutes if

the nurse provides the service in place of a doctor. For example, Kleiner and Park (2010) show

that occupational regulations that apply to dentists and dental hygienists affect the earnings of

both occupational groups. In addition, Marier and Wing (2011) find that these regulations also

influence the prevailing prices for basic dental services, with prices being lower in states that

allowed hygienists to have greater autonomy. In these occupational substitution scenarios, there

may be fewer incentives for incumbent occupations to support expansion in the other occupation.

These simple assessments of self-interested lobbying can change if people act as both members

of an occupation and owners of firms that may employ both types of workers. It seems plausible

that owners of dental firms would find occupational regulations that distort their labor input

allocation decisions to be a burden rather than a benefit.

       More recently, studies in other medical specialties such as occupational therapy and

physical therapy have shown the importance of laws and administrative procedures for the

employment and earnings of each of the occupations, given that they are also both complements

and substitutes in service delivery (Cai and Kleiner, 2013). Furthermore, in his examination of

the impact of the scope of practice laws for RNs and PAs on consumers, Stange (2011) focuses

on the changes in access, costs, and patterns of care and utilization for a broad population-based

sample. Our study develops an analysis that is distinct from the one by developed by Stange

(2011). Specifically, we study how the regulations affect the wages and employment of NPs

and MDs, and prevailing prices for child well care visits, which is a homogenous health service.

This narrower focus makes it easier for us to separate the regulatory price effects from general

variations in prices of medical services.



                                                  9
A Basic Model of Medical Services Production with Regulation

       The model uses a framework where the work of one occupation cannot legally be done

without the inputs of the other occupation. The focus of the model serves as a basis to inform the

empirical work, rather than as a fully specified general equilibrium model of medical production

under regulation. The model uses a modified standard production function:

       Qp = HH = f(P(z),K)                                            (1)

       Qn = HL = f(P(z), N(z),K),                                     (2)

where Qp is the output produced by the physician, which we will refer to as “high skilled patient

services (HH).” Qn is the output produced by the nurse, which we will refer to as “low skilled

patient services (HL).” P(z) represents the physicians’ labor, recognizing that output relies on

their decision of personal input and N(z) represents the nurse’s labor, recognizing that output

relies on their decision of personal input. K represents the quantities of capital inputs used in a

medical practice (Reinhardt, 1972).

       An explanation of the theory with licensing can be written as follows for MDs:

                                                                      (3)

where HH is the high-skilled physician services (p) provided, A is the technology provided to

produce HH, L is the labor input, and K is capital.

       Similarly, the output for nurses can be given by the following expression:

                       ,                                              (4)

where HL is the relatively lower-skilled services provided by practical nurses (n) and B is the

technology provided to produce HL.

       By law, however, the technology needed to produce HL for nurses is tied to supervision

by the physician. This expression can be written as follows:


                                                 10
                    .                                                             (5)

Therefore, the production function for nurses can be written as follows:

                                 ,                                                (6)

where in the case of Lp= 0 (i.e., where no nursing services are offered) under regulation, there is

no production of nursing services. In our specifications the inclusion of technology coefficients

in the model accounts for total factor productivity for both high and low skilled labor within the

production function (Jerzmanowski, 2007)

We also assume that Lp+ Ln=1. Therefore,                    and           .

         The profit function for medical services can be written as

         ρBLγnKδn– wnLn– rnKn                                                     (7)

         PpA LαpKβp+(1-ρ)        Lp) LγnKδn– wpLp– rpKp,                          (8)

where ρ=1 is the case of no regulation and                    1, and P is the price of the service.

         The functional relationship shown in (7) is a profit function for the practical nurses if the

price of the service is normalized as 1. Similarly, the functional relationship shown in (8) is a

profit function for physicians, where w1L1 is the cost of labor and r1K1 is the cost of capital, and

1=p,n. Within this profit function, the nurse’s wage is determined by the decisions of the doctor

to use the nurse’s labor input and technology mix by the high-skilled provider, HH, and is

exogenous. As the nurse’s wage goes down, the physician’s wage will go up in the model.1

However, if the nurses take on lower-skilled work, then physicians can work on higher-skilled

and larger value-added tasks, resulting in higher earnings for them as well. In this sense, the

skills of the nurse and those of the physician are complementary. Assuming that the skills of the

αLα-1pKβp+ (1-ρ) LγnKδn– wp= 0 and PaAβ LαpKβ-1p– rp= 0. It implies that the nurse’s wage will go down and the
physicians wage will go up (Varian, 1992). If physicians see nurses’ work as a source of revenue for low-priced
services, that will allow physicians to do more high-skilled tasks and enhance their earnings.

                                                         11
nurse and the physician are the same for low-skilled tasks, the physician can allocate low-skilled

tasks to the nurse and take on higher productivity and value-added tasks.

       Nevertheless, within this profit function, the nurse’s wage is tied to the decisions of the

physician to use the nurse's labor input and technology mix to the high-skilled provider, HH.

Regulation acts as a shifter of both the supply and demand curves. However, within the model,

nurses can either raise their own earnings and those of physicians or raise their earnings at the

expense of physicians. Physicians, who are generally in control of the production of these

services, can allocate relatively low-skilled work, such as well child exams to NPs while taking

on higher-skilled and value-added services such as caring for sick or injured children and thereby

maximize rents for them as well as the NPs. These issues are empirical questions that the rest of

the paper examines in addition to the influence of regulation on prices and quality of care.

Empirical Framework

       We pursue a quasi-experimental approach to analyzing how NP occupational regulations

affect the wages, employment levels, and service prices that prevail in the health services market.

In the empirical analysis, states adopt one of three forms of NP prescription authority regulation:

light regulation in which NPs are allowed to independently prescribe controlled substances,

moderate regulation in which NPs are allowed to prescribe controlled substances if they have a

supervisory relationship with an MD, and heavy regulation in which NPs are not allowed to

prescribe controlled substances. Let         represent the average wage, employment, or service

price outcome that would prevail in state at time if the state has adopted the light regulation.

        and          are the outcomes that would prevail if moderate or heavy regulations had




                                                 12
been adopted in the same state and year. In other words,                                                measure state

    year outcomes under light, moderate, and heavy NP regulations2.

         We estimate the standard generalized difference-in-differences regression models of the

following form                                                         and interpret the estimated regulatory

effects as averages of market specific effects. Depending on the outcome variable and the

available data, we augment the standard framework by adding time varying covariates to

improve statistical precision and further adjust for confounding variables. We also present a

series of sub-analyses that are intended to assess the sensitivity and robustness of the main

results to the most likely sources of potential bias.

The Data

Measures of Licensing Requirements

         We collected information on state statutes regulating nurses from the Nurse

Practitioner’s annual legislative updates for 1999–2010 (Nurse Practitioner, 1999–2010). While

the occupational regulations take a variety of forms, such as restrictions on title protection,

governing board structure, and scope of practice, we focused on the statutes regarding the

authority to prescribe medications. Regulations that require a licensed MD to supervise the

prescription activities of an NP, and permit an NP to prescribe medications including or

excluding controlled substances are common ways in which states regulate the prescription

authority of NPs.

         We coded the regulation variables to emphasize the relative independence of prescription

authority granted to NPs in different states and time periods. two statutory categories :

  Classical linear additive fixed effects models proceed by assuming that the regulatory effects are constant across
markets so that                 and             . Wooldridge (2005) shows that the methods designed to estimate
these constant coefficients also produce valid estimates of the average of the distribution of unit specific coefficients
under the additional assumption that the heterogeneous treatment effects are mean independent of the mean
differenced regulation variables.

                                                           13
independent prescription authority and whether NPs could prescribe controlled substances. The

reference case for our estimates include – Independent Prescription Authority – which describes

a state and time period in which NPs are allowed to prescribe controlled medications

independent of any supervision by a physician. We then specify two regulated work tasks. In

the first case – Supervised/Delegated Prescription Authority — means that in a given state and

time period, an NP was allowed to prescribe controlled medications under the supervision of a

physician. In the second case – Limited Prescription Authority –are those cases in which

regulations allow an NP to prescribe medications excluding controlled substances under the

supervision of a physician.

       The appeal of an NP to consumers involves access to basic medical care at convenient

times and locations that are often difficult for traditional providers such as MDs to deliver. For

example, NPs often work in retail-based clinics, walk-in clinics, and other convenience-oriented

environments, but MDs generally do not. Thus, licensing regulations that limit the flexibility of

NPs by making it more costly for NPs to practice independently and to provide common

treatments that often involve controlled medications are likely to either reduce the availability of

NPs to consumers or make NPs a less attractive option despite their availability, convenience,

and lower wages.

       The trend in the United States over the last 10 years has been toward greater autonomy

for NPs. In Figure 1 we show how prescription authority regulations that apply to NPs have

changed over time. The figure shows that in 2000, nine states did not allow NPs to prescribe

controlled medications of any kind, but only two states did not by 2011. Similarly, the figure

shows in the top line a slight growth in the number of states that allow NPs to independently

prescribe controlled substances without the supervision of a licensed MD. Figure 1 shows that



                                                 14
NPs have been gaining greater autonomy in providing services to patients. The middle line

shows that some of the largest changes in regulations come from the growth of regulations in

which NPs are allowed to prescribe controlled medications, but are required to be supervised by

a licensed MD. The regulations shown by the middle line in the figure can be seen as an

intermediate step or partial deregulation of the prescription authority environment.

       In Table 1 we show the states that changed their licensing requirements during the period

2000 through 2011. Eleven states relaxed their licensing requirements from 2000 to 2011 to

allow more tasks for NPs. There does not appear to be any significant regional bias to the

changers in both time periods that are shown in Table 1.

Labor Market Outcomes

       To examine the effects of the regulations on wages and employment levels we pooled

data from the 2002–2009 American Community Survey (ACS) to construct samples of NPs and

MDs. The ACS does not separately identify NPs, so we devised a sample selection method that

would capture practicing NPs. To create the sample, we started by limiting the sample to ACS

respondents with occupational codes that correspond to registered nurses. From this sample, we

retained only those nurses who held a master’s degree, a professional degree, or a Ph.D. After

imposing additional selection conditions based on the completeness of data on earnings, hours

worked, and some key covariates, we were left with an NP sample of 21,276 observations and

with a MD sample of 38,094 observations. Descriptive statistics from the ACS samples we used

are in Table 2. Hourly earnings average about $33.78 in 2002 dollars per hour for our sample of

NPs. This amount is about one-half the hourly earnings for physicians. The basic data in the

table show that about 90 percent of all NPs are women and that 7 percent are black. For state

regulation, the table shows that 66 percent of NPs are in states that allow for a supervised or



                                                 15
delegated prescription authority, and 27 percent of NPs are in states that grant both independence

and prescription authority. These legal provisions may allow nurses to complement or substitute

for physicians in providing basic services. Based on the results in the theory section, this would

result in costs going down if nurses are substitutes for physicians in providing services. If they

are complements, then nurses would handle lower-skilled tasks and the physicians would focus

on higher-skilled ones.

Medical Service Prices

        The NP regulations could influence the prevailing prices of health services by altering the

supply of health services and by changing the mix of providers available in the market for health

services. As discussed earlier, some health services may be provided by both an NP and a more

traditional provider such as an MD. The theory section shows that in many cases the services of

an NP can be viewed as both a substitute for and a complement to the services of an MD. Since

we do not expect the price effects to be very large in per-unit terms, we focus on a medical

service that is commonly provided, and which is often serviced by both MDs and NPs. We also

wanted to implement our analysis on a health service that was relatively standardized in delivery

so that we did not detect price differences that arose mainly because we were pooling

complicated and uncomplicated cases reflecting service heterogeneity across many different

services. After detailed consultations with colleagues in the School of Nursing at the University

of Rochester, we chose insurance claims for child well care exams because it met the criteria for

plausible test cases3. Child well care visits are widely consumed annually by millions of families

in the United States, they involve a standard set of tests and evaluations, and they are routinely

  We thank Irena Pesis-Katz at the University of Rochester School Of Nursing for helpful discussions about the
appropriate choice of a health service for analysis.

provided by both family practice physicians and NPs. These exams are a strong test for the role

of occupational regulations on the price of health services.

       Our analysis of prices is based on a large database of private insurance claims that is

maintained by FAIR Health, Inc., a non-profit organization that provides independent estimates

of the distribution of charges for health services across the United States. The claims database is

widely used by insurance companies and health care providers to better understand geographical

variation in the prices of health services. As discussed earlier, we extracted insurance claims

with Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes that are used to identify claims as well as

care visits for children. Specifically, we extracted claims with CPT codes 99381–99384 and

99391–99394. Each insurance claim contains information on the type of claim, the geographical

location of the office where the service was provided, the “billed charge” that was submitted by

the provider, and the “allowed amount” that the insurance company ultimately paid the provider

after allowing for negotiated discounts and the details of insurance plans. We analyze the

allowed amount because it is closest to the transaction price of the health services. Table 3

reports the sample sizes for each type of insurance claim in our analysis and also shows the mean,

median, and standard deviation of the allowed charge for each type of claim. There are almost

30 million total claims for these 8 health service categories over the period 2005–2010. The

table shows that the price of a well care visit increases somewhat with the age of the child and

those prices are higher for new patient visits than for established patient visits. In general, the

well care visits that are the focus of our paper cost about $80–$100 and have a standard deviation

across all claims of around $30.

       The FAIR Health database consists of individual insurance claims provided by a large set

of “contributing insurance companies” who operate in markets across the United States. Each



                                                  17
contributing company agrees to submit a complete and unadulterated data set of the insurance

claims it processed over a calendar year. The number of contributing companies varies

somewhat over time. The structure of the insurance industry in the United States means that

these companies may be affiliated with a larger parent company, and so it may not be reasonable

to think of each contributor as an independent company.

        Despite the large number of claims in the database, it is important to note that the claims

are not the result of a formal random sampling process. They are, instead, the product of the

decisions of individual health insurance firms to join the network of firms that contribute to the

data: these decisions may mean that contributing firms are different from non-contributing firms

in unknown ways. However, we think it is unlikely that firms select into the network of FAIR

Health contributors on the basis of the distribution of prices they pay for well care visits or that

these participation choices are correlated with responses to NP occupational regulations.

        To examine and evaluate the representativeness of the database, we compared the data

from the FAIR Health database to claims data from the Thomson Reuters MarketScan Research

database. The MarketScan database is similar in construction to the FAIR Health database, but it

consists of claims from self-insured employers rather than from independent health insurance

companies. MarketScan is widely used in the academic literature.4 We have FAIR Health data

for the period 2005–2010, but for MarketScan we only have information for 2007, and so we

limit our comparisons to claims for 2007.

        Figure 2 shows kernel density estimates of the distribution of prices for established

patient and well care visits for children ages 0–1 (99391), 1–4 (99392), 5–11 (99393), and 12–17

(99394). The line to the right or the green lines show the distribution of prices in the FAIR

Health database, and the line to left or orange lines show the distribution of prices in the

MarketScan database. The figure shows a remarkable similarity in the distribution of the prices

across the two sources of data. Prices are slightly higher in the FAIR Health data; on average the

price of a child well care visit is about $10 more in the FAIR Health data than in the MarketScan

data. The two data sets lead to very similar inferences about the distribution of prices for well

child care. These differences are statistically significant based on simple t-tests and on

Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for the equality of the two distributions. But these findings are not

surprising, given the extremely large sample sizes in both data sets: even small differences are

precisely measured with millions of observations. Overall, we think that the FAIR Health data

and MarketScan data would lead to similar inferences about the influence of changes in

regulations on the prices of these services.

       Our analysis of the price data was always conducted at some level of aggregation rather

than at the actual claim level. We conducted a state-level analysis by computing mean and

median prices in state x year y product code cells. We also conducted some analyses of prices

within selected Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) by classifying claims using the zip code

of the provider location. We generally reduced the influence of outliers (which are likely data

entry errors) by top coding the price data at $1,000 and removing prices that were missing or

negative. We kept 99.8 percent of the price data observations.

Empirical Results

Regulation and Wage Determination

The model we implement is applied to log wages, and is a fixed effects version of the standard

cross-sectional human capital wage equation, which leads to a few subtleties concerning how to



                                                 19
construct the market level regulatory effect estimates. The basic earnings equations can be

written as follows:

                                                                               (9)

where Earningsit is the hourly earnings of physicians (P) or nurses (N) i in state s at time period

t; Rst is the regulation that is in place for person i’s state s in time period t; the vector Xist includes

covariates measuring the characteristics of each person; δs and ηt are state and year fixed effects,

respectively; and     ist   is the error term.

        The model is a basic fixed effects approach that can also be viewed as a generalization of

the conventional two-group two-period difference-in-difference model. We estimated the

earnings equations using two different approaches. In the first approach, we estimated the model

using the full micro-level data set and estimated standard errors that are robust to

heteroskedasticity and clustering at the state level. In the second approach, we aggregated the

data to the level of state x year cells using the two stage procedure described in Hanushek

(1974), Amemiya (1978), and Conley and Taber (2011). In the first stage individual-level

outcomes are regressed on covariates and a full set of state            time fixed effects. The coefficients

on the state    time fixed effects represent state        time cell means that have been purged of the

variation associated with the within-cell variation in the covariates. In the second stage, the

covariate adjusted cell means are regressed on the policy variables, state fixed effects, and year

fixed effects. The standard errors allow for clustering at the state level.

        We estimated separate models of NP and MD hourly earnings and the results are in Table

4.5 The first two columns show estimates from the model that prescription authority restrictions

reduce the earnings of NPs relative to a policy in which they may prescribe controlled substances

5
 We also included time-varying state-level controls such as the state median household income but found that they
have no explanatory power. Consequently, we do not show the results in this paper.

                                                       20
independently. Depending on whether the model is estimated using the micro level or

aggregated data, the effect of requiring MDs to supervise the prescription authority including

controlled substances of NPs reduces the earnings of NPs by about 14 %. These coefficients are

precisely estimated. In contrast, estimates of the effects of regulations that limit prescription

authority to NPs are smaller in the one-stage model and are not precisely estimated. Columns 3

and 4 of Table 4 show estimates of the effects of the regulation on the earnings of MDs. The

results suggest that when states adopt laws that require NPs to prescribe only under MD

supervision, MD earnings increase by approximately 7 percent relative to NPs having full access,

which is consistent with the theoretical model. Moreover, the estimated effect of regulation that

limit prescription authority to NPs are small and the standard error of the estimate is large

enough so that we do not reject the null hypothesis that the regulations do not influence wages.

       The estimates suggest an interpretation of our results is consistent with the theory section:

that is, when a patient visits an NP, those visits come at the expense of a visit to a medical

doctor. Moreover, these two specialists may be substitutes in the production of services, and

these nurses may gain relative to physicians when they can do more tasks for the patient.

Employment

       Consistent with the potential influence of these regulations on wages, the expectation is

that a relaxation of licensing requirements would enhance the employment of NPs by allowing

them to do more medical tasks as well as signal to the market that their skills are of a higher

quality. We test this model in Table 5, using the ACS data and a model similar to the one

estimated in Table 4 using a first- and second-stage model. The results show that annual hours

worked is between 6 and 14 percent lower for NPs when they are limited in their ability to

provide controlled substances without physicians’ assistance in both estimation procedures. In



                                                 21
all cases the coefficients are precisely estimated. Moreover, in the second part of the analysis in

the table shown in the last two columns for physicians, their hours worked grows when NPs are

limited in their ability to prescribe controlled substances. Again, the results suggest that there is

some substitution of NPs for physicians. For example, physician hours worked grows between 6

and 9 percent, when NPs’ tasks are limited.

       To check robustness of the results shown in Tables 4 and 5, we also estimated the same

two-stage models with lagged values of the regulations. Appendix A shows that the lagged

regulations on both hourly earnings and annual hours worked are also significant, which

confirms the robustness of the previous estimates.

Regulation and Prices

       Consistent with theory, one would expect to find that as occupational regulations restrict

the ability of NPs to perform certain tasks, the NP imposition should lead to higher prices for

health services if the services are provided instead by more expensive practitioners such as

physicians. One interpretation is that regulations limit the supply of optimal health services and

that this practice drives up prices. Hedonic mechanisms, however, could also lead to higher

prices. For instance, if NPs are able to provide health services at more convenient times and

locations or with more appealing interpersonal relationships with patients, then these service

attributes could be reflected in prices. Regulations that reduce the ability of NPs to compete on

these margins are likely to make these service attributes less available to consumers, and will

minimize the role of NPs in the market. Finally, regulations can simply increase the cost

structure of an NP-led practice. For instance, if regulations require some type of costly

supervisory relationship between NPs and MDs, then these monitoring costs could further drive

up prices. For example, regulations that prohibit insurance companies from directly reimbursing



                                                 22
NPs could increase administrative costs for NPs and may reduce the service convenience for

patients. All of these factors could drive up prices. The basic model for price determination

mirrors the model we used for wage determination and is specified as follows:

                                                                        (10)

In the equation, Pricest is the median-allowed price in state s at time t; Rst is the licensing

regulation in state s in time period t; the vector Zst includes covariates measuring the

characteristics of each state; δs and ηt are state and year fixed effects, respectively; and   ist   is the

error term.

        Estimates of the state price effects using a variety of fixed effects model specifications

are shown in Table 6. The estimates of the price effects show that more restrictive requirements

for NPs increased prices for well care examinations. The intermediate level of regulation—

Supervised/Delegated Prescription Authority—increases prices by about $6. The stronger level

of regulation—Limited Prescription Authority—increases prices by about $16. Since the typical

price of a well care visit is around $100, these price effects are relatively large.

Sensitivity Analysis

        A concern with our difference-in-differences strategy is the demand for health services

might vary over time within states. Such demand changes could bias our estimates of the effects

of the regulations, if the demand changes are also associated with regulatory changes. To check

the robustness and sensitivity of the estimated price effects to alternative interpretations of the

results, we conducted several different analyses (Leamer, 2010). To examine this possibility, we

collected insurance claims data for a set of 7 basic dental procedures: teeth cleaning, fluoride

treatment, local anesthesia, nitrous oxide, sealant application, amalgam restoration, and x-rays.

We reasoned that these dental services, which are widely consumed by children and have prices



                                                  23
that are similar to child well care exams, should also be affected by the general demand for child

health services in a given state and year. A characteristic of a valid comparison group in this

case is that the markets for these dental services should not be affected by regulations that apply

to NPs, since NPs and MDs do not provide these dental services, but should be driven by many

of the same unobserved demand factors that affect the markets for child well care visits. We

aggregated the dental claims data into state x, year y, procedure code cells and combined them

with the data on the child well care visits. We then estimated triple-differenced regressions in

which the dental data served as a control group for the well care data. The results are presented

in Table 7 as a placebo or falsification test.

    We present the results including a full set of state, year, and state   year fixed effects. The

estimated regulatory effects are the difference in the estimated effect of the regulations on the

well care visits, which should be affected by the regulations, and the dental visits but which

should not be affected by the regulations. In the most complete model, which includes the fixed

effects as well as a vector of time-varying state covariates, we find that the intermediate level of

regulation increases the price of well care visits by about $5.52, and the more stringent

regulation increases prices by about $4.05. The results are statistically significantly different

from zero. These estimates are broadly consistent with the state-level results presented in Table

6, although the magnitude of the stronger regulation is substantially reduced when the dental data

and regulations are used as a control group. The number of observations is halved in the

estimates that include all the covariates. The regulation and price data have information from the

period 2005–2010, but the covariates spanned the period 2008–2010. We also estimated models

that assessed the effects of lagged and leading values of the regulations on contemporaneous

prices as way of ruling out particular forms of reverse causality. The results show no significant



                                                  24
changes in the trend lines prior to the passage of the changes in the regulations for NPs and they

are shown in Appendix B.

       Recent analysis has shown that nominal standard error estimates are often too small in the

generalized difference-in-difference models that we have employed (see also Moulton, 1990;

Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan, 2004; Donald and Lang, 2007; Conley and Taber, 2011;

Rosenbaum, 2002, 2009). In addition, Bertrand et al. (2004) and Conley and Taber (2011) have

both shown that statistical tests based on permutation/randomization distributions seem to

perform well even with clustered data with a relatively small number of groups.

       To assess the robustness of our results, we conducted a series of permutation tests based

on the state-level models. In the most basic implementation of the idea, we randomly selected a

set of state x year cells and defined them as “pseudo regulated markets.” Then we estimated the

regression model using the placebo regulations instead of the real regulations and stored the

coefficients on the pseudo regulations. We repeated this process 500 times to build up a

distribution of placebo effects. On average, the placebo laws should have no effect on prices

because they are simply randomly chosen cells. However, a placebo effect will happen by

chance one in twenty times. By comparing the regulatory effect produced by the actual

regulations to the empirical distribution of effect estimates produced by the placebo laws, we can

understand the likelihood that our effect was observed by chance without appealing to the

asymptotic distribution of a given estimator. In practice, we do not know the true “law

generating process,” and so we experimented by constructing placebo law distributions by

randomly selecting cells across all state x year y product cells and also only within years and

within states. Figure 3 shows kernel density plots of the distribution of estimated coefficients on

the two regulation variables included in the model. The key point is that the placebo



                                                25
distributions represent the sampling distribution of the estimated coefficients under the null

hypothesis that the regulations have no effect on prices. The vertical line in the graph shows the

effect we observed in our actual sample, and it lies in the extreme tail of the placebo distribution.

This is evidence that our results are not likely produced by statistical chance.

         In order to further estimate and test the robustness of our price effects of regulation, we

specify a model in which the data are limited to zip codes that belong to MSAs that fall on both

sides of a state border that marks a change in the way that NPs are regulated. Here the

experiment is to account for local demand and supply conditions that are common across the

MSA (Card and Krueger, 1997; Holmes, 2006).

         To implement the research design, we identified which zip codes were located in a

metropolitan statistical area (MSA) that straddled state borders and had differing state

regulations on either side of the MSA. Thirty-five MSAs met the criteria. We aggregated these

data to state x year y time period cells and used the aggregate data to estimate the following

model:

                                                                            (11)

where Pricemstp is the allowed price for product p at time t in state s in MSA m; Rst is the

licensing regulation in state s in time period t;    m,   p,   ηt are MSA, product, and year fixed

effects, respectively; and   mstp   is the error term. Table 8 gives the MSAs in our analysis that met

the criteria of being on a state border where the legal restrictions differed across state boundaries.

The MSAs represent a wide range of areas and do not appear to be systematically different

across areas of the country or size of MSA. Figure 4 shows the number of MSAs that had either

concordant/discordant regulations for practical nurses regarding their prescription authority. The

results show that there is a clear movement toward states having similar statutes across MSAs.


                                                     26
       Table 9 shows the influence of regulation on prices using our MSA analysis of different

regulations in adjoining states. The results are similar to those from the analysis that used the

dental services as an untreated comparison group. We find that the intermediate level of

regulation increases the price of well care visits by about $3.67 and that the more stringent

regulation increases prices by about $5.31.

       Finally, we examine if the laws were passed in states with specific underlying economic

characteristics. Table 10 shows a hazard model of time to the passage of a more relaxed law

based on the characteristics of the state. The estimates show that none of the standard economic

characteristics in the state is associated with the passage of the law, suggesting that economic

conditions were not a source of bias in our results in terms of passing a more relaxed law

governing NPs.

Reducing Regulations and Quality of Service Outputs

        The analysis thus far suggests that prices were reduced as a consequence of the shift to

more tasks by NPs. An additional issue is how such a shift may have affected the quality of

health services that are available and that are consumed in the marketplace. Quality effects are

conceptually difficult to measure. Moreover, the welfare implications of quality changes are not

obvious because a given health service may represent a bundle of convenience and quality

attributes. If deregulation led to an increase in services with lower quality, but higher

convenience, consumers who value convenience would be better off. Still, qualities of health

outcomes are one of the main arguments against deregulation. To assess the quality

consequences of allowing NPs to provide more services, we examine evidence of an increase in

major errors in medical treatment that could lead to serious injuries or death.




                                                 27
       We implement two approaches for evaluating quality changes. First, we estimate the

effects of the regulatory environment on infant mortality rates using state policy variations over

time. Since mortality is an extreme outcome that may not capture smaller nonfatal changes in

quality, we also examine the effects of relaxing the licensing requirements on the malpractice

insurance rates of physicians in the states that changed their statutes. In Table 11 we estimate the

influence of changing the statutes for NPs on mortality rates for children under the age of one

using a lagged model. We use this approach to capture the changes that occur over time

following the change in the statute on mortality. Specifically, we use infant mortality to adjust

for the influence the year after the regulation was enacted. The estimates in Table 11 use the

five-year mortality rate for the year after the regulation was changed, and then we subtracted the

five-year mortality rate for the current year. The procedure differences out five years of infant

mortality data, and we can estimate if the difference in mortality rates is affected by the changes

in regulation. The results in the table for both supervised/delegated and independent prescription

authorities show no influence of these changes in the regulatory law for infants who would likely

be most vulnerable to poor-quality services.

       As an additional robustness check on the influence of the changes in the statutory

provisions on quality, we examined the effects on the malpractice insurance rates paid by

physicians who were in states where the changes in statutory provisions occurred. We would

assume that if NPs were lower-quality providers of services and, as a consequence, severe

injuries occurred to children as a result of poor-quality care, then their malpractice insurance

rates would rise. In Table 12 we show the impact of changes in the law for both

supervised/delegated and independent prescription authorities for NPs on malpractice premiums

from 1999 through 2004 for internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and surgeons. In none

of the estimates did the change in the regulatory laws that allowed NPs more flexibility in tasks

statistically influence these malpractice premiums. All of the results for the influence of

regulation on quality yielded imprecise estimates. We were not able to find any influence of the

relaxation of the licensing statutes on blunt overarching, but important measures of health

outcomes.

Conclusions

       In this study we investigate how easing regulations that affect NPs may affect wages,

employment, prices, and quality in health markets. Initially, we examined a basic theory of

regulated labor inputs into the production of medical services. Next, we used data from the ACS

for the period 2002–2009 to study how changes in state licensing regulations have affected the

wages and hours worked of NPs and MDs. Subsequently, we analyzed a large database of

private health insurance claims for well care exams to estimate the effect of the regulation

changes on the supply prices of standard medical services. Our estimates show that more

restrictive NP regulations tend to reduce the wages of NPs and to increase the prices of medical

services. However, we also found evidence that more restrictive NP regulations tend to increase

the wages of MDs. One interpretation of this finding is that NPs and MDs are substitutes in

service production. For certain tasks, the abilities of NPs to provide more patient care result in

declines in the hours worked and earnings of MDs.

       We analyzed the sensitivity of our results using the prices of other routine health services

(dental procedures) that should not be influenced by NP regulations. We also analyzed these

policies at the level of MSAs to account for local supply and demand conditions using MSA

fixed effects. In addition, we conducted placebo law tests that are robust to dependent error




                                                 29
structures, and by examining the timing of the introduction of state regulations to determine

whether regulatory changes appear because of changes in state characteristics.

        Our analysis showed how regulating and relaxing provisions for the occupational groups

involved in the delivery of health services can affect both wages and prices. We found that

allowing NPs to independently provide prescriptions on their own is associated with a 14

percent increase in hourly wages for NPs relative to more restrictions on their tasks, and as much

as a 7 percent increase in earnings for physicians when tasks for NPs are limited. These results

suggest some substitutability of these occupations for one another. Our estimates from FAIR

Health, Inc. show that changing occupational licensing laws to allow more autonomy by nurses

lowers permitted prices by 3 to 16 %. However, we were not able to find any influence of these

changes in the regulatory climate on infant mortality rates or malpractice insurance rates as

indirect measures of the quality of the service provided. Relaxing regulations does not appear to

change the most serious adverse medical outcomes.

        The policy implications of our results suggest that the use of NPs may be an important

way to enhance access to medical care for patients. For these routine tasks related to prescription

of medications, allowing NPs to perform procedures leads to lower prices for the services we

examined. The estimates from the models in this paper suggest that regulations that restrict the

independence of NPs may cost the economy from a well-defined routine child well care visit.6

These regulations likely affect the prices of other health services as well, and it seems clear that

occupational regulations may be an important factor to consider in federal or state health care

policies that are intended to reduce the costs of medical care under the Affordable Care Act.

However, there is a need for additional analysis on more medical procedures, as well as further

6
 A simple “back of the envelope estimate” suggests that nationally relaxing these regulations could save about $600
million for this one medical procedure per year as an upper bound, if the savings are about $10 per visit and there
are about 60 million procedures.

new public policies.
