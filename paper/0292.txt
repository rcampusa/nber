          The Effect of Trade Unionism on Fringe Benefits



      This paper analyzes the impact of unionism on the fringes paid blue—

collar workers using data on individual establishments. The main substantive

finding is that trade unionism raises the fringe share of compensation,

particularly pension and life, accident and health insurance. The

magnitude of the effect is sufficiently large as to suggest that estimates

which neglect fringes understate theunion effect on compensation. The

paper uses the data on the compensation of blue—collar and white—collar

workers within an establishment to control for within—establishment pay

policies and estimate the potential effect of blue—collar unionism on the

fringes of white—collar workers.

      Does collective bargaining alter the composition of the compensation

package received by workers? Is the fraction of the wage bill spent on

"fringe benefits" higher in union than in nonunion firms, and if so, why?

      Despite considerable public attention given to the fringe benefits

negotiated by major unions and numerous studies of the effect of unions on

wages, the impact of collective negotiations on the composition of the wage

bill has received relatively little professional attention. While most labor

economists believe that unions increase fringe benefits, the only substantive

empirical analysis of the determination of fringes (Rice 1966) found little

evidence of a sizeable union impact. With firm size and wages, among other

factors, held fixed, Rice's regressions across industries yielded generally

insignificant coefficients on the percentage organized. Reviewing the evi-

dence, Reynolds concluded that much of the increase in fringes in recent

years was probably attributable to 'voluntary employer action' and that "the

specific influence of unionism is hard to determine" (Reynolds, pp. 216-217).

      In this paper I use more detailed and disaggregate data from individual

establishments to show that, contrary to the gross cross-industry results,

unionism does in fact significantly raise the fringe share of the wage bill,

and explore in detail the nature of this effect. The main source of data is

the Expenditures for Employee Compensation (EEC) survey of the Bureau of Labor

Statistics, which contains statistics on the compensation of office and non—

office (production) workers in private nonfarm establishments.1 By providing

information on two types of workrs within an establishment, one oC whom

(office workers) is rarely organized, the EEC data permit some methodological

advances in the estimation of union effects. Within-establishment differen-

ces in compensation can be used as units of observation, eliminating the po-

tential effects of "unobserved" firm factors in much the same way as comparisons
                                                                  2




of "brothers" or twins eliminates family background effects in the analysis

of earnings among individuals (see Chamberlain). In addition, it is possible

to exploit the establishment data to estimate models in which unionism

of production workers induces firms to raise the fringes paid office

workers within he establishment. These methodological innovations have a

 substantive effect on the magnitude of the estimated impact of unionism.

     The paper is divided into five parts. Section one sets out theoretic

and institutional reasons for expecting unionism to alter the composition of

the labor compensation package. Section two describes the data set used and

issues covered in the empirical work. Section three presents estimates of

the union effect from regressions across establishments. Section four

develops more complex models that allow for unobserved firm effects and

spillovers within establishments. The paper concludes with a brief evaluation

of the significance of the findings for the economic analysis of unions.



I. Unionism and Fringe Benefits

     The division of a dollar of compensation per—man hour between fringe

behef its and straight—time pay can be fruitfully analyzed in terms of the

effective supply price of fringes, defined as the wage workers would forego

to obtain the benefit. The higher the supply price the greater the probability

of providing a given fringe and the greater its share of compensation.

     There are several reasons for expecting trade unionism to raise the

effective supply price of fringes.

     The most important reason is that unions are political as well as

economic institutions, whose behavior must be consonant with the desires

of a majority of workers. In a world in which some workers are more or

less permanently attached to firms (for reasons of transactions costs of

mobility) while others are more mobile or marginal, the union will give
                                                                       j




 greater weight to the preferences of the older, relatively permanent

employees than would occur in a competitive market, where the desires

of the marginal employee set the supply price. In the context of the

median voter model, the union would represent the tastes of the median

worker, as opposed to the marginal worker. If, as seems reasonable,

older presuiably less mobile workers have greeter desires or fringes

 (see Nealey for evidence), the supply price and provision of fringes will
be    greater under collective than individual bargaining.

        Formally, represent the postulated differential attachment of workers

to firms by an upward sloping supply schedule dependent on wages (w) and
                                -
fringes (f)

        (1) L(w,f) L > 0            Lf > 0

The inverse function of (1) relating wages to fringes and employment defines

the supply price of fringes:

        (2) w(f,L Wf < 0                 > 0
                                    WL


Faced    with this supply price, cost minimization by the firm requires for

any given L an interior solution f* such that a dollar of fringes reduces

the marginal wage cost of labor by the same amount: 2

         (3)     Wf (f*,L) = —l

The firm will       provide a given fringe f1when at the optimal value f*

the reduction in wages exceeds expenditures on the fringe and the average

fixed cost ('/L)of instituting the program:

        (4)     w(0,L) —
                             1 1
                           w(f,L)    > f + c/L

According to (3) expenditures on fringes in a nonunion setting depend on the

marginal evaluation of fringes by the marginal worker, Wf(f,L). According to

(4)   initiation of a particular benefit depends on the change in wages
w<0,L)—        w(f,L) exclusive of any potential infra—margina]. 'worker surplus.
                                                                                        4




      By contrast, the supply price set by the union will depend on the

operation of the union as a political entity and the resultant union

maximand. In this paper I consider two schematic models of union behavior:

a median voter model and an 'optimizing                                  model. Under both models

and reasonable mixtures or variants thereof, it can be demonstrated that

the supply price of fringes will be higher under unionism.

      Consider first the case in which the union seeks to maximize the

preference function of the median worker. If all workers are ordered

from 0 to L in terms of greatest to least attachment to the firm, the

supply price function will be w(f, L/2)' Cost minimization by the

union firm leads to the interior solution fm that satisfies:

      (5) Wf(f, L12) = —l
and to the condition for introducing the fringe f1 of

      (6)     W(0, L/2) —             w(f,     L/2)   > f'   + E/L
If,     as    assumed, marginal workers                have    less desire for fringes than infra—

marginal workers, Wf (f, L/2) < wf(f, L). As a consequence fm > f* and

the union firm will spend more on fringes and be more likely to introduce

particular programs than the nonunion firm.

      As an alternative, consider the behavior of a union which, for reasons

of logrolling and internal redistribution of benefits among members,

operates like an optimizing cartel. Such a union will be assumed to

maximize total worker surplus, defined as the area above the supply curve:4

        (7)    Lw(f,L) — .f1 w(f,x) dx
Maximization requires an interior solution fc that satisfies:

        (8)    Wf(f              L)_fL Wf(fc, x) dx = 0



where
         1L              c
                                 x)   is the
                                      .                              .
              f   Wf(f       ,                 average supply price of the fringe,

and the condition for providing the fringe fi:

        (9) i/L 1L w(f1, x) dx > f + c/L.
When the average supply price is greater (in absolute value) than the

marginal supply price fc will exceed f*• When the 'average surplus,'

l/L fL w(, x) dx, exceeds the saving in wages w(O,L) —              the union
                                                          w(ffL),
firm will be more likely to initiate particular programs. Both of these

conditions hold when wfL <.   0, i.e. when, as postulated, marginal workers
have less desire for fringes than infra-narginal workers..

     Although both the median voter and optimal cartel models represent

polar cases, which ignore the numerous complexities of union behavior,

they do shed light on the difference between the supply price of fringes

under collective and individual bargaining. The prediction of greater

allocation of funds to fringes under unionism does not depend on the precise

model of union behavior but rather on the broad principle that, as political

institutions, union are likely to weigh more heavily than nonunion firms the pre-

ferences of infra—marginal workers who tend to beespeclallydesirousof fringes.



Additional routes of the union effect

     Trade unionism is likely to raise the supply price of fringes in

several other ways as well. First, by increasing the length of the attachment

between workers and firms (raising job tenure and lowering quit rates),

unionism raises the likelihood that workers will receive deferred fringes

such as nonvested pensions or insurance health benefits. As a result

the value of these fringes will be greater under unionism, increasing

their supply price and, all else the same, dollar expenditures.

     Second, in sectors of the economy where workers are attached to

occupations rather than employers (i.e. construction) or where enterprises

are short—lived (garment trade) or where firms are relatively small

(trucking) unions provide the type of large permanent market institution

needed to operate most fringe programs. Without unions (or some comparable

structure) the probability of receiving deferred benefits would be too
                                                                         6




small and the fixed costs too high for most benefits to be economically

sensible. What is needed are multi—employer programs, of the type initiated

by unions in the aforementioned industries, which vest benefits across

employers and provide the size to reduce average set up costs. In just

such a manner did unions operate as fraternal benefit societies years ago.

     Third, as argued by Freeman (1976), Nelson (1976) and Hirschman (1976),

unions may elicit more accurate information about workers preferences for

fringes than can be gained from individual bargaining. Given high income

elasticities for fringes, this should lead to more rapid and            pro-

vision in the organized sector. Conceptually, the adversary relation between

employers and employees ——   the   fact that the level as well as allocation of

the compensation package is at stake —— argues for circumspection in pro-

vision of information by workers. If employers had complete knowledge of

employee preference functions, they would seek to extradt all of the worker

surplus, striking a bargain that would leave workers at their minimum ac-

ceptance point.5 It might be better for employees to withhold information.

As the agent of workers, on the other hand, unions should obtain a more

accurate revelation of preferences through the internal process of bargaining

over the appropriate acceptable pay package, and may play anespecially

important role in eliciting desires for fringes that are 'public' to th

work force. Empirically, there is some evidence that information factors

are important in differentiating union and nonunion firms in the fringe area.

Richard Lester's 1967 review of surveys of managerial perceptions of worker

preferences found "limited data... that workers value benefits more highly

bmpared to wages than employers believe their workers do" (p. 494) while

Edward Lawler's study of union leaders concluded that leaders are generally

good predictors of the members' preferences for various compensation pack-

ages, though they also seem to have understated the desire for fringes (p. 517).

It may, in general, be more reasonable to expect accurate information flows
                                                                             7




to emerge from collective negotiation, despite bargaining tactics, than from

exit interviews, questioning of individual workers, and the like, given the

incentives to respond.6

     Fourth, the complexities involved in evaluating the costs and propective

benefits of modern fringe benefits may make workers more willing to accept

fringes when they have a specialized agent like a union evaluating and moni-

toring employer claims and programs (Aichian & Demsetz). Significant in-

vestments in knowledge which lie beyond the purview of individual workers

are needed to judge the true cost and future benefits of alternative compen-

sation packages. Union layers, actuaries, and related experts are one in-

stitutional mechanism by which workers can obtain the expertise to bargain

over these diverse benefits.

     Finally, the fact that most fringe benefits have been ruled by the courts

o be mandatory bargaining topics, whose lack of resolution can lead to im-

passes and strikes, is also likely to spur programs and expenditures in the

union sector. Prior to the Supreme Court rulings on pensions (Inland Steel

Case) and health and welfare funds (W.W. Cross Case) in 1949, companies often

argued that such benefits were 'management gifts' and not the subject of nego-

tiations. Since then fringes have become a major issue in almost all collec-

tive negotiations. While agreement need not be reached On these (or other)

mandatory topics, the rulings have presumably impelled more serious negotiations

and provisions than would have been the case if fringes had been ruled per-

missive topics.

     In sum, unionism is likely to raise expenditures on fringes and the number

of programs, particularly deferred benefits favordd by older workers and those

with high fixed costs, and to have especially large effects on small firms in

industries with unstable employer—worker relations.


Other determinants of fringes

     In addition to unionism, th fringe share of the wage bill is likely
                                                                        8




to depend on several other economic factors, whose influence must be held

fixed in empirical work. Ainont the most important are:

     (1) Overall level of compensation. Fringes are likely to have a

positive income elasticity and thus be correlated with total compensation

per manhour. If the elasticity exceeds one, the fringe share of the wage

bill will also be related positively to total compensations

     (2) Tax benefits of deferred compensation. Because money placed into

pension and related plans is not taxed when payment is first made; earns

interest that is not taxed until paid out; and is taxed at potentially

favorable capital gains rates or as salary at lower income tax rates on

retirinent, the tax system reduces the cost of fringes and thus encourages

expenditures on them. As a result of the tax advantages, the "income"

elasticity of fringes with respect to before—tax income will be biased upward

since the true effect of income will be confounded with the price effect

due to increasing tax rates and tax 'savings' from fringes.

     (3) Specific human capital. By creating an incentive for permanent

employment relations, specific human capital will increase the fringe share

of compensation. Workers will haiè a higher supply price for fringes because

of the likelihood of remaining with the firm. Firms will use deferred frin-

ges, notably pensions, to discourage quitting by the specifically trained.

      (4) Firm size. Two factors are likely to lead to greater fringes in

larger firms: reduction in the cost of establishing fringe programs as the

fixed cost is divided among more workers; and the greater tenure of workers

with large firms due to possibilities of within—firm mobility.

      (5) Demographic characteristics of workers. The supply price for

 fringes should vary among the population, depending on personal characteris-

 tics. Older workers tend to favor deferred fringes like retirement pay,

 medical and health insurance (Nealey). Women generally have less desire

 for fringes than men, in part because they are often covered by their

 husbands' pension and health plans (Herman). And so forth.
                                                                 9


medical and health insurance (Nealey). Women generally have less desire

for fringes than men, in part because they are often covered by their

husbands' pension and health plans (Herman). And so forth.



II. Data and Econometric Issues

    The principal source of data for the empirical analysis is the Expenditures

for Employee Compensation (EEC) Survey of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The EEC is an establishment survey covering all large establishments in

the private nonfarm sector and a probability sample of smaller establishments.

The survey has several advantages: it relates to establishments rather than

more aggregate units; contains detailed information on the compensation

package; differentiates between nonoff ice (blue—collar or production) workers

and office (white—collar) employees; and has an appropriate measure of

unionism, whether or not workers are covered by a collective bargaining con-

tract.7 There are diszidantages also; because of confidentiality, the public

data tapes exclude certain large firms:'because only enterprise data are

obtained, information on the personal characteristics of workers is lacking;

because the figures relate to costs rather than benefits, they provide

imperfect measures of the value of fringes to workers . Even so, the detailed

establishment compensation figures make. the EEC the best available data

set for analysis of the effects of unionism on the compensation package.

     The data from the EEC surveys of 1967—68, 1969—70, and 1971—72 were

amalgamated into a single pooled sample, with monetary figures transformed

Into comparable units by deflation to 1967 dollars on the basis of the

level of average hourly earnings in the private sector. The pooled sample

cuutttlns 10,088 establishment observations.

     Table 1 summarizes the data on the composition of compensation per

manhour in the sample for union and nonunion nonoff ice workers in the
                                                                              10


     Since some fringes are required by law and thus not amenable to

collective negotiations, lines 4 and 5 divide the fringes into two basic

types: the legally required, such as social security, unemployment

insurance, and workmen's compensation; and voluntary fringes, which include

vacationpay, holiday pay, pensions, life, accident and health insurance,

sick leave, overtime pay, and several smaller benefits. While, as seems

reasonalie, there is little or no difference in the proportion of compensa-

tion spent on legally required fringes between union and nonunion establish-

ments, there is a sizeable difference in the proportion going to voluntary

fringes. In manufacturing, 19.1 percent of the wage bill in unionized

establishments is spent on voluntary fringes compared to l3. 3 percent of

the wage bill in nonunion establishments. In all private industry, the

porportions are 16.2 percent (union) and 10.6 percent (nonunion). Because

voluntary fringes are the subject of labor—management negotiations, they

will be the main dependent variable in ensuing empirical analyses.



Independent variables

     To estimate the impact of unionism on the compensation package, it is

important to control for diverse other factors (correlated with unionism)

that can be expected to affect fringes. The EEC tapes contain several

establishment variables that will be used as controls:

     total compensation per man hour, which will control for income effects

in the 'purchase' of fringes and isolate the effect of unionism on the com-

position s opposed to level of the wage bill

    size of establishment, measured by nonoff ice employment

     region and SMSA dummy variables, which distinguish between four

regions and size of place

     industry dummy variables, entered to control for diverse differences,

including technologically determined differences in specific human capital

and differences in characteristics of workers. A large number of industry

 dummies will be used to focus on as similar groups of establishments as possible.

     The major problem with the establishment data set is a lack of infor-

mation on the personal characteristics of workers within establishments,

especially age, which can be expected to affect fringe payments. This prob-

lem is -dealt with ..in three ways. First, by supplementing the EEC data with
    t                      —          I.
information   from the Current Population Survey (CPS) on the characteristics

of workers in detailed industries. Specifically, I tabulated from the May

1973, 1974 and 1975 CPS files the mean years of schooling, percent male,

percent white, percents above 50 and below 30 years of age for union and

nonunion production (and nonproduction) workers in three digit industries

and added these figures to the EEC tapes.9 Establishments in which pro-

duction workers were organized were given the means for union workers in

the three digit industry while establishments which were unorganized were

given the means for nonunion workers. With different figures for organized

and unorganized establishments in the same sector, the procedure controls

for differences in the personal characteristics of union and nonunion workers

within an industry but not for differences across individual establishments.

     Second, in several calculations the ratio of office to nonoffice workers

in an establishment was entered as a crude indicator of whether the enterprise

had an assembly line (lower skill) nonoff ice work force or a more highly skilled

group of blue—collar employees. The ratio is expected to be higher when the

blijie—collar workers are relatively skilled because of the general pattern for

industries with relatively many white—collar employees to have a more skilled

blue—collar work force than those with a predominantly blue—collar work force.1°

     Third, as noted, extensive use is made of industry dummy::variables to con-

trol for characteristics that have a significant industrial variation. While

none of these procedures eliminates the problem of inadequate personal data,

that is the price that must be paid for the advantages of establishment data

files at present.
 Econometric issues

      The effect of unionism and the other independent variables on fringes

 will be estimated with linear and log—linear equations:

    (lG)                                                   .


     (11)             ln F1 = a + b(ln C1) +cTJN1 + d)t1 + V1

where F1 =      voluntary   fringes per man hour paid nonoffice (blue—collar) worker

      C1 =      total   compensation per man   hour   -




            =   0—1   dummy variable for collective bargaining coverage
      UN1

     X =        other   control variable, for algebraic sir-nlicitv only one

is distinguished here.

      U1 = random        disturbance

      V. = random        disturbance
       1
The linear form is applied to the entire sample, including the small minority

of firms (about 2 percent of the sample) which pay no voluntary fringes, and

is also used to analyze specific fringes, where there are numerous zero values.
The log form is used in analyses which correct for omitted establishment fac-

tors and which treat interactions between unionism and other variables. It

is applied to the establishments that have nonzero voluntary fringes.

      There are two econometric problems with (10) and (11). The first is

simultaneity due to the fact that total compensation includes fringes

 [C F. + S1 where S1 = straight—time pay], giving rise to the standard

simultaneous bias from having the same variable on both sides of the equation.U

To correct for simultaneity in the linear form, F1 + S1 is substituted for

C. in (10) and the' resultant equation solved for F1 to obtain



     (12)             F1 = a/i—b + (b/l—b)S1 + (c/l—b)UN1 + (d/l—b)X + U./l—b
                                                                            14




The structural parameters of concern can be obtained from (12) by solving

the estimated coefficient on Si for        and multiplying   the other parameters

by l—. To correct for simultaneity in the log form, in            will be

instrumented by ln1 (nd th other vriab1s in (1L)) and the instrument

used in place of in C. in the equation.

     The second and potentially more serious econometric problem relates

to the independence of UN. (or the         variables) and the residual U1 or V1.

If the residual includes an establishment component related to unionism,

the coefficient on UN1 will be biased. If high fringe firms tend to be organ—

ized-(say because they are leading enterprises), OLS estimates of (10) or (11)

will overstate the union effect, and conversely if E(V.UN1) < 0 or E(U1UN1) < 0

     The availability of data on office workers within an establishment

can beused to treat this problem. If the omitted enterprise factor affects

office as well as nonoffice workers, it will influence both fringes, per-

mitting white—collar fringes to proxy the missing variable. Formally, when

 there is an enterprise specific omitted factor, the error in (11) can be divided

into two parts, V1 =
                       Ah   +     where   h. is the firm effect, with a scaling factor

A, and where 2.. is the remainder of the- residual.12 This gives tre    following
equation for nonoff ice worker fringes:

     (13)        lnF. = a + b inC. + cUN. + dX + Ah. + 2..

Now let the fringes of office workers (FiW) depend on their compensation

       other controls (XW), the omitted factor with a scaling factor of i,13

and a residual     uncorrelated with the independent variables.

      (14)       ln(F."7) = aW   + bwlfl(Cw) + dWX +h. +2.1w

where the w superscripts relate to the office or white—collar workers and

'1ihere the different scalings of the firm effect in (13) and (14) permits the

 firm factor to affect white—collar workers differently from blue—collar workers.

      The firm specific component h1 can be eliminated from (13) by multiplying

(14) by A and substituting for Xh1 to obtain
                                                                         15




     (15)       ln(F1) =   Aln(F13+     cUN1+ b(lnC1) _Abln(C1W) + (d_AdW)x
                                                                                  +

 Least squares e3timates of (15) will not yield unbiased or consistent parameter

 estimates, since the residual —A2. is negatively correlated with lnF1W. The

 coefficient on lnFw will 1e   biased   downward and, given a positi've correlatfon
between lnF.W and UN1, the union coefficient will be biased upward. While
                                             14
there is no easy way around this problem,         the extent of the bias can be

 evaluated using standard bias formulae. If 1nF1W and UN1 are only iiiodestly

correlated (as turns out to be the case), the bias will be quite small and

the resultant estimate on UNi presumably close to the correct value.


      Finally, to the extent that as industrial relations experts like Slichter,

 Livernash and Healy claim "to some degree union plant workers have: become

 pattern setters for office groups" (p. 445), the model embodied in (15) provides

 an extremely stringent test of the impact of collective bargaining on blue collar

 fringes. It uses expenditures on white collar fringes (relative to expected

 expenditures) as a proxy for the omitted establishment component without allowing

 blue collar unionism to affect the white collar fringes. If unionized firms pay
higher fringes to white—collar workers to forestall organization and minimize

worker discontent, estimates of the impact of unionism that "correct" for omitted

firm factors as in (15) will understate the true union effect on production

workers by misallocating the union effect. An effort is made in section IV

to modify the model to allow for the possible impact of unionism on the fringes

of white—collar workers.


III. Basic Cross—Establishment Estimates

     This section presents least squares estimates of fringe equations

(l2)—(l5), using cross—establishment data. It finds that, with total

compensation held fixed, unionism significantly raises fringe spending,

particularly on life, accident & health insurance, pensions, vacation, and

holiday pay, and has its greatest impact on small low—wage firms. Since

the calculations control for total compensation, the effect cannot be
                                                                       16

 the mo.e complex aspects of union, behavior discussed in. section I..            ,
                                                                                      .•

 fits using linear equations (10) and (12) for the entire private nonfam

 sector and for the manufacturing subsector of the EEC sample. Lines 1—4

 record the coefficient and standard error for unionism, compensation, and

 size of establishment (in terms of nonoff ice worker employment); lines 5—9

 list the other control variab1e while the remaining lines give the summary

 statistics. Co1ui lrecords means of the explanatory variables for all pri-

vate industry, while Coltinn 2 presents estimates of equation (1)ior all

private industry. The union coefficient is a moderate but highly significant

 .056, indicating that establishments which are organized pay nearly 6 more

per manhour for fringes. Because of the simultaneity problem, however, this

is likely to be an underestimate o the effect of unionism on fringes with

compensation held fixed. Columns 3—4 correct for simultaneity by replacing

total compensation per manhour by straight—time pay plus required fringes on

the right—hand side of the equation. The coefficients in the new regression,

given in column 3, represent the structural parameters divided by 1—b, where

b is bhe parameter on compensation. Column 4 gives the estimated structural

parameters, obtained by solving for b Q/l—L =     .l04),and   multiplying coef-

ficients by 1—b. As expected, the simultaneity correction raises the esti-

mated impact of unionism markedly, from 5.6 in (2), to l0.l in 4). At

the mean level of spending on voluntary fringes in the sample of 49Q, the

final estimate translates into an eaticity of fringes with respect to unionism

of .21 (=   10.1/49).   The calculations in columns (b)—(8) give a similar result

for the manufacturing subsector, with a final simultaneity corrected estimate

of 78 or 13 percent of the mean voluntary fringes of 58 per manhour in the

sample.

        aDependent variable is dollars per manhour on voluntary fringes, as defined in
         Table 1. Independent variable measured in absolute units. Mean fringe for all
         private is 49. Mean fringe for manufacturing is 58Q.
        bThese variables were obtained at a 3—digit industry level from the Current
         Population Survey tapes for May 1973—75, with separate figures for union and
         nonunion workers, as described in text.
        Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Expenditures for Employee Compensation
                 Survey, tapes 1967—68, 1969—70, 1971—72.
      With respect to other variables, both compensation and size of estab-

lishment also positively influence expenditures on fringes. The simultaneity

corrected estimate of the effect of an increase In compensation on fringes

in all private industries is .133, whidh at the mean value of compensation

($3 52) and voluntary fringe s nding-($4) transl-ate into an elastitity

of .96 =    [(.133/.49)   x 3.52]. Finally, while the coefficient on number of

nonoffice workers is smallin absolute value, because of substantial varia-

tion of employment in the sample, a standard deviation change in number of

workers has a sizeable effect on fringes, raising them by 34 ( 16.00 x .021),

which exceeds the effect of a one standard deviation change in total compen-

sation of 2l (= l.59x .133).

           The link between unionism and fringes is pursued further in Table 3,

which contains estimates of the effect of collective bargaining on fringes

using the logarithmic form . The log equations are limited to establish-

ments with nonzero voluntary fringes, a restriction which eliminates 37

manufacturing establishments and 243 total establishments, most of whom

are nonunion. Column 1 records the results of regressing ln voluntary

fringes on the collective bargaining dummy for all private industry, with

total compensation used to measure the size of the pay package. Unionism

is accorded a highly significant positive coefficient of .109. Column 2

treats the problem of simultaneity between total compensation and fringes

by instrumenting lnC on in straight—time pay: as would be expected the

union coefficient rises while that on compensation falls. Column 3 examines

the possibility that the union effect differs among firms with different levels

of pay and size by interacting the collective bargaining variable with size of

firm and total. compensation. The interaction terms obtain sizeable significant

coefficients that imply very different effects on smaller and lower paid

establishments than on larger, higher paid establishments, as Is indicated

below:

        Columns 4—6 of the table present similar computations for the manu-

facturing subsector. The results are essentially the same, with sizeable

union effects in regressions 4 and 5, giving elasticities of fringe spending

to unions of .109, without the simultaneity correction and .150 with the

correction. The interaction of bargaining with the size of the blue—collar

work force in regression 6 parallels that for manufacturing in regression 3,

whilé the interaction with total compensation is larger.

        All told, the results in Table 3 support the hypothesis that trade

unionism influences the composition of the compensation package, raising

the fringe proportion of wages, particularly in smaller firms, as predicted

in section I, and in low wage firms as well.



Specific fringes

        Which voluntary fringes are most affected by trade unionism? To

what extent does the union effect operate by raising the likelihood that

establishments will have a particular fringe program?

        Table 4 presents calculations designed to answer these questions.

Columns 1—2 record the cents per manhour spent on the major fringes in the

average establishment and the proportion of establishments with the fringes.

It shows that the most important fringes in terms of expenditures and

availability are health, accident & life insurance, vacation and holiday

pay, overtime premiums, and pensions, with shift differentials, sick leave,

and bonuses of nonnegligeable but lesser significance. Column 3 examines

the impact of collective bargaining on expenditures for the mean fringes

using the linear model (12), with straight—time pay plus required fringes

as the measure of compensation and with all the variables listed in Table 2

used as controls. Because each fringe is too small to create a    simultaneity
problem, the column records the actual regression coefficients, rather than

the simultaneity corrected structural parameters. The regressions show that

unions have their greatest positive effect on deferred compensation in the

form of pensions; on life, accident, and health insurance, where fixed costs

tend to be sizeable; on vacation pay, which tends to have a strong seniority

component; and on holiday pay; and have negative effects on overtime premiums,

presumably because of high overtime rates, on sick leave and bonuses.

        Column 4 reports estimates of the effect of collective bargaining

on the provision of fringes, using a linear probability model and the

same set of controls as in previous calculations. While it would have

been desireable to estimate the effect of bargaining on the probability

of specific fringe programs using a more appropriate functional form,

the linear model allows for a greater number of controls and, on the basis

of limited experiments, appears to yield simi1a.. estimates of the impact of

unionism as does a logistic model (with fewer industry and other duunny contr'ols)..

        The estimates show that part of the union effect takes the form

of changes in the probability of providing the fringes. Among the major

fringes, trade unionism significantly raises the probability of providing

pensions; by a striking .224 points in manufacturing and .272 points over-

all. Unionism also raises the probability of life, acc ident & health

plans, of overtime premiums, of holiday pay, and of shift differentials,

while reducing sick leave and bonuses.

        Column 5 turns to fringe expenditures by establishments that have

the specified fringe. It records the estimated impact of unionism

from the OLS regression of friage spending on

straight—time pay and required fringes, and the standard control variables.
                                                                           23



    These calculations isolate the impact of collective bargaining on the level

    of spending, conditional on provision of the given fringe. The estimates

    s1ow that unionism affects the amount spent on most major fringes as well

    as the probability of initiating a program, with positive significant coefficients
•


    for all of te main fringes positively affected •by unionism except pension

    plans. In all private industrial firms with life, accident, or health

    insurance programs, expenditures per manhour are 4ç higher in the union sector;
    among firms with vacation programs expenditures on pensions are 2C

    higher; and so forth. This is consistent with the model of section I

    which predicts positive union effects on the average level of fringe

    spending as well as on the provision of fringes.

         Overall, the disaggregation of fringes in table 4 shows that unionism

    has its greatest positive effect on fringes most likely to be favored by

    older infra—marginal workers, such as pensions and health, accident, and

    life insurance, on vacation pay, which tends to have a strong seniority

    component, and on holiday pay, and a negative effect on fringes which may

    benefit the young marginal workers the most ——   sick   leave (often used by

    young workers who are absent on Mondays or Fridays) and bonuses, which will

    benefit the more productive young workers most. These patterns are roughly

    iii accord with the theoretic arguments given in section I.


The union effect on total compensation and on total fringe expenditures

           If unionism raises fringe benefits by substantial amounts, standard

    estimates of the union wage effect, which for reasons of data availability.

are generally limited to wages, understate the full impact of collective

bargaining on compensation per manhour. How large might this understatement be?

           Estimates of the magnitude of the bias due to neglect of the effect

of unionism on fringes can be made by comparing the union coefficients from

separate regressions of straight—time pay and of total compensation per man-

hour on collective bargaining coverage and the relevant control variables.
                                                                           24

 With a logarithmic equation, the resultant estimates of the collective

 bargaining effect in the EEC sample are:

       In all private industry, the impact of unionism on total compensa-

tion is .173, 17 percent above the impact of unionism on straight—time pay.

In manufacturing, the union coefficient rises by 25 percent from .082 to

.105. By these calculations, the union impact on fringes is important, not

only in terms of the composition of the wage bill but also in terms of the

level of the union wage effect.

        Finally, since unions raise straight—time pay and since straight—

time pay influences fringes, the total impact of unionism on fringe spending

will exceed the estimates in Tables 2—4, which hold total compensation fixed.

A path model can be used, in conjunction with the estimated impact of unions

on fringes and straight—time pay and of straight—time pay on fringes to

obtain the total impact:

      (16) bFU.X = bFU CX +
                            bFc    ux bcux

where bFuX is the total effect of unionism on fringes (conditional on controls X),

      bFUCX is the union effect, holding compensation fixed,           .




     bFC.ux is the effect of compensation o fringes, holding unionism fixed,
     bcux is the effect of unions on compensation
Since bFU      is positive and bcux is positive, the total effect will exceed

the estimates ofthe union effect conditional on compensation.

into (16) yields estimated total union effects of .36 (all private) and

.28 (manufacturing) compared to effects via the composition of compensation

of .18 and .15. It appears that unions raise total spending on fringes

roughly equally through raising the fringe share of compensation and through

raising the level of compensation.




IV. Establishment Specific Factors and Spillover Effects

        The analysis thus far has ignored the possibility set out earlier

that omitted establishment factors correlated with unionism could be

biasing the estimated coefficients. In this section I deal with the omitted

variable problem by estimating equation (15) and then expand the model to

allow for the possible effect of unionism on the fringes of white collar

workers within an establishment. Estimates of the impact of collective

bargaining on fringes turn out to be sensitive to omitted establishment

factors and to the effects of blue—collar unionism on white collar fringes.

        Columns 1 and 2 of table 5 present estimates of blue collar fringe

equation (15), which adjusts for omitted establishment factors by including

lnF. and the characteristics of white collar workers in the basic regression

model. According to the analysis, when omitted establishment variables

which raise the fringes of white collar as well as blue collar workers

are correlated positively with unionism, white collar fringes will enter

collective   bargaining coefficient is .13, which is 28% belàw the .18

drop In the impact of unionism suggests that the previous cross—section

estimates of the union impact were biased upward by omission of correlated

establishment factors.

     The least squares estimates of (15) do not, however, yield consistent

estimates of the union effect. As pointed out in section I, the part of the

residual in the equation that comes from the white collar fringe equation

(LW) is correlated with lnF1W so that when the partial correlation between

UN and lnF1W    is   nonzero, least squares yields a biased estimate of the

coefficient on unionism. The potential magnitude of the bias can be

assessed by treating X2.,.w as an omitted variable correlated with lnF.'

and applying standard bias formula. Let bx be the regression coefficient

of 1nFW on UN., conditional on all other variables and let                  be the

accompanying partial correlation coefficient and let P(0 < P < 1) be

the ratio of the variance of        to the variance of                Then the bias on

that      overstates A     by    a factor of 2, giving an estimate of        of 2/3. With
P = 1/2 and A = 2/3,       then (17) tells us that        understates c by about
.03[= l/2(.10)] in all private industry and by .05 [= 1/3(1.4)] in manufacturing.
As a result, the impact of unionism drops to .ll(= .14 — .03) in all private

industry and to .05 in manufacturing (= .10 —             .05).   These estimates are

markedly smaller than those obtained in Table 3 but still indicate that the

impact of unionism is far from negligible. We conclude that, while omitted

within—establishment factors may account for some of the estimated sizeable

impact of collective bargaining on fringes, a substantial separate effect

remains.



Spillover Model

       The omitted establishment model analyzed thus far has ignored the likelihood

that organization of blue—collar workers will cause firms to raise the fringes

of white—collar workers. To the extent that such patterns are significant,

the estimates which "correct" for omitted firm factors will bias downward the

 true union impact. While analysis of within—firm effects is complicated,
it is possible by modifying the model of (13) to (15) to obtain a rough

notion   of the impact of unionism on white—collar fringes and to use the
estimated       impact to correct the blue—collar fringes equation for 'spillovers.'

The key to a spillover analysis is a white collar fringe equation in which

white—collar fringes depend not only on white—collar compensation and

related variables but also on the presence of unionism in the plant

which   is analogous to (15) except that the coefficient on UN.       no longer
reflects       the impact of unions on blue—collar fringes but rather the difference

between the effect on blue—collar fringes and on white—collar fringes. To

isolate the effect on blue collar fringes reflected in the parameter c,

it is necessary to estimate A and sW. We can estimate 5W from (19)

if some way can be found to eliminate h.. The most direct approach

is to expand the model to include an equation for total white—collar

compensation:

        (21) lnC1W =         WUNW   + rwx. + WUN + Wh +U1w

where the compensation of white collar workers depends on unionism of

blue collar workers through , on their own (negligible) organization

through c, on the other factor X, and on the omitted establishment factor,

with a scaling factor            which permits a different establishment effect

on total compensation than on fringes.

     Now (21) can be solved for h. and the resultant expression substituted

into (19) to obtain an equation relating the fringes of white collar workers

to the unionism of blue collar workers with the omitted establishment

factor eliminated:

        (22)     lnFj'W = aW   + (sW4W/cW)UNi +
                                                  (bW_)lnc1J + (cw_l/4)UNiw

                 (dW_rW))x + ,w -

        Since    E(U.WC.W)      0, however, ordinary least squares estimates of (22)

will yield biased coefficients. To correct for this, an instrument is

needed which is correlated with              but not with U or         The obvious
                                                                                   -'U

 while E(C1 Ui') = E(C1      jW)    =    0.

         Instrumental   variable estimates of (22) are given in columns 3 and 4 of

 table 5. Note that in these equations the ln compensation of office

 workers is instrumented on the ln compensation of rionoffice workers,
                                   frj        4       — j.    ...   t.   ..   '-
 in   accord with the preceding argument, whereas in the equations for

 nonoff ice worker fringes in the table, ln compensation of office workers

 was instrumented on the ln straight time pay of office workers. The

 estimates reveal a moderate impact of unionism on white collar fringes,

 ranging from .10 in manufacturing to .13 in all industry. From these

 calculations, there would appear to be some validity to the industrial

 relations belief that trade unionism affects the compensation package of

 white as well as blue collar workers.

        In    the spillover model the coefficient on collective bargaining in
 equation (15) is the difference between the union impact on blue collar
 fringes      and the multiplicand of the union impact on Mhite collar fringes

 and the within establishment A parameter:

        (23) 1    =w       so that c =            +

We can solve (23) for the desired parameter using the estimates in

 table 5.      In all private industry, the coefficient of collective bargaining

 b) in the nonoffice worker equation is .14; the coefficient of collective

 bargaining in the office worker equation(s'5is .13. The estimated value

 of A, the enterprise specific parameter, is .33 but, by the arguments

 given earlier, the actual value of A may be as high as two—thirds. With

b =    .14,      = .13 and A =   .33, the estimate of c is .17. With b = .14,
 s    = .13 and AA =   .67, the estimate of c is .23. In manufacturing where
           A
b = .07 and s = .10, c is estimated to be .10 when A = .33 and to be .14

when A is .67. Taking account of the impact of unionism on white

collar fringes raises the estimated effect on blue collar fringes in the

omitted enterprise factor model to levels approaching those in the cross—

error) on unionism from the resultant regression of lnF1_X1nF1W on the

various explanatory factors. As the value of A increases, the estimate

of c_AsW drops, particularly in manufacturing. Line 3 records the values of
 W
     from table 5. Line 4 uses (23-) to obtain the final estimate of c.

 The calculations show that while c_AsW varies greatly with

 different values of A, c does not. According to the final figures, unionism

 raises fringe spending, all other factors the same, by from .18 to .20 log

 points in all private industry and by .10 to .13 points in manufacturing.

       The estimates of the spillovcr model suggest that blue collar unionism

 may have a sizeable impact on white collar fringes, making the 'brothers'

type of correction for within—establishment omitted factors incorrect. The

estimates should, however, be viewed solely as illustrative of potential

magnitudes of spillover impacts and not as a test of the existence of spillovers.

The model of (l9)—(23) provides no test of the direction of causality of

the linkages (any more than did the omitted factor model in Table 5); it

measures the union influences solely by presence of a contract in the plant,

rather than by provision of specific fringes; and it was not based on the

type of case histories that might provide sufficiently strong prior knowledge

to permit definite conclusions from the calculations.

       These errors of omission notwithstanding, the model does suggest the

possibility that unionism affects white—collar as well as blue—collar

 V.   Conclusion

       The analysis and findings of this paper can be summarized briefly:

  (1) Because of the political nature of unionism, which makes them more

  representative of average then of marginal worker preferences and more

  sensitive to intensities of preference; and because of the role of unions

  as stable market institutions; and possibly because unions provide more

  accurate information about worker preferences for fringes than can be

  garnered fron individual bargaining, unionism can be expected to raise the

  fringe share of the compensation package; (2) Estimates of the impact of

  unionism on the fringes of blue collar workers show the expected effect,

  with the magnitude depending on the particular statistical model used for

  estimation. The estimated effect of unionism is sizeable in regressions

  which compare organized and nonorganized establishment.s; are reduced when

  omitted firm factors are taken into account; but are raised when allowance

  is made for the possible effect of blue—collar unions on the fringes paid white—.

 collar workers in the same establishment; (3) The effect of unionism on fringes

  is especially large for deferred compensation like pensions, life, accident

  and health insurance, in accord with a priori expectations, and is greater

  for low wage and small firms; (4) Because of the sizeable impact of unionism

  on fringes and the importance of fringes in the wage bill, standard estimates

  of the union wage effect understate the differential between unionized

  and otherwise comparable nonunion workers.

    This model assumes that the firm is indifferent between paying fringes

    or paying hourly rates. See pages 8—9 for a discussion of why firms might

    prefer one form of compensation over the other.

          3The assumption that ordering worker by attachment to the firm also

     orders them by preferences for fringes is the key assumption in the analysis.

     In the model all workers of the same tenure with a firm are treated as if

     they had the same preference for fringes, making the difference in tenure

     the sole cause of different desires. When worker preferences for fringes

     differ for reasons unrelated to attachment to the firm, the competitive

     market will produce different sets of compensation packages, with more

     fringes in some establishments to attract those preferring fringes, and

     less in others. Variation of this type is ignored to concentrate on the

     situation in which preferences differ by potential mobility or tenure in the firm.


         4See W. Kip Viscusi (1977) for detailed discussion of this maximized

    in the context of work quality.


         5Leontief's 1946 article on the guaranteed annual wage makes this

    argument using the standard Edgeworth box.

         6The information argument can be investigated further by analyzing

    the extent to which, other factors fixed, union negotiated fringes "spill—

    over" to nonunion firms. Since the nonunion firm will imitate the union

    employer only if workers prefer the allocation of the wage bill in the

    union sector, the existence of a positive spillover could be taken as evi-

    dence of a better information flow. If there were no additional information

    about preferences in the union package, nonunion firms would not be influenced
     by the composition of the union settlement.

              The union variable is coded 1 if 50+   percent   of nonoff ice workers

     (or office worke.rs) are covered by collective bargaining. While        thi.
     implies that some workers who are not covered by contracts are included

     while some who are.not.are.countedas.nonorganjzedBLs eperts:
                                                                                       .•

     nonoffice   workers are covered and that none are covered in establishments

     when less than 50 percent are covered is reasonable.

              8Since the regressions deal with establishments and include size

      variables, there is no reason to expect any major problems.

              9The May CPS files were used because union membership is included

      in the May survey. The estimates were obtained from the basic data using

      unweighted counts of union and nonunion members.

              100mission of the variable had little effect on the results.


              "The problem is identical to that of estimating a consumption

      function in which C is regressed on Y, where Y = C + I.

          12
               The scaling factor is, of course, arbitrary as the variable is unobserved.

           13Since we have scaled h. to have an effect of         for blue collar workers,

     on alternative scale must be used if we are to permit the omitted factor

      to affect the two groups of workers differently. A scaling of 1 has the

     virtue of algebraic simplicity.

         14An alternative way to handle the consistency problem is to specify a

   priori values of X, save Xlnf1W to the left hand side, and estimate the resultant

   equation by least squares. With ifW as part of the dependent variable,

                is uncorrelated with'the explanatory variables.      While in many problems,

   a value of A =    1.0   can be defended in terms of the deFiinetti.exchangeability cri-

   terion this is not the case in the current problem. Blue—collar and white—collar

   workers are identifiably different and there is no reason to expect firm 'paterrralisiu'

   to treat them identically. Table 6 gives estimates conditional on prior values of A.
