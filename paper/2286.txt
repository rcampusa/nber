                   The Cost of Capital in the U.S0 and Japan:
                                  A Comparison




                                   ABSTRACT



      This paper uses financial statement data for large samples of U.S. and

 Japanese nonfinancial corporations to estimate the return to capital in each

country for the period 1967-83. Interpreting these as measures of the cost of

capital, we find that the before-tax cost of corporate capital was higher for

U.S. firms than for their Japanese counterparts, with the average gap

potentially as high as 5.8 percentage points. The use of alternative

measurement techniques alters the gap slightly but does not alter the basic

finding. However, market returns in the two countries were much closer during

the same period.

     Certain potential explanations for the gap in returns are rejected by

empirical evidence, including differences in corporate taxation, differences in

borrowing and differences in asset mix. This leaves three potential

explanations: differences in risk, differences in the tax treatment of

individual capital income and imperfections in the international flow of

capital.

1.   Introduction


     In the past few years, the enormous U.S. trade deficit and, in

particular, the bilateral trade deficit with Japan, has led to serious

industrial and political problems in the U.S., with trade-sensitive industries

experiencing serious declines in demand and employment and seeking protection

and trade sanctions. The severity of these problems has led economists and

others to search for their source. Certainly a major factor implicated is the

U.S. federal budget deficit, which has hovered around 5 percent of GNP in

recent years, far above the levels previously experienced during peacetime.

These deficits have been blamed for high real interest rates which, in turn,

helped keep the U.S. dollar strong until the past two years. Though the U.S.

trade balance has very recently improved somewhat, it still remains quite large

long after the dollar's decline began.

     Other attempts to explain Japan's favorable trade position with respect

to the U.S. have focused on differences between the structure of the Japanese

and American economies and government policies toward business. Some have

suggested that Japanese business is more efficiently organized, while others

have argued that Japan imposes barriers to American firms' attempts at

establishing markets, either through explicit policy actions or collusive

behavior among government, industry and the banking sector. An additional

possible explanation, which is the subject of this paper's investigation, is

that Japanese firms face a lower cost of capital, giving capital intensive

Japanese companies a competitive advantage over their American rivals.

     This explanation is not entirely independent of the others already

mentioned, since the U.S. cost of capital would be elevated by the high real
                                      —2—



interest rates induced by domestic deficits, and Japanese borrowing costs

could be lowered by targeted lending below market rates. There are, however,

many additional factors that could contribute to a cost of capital

differential between the two counties. These include differences in the

taxation of capital income, capital market restrictions that could cause the

higher Japanese level of savings to drive down domestic returns to capital

rather than flow abroad, and differences in the perceived riskiness of

investments or investor attitudes toward risk in the two countries.

     Our approach involves the use of market and financial statement data for

nonfinancial corporations in the U.S. and Japan. We extend our earlier study

on the same subject (Ando and Auerbach, 1985) by considering a large part of

the nonfinancial corporate sector in each country rather than a small

representative sample of firms, and by testing the sensitivity of our measures

of the cost of capital to a variety of alternative assumptions. All of the

measures we use are based on observed returns of corporations. The

fundamental premise that underlies this approach is that, in the long run,

corporations will earn, before tax, a rate of return relative to the value of

their securities just sufficient to achieve their cost of capital, taking

account of risk, taxes, and the required returns to holders of debt and

equity. This need not be the case in any given year, since unanticipated

events can cause returns to be above or below their expected values. Hence,

we compute our statistics over a period of nearly two decades, extending from

1967 to 1984 (to 1983 for Japan).

2.   The Data and Initial Estimates


     Our data source for the U.S. is the COMPUSTAT Tapes,1 and for Japan the

NEEDS-NIKKEI Financial Data Tapes.2 Information on both tapes is both based

on published reports from companies themselves, and while they are similar

enough to make comparisons between the two countries possible, we must be

careful to allow for a number of critical differences in institutions

including accounting rules used in the two countries, as well as tax laws. We

shall discuss the critical differences involved and make some adjustments for

them as we proceed with our analysis.

     We begin, in Table 1, with familiar ratios of earnings to price after

taxes and the rate of return on total capital before and after taxes, without

any adjustment. The rate of return on total capital before tax is defined as

earnings after tax plus taxes plus interest payments divided by the sum of

total financial debt and the market value of equity. The return after tax

equals earnings after tax plus interest payments, less the imputed tax

deduction received for the interest payments, divided by the same base. We

see that, for Japan, the earnings price ratio generally declines slowly during

the period of 1967 to 1983, while the total return to capital is very low and

does not have any discernible trend.

     For the U.S., the trend is less obvious, with the earnings-price ratio

increasing during the 1970s, then falling recently. Because of the increased

real interest rates in the U.S., there is no decline on returns to capital in

the 1980s, with such returns having been stable since about 1978. For Japan,

except for a period in the mid 1970s, the returns to capital have been quite
                                      -4-


stable. Overall, the numbers suggest a rate of return to capital that is much

higher in the U.S. than in Japan.



3.   Adjustments to the Measured Rates of Return


     These figures should not be taken too seriously because they require a

series of adjustments in order for them to be meaningful, and for figures for

the two countries to be comparable. There are five potentially major

adjustments that we will consider in this paper, three of them related to

inflation and the remaining two associated with institutional differences

between the two countries.


A.   Correction for Depreciation Under Inflationary Conditions

     In both Japan and the U.S., reported depreciation is based on original

cost. It is well known that this procedure understates the amount of

depreciation under inflationary conditions, and to this extent earnings and

the net return on capital will be overstated.

     To correct for this understatement of depreciation, we begin by assuming

that depreciation would be properly measured in the absence of inflation since

we are unable to assume otherwise. To restate depreciation based on original

cost in current dollar terms requires information on the vintage structure of

each year's overall depreciation, since the price factor by which book

depreciation must be inflated depends on the age of the asset to which the

depreciation applies. We produce an estimated vintage structure in the

following manner.3 We first assume that the net (of depreciation) capital

stock listed in the first year requires no correction. This is reasonable,
                                        —5-



given the low rates of inflation in both countries in the years immediately

preceding the mid-1960s. We then assume that each corporation's depreciable

assets are written off using the declining balance method at a single rate.

Finally, using the perpetual thventory method, we solve for the value of this

rate that would yield the listed book value for net capital in the last year

for which data are available. That is, the declining balance rate, 6, is

defined implicitly by:

(1)          =
                 K   •
                         (16)T   +   (15)T1   +


where Kt is the book value of net capital at the end of year t and    is the

book value of gross investment during year t. Since all these values of I and

K are positive, the solution for 6 is unique. There are additional problems

presented by each country's data set. For Japan, there are no separate

figures listed for gross investment. We impute an investment series from the

sum of depreciation and the first difference of the net capital stock. For

the U.S., there are no separate figures for land and depreciable assets, only

the sum. This should lower the estimate of the average depreciation rate,

since land is nondepreciable. In addition, the treatment of assets acquired

through merger rather than direct investment is inconsistent; they appear in

the capital stock, but are not in reported investment. We performed

calculations for the U.S. using both reported investment and, as was necessary

for Japan, imputed investment. Estimated values of 6 were generally lower and

more reasonable (given previous estimates) when imputed investment was used.

Because of this, as well as to be as consistent as possible in our

methodologies for the two countries, we present calculations based on imputed
                                       -6-


rather than actual investment. The depreciation rates are interesting in

their own right and are given for both countries in Table 2. The variation

across industries is consistent with general expectations. Firms in the

construction industry, for example, evidence very rapid rates compared to

retailers, whose capital is largely in the form of build-ings.

      In general, the estimated depreciation rates for Japan are higher than

those for the U.S. Clearly, one explanation, which we accept, is that

Japanese assets actually do depreciate more rapidly, because of such factors

as differences in composition. For example, land is excluded from the

calculations for Japan. However, there may be other factors that reflect

accounting differences rather than economic ones, such as the greater

flexibility U.S. firms have in choosing depreciation for tax purposes and

financial accounting purposes. This is an issue which would benefit from

further consideration.

      With these estimated rates of economic depreciation, we went back and

estimated current dollar capital stocks using the expression:


(2)        K =     * (K   * (1_6)T/p   +   I   *   * T11   +



where Pt is a price index (the gross national expenditure deflator for Japan
and the gross domestic business product deflator for the U.S.). Depreciation

in year 'c is estimated to be o*K1, and the difference between this measure

and the listed book measure is subtracted from earnings.

      This adjustment lowers the net return on equity on average by about

2 percent in both Japan and the U.S.
                                       —7-.




B.   Capital Gains and Losses on Financial Assets and Liabilities

     Under inflationary conditions, firms earn real capital gains on financial

liabilities that are fixed in nominal terms, while they incur real capital

losses on financial assets fixed in nominal terms. The ratio of earnings to

price suffers from the lack of adjustment for both of these possibilities,

and hence the earnings price ratio must be corrected for the net capital gain

(or loss) accruing to the net debtor-creditor position of the firm. The ratio

of total return to capital, however, is unaffected by the capital gain on

debt, because the return on equity should be adjusted for the gain on the debt

while the return to creditors must be adjusted for the same gain in the

opposite direction, thus cancelling each other out. Therefore, in the case of

the total return on capital, the required adjustment is only on the capital

loss on nominally fixed financial assets of the firm, net of nominal

liabilities not classified as debt.4

     We have made these corrections on both Japanese and U.S. data. Because

Japanese firms tend to have more financial assets relative to real assets, the

adjustment to the total return on capital is somewhat larger for Japanese

firms than for U.S. firms. Because Japanese firms also have more debt, net of

financial assets, the average correction to the earnings price ratio is much

larger for Japan, at 6.2 percentage points, than for the U.S., at 2.3

percentage points.


C.   Adjustments to the Cost of Inventory Sold

     As is well known, the use of certain inventory accounting systems, such

as First-Out (FIFO), understates the cost of goods sold during inflationary
                                      -8-


periods and therefore causes the earnings of the firm to be overstated. This

overstatement of profits is much smaller under the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)

system, although it is not altogether eliminated, while under other systems

such as the average cost method the overstatement of earnings typically is

smaller than under FIFO but greather than under LIFO.

     The algorithm used to restate the cost of goods sold proceeds as follows.

First, we assume that firms use either FIFO, LIFO or Average Cost accounting

in each year. Other methods listed (such as Specific Cost) are assigned to

whichever of these three major methods they most closely resemble, in our

judgment.

     Based on stated methods, we then estimate, for each firm in Japan, the

predominant method of accounting for inventories in each year. For the U.S.,

the predominant method is already indicated by Compustat. Each firm is

assumed to account for all its inventories using its predominant method.

Because there were occasional switches in this method over time (in the U.S.

usually toward the use of LIFO) we allow one break during the sample period

where the predominant method may change (there were few cases of multiple

switches, and these were ignored). Thus, a firm switching from FIFO to LIFO

in 1973 will be assumed to have a FIFO fraction of 1.0 through 1972 and a LIFO

fraction of 1.0 thereafter.

     To perform the inventory corrections, once the method of accounting has

been determined, we begin by assuming that all goods purchased in a given year

had a price equal to that year's price index, and that the initial year's

inventories are correctly stated. We then use book information on the cost of

goods sold and the change in inventories to estimate a time series of the cost
                                       —9-


of goods sold in current dollars. The method by which this -is done is

different for each of the three methods. For LIFO, no change in cost of goods

sold is made unless book inventories declined, in which case the last previous

year of accumulation not already run down in the intervening years is

determined and an appropriate price correction made. For FIFO, a one-year

price adjustment is necessary for those goods sold in the current year

attributable to initial inventory stocks. For average cost, our correction is

based on the assumption that goods purchased in the current year are added to

stocks and the price corresponding to the cost of goods sold is the average

price at which this pool of goods in inventory is carried.

     Once a current dollar measure of the cost of goods sold has been

calculated the difference between it and the book cost of goods sold is

subtracted from book earnings. This adjustment lowers the average after-tax

earnings price ratio by 1.2 percentage points for the U.S. and 2.7 percentage

points for Japan. It is thus of similar -importance, quantitatively, as the

capital consumption correction discussed above.


0.   Special Problems of Japanese Accounting Practices

     There are obvious differences between the accounting standard followed by

U.S. firms and that followed by Japanese firms. Without making any judgment

about their relative merits, for the purposes of comparing them against each

other, it is obvious that we have to make adjustments for significant

differences in accounting practices.

     One type of accounts that appears quite often in the records of

Japanese firms but much less so in those of U.S. firms is "reserves.t' These
                                         -10-


are book entries which represent future costs to the firm resulting from its

current actions. For example, suppose the firm hires a worker during period

t, and incurs an obligation to pay him a certain amount of severance indemnity

at the time of his retirement in period t + 1.   The Japanese tax law then

allows the firm to record a contribution to this obligation in period t and to

deduct such a contribution from the earnings of the firm in period t for tax

purposes, subject to some well defined limitations. "Reserve" accounts are

used strictly for record keeping purposes, since contributions of the firm to

the severance indemnity are not made until the worker actually retires. Thus,

such reserve accounts should not be included among debts of the firm when

computing the total return to capital.

     In our computation for Japanese companies, we have excluded the item

"Accrued Employees' Severance Indemnities" from the total liabilities of the

firm but left most other reserve accounts as recorded.5 The exclusion of

"Accrued Employees' Severance Indemnities" increases the earnings-price ratio

by an average of 1.1 percentage points. We have left other accounts labeled

"reserves" included in the liabilities of Japanese firms for the present

calculation because we are less sure of their nature.

    A second potentially troublesome class of balance sheet items for

Japanese firms are financial assets. There are strong indications, from the

appearance of data themselves and from our conversations with Japanese

economists, that Japanese firms hold a proportionately larger amount of safe

financial assets than U.S. firms. If this is so and such financial assets are

financed by financial liabilities, this may cause the measured overall rate of

return to appear low in Japan even if the rate of return on real assets is
                                      —11—


not. We address this issue in our discussion below of the sensitivity of our

results to alternative assumptions.


E.   Adjusted Measures of the Rate of Return

     The adjusted rates of return are reported in Table 3. For Japan, the

earnings price ratio rises substantially because of the large inflation—

induced gain on financial liabilities, with the average rising from

6.5 percent to 9.2 percent. The before tax rate of return on total capital

drops from 9.5 percent to 6.5 percent. The latter falls because accounting

for the net loss on financial assets and understatement of depreciation and

inventory costs due, to inflation offsets the correction for the overstatement

of liabilities due to the presence of pension reserves. As before, the

Japanese earnings price ratio falls steadily over the period, but both

measures of the return to capital are relatively stable. This difference in

trends can be attributed to the steady decline since 1975 in Japanese

debt-value ratios, which are shown in Table 4 (as are those for the U.S.).

From a peak of 69 percent in 1972, the ratio of corrected debt to corrected

debt plus equity fell to 58 percent in 1983, with a sample average of 63

percent.

     For the U.S., the correction lowers the earnings price ratio slightly

(from 9.4 percent to 8.4 percent) because the gain on financial liabilities is

much smaller than in Japan. Thus, the corrected Japanese earnings price ratio

average is actually somewhat higher. There is also a reduction in the average

estimated returns t,o capital for the U.S. similar to those for Japan once

corrections are made. Thus, the average before-tax returns still differ
                                      —12—


substantially by 5.8 percentage points, 12.3 percent for the U.S. versus 6.5

percent for Japan. This entire gap is attributable to the period after 1972.

For the period 1967—72, the average returns to capital in the two countries,

both before-tax and after-tax, are nearly identical.

     These results are somewhat at variance with our earlier study, which

failed to identify a significant cost of capital differential between the two

countries. This indicates the value of examining more comprehensive sample of

firms, as we have here. Our estimated costs of capital and estimated gap are,

however, broadly consistent with the findings of Hatsopoulos and Brooks (1986).



4.   Possible Explanations for the Cost of Capital Gap


     In the previous section, we presented measures of the corrected earnings

price ratios and returns to capital for the U.S. and Japan. From these, it

appears that Japan has had a consistently lower cost of capital during the

past two decades, measured by the before tax return to capital. In this

section, we consider several explanations of the differences in the returns to

capital, some that would account for a cost of capital gap and others that

would attribute the gap in returns to factors other than an underlying

capital cost difference.


A.   Differences in Corporate Tax Positions

     Few have argued that Japanese companies enjoy more generous tax benefits

on real investments than their American counterparts. If they did, however,

this could help account for a lower Japanese cost of capital. This issue is

easily addressed by comparing the before—tax and after-tax returns to capital
                                      —13—


in the two countries. By construction, the gap in returns includes not only

taxes actually paid but also the taxes avoided through interest deductions.

Hence, they may be viewed as the taxes associated with real investment

decisions, leaving out the additional tax consequences of borrowing. The

latter are considered separately below. This distinction is useful because it

allows us to measure separately the effects of the tax system, given financial

policy, and the impact of differences in financial incentives and policies.

     In the U.S., the average effective tax rate (equal to the difference

between before-tax and after-tax returns divided by the average before-tax

return) is 54 percent. In Japan, it is 65 percent. The absolute tax wedge is

larger in the U.S., 6.7 percentage points versus 4.2 percentage points, but

this still leaves a gap of 3.3 percentage points between the after-tax returns.


B.   The Greater Use of Borrowed Funds in Japan

     The average corrected returns to equity in the U.S. and Japan are very

similar, 8.4 percent versus 9.2 percent; so are the average real returns to

debt, 2.7 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively. Hence, in a statistical

sense, one may attribute the higher U.S. returns to capital to lower U.S.

debt-equity ratios. This does not imply, of course, that the gap would

disappear if U.S. companies borrowed more. The Modigliani-Miller, Theorem,

perhaps the most fundamental result in finance, reminds us that, except for

the differential tax treatment of debt and equity and the increase in firm

risk (such as through a higher probability of bankruptcy) associated with more

borrowing, changes in debt-equity ratios cannot affect the cost of capital.

An upper bound for the tax advantage to debt is the value of the interest
                                      -14—


deduction, since there are personal taxes in both countries favoring returns

to equity via the preferential treatment of capital gains. Hence, if Japanese

firms borrow more because there are smaller nontax costs (i.e. increases in

firm risk) to borrowing than in the U.S., the maximum effect of this

additional borrowing on the cost of capital gap is the full value of the

additional interest deduction as a fraction of total capital costs.

     This upper bound on the net Japanese borrowing advantage is easily

calculated by estimating the before—tax returns to capital again, this time

ignoring the interest deduction, and seeing how much the gap in returns in the

two countries closes. The answer 15: very little. Ignoring the interest

deduction would raise the U.S. return to capital by an average of 1.6

percentage points and the Japanese return to capital by 1.8 percentage points,

for a maximum net difference of .2 percentage points in the cost of capital

attributable to additional borrowing in Japan. The effect is so small, in

part, because U.S. inflation and nominal interest rates were higher during

this period, making the interest deduction more valuable in the U.S. per

dollar of debt.


C.   Liquid Assets in Japan

     The Japanese firms in our sample hold substantially more liquid assets as

a fraction of their value than do their U.S. counterparts. There are several

possible explanations for this, such as the institutional requirement by

lenders that borrowers maintain compensating balances. Whatever the reason,

the presence of these low yield, low risk assets on Japanese balance sheets

probably acts to exaggerate the debt-equity ratios used to finance real

investments and the rates of return required and earned on such investments.
                                      —15-


     To measure the importance of this, we calculated (in two alternative

ways) the differences in average U.S. and Japanese ratios of liquid assets to

market value, and subtracted the implied "excess" liquid assets from both

sides of the Japanese balance sheet, at the same time subtracting the imputed

earnings on such assets based on the rate of return on deposite-like items

given in the Bank of Japan Statistical Monthly. This correction has the

desired effect of netting these extra liquid assets against debt •and adding

the gap between the borrowing cost and rate of return on such funds to the

cost of other borrowing for other assets.

     Depending on the measure of excess liquid assets, this correction raises

the average before-tax return to capital in Japan by .5 or 1.1 percentage

points, still leaving an apparent cost-of-capital gap of between 4.7 and 5.3

percentage points, of which at most .2 percentage points can be explained by

the greater level of Japanese borrowing.



5.   Market Return Measures of the Cost of Capital


     It is well known that the equities of firms with high growth prospects

often sell at price-earnings ratios well above any reasonable measure of the

inverse of the after tax cost of equity capital. This is fully rational if

investors anticipate that the firms have access to projects with hi9h marginal

products, since the excess returns (over the cost of capital) on these future

projects should be capitalized into the current stock price.6 This would

certainly not represent a cost of capital reduction, only a difference in the

composition of true economic earnings: a greater fraction would be accounted
                                      -16-


for by capital gains, in excess of retained earnings. Hence, our measures

thus far based on corrected book earnings would understate the cost of capital

for such firms. Since Japan has experienced a higher growth rate than the

U.S. in the past two decades, the lower earnings-price ratios in Japan may

simply mean that Japan is a composite of "growth firms" compared to the U.S.

     To assess this possibility, one must use data on returns to equity

investors that include the capital gains component. We consider one such

measure in this section, the actual holding period returns to equity in each

year, equal to dividends plus capital gains. This measure has the advantage

of being an observed return to the investors who determine the cost of equity

capital.7 Its major shortcoming is that it is extremely volatile, so that

even over several years its mean could be a very misleading measure of the

expected return to equity.8

     A second problem is that if there is a change in the cost of equity

capital, the market return to equity will move in the opposite direction in

the short run. For example, if the required return rises, share prices must

fall to permit subsequent returns to satisfy the new higher rate. Thus,

during the transition to a higher cost of capital, the estimated cost of

capital would actually be lower than the true value.

     With these potential problems in mind, we now present, in Table 5,

estimates based on this measure of the return to equity. We also present

calculations of the the overall returns to capital before tax and after tax

based on the returns to equity, following the same methodolgy used in

calculating corrected returns to capital from corrected equity measures in the

previous section. While the annual statistics of the measures are
                                        —17—


substantially more volatile than those based on corrected book earnings, the

sample averages are not unreasonable.

     For Japan, the average market return to capital, before tax, was 5.7

percent, close to the 6.5 percent average based on corrected book measures in

Table 3. It is worth pointing out, however, that the Japanese price earnings

ratio has increased over the same period. If this were due to a decline in

the equity cost of capital over time, then the argument given above would

suggest that the average of 5.7 percent based on actual market returns may

overstate the cost of capital over this period.

     For the United States, the average before tax return to capital based on

actual market returns is 8.1 percent, substantially below the corresponding

average corrected book measure given in Table 3, 12.3 percent. This lower

return is attributable to the very poor U.S. stock market performance during

the 1970s, when real returns averaged only 3.6 percent, which is well below

their historical average. If an historical measure were used in place of 3.6

percent, the resulting return to capital would be very close to that given in

Table 3. On the other hand, if we had been able to include data for the very

successful stock market year 1984 in Japan, this would have raised the sample

average return in that country.

     Because of the remaining uncertainties about these market-return-based

measures, we must conclude, therefore, that these additional data do not shed

much light on whether there really is a substantial gap in the cost of capital

between the two countries.

6.   Issues for Future Research


     What can be the source of the large apparent gap in the real before-tax

cost of funds in the U.S. and Japan? It is easier to identify incorrect

answers than correct ones. As we showed above, the fraction of before tax

corected earnings paid in corporate taxes is generally higher in Japan than in

the U.S. Put another way, the returns to capital, even after—tax, differ by a

substantial amount, suggesting that one must go beyond the corporate tax

burden to explain the differences in rates of return. A second explanation

that can account for at most a small fraction of the difference is the

combination of tax deductibility of interest payments and the greater Japanese

use of debt in corporate capital structure.

     The problem, then, is to explain the large gap in the after-tax returns

to capital in the two countries. There are at least three possible

explanations, each having different policy implications. The first is that

Japanese firms may be less risky than those in the U.S. or Japanese investors

less risk averse than U.S. investors. In either case, a lower risk premium

would be required to satisfy investors.

     This argument is related to the one we considered above, that the

Japanese rate of return on real, presumably risky investment, is understated

by the combination of such assets with substantial liquid assets on corporate

balance sheets. However, our findings are that the returns are lower in Japan

even when the mix of assets is standardized in the two countries. The

evaluation of whether the real investments of Japanese corporations are less

risky or Japanese investors less risk averse would require data and
                                      —19


theoretical modelling beyond the scope of this paper, but represents one

important line for future research.

     There remain two other possible explanations for the lower returns in

Japan that we cannot address using our data. One is that Japanese households

require a lower return from corporations because of the favorable individual

tax treatment of capital income. This explanation has been suggested by

Shoven and Tachibanaki (1985), who estimated a much lower rate of capital

income taxation at the individual level in Japan. However, for this

explanation to hold, it would also be necessary that the favorable Japanese

tax treatment of individual savings apply only to domestic assets. Otherwise,

the same saving incentive would also reduce the cost of capital for purchases

of U.S. assets by Japanese savers directly or by the Japanese firms in which

they hold debt and equity. A second possibility is that the large pool of

Japanese savings has not, at least until recently, been permitted free access

to foreign capital markets, forcing funds generated in Japan to be invested at

lower rates than those prevailing in the U.S. and elsewhere.

     It is difficult to know which of these three explanations are

quantitatively important. More research is clearly needed and would be

valuable, since the appropriate policy responses would be different according

to the source of the difference in the rates of return. If riskiness or

attitudes toward risk differ, there is little action warranted. If capital

markets have been closed, then the recent trend toward liberalization should

lead to a reduction in the gap. If individual tax differences are important,

then a reconsideration of their effects, both in the U.S. and Japan, may be

appropriate. Recent and pending changes between the two countries with
                                     -20-


respect to the tax treatment of savings and the openness of capital markets

should provide the opportunity for future empirical research to address these

questions.

These tapes cover most firms listed on the New York and American Stock

Exchanges. We have excluded all financial firms from our analysis. Our

sample size is 1095, except for the calculations reported in Table 5, for

which we have complete data for 1443 firms..

2.   Since we have not been able to arrange direct access to these tapes, we

are most grateful to Professors Fumio Hayashi and Kanemi Ban of Osaka

University who carried out the basic computations on Nikkei tapes available at

Osaka University and made the results available to us. Here again, firms

included are all those listed on the Tokyo Exchange, excluding financial

firms. The sample size is 1287, and 1297 for the calculations reported in

Table 5.

3.   This procedure was also used by Auerbach (1984), where it is described

and evaluated more fully.

4.   An unambiguous determination of nominal assets and liabilities is

difficult. The use of alternative measures caused estimated rates of return

to move up and down in the U.S. and Japan by as much as 1.5 percentage points,

but with virtually no impact on the differences between the countries.

5.   To bring the accounting with respect to this item to a cash basis as in

the case for U.S. corporations, we have subtracted the net change in this

account from the current costs of Japanese companies.

6.   This can be rigorously shown using, for instance, the "q" theory of

investment. Suppose there is the anticipation that an outward shift will
                                      —22—


occur -in the production frontier in the future, increasing the marginal

product of capital. This will increase investment, and market value,

immediately, decreasing measured earnings in the short run because of capital

deepening. Hence, one would observe a low earnings-price ratio in the short

run. The capitalized value of higher future marginal products rises as their

date of appearance nears, giving investors a sufficient overall return to

equity.

7.   If the marginal source of equity funds is retained earnings, rather than

new shares, then one should adjust dividends in this calculation, multiplying

them by a factor less than 1 that represents the relative cost to the firm of

delivering an after—tax dollar to the investor in the form of capital gains as

opposed to dividends. This is the ratio (1-9)1(1-c), where 0 is the dividend

tax rate and c is the accrual-equivalent of the capital gains tax. See

Auerbach (1979, 1983). This correction is important in the current context to

the extent that dividend yields differ between the U.S. and Japan.

8.   An alternative measure is the sum of dividends plus the trend growth rate

of dividends (adjusted for the dilution of new share issues and net of the

annual inflation rate) since, in the long run, the rate of capital

appreciation of equity must equal the rate of dividend growth. Unfortunately,

the anomalous Japanese dividend behavior over this period makes such an

approach problematic. Over this entire period, aggregate dividends in our

sample adjusted for dilution did not grow in real terms! This remarkable fact

seems to be consistent with statistics reported in the Annual Report on

National Accounts of Japan's Economic Planning Agency (EPA). Moreover, many

of the Japanese companies in our sample had zero dividends at the beginning or
                                      —23-


the end of the sample period, making the calculation of a growth rate

impossible.

9.   The geometric average real rate of return on common equity in the U.S.

over the period 1926-86 was 7.0 percent; the arithmetic average was 9.0

percent. See Ibbotson Associates (1987).
