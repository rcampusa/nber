                                            ABSTRACT

We show how the economic incentives to remain in the labor force induced by Sweden’s public
old-age pension system and disability insurance program have changed between 1980 and 2015.
Based on earnings histories for different hypothetical individuals corresponding to groups by
gender and educational attainments we calculate the following measures: the replacement rate
(RR), the social security wealth (SSW), the accrual in the social security wealth from working
one additional year as well as the implicit tax rate on working longer (ITAX). We then investigate
to what extent the observed changes in these measures concur with changes in employment rates
among older workers.

1. Introduction

Labor force participation of men in the age group 60 to 64 has changed dramatically over the
most recent decades in Sweden. In the early 1980s more than 70 percent of this age group
participated in the labor market. By the end of the 1990s, this decreased to around 55
percent. Since then, however, it has been a steady increase in the participation rate and in
2016 labor force participation in this group exceeded 75 percent. For females there is partially
another story. In the 1980s and 1990s there was still an increase in labor force participation
following the large overall trend towards increased female labor force participation. The
recent increase in labor force participation has, however, been very similar to the
development among males.

Over the same period, there has been a steady improvement in health for both males and
females and there have also been improvements in the work environment. The population
has become more educated (see, e.g., Laun and Palme, 2018). Guided by the correlation
between all these characteristics in the population and the labor force participation in old
ages, we would expect a steady increase in employment among the elderly during the past
decades, but, as described above, this prediction only concurs with the development since
the late 1990s.

During the 35-year period covered in this study there has also been several changes in income
taxes and public income security programs that have affected the economic incentives for the
workers to stay in the labor force. The most important changes are the major reform of the
income tax system in 1991; the introduction of earned income tax credits in a series of
reforms starting in 2008; a large reform of the old-age pension system replacing the old
defined benefit scheme with a notional defined contribution (NDC) scheme; introduction of
gradually more stringent eligibility rules for the Disability Insurance (DI) program; and, finally,
a change in the rules for mandatory retirement in 2001.

In this paper we focus on the effect of the reform of the old-age pension system and the
stricter eligibility rules in DI and use earnings histories of different hypothetical workers to
calculate changes in the economic incentives to stay in the labor force between 1980 and
2015. This means that that we leave out several changes in incentives that may have played
a role such as changes in income taxes, negotiated occupational pension programs or private
pensions. We calculate three sets of measures for the economic incentives. First, the
replacement rate (RR) – the ratio between post- and pre-retirement earnings – and the social
security wealth (SSW). These two measures reflect the income level after retirement. Second,
the accrual in SSW of staying one additional year in the labor force, which measures the
marginal gain in benefits of remaining employed. Finally, the implicit tax of remaining
employed (ITAX), which includes both income levels and changes in income of staying one
additional year in one statistic.

The results show very large effects on economic incentives of the transition rules for the
implementation of the pre-reform old-age pension scheme in the 1980s. It is likely that these
incentives contributed to that very few claimed old-age pension before age 65 under the pre-
reform system. The dominant pathway for those who left the labor force earlier was the
Disability Insurance pathway.

                                                2
The results also show surprisingly small effects of the implementation of the new pension
scheme starting in 1999. This means that our results do not lend support to the claim that the
pension reform was the main reason behind the marked increase in labor force participation
rates among older workers since the late 1990s that coincided with the implementation of
the new pension system.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of changes in labor force
participation and employment rates between 1980 and 2015. Section 3 presents changes in
Sweden’s income security programs, income taxes and mandatory retirement rules over the
past 35 years. Section 4 explains the methodology behind the empirical analysis. Section 5
presents the results and, finally, Section 6 concludes.


2. Labor Force Participation of Older Workers in Sweden

Figure 1 shows the evolution of labor force participation in Sweden between 1980 and 2015
for the age groups 55-59, 60-64 and 65-69, respectively. The left panel shows the
development for men and the right one for women. For men, the most dramatic changes are
in the age group 60-64. For this group there is a U-shaped pattern over time. Starting above
70 percent in 1980; then decreasing to around 55 percent by the end of the 1990s; and then,
finally, recovering to around 75 percent by the end of the period. In the age group 55-59 there
are very small changes over the period included in the diagram, although the changes follow
the same pattern as in the 60-64 age group. Finally, in the age group 65-69 there is a steady
increase in LFP towards the end of the period, although it is from a very low level.

For females, Figure 1 shows a partially different development. Seen over the entire period,
there is an increase in the labor force participation rates in all three age groups. The main
background to this pattern is the overall trend toward higher labor force participation seen in
all industrialized countries. However, interestingly, one can see a slight decrease in the labor
force participation in the age group 60-64 during the 1990s parallel to the development for
men and a recovery, again parallel to the development for men.

                                                                     3
Figure 2 shows the development of the employment rate between 1980 and 2015 for the
same age groups as in Figure 1, again for males and females separately. Compared to Figure
1, it is evident that the general patterns of the developments are very similar, i.e., the changes
are not driven by changes in the unemployment rate. However, one can see that the decrease
in the employment rate following the economic crisis in the 1990s was more sizeable
compared to the corresponding decrease in labor force participation rates shown in Figure 1.

3. Institutional Changes

Figure 3 summarizes the main institutional changes affecting incentives to exit from the labor
market. The figure differentiates between four different fields of impact: old-age pensions,
mandatory retirement rules and early eligibility ages (EEA), the Disability Insurance program
(DI) and, finally, income taxes. In this section we will summarize the main changes. We follow
the same division of fields in our sub-sections as in Figure 3.




                                                                     4
Figure 3. Major institutional changes affecting incentives to exit from the labor market
between 1980 and 2015.


3.1 Old-age pension systems

The most important change in the old-age pension system between 1980 and 2015 was the
major pension reform decided in the Swedish parliament in 1998. In this reform, the old
Defined Benefit (DB) plan was gradually replaced by a scheme consisting of a pay-as-you-go
(PAYG) Notional Defined Contribution (NDC) scheme and a fully funded scheme where people
can choose between a large number of privately managed funds or stay in a default fund
managed by the pension authorities.

Those born in 1938 were the first ones to be assigned to the post-reform public pension
system. This cohort was in the post-reform system by 20 percent and by 80 percent in the
pre-reform system. After the 1938 cohort the share in the post-reform system was increased
by 5 percent per cohort, implying that those born in 1954 are fully covered by the post-reform
pension system.

3.1.1 The Pre-reform Public Old-age Pension System

The pre-reform public old-age pension system consisted of two main parts. The first part, the
Basic pension (Folkpension) is unrelated to the insured individuals’ previous earnings. For a
singled pensioner this pension amounts to 96 percent of a Basic Amount (BA)4 and is reduced
to 78.5 percent of a BA for a married pensioner. The BA indexes a large part of the Swedish
income security system. The BA is politically decided but follows the Consumer Price Index

                                              5
(CPI) very closely. It has deviated from the CPI on a few notable occasions.5 In 2018 the level
of the BA was 45,500 SEK.6

The second main part of the pre-reform public pension system is a supplementary pension
(Allmän tilläggspension, ATP). This part is related to the retirees’ previous earnings. The size
of the benefit is determined by equation (1):

                                         .
                𝑌" = 0.6 ∙ 𝐴𝑃" ∙ 𝑚𝑖𝑛 -01/ , 14 ∙ 𝐵𝐴,                                            (1)

where AP is the average pension points obtained by averaging the pension points of the 15
best years of the insured individual’s earnings history. The pension points are obtained from
dividing the individual’s annual earnings by the BA below the social security ceiling of 7.5 BA:s.
Earnings below 1 BA is not counted. N is the number of years the individual has positive
                                                                                                       .
pension points, i.e., contributed to finance the pension scheme. The expression 𝑚𝑖𝑛 -01/ , 14
implies that the benefit is linearly reduced if the individual contributes less than 30 years to
the system.

In addition to these two main parts, the pre-reform public pension system also includes a
Special Supplement (Pensionstillskott). The Special Supplement was introduced in 1969 and
given to those with no or very low supplementary pension. It is decreased on a 1:1 basis with
the supplementary pension (ATP).

Until 1997 all benefits from the pre-reform public old-age pension system could be claimed
from the month the insured individual turns age 60, with a life-long actuarial adjustment on
0.5 percent for each month of early withdrawal relative to age 65. After age 65, there was an
actuarial addition on 0.7 percent for each month of delayed withdrawal.7 In 1998 the age of
early withdrawal was changed to age 61.

An important feature of the pre-reform old-age pension system are the special rules during
the phasing-in of the program. Labor earnings for the income related part of the system was
recorded for the first time in 1960. Those born in 1914 or earlier only required 20 years of
                                                                                            .
contributions to receive full benefits and the benefits were linearly reduced by the factor 61,
where N is the number of years of contribution if the worker contributed less than 20 years.
For each birth cohort between those born in 1914 and 1924 one year of contributions were
added to this requirement. This means that for the 1915 birth cohort 21 years of contributions
were needed. The 1924 cohort were the first ones to meet the requirement of 30 years of
contributions.8


5
  The first time was between November 1980 and November 1982, when the BA was linked to a price index that
to a lesser extent reflected changes in oil and electricity prices than the CPI. The second time was when price
changes due to the 16 percent devaluation of the Swedish currency in 1982 was not fully accounted for in the
BA (see Palme and Svensson, 1999).
6
  About 4,000 € or 5,000 US$ in 2018.
7
  Until 1988, the actuarial addition beyond age 65 was 0.5 percent.
8
  Since labor earnings were recorded from age 16 and the first year this was done was in 1960, one could claim
the system was not fully matured until the cohort born in 1944 reached the normal retirement age at age 65 in
2009. This means that the ATP system was abolished before it was fully implemented.

                                                      6
3.1.2 The Post-Reform Public Old-age Pension System

The post-reform public pension system consists of three main parts. The first part is a
guaranteed benefit level (Garantipension) for those with no or low income related benefit
that is financed through the general state budget and indexed by the CPI. The benefit level is
independent of the insured individual previous contribution to the pension scheme. In 2018
the level of the benefit was set to 8,076 SEK (about 800 € or 880 US$) for single pensioners
and to 7,204 SEK for married.

The second and third parts of the post-reform system are financed through employers’
contributions. The part of these contributions devoted to the pension system is set to 18.5
percent of annual earnings. Of these 16.0 percentage points, or 86.5 percent, are devoted to
a pay-as-you-go NDC scheme and 2.5 percentage points, or 13.5 percent, to a fully funded
scheme.

The NDC system is based on individual notional accounts. The benefits are proportional to the
contributions made below the social security ceiling. Since 2003, as opposed to the pre-
reform pension system, the social security ceiling in the post-reform system is indexed by the
income basic amount, which is indexed by the Income index. The Income index measures the
percentage change in the average income from labor for all permanently living in Sweden
between age 16 and 64.9 The transition from indexing the social security index with a wage
rather than a price index is important, since it prevents the income related part of the pay-
as-you-go pension from “fading out” with economic growth.

The income basic amount is also used for indexing previous earnings. All individual
contributions recorded since 1960 are included in the individual accounts. Inheritance gains
from deceased individuals are allocated proportionally to still active persons in the same age
cohort proportionally to the size of their account balance (see Orange Report, 2017). The
accounts are also reduced by a factor corresponding to the administrative cost of the pension
system.

When the individual decides to retire, the account balance is divided by the so-called annuity
divisor to get the size of the annual pension benefit at the date of retirement. The annuity
divisor is a function of an interest rate, which is set to 1.6 percent, and the life expectancy of
the individual’s age cohort at 65. If the individual retires before age 65, the annuity divisor is
recalculated when he or she turns 65. For each year during retirement, the benefit is changed
following the adjustment indexation. At the turn of the year, the benefits are adjusted with
            78 /78:;
the factor <.1<=     , where It is the income index of the coming year and It-1 corresponds to the
past year. If there is a growth rate at exactly 1.6 percent there is no adjustment. If the real
wage sum grows faster than 1.6 percent, there is a real growth rate in the benefit levels.
However, if the growth rate is smaller, there will be a real decrease in the benefit levels.



9
  Formally, the Income index is based on the sum of labor income qualifying for old-age pension, i.e., labor
income above 42.3 percent of a BA, divided by the number of individual with a positive pension qualifying
income from labor.

                                                       7
Since the employers’ contribution to the NDC scheme is fixed to 16.0 percent of the annual
earnings, there is an uninsurable risk for the system to get financial problems, primarily
related to unexpected changes in life expectancies or a smaller labor force. To handle these
risks, the pension scheme includes a special “balancing mechanism” that lowers the benefits
proportionally in order to reach balance in expected incomes and liabilities of the NDC
system.10

In the third part of the post-reform public pension system, the fully funded Premium Pension
(PPM), the insured individual is able to choose between almost 850 different funds (see Palme
et al., 2007, for a more detailed overview of the Premium Pension). When the system was
introduced in the year 2000, all fund managers with an active business in Sweden were
allowed to participate in the system. However, since then, somewhat stricter rules for
participation have been implemented.

The system contains a default fund for those who do not make an “active choice” of fund
manager. When the system was introduced, about 68 percent avoided the default alternative
by choosing a different a fund manager. However, since then, the share of those who make
an active choice has decreased and today almost 50 percent of the insured individuals have
their savings in the default fund managed by the pension authorities.

The annual benefits from the fully funded part of the public pension are calculated using the
same annuity divisor as the NDC part. However, the advance rate is currently set to 1.75
percent, where 0.1 percent is reserved to cover administrative costs for the Swedish Pension
Agency. The premium pension can be drawn as a traditional insurance, where the fund shares
are sold at the date of retirement and managed by the Swedish Pension Agency, or as a fund
insurance, where the pension benefits remain in the fund chosen by the insured individual.


3.2 Mandatory retirement and early eligibility rules

Most of Sweden’s labor market is covered by central agreements between trade unions and
employers’ confederations. These include agreements on retirement ages and in most cases
the mandatory retirement age was 65. This was also supported in the labor market legislation.
Workers older than age 65 were not covered by employment security legislation and were
exempted from seniority rules. In addition, they were not covered by the unemployment
insurance (UI), disability insurance (DI) or the compulsory sick pay insurance. Central and local
government employees automatically lost their jobs at age 65. Exceptions from this rule were
permitted for one year only.

A new legislation implemented in 2001 postponed the mandatory retirement age to 67,
meaning that those aged between 65 and 67 were now covered by the employment security
legislation. The special rules for central and local government employees were also adjusted
to age 67. However, the rules for the income security programs remained at age 65 also after
the reform. Depending on ongoing collective agreements in some sectors of the labor market,
the reform was not fully implemented until 2003.

3.3 The Disability Insurance program

The Disability Insurance program replaces forgone earning due to permanent health
problems. Since 1980 there has been several changes of the program. A series of reforms that
gradually made the eligibility rules more generous were implemented in the 1970s. The most
important changes were the introduction of special eligibility rules for older workers (initially
older than age 63) and rights for older workers to receive Disability Insurance for labor market
reasons. These reforms were reversed in the 1990s. The eligibility to DI for long-term
unemployed workers older than age 60 were abolished in 1991. Six year later, in 1997, the
special eligibility rules were completely abolished. This meant that workers older than age 60
no longer had lower medical eligibility rules, had to participate in rehabilitation programs and
were covered by the same requirements for taking suitable jobs and accepting geographical
mobility as younger workers (see Karlström, Palme and Svensson, 2008, for a detailed
description of the reform and its effects on employment).

Before 2003, the Disability Insurance program was a part of the public old-age pension
system. Like the old-age pension, it consisted of a basic and an income related supplementary
part. In 2003, following the reform of the Swedish pension system, the DI program became
independent of the public old-age pension system. The benefits are calculated as 64 percent
of the “assumed income” below the social security ceiling. The “assumed income” is the
average of the five to eight best years of annual income from labor before the worker became
eligible to DI.

The reform in 2003 also included changes in eligibility rules for DI. The most important change
was that the DI benefit was no longer permanent; eligibility would be reconsidered every 5th
year. The Disability insurance program for those younger than age 30 changed name to
“Activity support” (Aktivitetsersättning) and the recipients were automatically required to
reapply for benefits when they turned 30. In addition, rehabilitation programs in collaboration
with unemployment offices were initiated.

In 2008 the government implemented a new reform of the DI system. The most important
element of the new eligibility rules was that the person applying for DI had to show that his
or her ability to work was permanently lost. For obvious reasons, this change implied that the
threshold for receiving DI increased significantly. Simultaneously, the rules for the sick pay
insurance program, which replaces foregone earnings from temporary health problems, was
changed so that the maximum spell length was limited to one year. The reform also implied
a much more structured rehabilitation program (Rehabiliteringskedjan) that was imposed
very early on in a sickness spell.

Figure 4 shows the development of DI prevalence and incidence between 1980 and 2011 for
males and females, respectively. The most striking result in Figure 4 is the sharp drop in DI
entry from the late 1980s to today. The analysis in Jönsson et al. (2012) indicates that changed
eligibility criteria during the 1980s and 1990s clearly affected program caseloads and may also
have had an impact on labor force participation. However, for our purposes the most
interesting change is the decline in DI entry since 2005. It is apparent that the background to
the decline is the more stringent eligibility rules following the reforms of the DI system in
2003 and 2008.


3.4 Income taxes

3.4.1 The 1991 income tax reform

In 1991 Sweden implemented a major reform of the income tax system – “The tax reform of
the century” (see Agell et al., 1996, or Björklund et al., 1995, for an overview). There were
four main elements of the reform.
1. The marginal tax rates were substantially lowered. The highest marginal tax rate in the
    pre-reform system was 75 percent. This rate was decreased to 50 percent and a majority
    of the income earners only paid municipality tax at around 30 percent after the reform.


                                                                            10
2. The tax base was broadened. Several “fringe benefits” from employment, such as free
   meals and cars, were included in the tax base after the reform.
3. Separate taxation of labor and capital income. In the pre-reform tax system income from
   labor and capital were added together and taxed at the same rate. After the reform the
   tax base was divided and all income from capital were taxed at a flat rate on 30 percent.
4. Increased child and housing allowances. To offset undesired effects on income inequality,
   the child allowance, which is unrelated to parental income, and the housing allowance,
   which is related to income and housing costs, were substantially increased.

3.4.2 Introduction of earned income tax credit schemes 2007-2014

In recent years, the most important change of income taxes is the introduction of the earned
income tax credit. The EITC was implemented in a series of reforms between 2007 and 2014.
Unlike in most other countries, the Swedish earned income tax credit was not phased out at
higher earnings.11 Importantly, the size of the tax credit was larger for workers who were
above age 65 at the beginning of the tax year. The earned income tax credit applies to
earnings, but not to income from public pension or public transfers. The tax credit is a function
of earned income, the basic deduction and the municipality income tax rate.

An additional element of the 2007 reform was that the payroll tax rate was reduced from
26.37 percent to 10.21 percent for workers above age 65 at the beginning of the tax year.12
The purpose was to stimulate the demand for older workers. The reforms in 2007
substantially increased the net-of-participation-tax rate of workers above age 65. The
introduction of the earned income tax credit also slightly increased the net gain from working
for workers below age 65, although not to the same extent. Laun (2017) analyzes the
combined effects of the earned income tax credit and the payroll tax reduction for workers
above age 65 and finds that the tax credits increased employment at the extensive margin
among workers just above age 65 by about five percent.

Overall, the changes in taxation for older workers are potentially important for encouraging
a delayed labor force exit above age 65, and there is evidence of a response to the tax credits
introduced in 2007. For workers below age 65, it is unclear if the smaller change in the tax
burden due to the introduction of the EITC in 2007 impacts the retirement decision in these
ages.


4. The Implicit Tax on Working Longer

Our measures of economic incentives to remain in the labor force are all based on the social
security wealth. The individual social security wealth at a particular age S is defined as the net
present value of all future social security benefits. It will depend on individual retirement age
R and which pathway k of the income security system that the individual chooses to exit from
the labor market, i.e.,

                   𝑆𝑆𝑊@,A (𝑅, 𝑖 ) = ∑GAHI 𝐵@,A,F (𝑅, 𝑖 )𝜎A,F 𝛽 FLI ,                (3)
11
     A phase-out range in the earned income tax credit was introduced in 2016.
12
     The payroll tax rate above age 65 was raised to 16.36 percent in 2016.

                                                       11
where t is an index for time and a for age; 𝜎A,F is the survival probability in time t at age a;
finally, 𝛽 is the discount factor.

Postponing retirement has two counteracting effects on the social security wealth. Delaying
retirement increases, through the actuarial adjustment in the pension system, the size of the
pension benefits. However, the individual will also receive fewer benefit payments, which will
decrease the social security wealth. The net value of these effects is measured in the benefit
accrual measure:

              𝐴𝐶𝐶@,A (𝑅, 𝑖 ) = 𝑆𝑆𝑊@,AN< − 𝑆𝑆𝑊@,A ,                                  (4)

for a particular exit path, k, out from the labor force. This measure could also be constructed
as a weighted average for all exit routes combined, i.e.,

              𝐴𝐶𝐶A (𝑅, 𝑖 ) = ∑Q
                              @H< 𝑝@," 𝐴𝐶𝐶A,@ (𝑅, 𝑖 ),                              (5)

where 𝑝@," is the individual specific probability to exit the labor market through path k.

From this measure we can obtain the following expression for the implicit tax rate on
remaining at the labor market:

              𝐼𝑇𝐴𝑋A (𝑅, 𝑖 ) = −(𝐴𝐶𝐶A (𝑅, 𝑖 ) − 𝑊AN< (𝑖 )𝑃𝑇AN< )/U𝑊AN< (𝑖 )(1 − 𝑇𝐴𝑋A (𝑖))V.     (6)

This implies that the tax on continued work is calculated as the gain in social security wealth
for working one additional year minus what the individual would have contributed to the
pension system through the payroll tax on labor earnings as a share of net labor earnings
during that additional year. The reversed sign is due to the fact that a tax by definition is a
reduction in wealth, meaning that a negative change in wealth is a positive tax. All
contributions to the pension system through the payroll tax made before the hypothetical
last year are regarded as sunk costs to the individual.

A negative tax rate tells us that the income security system works as a subsidy for continued
work given the assumed discount rate. This implies that it is rational for the individual to
remain in the labor force if he or she values work and leisure time equally. If the tax rate is
positive, the individual will remain in the labor force if he or she values the increase in social
security wealth higher than his or her valuation of leisure.

Empirical implementation

We calculate four different measures for the incentives to stay in the labor force for older
workers in Sweden between 1980 and 2015 for a number of representative (hypothetical)
individuals:
    • The replacement rate (RR)
    • The social security wealth (SSW)
    • Benefit accrual (ACC)
    • The implicit tax rate (ITAX)

                                                 12
                       The first two, the replacement rate and the social security wealth, measures the income or
                       the consumption possibilities of the individuals, and the second two, the implicit tax and
                       benefit accrual, the change in income of staying one additional year at the labor market.

                       The hypothetical individuals are obtained from three different education groups: 1. Low
                       educated with compulsory schooling, only; 2. Medium education, with vocational schooling
                       or secondary education; and 3. High education, with college or university education. We do
                       the calculations for singled men and women, separately. We assume that the low educated
                       are employed since age 16, the medium educated since age 20, and the high educated since
                       age 25.

                       To facilitate comparisons of how the social security system affects retirement in comparable
                       countries, represented in the other chapters of this volume, we use earnings profiles
                       combining data from the US (Us Current Population Survey, CPS), Germany SUF-VSKT 2011)
                       and Italy (INPS). These are shown in Figure 5. Common survival rates were provided by
                       Eurostat (average of EU28 countries). According to these survival probabilities, life
                       expectancies at age 15 were 67.8 years for women and 64.7 years for men.

                       We consider two different pathways out from the labor force. First, the old-age pension
                       pathway, i.e., that the individual chooses to leave the labor force through the public old-age
                       pension. Second, the disability pension pathway. For this pathway we assume that the
                       individual uses the Disability Insurance program to finance his or her exit from the labor force
                       before reaching age 65, when he or she is automatically transferred to the old-age pension
                       system. To measure the overall incentives, we calculate the weighted average based on age-
                       specific probabilities for each pathway from observed exit patterns. Figure 6 shows these
                       probabilities between 1980 and 2015 for males and females, respectively.

5. Results


5.1 Replacement rates and social security wealth and its accrual

Figure 7 shows the replacement rates of the public old-age pension system between 1980
and 2015 for the representative individuals with median education, by age of labor market
exit. We consider ages between 60 and 64 – which is the age span when most Swedish
workers leave the labor force. The left panel shows the results for the hypothetical male
worker and the right panel for the female one. The most apparent change revealed in the
figures is the 1998 change in the early eligibility age (EEA). This change implied that the worker
could only get benefits if eligible to the Disability Insurance program. The result that the
replacement level deviates from zero after 1998 is attributed to the fact that we weight the

             It may appear surprising that the replacement rate increased after the implementation of the
             new pension system. This result is different from previous research based on actual
             outcomes.13 Our simulations are, however, based on two strong assumptions. First, the
             assumption that the worker contributes to the system every year from a very young age. This
             is particularly important for the workers in the low educated group, who are assumed to enter
             the labor force at age 16. Second, we assume that the system works without activating the
             Balancing mechanism, as we described in Section 3.1.2.

             Figure 8 shows the replacement rate for the hypothetical individuals retiring at age 63
             representing the three different education groups. The replacement level is, as expected,
             highest for the hypothetical man and woman representing the lowest education group,
             because of the social security ceiling. For low educated men as well as low and medium

               Granbom (2017) studies the pension outcomes of those born 1938-1945 and finds that these cohort, who
             are both in the pre- and post-reform systems, would have had higher benefits on average if they would have
             been in the pre-reform system only.

                                                                                          15
   educated women, the ceiling is not at all binding, while it is for high educated from both
   gender groups and for medium educated men.

   Figure 8 also shows that the replacement level increases for the low and medium educated
   when the post-reform old-age pension scheme is gradually implemented, while it decreases
   slightly for the high educated. The background to this result is that income earned relatively
   early in the worker’s career is weighted more heavily in the benefit calculation in the post-
   reform system than later earnings, while it was not included at all when determining the
   benefits in the pre-reform system.

   Figure 9 shows the Social security wealth (SSW) calculated at the age of retirement for the
   median education hypothetical worker retiring at ages between 60 and 64. The lower SSW
   for those who retire early shows that the increase in the size of the benefits, following the
   actuarial adjustments in both the pre- and post-reform schemes, exceeds the loss from fewer
   benefit payments following delayed retirement. The figure also shows, confirming the results
   from our analysis of the replacement level, that the SSW increases slightly after the
   implementation of the post-reform pension system.

                       for the replacement level, it may appear confusing that, for both men and women, the high
                       educated hypothetical worker has a lower SSW than the medium educated worker. However,
                       the result can be attributed to the fact that the high-educated pay higher taxes, based on the
                       tax bases for which also incomes from occupational pensions are included.

                       Figure 11 shows the changes between 1980 and 2015 in the accrual in SSW from staying an
                       additional year in the labor force for the hypothetical worker from the medium education
                       group by age of retirement between age 60 and 64. The left panel shows the results for the
                       male worker and the right for a female worker. The most striking results in Figure 11 is the
                       sharp drop in the accrual in the late 1980s and the sharp increase in accrual in 1998 for those
                       retiring at age 60. The late 1980s drop has, as we pointed out in Section 3.1.1, to do with the
                       transition rules in the implementation of the ATP system (the pre-reform supplementary
                       public pension system). Since contributions to the scheme were first recorded in 1960, the
                       cohorts retiring in the late 1980s got an additional actuarial adjustment for each year they
                       remained in the labor force. The 1998 increase for those retiring at age 60 is fully attributed
                       to the change in early retirement age from age 60 to 61.

                       The most important result revealed in Figure 11 is the quite stable development in the age
                       groups retiring between 61 and 64. This means that the reform of the old-age pension system
                       did not imply any drastic changes in the incentives to stay in the labor force. For those retiring
                       at age 63, there is a slight increase in SSW accrual towards the end of the period. Figure 12
                       shows that this also applies to the other education groups considered in this study. In fact,
                       the increase is slightly stronger for the high education hypothetical worker.

                         5.2 The implicit tax rate on working longer

                         The implicit tax rate from the weighted average of the public old-age pension system and the
                         disability insurance program summarizes the economic incentives to exit from the labor force
                         induced by the income security program. Apart from the tax increase in the late 1980s and
                         the sharp drop in 1998 for those retiring at age 60, Figure 13 reveals a steady decrease in the
                         tax rate at ages 60-63 and a stable tax rate for those retiring at 64. This pattern applies for
                         both men and women. Figure 14 further reveals that for the hypothetical worker retiring at
                         age 63 this pattern applies for each education level.

                    5.3 Relation between implicit tax rates and employment rates

                    Can changes in economic incentives induced by the public old-age pension program and the
                    disability insurance explain the pattern of decreased labor force participation between 1980
                    and the late 1990s and the subsequent increase between year 2000 and 2015 among older
                    workers in Sweden? One way to approach this important issue is to investigate to what extent
                    the changes in our measures of economic incentives to stay in the labor market concur with
                    the development in labor force participation in the relevant age groups.

                    An obvious weakness of this research strategy is that a similar development very well could
                    be attributed to some underlying trend in the society, such as improved health or work
                    environment, that could have driven the increase in labor force participation of the elderly
                    and may also have coincided with changes in economic incentives. An advantage with the
                    time period that we cover from this perspective is, however, that it includes both a downturn
                    and an increase in labor force participation.

                    Figure 15 plots the development of the implicit tax rate on staying in the labor force (ITAX)
                    and the employment rate in three different age groups: 55-59, 60-64 and 65-69. The upper
                    panel shows the development for men and the lower one for women. To the extent that there
                    is a role for economic incentives in explaining the development of the employment rate of
                    older workers in Sweden we would see a negative association in these graphs. It is, however,
                    important to stress that the development in the different age groups should be viewed
                    independently. The fact that both labor force participation and the implicit tax rate is higher
                    among younger workers is not a part of our analysis.

                    The within-age group development in Figure 15 reveal no obvious negative relation in any of
                    the age and gender groups included in our analysis. It is therefore not possible for us to
                    conclude that the economic incentives that we measure in this study is driving the

           If we instead use the ITAX measures for the medium education worker from Figure 14, i.e.,
           the ITAX measure for a worker retiring at age 63 Figure 16 shows a different picture. For men,
           the figure shows a clear negative relation between the implicit tax to remain in the labor force
           in two different eras; the first one including the 1980s and the second 1990-2015. For women,
           the negative relation emerge for the second era only.

           Taken together, our results suggest that the changes in economic incentives, primarily driven
           by stricter eligibility rules in the Disability Insurance program, may have contributed to the
           increased labor force participation among older workers since the late 1990s. For men, this is
           true also for the development in the 1980s. For women, it is obvious that the general trend
           across cohorts towards higher labor force participation among females dominates the
           development in this era.

           6. Conclusions

           In this paper we measure how the economic incentives induced by the public pension system
           and the disability insurance program have changed between 1980 and 2015. We find that it
           was a large change in the late 1980s, when the cohorts that were affected by the transition
           rules for the pre-reform supplementary pension (ATP) reached the retirement age. For this
           generation, the linear reduction in the scheme for workers who did not contribute the
           required number of years for full benefit were binding and worked as an additional actuarial
           adjustment. It is conceivable that these transition rules contributed to that very few, less than
           9 percent (see e.g. Palme and Svensson, 1999), retired before age 65 through the old-age
           pension pathway during these years.

           On the main focus of our study – how the major reform of Sweden’s old age pension system
           affected incentives to remain in the labor force – we found surprisingly small changes. We
           could therefor conclude that our results do not support the claim that the major increase in

                                                                                                             21
labor force participation seen for both men and women in the age group 60-64 was driven by
the pension reform. However, as pointed out in Laun and Palme (2018), in the pre-reform
public old-age pension system, as opposed to the post-reform system, there was an incentive
for some workers to delay claiming of their benefits to some years after the actual retirement.
Since we in this study assume that the hypothetical workers claim their benefit immediately
after retirement, a limitation of our study is that the overall incentive effect of this aspect of
the pension reform was not assessed.

Our results show that the eligibility rules of the Disability Insurance program was the main
background to the development towards stronger incentives to stay in the labor force since
the 1990s. This change coincided with the increased labor force participation rate among
older workers. This result supports the conclusions in Palme and Laun (2018) that the more
stringent eligibility rules contributed to the increased labor force participation rates. In Palme
and Laun (2018) we also concluded that the improved health, in particular among men in the
age group 60-64, is likely to have reinforced the development. In future research, we plan to
come back to the important question on how changes in the population have interacted with
policy changes in prolonging the work life of Swedish workers in recent decades.
