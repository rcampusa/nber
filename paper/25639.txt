                                          ABSTRACT

Using a novel panel data set of recent immigrants to the U.S. (2005–2007) from individual-level
linked U.S. Census Bureau survey data and Internal Revenue Service administrative records, we
identify the determinants of return migration and earnings assimilation. We show that by 10 years
after arrival almost 40 percent have return migrated. We show, for the first time, that return
migrants experience downward earnings mobility over two to three years prior to their return
migration. This finding suggests that economic shocks are closely related to emigration decisions.
As a result, standard calculations of immigrants earnings growth may be understated.

1       Introduction
The economic impact of immigration has been an important topic of economics research, especially
during periods of large immigrant inflows. Economists and policy-makers are concerned about potential
negative impacts that newly arriving immigrant cohorts may have on the labor-market outcomes of
native-born workers (Borjas, 2003; Card, 1990; Cortes, 2008; Foged and Peri, 2016; Friedberg, 2001;
Hunt, 1992; Ottaviano and Peri, 2012; Peri, 2012; Peri and Sparber, 2009). Major questions regarding
immigration include how incoming workers of different abilities impact the overall wage structure and
skill-based wage inequality. Related research topics have examined the quality of new arrivals in human
capital terms and earnings ability (Borjas, 1995; Card, 2005, 2009; Chiquiar and Hanson, 2005; Chiswick,
1978; Lubotsky, 2007). Specifically, the economic question focuses on whether and to what extent new
arrivals assimilate into the U.S. economy over time in terms of employment and earnings (generally
measured as a convergence in earnings between immigrants and the native born).
         In this paper, we use a complete panel of new immigrants to the U.S. Our panel contains
a decade’s worth of records for those immigrants who remain and those who eventually leave due to
return migration over time. We identify new arrivals to the U.S. using 2005–2007 American Community
Survey (ACS) data. We restrict analysis to immigrants who were between the ages of 25–45 at the time
of entry, who participated in the formal labor market, and who report entering either in the current year
(2005, 2006, or 2007) or one year earlier (2004, 2005, or 2006); all other immigrants are excluded from
this analysis. A complete entry cohort should have experienced very little return migration between
the reported entry year and inclusion in the ACS; thus we take these samples as representative of the
complete, formal-market immigrant arrival cohorts in our analysis. We link these observations at the
person level to their Internal Revenue Service (IRS) W-2 or 1099 forms for the years 2005–2015. This
novel panel data set differs from previous stock-based immigration panel data in that we are able to
identify those in the initial arrival cohorts who leave. In other words, these data allow us to examine
the forward-looking trajectory of recent immigrant earnings (whereas previous stock-based panels were
retrospective), capturing the labor market outcomes of stayers and leavers.
         The first generation of research into this topic estimated wage regressions for a single cross-
section, examining immigrants’ tenure in the U.S. to assess the rate of wage assimilation (Chiswick,
1978). This research indicated a strong convergence of immigrant wages to those of native-born workers,
with immigrant wages even eventually surpassing those of the native born. The next generation of
research critiqued earlier methods for failing to account for the average differences in immigrant cohorts
over time (Borjas, 1985; Borjas et al., 1987). As a result, researchers used data from repeated cross-
sections (essentially the U.S. decennial censuses) and showed that the rate of wage assimilation was
slower than that shown in a single cross-section. This later research aligns with a story of decreasing
average immigrant cohort characteristics in human capital over time.
         Our research is related to more recent work that focuses on the use of stock-based panel datasets
and forms much of the base of knowledge that we have on the earnings growth and assimilation of
immigrant cohorts.1 These data tend to be merged longitudinal administrative data such as the Social
Security Administration’s Detailed Earnings Records (DER) and a nationally representative survey
such as the Current Population Survey (CPS) or Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).
    1
   We provide in Appendix Figure A1 a selected list of existing research using stock-based panel and complete
panel data sets in the immigration literature.




                                                     1
These data provide a complete panel for individuals from all prior immigrant arrival cohorts that have
survived until the current time period (or the time when the national survey was conducted). Dustmann
and Görlach (2015) calls this type of data set “stock-based panel data” because it provides information
on the surviving stock of immigrants from an earlier arrival cohort. Duleep and Regets (1997), Duleep
and Dowhan (2002), and Duleep and Dowhan (2008), using the DER merged to the CPS, found that
immigrants’ wage growth is greater than that of natives. They also show that immigrant earnings
converge to those of natives by the 10-year mark. In contrast, Hu (2000) used Health and Retirement
Survey data merged to DER data and found that wage assimilation takes longer in the longitudinal
data than in the repeated cross-sectional data. Lubotsky (2007, 2011) merges DER data to the 1990
and 1991 SIPP and the 1994 CPS to create a panel dataset. He infers that low earners are the most
likely to return migrate. Lubotsky (2007) finds that the earnings gap between immigrants and natives
takes about 20 years to close (on average) which is about half as fast as is suggested by repeated cross-
section analyses. Kaushal (2011) uses the 2010 National Survey of College Graduates to construct a
stock-based panel and finds that return immigrants are negatively selected based on earnings data; in
more recent work Kaushal et al. (2016) finds strong evidence that there are large gains in employment
and earnings growth for immigrant men relative to natives. Other researchers (Hall and Farkas, 2008;
Villarreal and Tamborini, 2018) have found differential earnings assimilation outcomes by race and
English-language abilities.
       This previous research generally improved our understanding of important questions related
to immigration, such as: what is the wage assimilation of the immigrants who end up staying for
(relatively) long periods of time in the U.S. relative to the wages of the native-born? Stock-based panel
data provided improvements to answer these questions compared to repeated cross-section data. Still,
stock-based panel data do not allow one to understand the true earnings growth of an initial arrival
cohort once return migration is accounted for. A true panel data set, which is forward-looking, is
required to answer this type of question.
       There are a few complete immigrant panel datasets that researchers have compiled to examine
certain aspects of return migration and earnings growth in the U.S.; however, these tend to cover a
historical period, be limited to a particular occupational group, lack the employment and earnings data
that allow for a study of key labor-market effects, or constitute a limited-duration panel. Jasso and
Rosenzweig (1982) and Jasso and Rosenzweig (1988) use administrative data from the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service for a 1971 entry cohort of legal permanent residents to identify the emigration
rate and occupational status over an eight-year period. They find that the average emigration rate for
that cohort is about 50 percent. Both Borjas (1989), examining high-skilled immigrants, and Schwabish
(2011) find that return migrants are negatively selected based on earnings data. Borjas (1989) also
finds a lack of wage convergence among a set of high-skilled immigrants. Similarly, Van Hook and
Zhang (2011), using the two-year panel structure of the CPS ASEC, and Abramitzky et al. (2014),
using decennial census data linked at the individual level, find that negative labor market outcomes for
migrants in the U.S. are associated with return migration.2
   2
    European datasets, in contrast, have allowed researchers to examine more recent and representative immi-
grant cohorts to those countries. Dustmann and Weiss (2007) use the British Labor Force Surveys, which is a
complete panel of five consecutive quarters to identify new arrivals in the UK and follow the return migration
and the wage assimilation of those who remain in the country. They find high rates of return migration within
the first 10 years of arrival. In related work, Dustmann et al. (2010) compare differences in return migration




                                                      2
       We contribute to this literature by taking a nationally representative immigrant arrival cohort
and linking it to future earnings reports via IRS data, in contrast to prior research that has relied on
matches to historical earnings reports. This forward-looking link to earnings allows us to examine the
labor-market outcomes of immigrants from the time they enter the U.S. until either they reach the end
year or leave the U.S. Key to the novelty of our data is our ability to link observations captured in the
2005–2007 ACS to their administrative record for every year that they work in the formal U.S. labor
market, up to 2015. This contrasts with survey-DER linkages, where administrative earnings records are
linked to survey observations up to the survey year. These retrospective studies can only measure labor-
market outcomes for immigrants who have remained in the U.S. up to the survey year. Additionally,
our sample is large enough to separately categorize the immigrant group into different educational
attainment, race, and country of birth categories and follow their differential earnings growth. We also
separate the analysis by gender to illustrate the potentially different experiences across these two groups
independently. Group-level differences in earnings growth have eluded previous analysis due either to
relatively small sample sizes, short-duration panels, lack of forward-looking longitudinal earnings data,
or a combination of these factors.
       Our data allow us to investigate the determinants of return migration from the U.S. in much
greater detail than has been possible in previous research. We show that there is a relatively quick
reduction in an immigrant arrival cohort in the first few years in the U.S.—by year 10 almost 40 percent
have returned home, with the majority leaving in the first few years. After identifying the immigrants
who will end up leaving the U.S., we estimate earnings assimilation relative to the native born for the
eventual return migrants, the panel, and the repeated cross-section data. Our analysis shows that the
return migrants experience downward earnings mobility in the two to three year prior to their return
migration. In general, these individuals are not statistically different at the time of arrival from others
in their arrival cohort; therefore, our evidence suggests they must differ from more successful cohort
members in their time-variant unobserved characteristics. These characteristics influence their earnings
outcomes as well as their decision to return migrate. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of
how success or failure in the U.S. labor market impacts immigrants’ choice to return migrate. The
results of our analysis have been predicted by previous researchers, who argued that return migrants
are negatively selected. However, the data necessary to test this prediction—namely, detailed annual
earnings for the return migrants prior to their return—were not previously available.
       We use characteristics of the population from the ACS data to identify immigrants’ educational
attainment, country of birth, and English-language ability at the time of arrival to show how these
characteristics are related to return migration over time. We also examine how earnings assimilation
differs by an immigrant’s initial characteristics. In particular, we examine earnings assimilation across
these individual characteristics. One important finding is that earnings assimilation by education level
is almost complete by 10 years after arrival for those immigrants who remain in the U.S. We find
that earnings assimilation within race groups is nearly indistinguishable across the immigrant–native
from the UK and Germany using two different nationally representative datasets. They find little difference in
response to economic shocks across immigrants and natives in earnings, but find that economic shocks have a
larger effect on unemployment rates for immigrants as compared to natives. Lehmer and Ludsteck (2015) find
that reductions in earnings differences between immigrants and natives in Germany can be attributed to the
acquisition of firm-specific human capital over time. Our analysis follows more closely the work conducted with
administrative data from European countries.

earnings distribution by 10 years after arrival.
         Finally, we examine the earnings growth across the three types of data sets available for study-
ing immigrants. We confirm that repeated cross-section data overstates the rate of earnings growth
compared to stock-based panel data. We also find that the stock-based panel analyses may under esti-
mate the true rate of immigrant earnings growth; this may be the case when unobserved time-variant
characteristics are related to both immigrants earnings and migration decisions. This is also a novel
empirical contribution to the literature; previous researchers have been unable to show how stock-based
panel analysis may differ from complete panel data analysis for the U.S.


2       Data Description
We use confidential-use individual-level data from the ACS for the years 2005, 2006, and 2007. The
ACS provides characteristics of the population sampled annually. We use the year of entry variable to
identify new arrivals to the U.S.3 In our analysis we include individuals who report entry either in the
year prior to the ACS or the current year.4 In practice this means that we include individuals within
a two-year range of the ACS (2004 and 2005 for the 2005 ACS; 2005 and 2006 for the 2006 ACS; 2006
and 2007 for the 2007 ACS).5
         These immigrant cohorts are linked at the U.S. Census Bureau to their individual IRS data using
a process whereby observations in each data set were given a unique, protected identification key, called
a “PIK.” When a Social Security Number (SSN) is available in a data set, the identifier is assigned
based on SSN. For records without an SSN, personally identifiable information such as name, address,
and date of birth is used in probabilistic matching to assign PIKs from a master reference file. Personal
information is then removed from each data set before they may be used for research purposes. Only
those observations that received the unique person identifier are used in the analysis. The IRS W-2
data span the years 2005–2015 and allow us to examine the earnings progression of these individuals
over a 10-year time period. It also allows us to identify individuals that start out in the labor force and
leave it subsequently either as return migrants or because they enter informal work.
         It is important to note that the record-linkage approach we use to link the data introduces some
bias. Minorities and people with lower socioeconomic status are less likely to receive a record-linkage
key compared to whites and people who have higher levels of socioeconomic status (Bond et al., 2014).
Because we focus on incoming immigrants and use IRS return information, we are only able to link and
follow those immigrants who enter the U.S. to work in the formal labor market. Any results we report
will therefore only apply to immigrants working in the formal sector. We provide some details below
on how much the linking procedure covers the new immigrant population in the ACS.
         Once these ACS individuals are linked to their earnings records, we identify whether the in-
dividuals are present annually in each of the years from 2005–2015. We calculate the two outcome
    3
     Grieco et al. (2018) has shown that the single year ACS data provides more accurate reporting than multi-
year ACS data for immigrant arrivals. Additionally, they find that there is an undercount the longer the recall
period. Our analysis only requires an immigrant to recall arrival for the current or prior year.
   4
     The question on the ACS asks: “When did this person come to live in the United States?” and as such may
not necessarily be the first time that an individual came to the U.S.; it simply indicates the most recent date of
arrival.
   5
     While the ACS data provide a snap-shot perspective of the country on average, the sampled individuals are
not the same on an annual basis and it is not possible to create a panel data set using the ACS alone.




                                                        4
variables of interest: missing W-2 or 1099 filings in subsequent years (2006–2015) and relative earnings
(as compared to natives). We provide these results disaggregated by country of origin, educational at-
tainment, race, and English language ability as reported in the 2005–2007 ACS by gender. This novel
data set provides a representative picture of the earnings progression of recent, formal-sector employed
immigrants to the U.S. over the time period 2005–2015. This data set is also unique in that there is
no top-coding of earnings as is often the case for research using SSA data. We exclude all individuals
who report being enrolled in college or graduate school from this analysis.6
       Finally, for comparison, we take a sample of native-born of both genders from the 2005 ACS in
the same age range. We take a 50 percent sample of the 2005 ACS population for comparison in wage
assimilation and growth analyses.
       Table 1 shows the rounded sample sizes for the panel data used in our analysis.7 The first
row shows that there are 13,000 individuals who fit the criteria of: male; ages 25–45; not enrolled in
school of any type; and year of arrival to the U.S. is 2004 or 2005 for the 2005 ACS, 2005 or 2006
for the 2006 ACS, or 2006 or 2007 for the 2007 ACS. Similar criteria exist for women, shown in the
first row of Panel B, where we find 12,000 observations. The next rows in Panel A and B show that
6,800 and 6,700 of these individuals, for males and females respectively, were assigned a PIK by the
U.S. Census Bureau. The assignment of PIKs are in large part determined by whether the individual
has a presence in administrative data and records.8 By definition, an undocumented immigrant will be
much less likely to be found in U.S. administrative records.9 As a result, our panel data likely identify
documented immigrants to the U.S. who have valid visas or work permits. The PIK assignment rate
of 52 percent for men and 56 percent for women is very similar to what others have found for the
immigrant population using the ACS data (Bond et al., 2014). In the third row of both panels we show
that the link to the IRS W-2 and 1099 data results in a total sample size of 5,800 observations for men
and 4,500 observations for women.10
   6
      See Akee and Jones (2018) for analysis that focuses exclusively on immigrants enrolled in graduate school in
the U.S. and their earning outcomes compared to the native-born.

      U.S. Census Bureau data dissemination requires rounding of count data as well as regression coefficients.
Those rules have been employed throughout this paper and results have been approved for release by the Bureau’s
Disclosure Avoidance Review Board.
    8
      Bond et al. (2014) have evaluated the assignment of PIK numbers to individuals from the ACS and find an
assignment rate for the foreign-born population that is similar to ours. Subsequent versions of PIK assignment
(2010 ACS) accounted for Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) which may be available in IRS
data when an individual does not have a Social Security Number (Bhaskar et al., 2016). However, this is not
possible for the older assignment of PIKs to earlier data since the ITIN is not available for the data. As a result,
the individuals studied in this analysis are more likely to be employed in the formal sector and have a strong
participation in government programs in order to be identified in the Personal Identification Validation System,
which assigns PIKs to individuals. The reference files used for matching contain all variants of a person’s name,
date of birth, and sex, as well as current and recent addresses(Bond et al., 2014).
    9
      In recent research, Foster et al. (2018) found a higher match of foreign-born between the Census and IRS
data than we do. Their data differ slightly in that they are examining all immigrant arrival cohorts, not just the
most recent ones as we are. Moreover, they are using a wider variety of IRS data, including the 1040 tax returns;
we do not use these data since we are primarily concerned with identifying the individual immigrant’s earnings
in isolation, which might not be discernible on jointly-filed tax forms.
  10
      In Appendix Tables A1 and A2 we show the comparison of several characteristics for the matched and
unmatched observations for both matching steps. The data show, as expected, that the matched observations
tend to have higher earnings and more education–these are characteristics that are associated with having a
larger presence in administrative records used for matching.

3        Research Methods
We conduct three empirical analyses in this paper. The first examines the nature of return migration
of recent U.S. arrivals. Our panel data allow us to identify individuals who do not have reported W-2
or 1099 data for the years 2005–2015 in the U.S. The second analysis examines the wage assimilation of
the recent arrival cohorts of immigrants to that of native-born individuals by educational attainment,
race, and country of birth (of the immigrants). The third analysis examines the wage growth by years
since migration for the arrival cohort in the repeated cross-section data, the stock-based panel data,
and the complete panel data with selection correction.

3.1      Estimating the Return Migration of New Immigrant Arrival Cohorts
For each year of data we count up the total number of individuals who are found to have a W-2 or
1099 form from the original entry cohorts (2005–2007). These data are then plotted in a figure for each
cohort over the time period 2005–2015. Additionally, we separate our data into three different groups.
The first is the attriters (or return migrants); the second is the repeated cross-section, which is the
surviving portion of the initial arrival cohort in the data in a given year; and the third group is the
panel of immigrants that remain for at least 10 years in our data.
          We identify those whom we classify as leavers or return migrants based on whether they have
reported W-2 or 1099 forms for a particular year. Individuals who have a W-2 or 1099 reported in
2005 or 2006 but are not present in the data for the years 2007–2015 are coded as part of the two-year
cohort. We create a three-year cohort for those who are not present in the years 2008–2015. We create
similar cohorts for leavers up to and including a ten-year cohort which were not present in 2015.11
See Table 2, which provides the detail for how we code individuals in the 2005 cohort as missing by
    11
    It is not possible to remove individuals who leave after eleven years as we do not have information on whether
individuals present in 2015 may leave in the subsequent year.

length of time in the U.S.(later cohorts are treated analogously). Individuals are only coded as leavers
when they are missing in consecutive years until 2015. Our methods allow individuals to have short
unemployment spells and not be counted as leavers as long as they are observed to have a W-2 or 1099
again at some later time period. In Appendix Table A3 we attempt to find individuals who only report
1 to 6 years of administrative IRS data (for the years 2005-2010) in the 2010 U.S. Census records. Our
results indicate that our assumption that the foreign born with missing administrative records have
return migrated is a good one: for example, we find only four percent of individuals with a single year
of administrative records (2005 alone) in the 2010 U.S. Census. This panel data set provides us with
the main data for our analysis of earnings regressions over time.

       We tabulate the mean of the missing observations as coded according to Table 2 above for each
year. In further analysis, we tabulate the mean of the missing observations in the panel data set for
each year separately by each category of the characteristic of interest. For example, we sum the missing
by year for each of five educational categories (less than high school, high school degree, some college,
college degree, and more than a college degree) for each year and plot those in a single figure. We do
a similar analysis for country of birth and for English language ability.

3.2   Estimating the Wage Assimilation of New Immigrant Arrival Cohorts
Next we estimate the wage assimilation for the new arrival cohort of immigrants relative to natives over
this time period. We replicate the standard repeated cross-section analysis of previous research. Given
that we can further separate the data into the attriters (return migrants) and the panel component, we
also show the earnings assimilation of those groups on a single graph with the repeated cross-section
data for comparison. The wage assimilation figures are based on the following regression model run for
each year (2005–2015) in our analysis:

                                 Yi = α + β × Immigranti + θi + γi + i                                  (1)

       In our equation, Yi is the log of earnings for an individual for a single year, where earnings is the
sum of all W-2 and 1099 wage reports. We include a state of residence fixed effect θi and an age fixed
effect γi . The coefficient of interest is β, which indicates the difference in log earnings for an immigrant
relative to a native-born individual. We also separate out the analysis by the stock-based panel, the




                                                      7
repeated cross-section data, and the attriters. We then plot the coefficient β by year by group in the
figures.
        In subsequent figures, we separate out the analysis by different individual-level immigrant charac-
teristics, such as educational attainment at the time of arrival, country of origin, race, or English-ability
categories. We only show the results for the complete panel and the repeated cross-section data (shown
in Appendix figures) in such analyses. These estimated coefficients are then plotted on a single figure
for each characteristic.
        In additional analyses shown in the Appendix, we add in educational category variables as
controls for some reported results. In general, those results are similar to our main results; however,
they tend to shift observed estimates downward.

3.3     Estimating the Years Since Migration on Earnings Growth
We examine the effect that years since migration has on the earnings growth of immigrants relative to
native-born. The discussion below follows closely Dustmann and Görlach (2015). Researchers have been
concerned with estimating the earnings growth of the immigrant populations; however, it is notoriously
difficult given that the population of immigrants is not a constant one. New arrivals and the possibility
of return migrants may confound any estimates. Previous research has had to make several strong
assumptions in order to estimate immigrants’ earnings growth using repeated cross-section data or
with stock-based panel data.

3.3.1      Basic Equations for Log Earnings and Selection for Remaining in the U.S.

It is useful to first define the earnings equation as a function of two separate components. Earnings
for a cohort c of immigrant arrivals are comprised of a component µct (equation 2), which accounts for
the cohort average earnings. A second term, cit , is the individual i ’s deviation from his cohort average.
This term differs across individuals and time periods denoted by t.
        In Equation 3 we further separate out this deviation term into two components (αic and ηit
                                                                                                c ) that

represent time-invariant and time-variant unobserved characteristics. The first term may represent
unobserved endowment of skills and the second some type of shock in a time period.
        Finally, the decision to remain in the U.S. is based on a number of both observable and unob-
servable characteristics and shown in Equation 4. The observable characteristics Ziτ could be income,
age, educational attainment, or other similar characteristics. The next determinant of return migration
accounts for potential unobserved characteristics and preferences uciτ . In this equation, if the term
inside the brackets is true, then an individual will remain in the U.S., otherwise, that person return
migrates.
        This provides both an explicit threshold for return migration as well as allowing for a potential
time-varying component of earnings that may also be related to return migration decision-making.

                                               Wcit = µct + cit                                         (2)

3.3.2    Estimating Earnings and Selective Return Migration Using Repeated Cross Section
         Data

Several previous researchers (Borjas, 1985; Duleep and Regets, 1997; Lubotsky, 2007) have shown that
using standard cross-section data to measure the earnings growth of immigrants leads to an upward
bias when more recent arrival cohorts of immigrants are lower skilled than previous ones or there is
negative selection of return migrants. In equation 5 we show the change in earnings over time periods
t1 and t2 . The first term on the right-hand side of the equation indicates the true growth in earnings
for the arrival cohort c in the absence of return migration. The next two terms on the right-hand side
provide the bias term given the presence of return migration. If there is negative selection for the return
migrants from cohort c over time on unobserved characteristics, this implies that the the two terms
on the right will be positive since E[it2 | µct2 , Sit2 = 1] > E[it1 | µct1 , Sit1 = 1] as the individuals with
the lowest unobserved skills leave, and it2 will be greater than it1 . Therefore, the estimated earnings
growth will be larger than the true earnings growth if there were no return migration from the arrival
cohort c.

                ∆Earningsct1 t2 = {µct2 − µct1 } + E[it2 | µct2 , Sit2 = 1] − E[it1 | µct1 , Sit1 = 1]     (5)


3.3.3    Estimating Earnings and Selective Return Migration using Stock-Based Longitu-
         dinal Data

One method to improve upon the bias inherent in repeated cross-section data has been to use admin-
istrative data merged to existing survey-based data. Several researchers have linked administrative
data from the Social Security Administration to the SIPP or CPS and created a stock-based panel.
As mentioned in the Introduction, this type of data is a panel of all individuals from arrival cohort c
that survived up to some ending date T. While these data cannot provide information on those that
return migrated, it does provide a panel data set of the surviving cohort of arrivals. As in equation 6, a
researcher can directly estimate the change in earnings between time 1 and time T for the individuals
that survived up to time T from arrival cohort c.

                                            ∆Earningsct1 T = µcT − µct1                                      (6)

        However, the stock-based panel data does not allow one to estimate the true earnings growth
of immigrants except with some strong assumptions. The stock-based panel data provide an accurate
depiction of earnings growth for the entire cohort only under the assumption that there is no relationship
between the unobserved time-variant elements of earnings and the term uciτ from Equation 4. We again
difference the earnings equation across two time periods and provide that below in Equation 7. Taking
expectations and assuming the joint normality of uciτ and ηit
                                                           c gives us Equation 9. In that equation, the

true change in cohort c’s earnings over time is the first term in the brackets on the right-hand side of
the equal sign. The next two terms indicate the correlation between the individual earnings deviation
and the uciτ term in different time periods multiplied by each of those expected values in different time
periods. Assuming that there is no relationship between the deviation term in the earnings equation
and the unobserved characteristics in the return migration equation would mean that those final two
terms are equal to zero. In the absence of such an assumption, Equation 9 does not provide an unbiased

                                    c and u
Therefore, the correlation between ηit     iτ should be positive. However, due to the negative self-
selection of return migrants over time, the correlation between these two time-variant characteristics
should be decreasing over time; individuals who were closer to leaving have already been induced to do
so. This implies that ucit2 <ucit1 and that the last two terms on the right could be negative and result in
an underestimation of the average earnings of an immigrant cohort. Second, the correlation between
               c and uc will diminish over time as the selection condition for the return migration
the two terms ηit     iτ
decision (Equation 4) becomes more slack (those at the margin and most likely to return migrate have
already done so in prior periods).

3.3.4    Estimating Earnings and Selective Return Migration Longitudinal Data

Using complete panel data, however, allows researchers to identify both the growth rate of the surviving
individuals of arrival cohort c at time t as well as the true average cohort earnings growth µct2 − µct1 .
This earnings growth rate is of particular interest for understanding the time that it takes for immigrant
cohorts (absent return migration) to assimilate to the earnings of the native-born. In equation 10, we
reproduce the result from above for the differenced earnings equation for periods 1 and 2. The second
term can be re-written in expectations as the correlation between the unobserved time-variant terms
from equations 2 and 4 and the inverse Mills ratio computed from the annual selection into the data. We
assume that the two unobserved time-variant characteristics from equations 2 and 4 are joint normally
distributed. The inverse Mills ratio (IMR) may be computed directly from the complete panel data by
estimating a logit model where the outcome variable is equal to one in a given year if the immigrant
is observed in the data and zero otherwise. Dustmann and Görlach (2015) suggest using earnings from
two periods prior (in this case t = 0) as the exclusion restriction for this regression with the assumption
that any earnings shocks in two time periods earlier are not correlated with current shocks or other
unobserved characeristics. Then the IMR is included for each year in a pooled earnings regression
equation as a correction for selective out-migration.



                                        ∆Earningsct1 t2 = ∆µct1 t2 + ∆cit                              (10)


                                     E[∆Earningsct1 t2 ] = ∆µct1 t2 + E[∆cit ]                         (11)




                                                         10
given that cit is jointly normally distributed with uiτ , this can be re-written as:

                                                                              0
                                 E[∆Earningsct1 t2 ] = ∆µct1 t2 + σ∆,η × λ(Zitc β)                         (12)

          where λ is the inverse Mills ratio for the selection into the data.
          In our analysis, we calculate the earnings growth for the three different data types (repeated
cross-section, stock-based panel data, and complete panel) and show how they differ from one another
in this case.


4        Return Migration
4.1      Return Migration by Entry Cohort of Immigrants and for Native-Born Men
In Figure 1 we present the most basic results for missing either 1099 or W-2 data for the three entry
cohorts 2005–2007 for men in Panel A and for women in Panel B. The data show that there is a
pronounced drop after the first year in the U.S. for both genders, and then the missing observations
tend to moderate after that. Of note is the increase in filed W-2 or 1099 forms in 2011, implying a
return to the labor force, which is when employment began to recover from the Great Recession.
          We also provide a measure of changes in the reported W-2s and 1099s for native-born males
and females ages 25–45 in Figure 1. This measure includes all native-born in the same age range as
the immigrants. We take the labor force participation rate for the native-born in 2005 as the base and
normalize all subsequent years for native-born relative to this amount. This measure takes the count of
the total individuals with a reported W-2 or 1099 in the year 2005 and then shows any changes in that
amount by subsequent year. The line for the native-born shows a increase in labor force participation
and then a steep drop in 2010 during the Great Recession.12 There is a recovery by 2011 that exceeds
the original proportion in 2005, and then there is a slight downward trend (which may reflect entry
into disability or early retirement). For the native-born we allow for gaps in reporting of W-2s and
1099s, which may explain the increase in labor force participation rates we observe for 2011. For all
three arrival cohorts of immigrants, we observe that there is a steep drop between the year of arrival
and the next year; almost 20 percent of the observed cohort of immigrants are no longer present in the
W-2 or 1099 data.13 There is a continual decline in the number of immigrants with reported W-2 or
1099 data over the next 10 years, and by 2015 each of the three entry cohorts contains slightly more
than 60 percent of persons from the the initial arrival cohort.




    12
     We have also re-weighted these observations so that they are similar to the foreign born on demographic
characteristics and we observe qualitatively similar results for the native-born results.
  13
     We find qualitatively similar results for other arrival cohort years over and during the Great Recession. In
Appendix Figure A2 we provide data for return migration for individuals who arrived in the U.S. for the years
2005–2013.

4.2   Return Migration by Initial Educational Attainment
In Figure 2 we show missing tax forms by the educational attainment of the individual immigrant
for the 2005 entry cohort alone. We assume that educational attainment occurred abroad because we
have selected individuals who are 25-45 years old (who have only recently arrived in the U.S.) and
have explicitly excluded any individuals who report that they are currently enrolled in school of any
type. Overall, the more educated individuals of either gender are most likely of any education group
to return migrate. The data for individuals with less than high school degree are the most volatile,
reflecting the higher probability of this education group to be unemployed or perhaps employed in
the informal economy. On the other hand, the other educational attainment categories are mostly
monotonically decreasing over time for the males. Individuals with an MA or PhD are the most likely
to leave, followed by those with a college degree. For women, the very highly-educated have a steep
rate of return migration over the first three years, but the rate of return does not differ substantially
over the other education categories. These education categories are independent of one another and
these results should be interpreted as the percent returning from within each educational category.

4.3   Return Migration by Country of Birth
Figure 3 provides the return migration of individuals from the 2005 entry cohort by country of origin
for the top five immigrant-sending countries. Panel A presents the results for males and Panel B
presents the results for females. In Panel A, the highest return migration is for Canada, followed by
China, India, Mexico, and Philippines. There is a steep drop for Canadians and Chinese men in 2010
which may indicate that this group was the most likely to return migrate as a result of the Great
Recession. Mexican males rebound in their reporting of W-2 or 1099 in 2011, indicating that they may
have remained in the U.S., perhaps working in the informal sector, but that they returned to formal
sector employment in 2011 and returned to trend in 2012. Immigrants from the Philippines in this
entry cohort are the least likely to return migrate as a percent of their initial arrival cohort. In Panel
B Canadian women are the most likely to return migrate followed by Indians, Mexicans, Chinese and
then Filipinos. Return migration is largest for Canadians, and then the other four groups tend to be
clustered together. Mexican women show a rebound in their reporting of W-2s and 1099s in 2010 and
subsequent years; this return to the formal U.S. labor market is sustained over the remaining years,
which differs from that of Mexican men in the panel above. Chinese women show a similar pattern to
those from Mexico.

4.4   Return Migration by English Language Ability
In Figure 4 we show return migration by an individual migrant’s English language abilities as reported
in the ACS data. We collapse the original four categories into just two to indicate “Speaks English
Well” or “Does Not Speak English Well.” There is a slight increase in reporting of W-2s or 1099s in 2011
for the group that doesn’t speak English well in both panels. For men, there is a slightly higher return
of individuals who reportedly speak English well; however, this might be correlated with educational
attainment, consistent with what we observed in Figure 2 (the highly-educated are the most likely to
return migrate). In Panel B we see that the probability of return migrating doesn’t differ between
the two categories for women. Overall, return migration doesn’t appear to differ by English language
abilities for women and differs only marginally so for men.

4.5   Return Migration by Marital Status
Return migration may also be influenced by an individual’s marital status. This might differ by gender
in significant ways. In Figure 5 we show the return migration by gender and marital status for the
recent cohort of immigrant arrivals. The fact that return migration rates do not differ by marital status
for either gender was a surprising finding. Unmarried men were slightly more likely to return migrate
in the first few years after arrival in the U.S. than their married counterparts, but after that there is
little difference between marital groups over time. For women, there’s a slightly higher probability of
married women to return migrate in the first few years after arrival, but rates become similar across
marital status after about year 5.

4.6   Regression Results for Return Migration by Education and Country of Birth
In Table 3 we present the regression results as specified in equation 1 for men in Panel A and women
in Panel B. The outcome variable indicates whether there is a missing W-2 or 1099 by year for an
individual based on their educational attainment. We include other control variables in this analysis
such as state of residence and age fixed effects; standard errors are clustered at the state of residence in
the U.S., according to the ACS. The omitted education category is less than a high school degree. The
regression results indicate that more educated immigrants are likely to be missing over time. In Panel
A we find that in 2011, all education categories show a higher missing rate compared with the lowest
education group, which reflects the finding in Figure 2 that this group had a higher rate of return
migration than others in 2010. After 2011, male high school graduates and males with completed
college degrees or more (master’s or doctorate’s), and to a lesser extent those with some college are
more likely to be missing in the data than the base group. This is in contrast to earlier years in the time
series—specifically, 2007 and 2008, when those with higher educational attainment were less likely to
be missing than those from the lowest educational attainment group (although some of those estimates
are not statistically significant). In Panel B, the results for women differ from men in that it is only the
very highly educated that have a significantly different return migration after 2011, confirming what
was found in Figure 2. Overall, these results indicate that the more highly educated are the most likely
to return migrate (relative to those with less than a high school diploma) over time.
       In Appendix Table A4 we show a similar regression analysis by country of birth. The omitted
country category is all other countries (besides the top 5 immigrant-sending countries). As before, we
include other control variables in this analysis such as state of residence and age fixed effects; standard
errors are clustered at the state of residence in the U.S. In Panel A we find that immigrants from
Mexico, India, the Philippines, and China are less likely to return migrate than are immigrants from
other countries. Filipinos appear to be much less likely to return migrate at all years as compared to
immigrants from other countries. Indian men appear to be less likely to return migrate in the middle
years of this ten-year panel. Mexican men are less likely to return towards the end of data years.
Chinese men have a statistically significant lower return migration rate only in 2014. Canadian men
appear to have an approximately similar rate of return as immigrants from other countries across all
years in our data. In Panel B we find somewhat similar results for women from the Philippines and their
male counterparts; they are less likely to return migrate in all years over the 10-year period. Mexican
women are less likely to migrate towards the second half of the 10-year panel. To a lesser extent there
is a reduction in the return migration of Indian women during the middle part of the panel (similar to
Indian men) and Chinese women are less likely to return migrate at the end of the panel.
       Finally, Appendix Table A5 provides the regression table where we control for initial educational
attainment and country of birth and the interaction of those categories. One consistent result emerges
from this analysis—the highly educated are the most likely to return migrate. In particular, the highly
educated men from Mexico, India, and China are more likely to return migrate towards the end of
our time period. Highly educated male immigrants from the Philippines and Canada appear to return
migrate at the same rate those from other education groups. For women, there does not appear to
be differential return migration across country and education categories that is statistically significant,
with the exception of highly-educated Chinese women in the first few years of the data.

5    Immigrant Earnings Assimilation Relative to Native-Born Popu-
     lation
In Figure 6, we provide the results from the earnings assimilation analysis. This analysis is based on
equation 1 where we regress the log of earnings on immigrant status, age fixed effects, and state of
residence fixed effects; we plot the estimated coefficient on the immigrant variable for all years. The
black dotted line in Panel A for men reports the results from a standard repeated cross-section analysis,
which includes all immigrants present in the data at each time period. This line provides the difference
in log earnings of immigrants and natives in the U.S. in each year. This line crosses the horizontal
line at 0, indicating earnings assimilation, by 2012 or about 7 years after arrival on average. The
dotted line in Panel B shows that there is almost convergence for immigrant women by 2012 to the
native-born; however, the line diverges in the years after. We do not include confidence intervals in
these figures; however, the observed results are statistically significant from zero except for instances
where the estimated results are near to the zero line.
       The solid black line “Panel All Years” provides the earnings differences in logs between the
immigrants from the 2005–2007 entry cohorts to that of the native born and removes individuals who
will return migrate at some point over this time period (2006–2014). This group comprises individuals
who remain in the U.S. for all of the years in the study. This analysis replicates the stock-based panel
data analysis which links either the CPS or SIPP data (for immigrant survivors of older entry cohorts)
to their historical SSA Detailed Earnings Records (see Duleep and Regets (1997); Lubotsky (2007)).
Note that the final years (2014 and 2015) necessarily converges to that of the dashed black line (repeated
cross-section) as we have no further information on whether an individual will return migrate in future
time periods; this would require data from 2016 for instance. This line for both panels shows a quicker
convergence to that of the native-born earnings in about 3 years for men and 6 years for women. This
provides some evidence that the returning migrants are negatively selected with regard to earnings;
at all years those who remain for all time periods have consistently higher earnings than those in the
repeated cross-section data.
       The bottom line in both panels shows this result explicitly. The red line in both figures provides
similar analysis for the individuals who do not remain in the U.S. for all time periods; these are the
attriters—or those who emigrate. A description of how we coded these individuals can be found in
Table 2. To create the red line we aggregate all of the individuals that remain in the U.S. for less
than the full time period of 10 years; this is the complementary set of observations to the solid black
line called “Panel All Years” that, when combined, forms the repeated cross-section dotted line in
both panels. We find in Panel A that there is evidence of downward earnings mobility for this group
of immigrants starting about three years after arrival on average. At the time of arrival the starting
earnings for all three groups are relatively similar to one another, but this group of return migrants
in particular appear to have a series of negative shocks or experiences in the labor market, different
from everyone else in the labor market, that help to increase their probability of leaving the U.S. We
present the same analysis in Panel B for women. In this case, the return migrants appear to start out
at a significant reduction in their initial earnings compared to those immigrants who stay in the U.S.
for the entire time period. They, too, experience downward earnings mobility starting in the third year
after migration on average.




                                                   24
       In Appendix Figure A3, we conduct the same analysis and directly control educational attain-
ment. We find that the figures remain qualitatively similar in shape and that there is a general shift
downward of all lines. In Panel A, we find that initial earnings for men are slightly higher for the panel
observations as compared to the repeated cross-section observations, and the attriters have the lowest
initial relative earnings. For women in Panel B, the initial earnings look approximately the same as in
Figure 6.

5.1    Immigrant Earnings Assimilation for Return Migrants by Duration of Stay in
       the U.S.
In Figure 7, we separate out the relative earnings for the return migrants by their duration of stay
in the U.S. These lines are the disaggregated form of the single attrition line shown in the red line in
Figure 6. Of note is that those who leave have quite low earnings in their year prior to emigration.
In many cases, earnings have also experienced a decrease in two years prior to emigration. We believe
that this is the first time this feature of immigrant outcomes has been observed for return migrants
from the U.S. Overall, negative earnings shocks appear to play an important role in determining return
migration for recent arrival cohorts. Note that this downward earnings mobility is a consistent predictor
of return migration across all of our years; this is not simply an artifact of the Great Recession as there
are downward trends for this group prior, during and after the Great Recession.
       In Appendix Figure A4 we decompose the return migrants by two broad education categories—
those with a high school degree or less and those with some college or more. The results show that
there is a downward trajectory in earnings for both groups that end up return migrating. There is
a level difference for those with only a high school degree or less as compared to the other education
category for men, but not for women. Overall, it appears that the return migration isn’t being driven
solely by low-education immigrants. There are relatively highly educated immigrants that experience
downward earnings mobility and opt to return migrate.
       In Appendix Figure A5 we decompose the return migrants by four occupation categories. We
observe occupation in the ACS and not in the W-2 data; thus the occupation identified is what the
ACS respondent reported at entry into the U.S. The most pronounced downward earnings mobility
exists for sales or office occupations and management occupations for men and production occupations
for women. In the other categories earnings are mostly stable across time for return migrants who are
at least initially employed in these occupations.
       In order to explore whether an adverse economic shock affects those who return migrate we
investigate one potential shock—job loss or change. In Table 4 we analyze whether return migrants
are more likely to have changed employers over time, as identified from the Employer Identification
Number (EIN) listed on the W-2. In theory, of course, a change in employers could indicate that a
person has found a better employment match and increased earnings. On the other hand, it may also
signal a job loss that requires finding another employer (especially if an immigrant is in the U.S. on a
work visa) and having to take a reduction in earnings. The estimation reported in Table 4 regresses a
binary indicator variable for whether there is a difference in the EINs reported across adjacent years on
indicator variables for years since migration and return migration. EINs are unique for employers, and
any differences will indicate a change in employer by year.14 The interaction variable between years
since migration and return migration is the variable of interest; this tells us whether an individual that
will eventually return migrate and stays for one year longer will change her employer. We also include
controls such as age, state of residence, year of entry, and a constant. Standard errors are clustered at
the state of residence.
  14
    A certain caveat applies: While the EIN is unique to an employer, large employers who have multiple
establishments may or may not use a single EIN for all establishments. Employers who make use of franchises
are especially prone to multiple EIN use, and a move from one EIN to another may only indicate a change in
franchise location and not necessarily employer (but may still indicate a job loss at the original franchise location).

          The regression results indicate that, for both males and females, the signs of the estimated
coefficients on years since migration and being a return migrant are negative and not always statistically
significant. These results are not surprising and indicate that the shorter one stays in the U.S. the lower
the chances there are of changing an employer. The estimated coefficient of interest, however, is the
interaction of these two variables. This is shown in the first row of Table 4. For men the estimated
coefficient is marginally statistically significant, indicating that return migrants who stay longer in the
U.S. are more likely to have changed employers. The results are positive for women but not statistically
significant. This provides some evidence that job changes (perhaps due to firing) may be a determinant
of male immigrant downward earnings mobility that eventually predicts return migration within the
first 10 years after arrival. For women, we do not observe a similar direct relationship in the available
data.15

5.2    Immigrant Earnings Assimilation by Initial Educational Attainment
In Figure 8, we present a similar analysis for the earnings assimilation by an individual’s own educational
attainment at the time of entry into the U.S. We employ only the panel data, which contain the
individuals who remain in the U.S. for the entire time period. The repeated cross-section analysis is
  15
    We have also conducted a separate analysis where we include a country of birth fixed effect for the top 5
immigrant sending countries and group the rest in a single category. We have also clustered the standard errors
at the country of birth by state of residence categories. These results provide very similar results to those shown
in Table 4 and are available upon request. Additionally, we provide simple ordinary least squares regressions in
Appendix Table A7 which show a similar result when coding for the number of changes in employment by return
migrant status and gender.

presented in Appendix Figure A6 and is qualitatively similar. Thus, the analysis for the next set of
figures answers the question: what is the earnings assimilation of immigrants who remain in the U.S.



                                                                               29
for a prolonged period of time by a specific initial characteristic? In each of the subsequent figures we
will examine this by different individual-level characteristics of the immigrant. We control for age and
state of residence fixed effects in all analyses.
       The results indicate a relatively quick assimilation for all educational levels for men in Panel
A; while immigrant earnings do not reach parity with the earnings of the native-born it is quite close
for those with the highest levels of education. We estimate only a 6 percent difference in earnings
between immigrants and native-born workers. This suggests that an important predictor of remaining
in the U.S. is a relatively quick (within 8–9 years) earnings assimilation experience. Note that the
estimate for individuals with less than a high school education is always above the native-born earnings
estimates for all years. Because these immigrants with lower educational attainment are working in
the formal labor market–which may indicate that their skills for a particular industry are measurable
by something other than a formal degree–comparisons within this group may indicate large difference
in abilities (lower skills for the U.S. population in this education category than for those from other
countries). Additionally, there is convergence in earnings around the depths of the Great Recession and
then a slight divergence after that for those immigrants with less educational attainment. The results
for women in Panel B display a more rapid convergence to that of native-born women in the first three
to four years after arrival for all education groups other than those with less than a high school degree.
After the Great Recession, however, there is some divergence as immigrant earnings decline relative to
the native-born. The group with less than a high school education is consistently above that of the
native-born, just as for men.

5.3   Immigrant Earnings Assimilation by Country of Birth
In Figure 9 we show the earnings assimilation for individuals from the top five immigrant-sending
countries in an analysis similar to that described in the previous section. We find that Canadians have
earnings that are above those of native-born workers in all years for both men and women. By the
end of the period, Indian men have the highest earnings (Panel A), followed by Canadians, Chinese,
Filipinos, and Mexicans. Mexicans have a very flat earnings profile on average, and the average is
consistently below that of the native-born in all years; it is approximately 30 percent lower than native-
born earnings. Chinese immigrants tend to make some of the largest earnings gains especially in the
first five years: their earnings start at a significant earnings disadvantage but ultimately exceed those of
the native-born. Filipinos realize earnings gains over time, but they do not fully converge to the native-
born by the final year in the data. For women, reported in Panel B, the results show that Canadians,
Indians, and Filipinos experienced rapid earnings gains relative to the native-born shortly after arrival
in the U.S. By year two or three all of these immigrants groups have earnings estimates that lie above
the native-born estimate. Chinese immigrant earnings converge to those of native-born by year five,
but they experience a downward trend after that. Mexican women have a flat earnings profile across
all years; their earnings remain at approximately 30–50 percent below those of the native-born in all
years. We also show in Appendix Figure A7 the same analysis for the panel data, where we control for
a person’s educational attainment. The results generally show a downward shift of the observed curves
for all countries of birth shown in Figure 9. We show an analysis analogous to that shown in Figure 9
for the repeated cross-section in Appendix Figure A8.

5.4    Immigrant Earnings Assimilation by Race
In Figure 10 we separate out the earnings assimilation for the immigrants by their race or ethnic
group; all comparisons are with the same race or ethnic groups for the native-born.16 We show in
Appendix Figure A9 the same analysis with the cross-section data for comparison. In contrast to the
educational-attainment results, we find that there is strong earnings assimilation within race and ethnic
groups for males in Panel A. The one race group that far exceeds the earnings of the native-born is the
non-Hispanic white category. Our results are similar to that found by others; Villarreal and Tamborini
(2018) find that Black and Hispanic immigrants have slower earnings assimilation than non-Hispanic
White immigrants. However, these race groups are able to catch up to earnings within their own race
in native-born populations over time. Our additional contribution is showing the earnings assimilation
for the Asian race group which is not often reported; the results indicate that there isn’t a complete
convergence in earnings to native-born Asians, perhaps due to the fact that the native-born population
in this category is, on average, a high-earning group. For women in Panel B there are more differences
across race and ethnic groups in terms of earnings across time. Asian and Hispanic female immigrants
earn significantly less then their native-born co-ethnics over all years. On the other hand, non-Hispanic
Whites and Blacks achieve some earnings parity with their native-born counterparts in the first three
to four years after arrival. These results highlight the differences across race and gender in immigrant
earnings experiences in the U.S. labor market.

6      Immigrant Earnings Growth in Repeated Cross-Sections, Stock-
       Based Panel and Longitudinal Data Settings
In this section, we examine the role that years spent in the U.S. has on the earnings growth of an
immigrant arrival cohort, which we define here as the pooled cohorts between 2004 and 2007 and
captured in the 2005, 2006, and 2007 ACS. The focus on this pooled arrival cohort allows us to eliminate
earlier arrival cohorts that may already have been subject to selective return migration. It allows us
to compute estimates for a single cohort of arrivals over their first decade in the U.S. in a complete
manner given the panel nature of the data. Therefore, we do not focus on differences in average cohort
quality across the four arrival years since these are clustered so close to one another.
        In Table 5 we pool all observations of newly arrived immigrants from the 2005-2007 ACS and
regress the log earnings on the number of years that an individual has been present in the U.S. The
outcome variable is the change in earnings in column one. We include state of residence and age
fixed effects in this analysis; standard errors are clustered at the state of residence. The coefficient of
interest—years since migration—is a count variable for the foreign-born population and set to zero for
the native-born. The estimated coefficient in column 1 in Panel A for men is positive and statistically
significant, indicating that a longer duration in the U.S. will result in greater earnings growth. In
particular, these results show that each additional year of residing in the U.S. will increase earnings by
5.2 percent. These results are qualitatively similar to those found by others using cross-section data. In
columns 2–9, we provide the estimated coefficient on years since migration in that year. The estimated
coefficients are all approximately similar to the estimated coefficient in column 1. An analogous analysis
is provided for female immigrants in Panel B. The results show that there is about a 3.4 percent increase
in earnings by year in the U.S. in column 1. The duration of years in the U.S. is provided in columns
2–9.

       In Table 6, we show both the stock-based panel regression results for the years since migration
as well as the selection-corrected regression that is possible using the complete panel data for male and
female immigrants. In the first and third columns, we replicate the standard analysis conducted by
recent researchers using stock-based panel data for males and females respectively. We use the survivors
from an arrival cohort and their earnings history to identify the earnings growth over their subsequent
time in the U.S. We find that, using an individual fixed-effects regression, the years since migration is
still positive and statistically significant; however, it is about 2.7 (1.2) percent per year compared to
the 5.2 (3.4) percent per year found in the repeated cross-section analysis in Table 5 for men (women).
This is the standard result that has been found by many other researchers in regard to earnings growth
between repeated cross-section and stock-based panel data.
       In columns 2 and 4, we employ a Heckman selection-correction to the analysis as described in
Section 3.3.4.17 This type of selection-correction can only be conducted when the researcher knows
exactly which individuals in the panel data will end up leaving. We use the individual earnings from
two periods prior to the departure date (as suggested by Dustmann and Görlach (2015)) as the exclusion
restriction for each time period. Then we compute the inverse Mills’ ratio and include this correction
term into the pooled OLS regression model. The estimated coefficient on years since migration is then
presented in columns 2 and 4 (for men and women respectively) in the table below. The key difference
between this analysis and the one shown in column 1 and 3 is that we now relax the assumption that
the disturbance terms in the earnings equation and the emigration decision equation are orthogonal to
one another. Allowing them to be jointly determined results in an even larger estimated coefficient on
the years since migration. The estimated coefficient is 6 percent per year for men and 3.3 percent for
women. The estimated coefficient is only marginally statistically significant for men and does not reach
conventional levels of significance for women in this corrected analysis. Overall, the results for men,
at least, indicate that the earnings growth estimated from repeated cross-section analysis may not be
overstating the results at all if there is downward earnings mobility for the return migrants.


7    Discussion of Results for Immigrant Selection
Our analysis reveals some novel insights into the determinants of return migration and its relationship
to the earnings histories of the immigrants. The first finding is that many immigrants return migrate
within a decade of entry, during which almost 40 percent of the arrival cohort has emigrated. Given the
immigrant population that we study—i.e., immigrants who are employed in the formal labor market—
they presumably have a work visa or are in the U.S. on a family-reunification visa. In light of this, a
prior expectation might be that these workers would have had a strong incentive to remain in the U.S.
Their high return rates suggests that important unobserved characteristics play a role in the return
migration decision of many immigrants. It is especially striking that we find the more highly educated
return at higher rates than their lower-educated counterparts, contrary to the expectation that highly
educated workers have the most lucrative options and thus the greatest incentive to remain in the U.S.
The fact that these individuals are leaving may indicate that other factors play an important role in
return migration.

     We provide the regression equations for the Heckman selection-correction in Appendix Table A8. The
exclusion restrictions are statistically significant at the 1% level for all years 2008-2015; indicating that the
earnings lagged by two years is a strong instrument.

       One important result that we document is the downward earnings trajectory of the group of
immigrants who eventually return migrate. It is well known that employer-employee match plays a
strong role in business success and the continued employment of the employee. A mis-match may be
particularly difficult for an immigrant who arrives in the U.S. with a specific work visa and employer.
Firing by an employer makes it highly likely that the immigrant will have to return home unless he (or
she) can find an employer willing to support the work visa. We find in Table 4 that return migrants
are more likely to have a different employer over time, even controlling for years since migration, than
the migrants who stay in the U.S. for the entire span of our data. This suggests that employment
transitions influence return migration, possibly due to firing.
       Unobserved time-variant characteristics also likely play an important role in determining the
immigrant earnings success. Previous research highlighted on the importance of cultural and social
assimilation of immigrants in the U.S. While we have no measures of these characteristics over time,
it is possible that non-cognitive-type skills are important in determining employment relationships
and success. As noted earlier, these characteristics also must be related to the time spent in the U.S.
Therefore, immigrants who remain in the U.S., holding observed characteristics constant, must be those
who are most flexible and integrative with respect to the U.S. labor force.
       Selective return migration plays an important role in determining earnings assimilation and
growth for immigrants. Over time as return migration creates an increasingly high-earning stock of
immigrants, earnings assimilation and growth estimates will be upwardly biased. However, if return
migration is a standard component of all immigrant arrival cohorts, then perhaps this is the measure
that we should be concerned with. Much of the immigration research has been focused on estimating
earnings assimilation and growth for a new (entire) arrival cohort of immigrants. However, if it is
a standard feature of immigrant arrival cohorts that a relatively large number of immigrants return
migrate in the first few years after arrival, it might be more important to estimate earnings for those
who remain. This argues in favor of using the stock-based panel of immigrants (in the absence of
complete panel data).




                                                         39
       On the other hand, stock-based panels can underestimate earnings growth for immigrants if there
is time-variant unobserved characteristics that jointly determine earnings and the decision to return
migrate. In our analysis, we find this to be the case. It remains to be seen if this is a general condition
that persists over different time periods and shocks. Our analysis covers a period including the Great
Recession, which was an extreme outlier in U.S. economic history. Therefore, in another period, the
importance of time-variant unobserved characteristics may actually play a less important role. Further
empirical analysis with complete panel data will shed light on this question.


8    Conclusion
This research uses a novel data set composed of linked survey and administrative data to create a
complete panel dataset for a recent arrival cohort of immigrants to the U.S. The linked ACS-IRS data
provide information on important characteristics of the population such as age, year of arrival, country
of birth, and English language abilities while the IRS data provide a useful panel of earnings linked
at the person level. Typically, this type of data does not exist for the U.S. Previous researchers have
used stock-based panel data which is a complete panel only for those immigrants who have survived
up to a particular point in time. Our data allow us to identify individuals who end up leaving (return
migrating) after their arrival to the U.S. and provides forward-looking information not contained in a
stock-based panel.
       As a result of the additional information provided in the complete panel data, we are able to
provide several new insights into the return migration and earnings growth of immigrants. First, we
show that the attriters (return migrants) experience downward earnings trajectories in the one to two
years prior to their departure. Although several researchers have predicted this negative selection into
return migration, a lack of data has hindered confirmation of this feature of the immigrant experience.
The findings provide evidence that time-variant unobserved characteristics may play an important role
in joint determination of immigrant earnings and the decision to return migrate.
       We also find that there is significant earnings assimilation with native-born workers along a
number of important individual-level characteristics. We find that there is strong convergence within
the race and ethnic groups for immigrants. After large differences in initial earnings by educational
attainment, there is significant convergence to the earnings of the native-born by 10 years later, although
the convergence is not complete. On the other hand, there are large differences in levels and rates of
earnings assimilation by country of birth.
       Finally, we examine the earnings growth of the immigrant arrival cohort using three different
methods. The first estimates provide a rate of earnings growth per year of 5 percent for men and
3.4 percent for women in the repeated cross-section data. The second replicates the analysis using
stock-based panel data and finds, as expected, a much lower rate of earnings growth of 2.7 percent for
men and 1.2 percent for women. Finally, we use a selection-correction analysis that accounts for the
negative selective return migration over time and finds that the estimated coefficients are larger than
the stock-based panel data estimates and closer to those from the repeated cross-section. This finding
provides strong evidence that there are important time-variant unobserved characteristics that play an
important role in determining immigrant earnings and return-migration decisions.
