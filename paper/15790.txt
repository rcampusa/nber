How Much Is Employment Increased by Cutting Labor Costs? Estimating the Elasticity of
Job Creation

                                              ABSTRACT

In search and bargaining models, the effect of higher wages on employment is determined by the elasticity
of the job creation curve. In this paper, we use U.S. data over the 1970-2007 period to explore whether
labor market outcomes abide by the restrictions implied by such models and to evaluate the elasticity
of the job creation curve. The main difference between a job creation curve and a standard demand
curve is that the former represents a relationship between wages and employment rates, while the latter
represents a relationship between wages and employment levels. Although this distinction is quite
simple, it has substantive implications for the identification of the effect of higher wages on employment.
 The main finding of the paper is that U.S. labor market outcomes observed at the city-industry level
appear to conform well to the restrictions implied by search and bargaining theory and, using 10-year
differences, we estimate the elasticity of the job creation curve with respect to wages to be -0.3. We
interpret this relatively low elasticity as reflecting a low propensity for individuals to become more
entrepreneurial and create more jobs when labor costs are lower and variable profits are higher.

       Introduction
       The evaluation of policies or institutions that change labor costs requires a clear understand-
       ing of how such changes affect employment. Discussions of numerous policies, including pay-
       roll taxes, job security legislation, minimum wages and policies related to worker benefits are
       commonly framed in terms of whether they will “kill” jobs or, if cut, help create new ones.1
       As a recent example, in debates about stagnant employment outcomes as economies emerge
       from recession, some analysts have argued that cutting labor costs is the key to re-starting
       employment growth. Embedded in such a claim is the view that higher labor costs substan-
       tially reduce aggregate employment. The evidence on this, however, is rather mixed. Many
       of the studies that examine the direct impacts of policy shifts – such as payroll tax changes –
       find only modest impacts on aggregate employment (Blau and Kahn, 1999), implying rather
       inelastic labor demand curves. This is the same conclusion reached in much of the literature
       directly estimating labor demand elasticities (Hamermesh, 1993). On the other hand, stud-
       ies of regional responses to supply shocks tend to find quite small wage impacts, implying
       very elastic labor demand curves (Blanchard and Katz, 1992; Krueger and Pischke, 1997).2
       Further variation in estimates arises because different studies use different measures of em-
       ployment outcomes (either employment rates or employment levels), often without a clear
       reference to theory to support their choice. Thus, policy makers face a confusing array of
       predictions about the employment impacts of policies that affect labor costs either directly or
       indirectly.
           Attempts to provide estimates of the effects of labor costs on employment must deal with
       the inherent endogeneity problem stemming from the fact that wages and employment are
       jointly determined. In this paper, we provide estimates of the effects of labor costs on employ-
       ment using a search and bargaining model to help guide and motivate our empirical strategy.
       We adopt this modeling perspective because it offers new insights regarding how to estimate
       the effects of labor costs on employment and it imposes simple testable implications which we
       can evaluate with available data. In addition, the model provides a potential explanation for
       disparities among earlier estimates of labor demand elasticities related to the use of different
       forms of variation and different dependent variables.
           In search and bargaining models, labor demand is determined by an equilibrium rela-
       tionship known as the job creation curve. This curve reflects employers’ comparisons of the
       expected cost to the expected benefit of opening and maintaining a vacancy. With unrestricted
       entry, in equilibrium these costs and benefits must just equal one another at the margin. More
       specifically, this zero profit condition implies that a rise in wages (which reduces the benefits
       of a filled job for the firm), must be offset by lower vacancy creation costs. Since the cost of a
       vacancy is increasing in how long it takes to fill it, in equilibrium the tightness of the labor
       market (i.e., the employment rate) must fall when wages rise. This equilibrium relationship
   1
     For example, the California Chamber of Commerce releases an annual list of “job killer” bills which they claim
identifies legislation that will “decimate economic and job growth in California”. Often the identified bills contain
“workplace mandates” which are suggested to increase labor costs.
   2
     The two extremes are captured in the minimum wage literature on one end (where studies commonly find either
small positive or small negative elasticities) and the literature on city adjustments to shocks on the other (where,
for example, Card (1990) finds virtually no wage response to the Mariel Boatlift supply shock in Miami).


                                                         1
       between the employment rate and the wage is the Job Creation curve, and it is the slope of
       this curve in which we are interested. The fact that the job creation curve relates employment
       rates to wages is a subtle but important difference relative to standard labor demand curves,
       which are often expressed as relating employment levels to wages. As we will discuss later,
       the search and bargaining model provides a straightforward explanation for why employment
       rates and employment levels can react differently to wage changes, thereby potentially ac-
       counting for some of the heterogeneity in the labor demand elasticity literature.3
           The second important locus in a search and bargaining model is the wage bargaining curve.
       This represents the outcome of bargaining over the match specific surplus between pairs of
       workers and employers. It is also a relationship between the wage and the employment rate
       since changes in labor market tightness alter the bargaining power of workers relative to
       employers. The equilibrium wage and employment rate are determined by the intersection of
       the job creation and wage bargaining curves. Thus, we can obtain estimates of the slope of
       the job creation curve if we can find exogenous shifters of the wage bargaining curve such as
       would arise from shifts in workers’ bargaining positions that are not directly related to the
       benefits of creating jobs. The main body of the paper is aimed at showing how and under what
       conditions the slope of the job creation curve can be identified with non-experimental data.
           The empirical approach we use in this paper is a structural-IV approach. By this we mean
       that we use a structural model to carefully derive the conditions under which proposed instru-
       ments provide consistent estimates of the coefficients of interest. However, we do not directly
       impose the model structure on the data. Instead, we estimate relatively straightforward lin-
       ear regressions using the controls and instruments indicated from the theory and then test
       the over-identifying restrictions that are implied by the theory. Our goal is to allow the reader
       to fully understand the source of variation we are using to identify parameters and its rela-
       tion to the theory. We depart slightly from “full” structural estimation in that we focus on
       estimating only first order implications of the theory as implied by its linear approximation.
       We believe such a choice is desirable as it offers a simple, clear and intuitive exposition of
       results.
           Given this approach, the theory is the central building bloc and accordingly we begin the
       paper by setting out a multi-sector, multi-city version of a standard search and bargaining
       model. In our model, local labor markets, called cities, are linked through goods trade and
       labor mobility.4 We extend the standard model to allow for multiple sectors as it is key for our
       identification strategy. Furthermore we extend the model to include heterogeneous abilities to
       create jobs in different industries.5 This feature is common in the firm creation literature and,
       in our model, provides an additional justification for a less than perfectly elastic job creation
       curve. Our main assumption regarding potential job creators is that they are proportional to
   3
     For example, within our search and bargaining framework a shift in labor costs (such as arises with changes
in payroll taxes) can trace out the slope of the job creation curve, while a shift in labor supply does not.
   4
     Although labor mobility will allow expected utility to be equalized across localities, labor market frictions will
nevertheless imply that wage determination maintains a local component.
   5
     The selection mechanism implied by our entrepreneur heterogeneity approach shares similarities to other work
that has modeled industries as collections of heterogeneous producers (Hamermesh (1993, Chapter 4), Jovanovic
(1982), Melitz (2003)). The idea that there is heterogeneity among firms has received support from the related
empirical literature (see, for example, Bartelsman and Doms (2000)).

       the population.6
           Our empirical work is based on U.S. Census data from 1970-2000 and data from the Amer-
       ican Community Survey for 2007. Our approach relies on comparing industry-city level
       changes in employment rates between localities with different levels of wage pressure due
       to changes in bargaining position induced by predicted shifts in industrial composition. We
       look at effects over periods of 10 years (except for the shorter 7 year period 2000-2007), and
       therefore the estimates we find are associated with quite long run phenomena.
           The main idea behind our identification strategy builds on an insight from Beaudry, Green,
       and Sand (2009, hereafter BGS) that in a search and bargaining model with multiple sectors,
       a shift in the sectoral composition of the workforce toward relatively high paying sectors im-
       proves the bargaining position of all workers, even holding labor market tightness constant.
       This arises because a worker’s outside option in bargaining with his or her employer is based
       on the wages the worker can obtain in alternative employment options. If, for example, a high
       paying steel mill closes down and is replaced by a lower paying textile mill, this affects the
       bargaining position of other workers in the city even if total employment has not changed.
       The change in bargaining positions arises because employers know that workers’ wages at
       their outside options are now lower and so a threat to quit carries less weight. By working
       with data on wages and employment rates in cells defined by city and industry, we are able to
       take advantage of this insight . We use the theory to show that the wage bargaining curve for
       an industry-city unit should shift with a change in a city-level measure of industrial compo-
       sition, where movements in the composition measure reflect shifts toward or away from high
       paying sectors. We can then identify the slope of the job creation curve in a regression of the
       change in the employment rate in a city-industry cell on the change in the average wage for
       that cell by instrumenting for the wage using predicted changes in the industrial composition
       index of the city. We derive the conditions under which we can obtain two valid instruments
       for capturing changes in the bargaining power of workers through changes in industrial com-
       position, and we report a clear over-identification test of the validity of the assumptions. The
       model also has other testable implications which we assess.
           The main finding of the paper is that the type of labor demand specification implied by
       our augmented model of search and bargaining - which emphasizes employment rate-wage
       trade-offs - is given substantial support in the data. In particular, the specification and over-
       identifying restrictions implied by theory are easily accepted. Given this, we view estimates
       derived from this model as a reliable basis for assessing the impact of wage changes on em-
       ployment outcomes. We present estimates of two types of elasticities identified by the model.
       At the city level, we find an estimate −0.3, suggesting that the employment rate – labor cost
       trade-off is relatively inelastic. At the industry level, we find a larger elasticity, as predicted by
       the theory. We interpret the rather low city-level elasticity as partly reflecting a low propen-
       sity for individuals to become entrepreneurs and create jobs when wages are reduced. The
       model also provides a rationale for why studies focusing on regional adjustment yield results
       that seem to imply a very elastic labor demand curve. In particular, given a constant returns
   6
     In a standard search and bargain model, the elasticity of the job creation curve is driven entirely by the match
frictions. In our set up, this elasticity will reflect both match frictions and the potential supply of job creators. Our
empirical results suggest that our proportionality assumption is a reasonable approximation.

to scale matching technology and the assumption that potential job creators are proportional
to the population, an exogenous inflow of workers simply replicates the economy, with no
impacts wages or employment rates. We show that the data conforms to this property, which
fits with other investigations of the nature of the matching function (Blanchard and Diamond,
1989). Expressed in wage/employment-level space this means that an inflow of workers traces
out a flat relationship as employment expands with no effect on wages. Our interpretation im-
plies that this flat relationship is not related to a perfectly elastic labor demand, but is instead
a series of equilibrium points reflecting adjustments on both sides of the labor market.
    A number of papers are related to this work. First, we build on standard equilibrium
search models (Pissarides, 2000) to include endogenous industrial composition (Acemoglu,
1999, 2001). In contrast to these latter studies, which are mainly theoretical and focus on
factors that influence the composition of jobs, the primary focus of this paper is empirical and
investigates the long-run consequences of industrial composition for wage and employment
outcomes. This focus also differentiates our work from studies of regional adjustment to aggre-
gate labor demand changes (Blanchard and Katz, 1992; Bartik, 1993, 2006). Our paper is also
related to work investigating the impact of labor costs on employment, as surveyed by Blau
and Kahn (1999), and to a large literature examining local adjustment to supply shocks (see,
for example, Lewis (2004), Boustan, Fishback, and Kantor (2007) and Card (2009), among
others), and concerned with issues similar to Krueger and Pischke (1997). Our work is dif-
ferent from all of these studies because it is based on an empirical evaluation of a search
and bargaining model and, therefore, we offer an different interpretation of the data. Our
empirical findings are, nonetheless, largely consistent with the main empirical observations
highlighted in these literatures.
    The remaining sections of the paper are as follows. In section 1 we propose an extended
search and bargaining model and illustrate the implications of such a model for an empirical
specification of a job creation curve. In particular, we use the model to derive both an empirical
specification and an instrumental variable strategy for identifying key parameters. In section
2, we present our data and discuss implementation issues. In section 3, we present a large set
of results. The model we derive implies a number of estimating strategies and we illustrate
how the results from each reinforces the other by satisfying various constraints in the data
that are implied by theory. In section 4 we assess the robustness of our results. Section 5
concludes.



1    Theoretical Framework
In this section, we set out an extended version of a standard search and bargaining model
which incorporates multiple sectors, multiple cities, and limited entrepreneurial talent. Our
goal is to derive an empirical specification of the job creation curve and show how such a job
creation curve can be estimated with city-level data. Because of that goal, our model is highly
stylized, but we will show that it still yields strong testable implications, which will allow us
to evaluate whether such a simple model is a reasonable approximation of the data generating

      process. 7
         We consider an economy in which there is one final good, Y , which is an aggregation of
      output from I industries:

                                            I
                                                           !1/χ
                                                  ai Ziχ
                                            X
                                     Y =                          ,    where χ < 1.                         (1)
                                            i=1

          The price of the good, Y , is normalized to 1 and the price of good i is given by pi . There are
      C local markets, or cities, and the “I” industry goods can be produced in any of these markets.
      The total quantity of good i, Zi , equals the sum across cities of Xic , the output in industry i in
      city c.


      1.1    Search
      We assume that search frictions characterize the labor markets in all cities and focus on the
      steady-state. Initially, we will concentrate on the somewhat extreme case in which workers
      are not mobile across cities. However, as we will see in a later section, the results derived
      here are robust to including worker mobility and allowing housing prices to adjust such that
      the expected utility across cities is equalized.
          Each local economy unfolds in continuous time and consists of firms and workers who are
      risk neutral, infinitely lived, and discount the future at a rate, ρ. Firms and workers come
      together in pairs according to a matching technology and matches end at an exogenous rate,
      δ. Define Lc as the total available number of workers in city c, and Eic and Nic as the number
      of employed workers (or matches), and the number of available jobs in industry i in city c,
                               P                P
      respectively, and Ec = i Eic and Nc = i Nic . The number of matches produced per unit of
      time is governed by the matching function:

                                        M = M ((Lc − Ec ), (Nc − Ec )) ,                                    (2)

      where the inputs are the available pool of unemployed workers, Lc − Ec , and the number of
      vacancies, Nc − Ec . As is standard in the search and bargaining literature, we assume the
      matching technology exhibits constant returns to scale and is increasing in both arguments.
      We test the constant returns to scale assumption in our empirical work.
         These properties of the matching technology imply that we can write the probability that
      a worker encounters a vacancy and the probability a firm fills a vacancy as:

                          M ((Lc − Ec ), (Nc − Ec ))                         M ((Lc − Ec ), (Nc − Ec ))
                   ψc =                                     and       φc =                              ,   (3)
                                  Lc − Ec                                            Nc − Ec
      respectively. In steady state, the flow of workers leaving unemployment must equal the flow
      of workers exiting employment, implying the equilibrium condition:
                                                                  
                                         Ec           Ec Nc Ec
                                       δ    =M 1−        ,   −       .                         (4)

    Our model exposition shares much with that in BGS but the model in that paper emphasizes the wage bargain-
ing curve while here we focus on the derivation of the job creation curve.

       1.2    Bellman Equations
       Firms can open jobs in any industry and city. To create a job in industry i in city c, a firm
       must pay a cost, kic , the value of which will be determined in equilibrium. Denote by Vicv the
       present-discounted value of a vacancy in industry i and city c. In steady-state, Vicv must satisfy
       the Bellman equation:
                                                                     
                                          ρVicv = −ri + φc Vicf − Vicv ,                              (5)

       where ri is the flow cost of maintaining the vacancy and with probability φc the vacancy is
       converted into a filled job, which has a present-discounted value of Vicf . In equilibrium, this
       value must satisfy
                                                                          

       occurs, a firm enjoys a profit flow of pi − wic + ic , and with probability δ the match is broken.
           Workers can either be employed or unemployed. Denote the present-discounted value of
       employment and unemployment in industry i in city c as Uice and Uicu , respectively. The value
       of Uice in steady-state must satisfy the Bellman relationship:

                                            ρUice = wic + δ(Uicu − Uice ),                                 (7)

       where wic is the wage paid to the worker in industry i in city c. When an individual is unem-
       ployed, he receives a flow utility from an unemployment benefit, b, plus a city-specific amenity,
       τc , that can be interpreted as the difference in flow utility associated with amenities when un-
       employed versus when someone is employed. The probability that a potential worker finds a
       job is ψc . Let µ denote the probability that an individual is matched with his previous indus-
       try, and 1 − µ the probability that he draws a job from all industries (including i). Thus, the
       value of unemployment must satisfy:
                                                                                       
                                                                       X
                             ρUicu = b + τc + ψc µ · Uice + (1 − µ) ·        e
                                                                         ηjc Ujc − Uicu  .           (8)
                                                                       j

       The important aspect of equation (8) is that, as long as µ < 1, the utility level associated
       with having lost one’s job in industry i depends on the utility associated with jobs in other
       industries. The instantaneous probability of finding a job in industry j is given by ψc ·(1−µ)·ηjc ,
       where ηjc represents the fraction of vacant jobs that are in industry j. This implies that a
       worker finding a job in another industry is assumed to find it in proportion to the relative size
       of that industry.8
           In writing the above equations, we have assumed that there are always gains from trade
       between workers and firms in all jobs created in equilibrium. Once a match is made, workers
       and firms bargain a wage, which is set according to the bargaining rule:
                                                     
                                           Vicf − Vicv = (Uice − Uicu ) · κ,                           (9)
   8
   We are assuming that workers can only search while being unemployed. While this is a strong assumption, we
maintain it throughout since it has the attractive feature of allowing the problem to be solved explicitly for simple
empirical specifications.


                                                          6
where κ is a parameter governing the relative bargaining power of workers and firms. Finally,
the number of jobs created in industry i in city c, Nic , is determined by the free entry condition:

                                                  kic = Vicv .                                   (10)

    The cost kic should be viewed as the cost of creating a marginal job. If this cost were fixed,
then cities would generally specialize in only one industry. Since we want to generate cities
with employment across a wide range of industries, we model kic as increasing in the number
of new jobs being created locally in that industry. To do this, we model the supply of jobs
as being determined by the decisions of a set of potential job creators who differ in terms of
set-up costs. In particular, we assume that in each period, an individual in city c (in addition
to being a worker) receives the option of creating a job in industry i with probability Ω̃ic . He
then learns his cost of creating a job, which is drawn from the distribution f (·). Since the
expected value of creating a job in industry i in city c is Vicv , all jobs with costs lower than Vicv
will be undertaken. Therefore, the number of jobs created in industry i in city c in a period,
denoted Jic , will be


                                       Jic = Lc · Ω̃ic · F (Vicv ) ,                             (11)

where F (·) is the CDF associated with f (·). In the steady state equilibrium, the number of
jobs created every period will need to equal to the number of jobs destroyed. Given that Eic
represent the level of employment in the industry-city cell, the marginal cost of creating a job
can then be expressed as

                                                             
                                                   δEic
                                       F −1                       = kic ,                        (12)
                                                  Lc · Ω̃ic
where Ω̃ic can be interpreted as a city-industry comparative advantage in creating certain
types of jobs. It will be convenient to decompose this advantage into two terms: Ω̃ic = Ωi + Ωic ,
where Ωi represents an industry effect that reflects systematic job creation probabilities for
industries that is common to all cities, and Ωic reflects a city-industry component with the
                P
property that c Ωic = 0.
    This formulation implies that lower cost entrepreneurs enter the market and create jobs
first. If employment is to expand, the value of creating jobs must rise in order to maintain zero
profits for the marginal entrepreneur who is of increasingly lower quality. This has the effect
in our model of providing an additional reason for a less than perfectly elastic job creation
curve because the supply of potential job creators is negatively related to wages (positively
related to the value of a vacancy, Vicv .). This relationship is what we mean when we refer to
limited entrepreneurial talent: at any given wage, only a subset of potential job creators will
find it profitable to create jobs.


1.3    Model Solution
At the city level, prices of industrial goods are taken as given and an equilibrium is defined by
values of Nic , wic , and E
                          Lc such that equations (4) through (10) are satisfied. At the economy-
                           c


wide level, prices adjust to ensure that markets for industrial goods clear. Price changes

                                                       7
occur when there are shifts in demand for industrial goods, captured in the model by the ai
parameters. Local outcomes respond to industry prices and local advantages, captured by the
Ωic s and ic s. We will take the above description of a steady-state equilibrium as representing
an equilibrium at a point in time and examine how this equilibrium changes in response to
changes in the exogenous driving forces, ai , Ωic , and ic . We develop our empirical strategy by
focusing the difference between two steady-state relationships.


1.3.1   Job Creation
Using equations (5) and (6), we can write the value of a vacancy as:

                                 ρVicv = αc1 · ri + αc2 · (pi − wic + ic ),                   (13)

                (ρ+δ)                 φc
where αc1 = − ρ+δ+φ   c
                        and αc2 = ρ+δ+φ  c
                                           . Note that both αc1 and αc2 depend on a city’s vacancy
contact rates, φc , which, in turn, depend on the city’s employment rate, ELc . It is useful to make
                                                                            c


this relationship explicit by taking a linear approximation around the point where cities have
an identical employment rate and industrial composition (this arises when cities have ic = 0,
and Ωic = 0). In addition, for reasons we will make clear shortly, it will be useful to work in
log changes between two periods. We can then rewrite (13) using a log-linear approximation
as:

                              v                                      Ect
                       ∆ ln Vict = α̃it + α2 ∆ ln wict + α3 ∆ ln         + α4 ∆ict ,          (14)
                                                                     Lct
where ∆xit = xit − xit−1 and we have added time subscripts because we will use data from
several periods. The α̃it s correspond to industry-year specific effects, and, hence, can be cap-
tured in an empirical specification by industry-year dummy variables. The coefficients α2 and
α3 (which are evaluated at common vacancy filling rates) are predicted to be negative since,
all else equal, the return to opening new jobs will be lower when wages are higher and when
the labor market is tighter (implying a longer time to fill a vacancy). The last term represents
an error term that depends on the city-industry cost advantages.
    We now want to relate the change in the value of a vacancy with the employment rate in
an industry. To this end, we can use (12), log-linearizing it and taking differences between
two periods, to arrive at:
                                                         Eict
                                   ∆ ln kict = θ1 ∆ ln        + θ2 ∆Ω̃ict ,                    (15)
                                                         Lct
where θ1 is a positive coefficients which reflects that marginal set-up costs increase (or average
entrepreneur quality declines) as employment expands in a city, and θ2 is a negative coefficient
that reflects the impact of increasing the size of the pool of potential job creators on ∆ ln kict .
   Finally, we can use the entry condition, (10), to equate equations (14) and (15) to give us
an empirical specification for job creation:
                                Eict                                Ect
                         ∆ ln        = ϕit + ϕ2 ∆ ln wict + ϕ3 ∆ ln     + ζict ,               (16)
                                Lct                                 Lct
where the ϕit represent a set of common industry-year effects, and ϕ2 = αθ12 < 0 is the elasticity
of labor demand with respect to wages holding the aggregate employment rate constant. Note


                                                     8
       that this elasticity is decreasing in θ1 . This arises due to the fact that although lower wages
       increase the profitability of job creation less individuals will choose to create more jobs if θ1 is
       high. Hence, in this model, one of the reason that the elasticity of employment with respect to
       wages can be low is that the supply of entrepreneurial activity may have a low elasticity rela-
       tive to variable profits. The more common assumption in the search and bargaining literature
       is to assume that the cost of creating jobs is constant (often zero), and therefore θ1 is implicitly
       zero with the implication that labor demand should be infinitely elastic. By estimating equa-
       tion 16 we will be able to examine whether such an approximation is appropriate. The last
       term in (16), ζic = θ11 (α4 ∆ic − θ2 ∆Ωic ), is an error term that depends on city variable costs
       and job creation advantages.
           Equation (16) forms the basis of our empirical investigation and can be interpreted as a
       Job Creation curve at the city-industry level. Notice that the equation involves a reflection
       problem (Manski, 1993; Moffitt, 2001). To see this, note that ∆ ln E        Lct can be approximated
                                                                                    ct


       by i ηict ∆ ln ELict
           P
                         ct
                            so that (16) involves a regression of the change in the log employment rate
       in a given city-industry cell, ∆ ln ELicc , on its average across such cells within a city. We could
       address this issue directly via an instrument or solve out for ∆ ln E   Lct . We implement both ap-
                                                                                ct


       proaches in our empirical work. However, this will not solve all of the simultaneity problems
       inherent in (16), since within-industry wage changes, ∆ ln wict , are simultaneously determined
       with ∆ ln ELicc in the model and, as we show in the following section, are also a function of the
       city-wide employment rate. Thus, to consistently estimate (16), we must identify variation in
       wages that is uncorrelated with ∆ic and ∆Ωic in the error term in (16) and that is separate
       from variation in the city employment rate. The following section discusses the wage determi-
       nation process in the search and bargaining model and illustrates our procedure for dealing
       with the simultaneity issues.


       1.3.2     Determination of Wages
       Using equations (5) and (6), we can derive an expression for Vicf − Vicv . Similarly, equations (7)
       and (8) can be used to derive an expression for Uice − Uicu . Using these expressions along with
       the bargaining equation (9), we can write the following wage equation:9
                                                                       X
                                            wic = γc0 + γc1 pi + γc2       ηjc wjc + γc1 ic .                   (17)
                                                                       j

       Equation (17) links wages in industry i in city c to the national price of the industrial good,
       pi , and the average level of wages in city c.10 Equation (17) captures the notion that in a
       multi-sector search and bargaining model sectoral wages act as strategic complements; that
       is, high wages in one sector are associated with high wages in other sectors. This follows
       directly from a combination of equations (7) and (8), which show that a worker’s outside option
       in bargaining depends on the wages he could get at other jobs in the city weighted by the
       probabilities of getting those jobs. The intercept, γc0 , is a function of unemployment benefits, b.

     This section is a much shortened version of the discussion in BGS. Thus, BGS can be seen as an extended
investigation of the first stage in the estimation of the job creation curve in this paper.

     The coefficients in (17) are γc0 = [(ρ+δ+ψ   c µ)+κ(ρ+δ+φc )](ρ+δ+ψc )
                                                                            (b + τc ), γc1 = (ρ+δ+φρ+δ+ψ   cµ

                                                                 9
       Thus, (17) reflects the standard search model result that wages are a function of productivity
       (pi + ic ) and the value of a worker’s outside option (which is, in turn, a function of b and the
       wage he would expect to earn in other sectors in the city).
           The wage equation, (17), again contains a classic reflection problem in that the sectoral
       wage depends on the average of such wages in the city. One can respond to this, in part,
                                                                                       P
       by using the model to show that the average wage can be replaced by j ηjc wjc , which is a
       function of national level wage premia. In particular, through a series of simple derivations,
       we can rewrite the wage equation (17) as
                                                                                 X

                                                    j                                   j

       where, νi = wi − w1 (the wage premium relative to an arbitrary baseline industry, 1, at the
       national level), and d˜ic is a function of γc0 , γc1 , γc2 from equation (17) as well as pi . We refer
       the reader to BGS for the derivation linking (17) to (18) but note that the γ coefficients are
       functions of φc and, therefore, of the city-level employment rate.
           Equation (18) states that wages within an industry-city cell depend on the industrial com-
                                                    P
       position of a city as captured by the index j ηjc (wi − w1 ). We will denote this index by Rc and
       refer to it as average city rent. A high value of this index indicates that a city’s employment is
       concentrated in high paying industries. Thus, the specific composition effect captured in (18)
       is one related to the proportion of “good jobs” in a city, where by good jobs we mean jobs in
       industries that pay a relative wage premium.11
           As with the job creation curve, it is useful to make the dependence of wages on the city’s
       employment rate more explicit by taking a linear approximation of (18) under the same con-
       ditions that were used to derive equation (13). Furthermore, to eliminate the city-level fixed
       effects driven by the amenity, τ , we focus on the difference in wages within a city-industry cell
       across two steady state equilibria, denoted ∆wic . This is given by equation (19):
                                                       X

                               ∆wic = ∆di +               ∆       ηjc νi + γ5 ∆    + ∆ξic ,              (19)

       where: ∆di is an industry-specific effect incorporating ∆pi that does not vary across cities,
       and hence can be captured in an empirical specification by including industry dummies; and

       wage determination; an effect which depends on all the parameters of the model.
           To obtain our final equation for wages, we divide both sides of (19) by w1 in order to focus
       on a log specification and re-introduce time subscripts since we will pull data from different
       periods:
                                                                        Ect

     It is important that these wage differentials are rents since if they just reflect compensating differentials or
industry specific skills then workers in other industries could not use them as the basis for bargaining for a better
wage.

1.4    Dealing with Endogeneity
The wage equation (20) developed in the previous section highlights the difficulties in iden-
tifying the parameters in the job creation equation (16). In particular, with ∆ ln wict on the
right hand side of (16) and local productivity shocks ict s appearing in the error terms for both
∆ ln wict and ∆ ln ELict
                     ct
                         , we face a standard endogeneity problem. At first glance, the derivation
of the wage and job creation equations in a multi-sector context also suggests a potential in-
strument: ∆Rct , the change in industrial composition, affects ∆ ln wict through its impact on
bargaining positions but affects ∆ ln ELict ct
                                                only indirectly, through its impact on wages. As de-
scribed earlier, estimating equation (16) also involves solving a reflection problem. We return
to that problem below.
    While ∆Rct may appear at first to be a good candidate as an instrument, there are obvious
reasons to question its validity. In particular, ∆Rct is itself endogenous since it is a function
of the ηs (the industry shares), the ηs can be written as functions of the s and Ωs (the local
productivity shocks and cost advantages), and the s and Ωs are present in the error term of
equation (16). Given this, instead we will propose two instruments that are based in part on
national-level variation in employment and wages, and we will show under what conditions
they are valid. Our proposed instruments are related to the two components in a standard
                                               P                        P
decomposition of ∆Rct given by, ∆Rct = i (ηict − ηict−1 ) · νit−1 + i ηict · (νit − νict−1 ).
    To create our first instrument, we first predicting the level of employment for industry i in
city c in period t as:
                                                              
                                                          Eit
                                        Êict = Eict−1            .
                                                         Eit−1

Thus, we predict period t employment in industry i in city c using the employment in that
industry-city cell in period t − 1 multiplied by the national level growth rate for the indus-
try. We then use these predicted values to construct predicted industry specific employment
shares, η̂ict = PÊict , for the city in period t and, finally, form our first instrument as,
                i   Êict
                                            X
                                 IV 1ct =       νit−1 · (η̂ict − ηict−1 ).                     (21)
                                            i

    This instrument is closely related to the first component of the decomposition of ∆Rct :
the component relating just to changes in the employment composition. By using predicted
changes in employment shares based on national-level employment growth, the instrument
breaks the direct connection between growth in wages and growth in employment at the
industry-city level.
    Our second instrument relates to the second component in the variation of ∆Rct which
reflects changes in national wage premia over time. Those national level changes are weighted



                                                   11
       by the share of the relevant industry in the city at the start of the period. Thus, our second
       instrument is,
                                                X
                                       IV 2ct =    η̂ict · (νit − νit−1 ).                        (22)
                                                      i

           For IV 1ct to be a valid instrument we require (along with it being a significant determinant
       of wages and the assumption that it does not belong in (16)):
                                      I C                        C        I

       where ζict =    1

       this condition are met are best understood by re-stating ic (and Ωic , as well) as the sum of a
       common city component (or absolute advantage component) and a second, relative advantage
       component. Thus, denote ˆct and Ω̂ct as the common components of the s and the Ωs, respec-
                          and v Ω represent the relative advantage components. Then,                     
       tively, and let vict       ict                                                         ict ≡ 
                                                                                                    ˆct + vict
       and, by definition, the vict  s across industries within a city sum to zero (with similar expres-

       sions for Ωict ). Both IV 1ct and IV 2ct are functions of the relative error components, vict−1      ,
                                                                    PI
       but not of the common error component. In contrast, i=1 ζict depends only on the absolute
       advantage component of the s and Ωs (since the vict       s sum to zero). As a result, as we show

       in Appendix A, these instruments provide consistent estimates under the condition that ∆ˆ            c
                                                     Ω
       and ∆Ω̂c are independent of vict−1 and vict−1 ; i.e., that changes in the absolute advantage of a
       city are independent of the past level of comparative advantage for the various industries in a
       city. Note that this allows for the possibility that a city that shifts in the direction of a higher
       wage industrial composition also experiences general improvements in cost advantages. We
       just require that those general improvements not be systematically predictable based on past
       aspects of comparative advantage.
           The use of IV 1ct and IV 2ct provides an over-identification test for the model. The two in-
       struments represent substantially different forms of variation, with one based on movements
       in national-level employment growth and the other on movements in national-level wage pre-
       mia. In fact, in our Census data, described in section 2, their correlation (after removing year
       effects as we do in all of our estimations), is only 0.18. Yet, the model indicates that both types
       of variation should have the same effect on wages and, through them, on employment rates
       since what matters for a workers bargaining position is the change in the average wage in
       other industries, regardless of whether that change stems from changes in industrial com-
       position or the industrial wage premia. Thus, a standard over-identification test represents
       a strong test of the model and the assumption under which the instruments are valid. As
       with all such tests, it is not impossible that an alternative model would imply the same test
       statistic but we have not been able to discern what such a model would look like, while the
       restriction is a clear implication of a search and bargaining model.


       1.4.1    Endogeneity of Employment Rates
       The last endogeneity issue relates to the potential correlation between the change in the
       employment rate, ∆ ln E                                                               Ec
                             Lc , and the error term in (16) arising from the fact that ∆ ln Lc is
                               c


13
     An analogous condition is required for IV 2ct to be a valid instrument.


                                                          12
an aggregation of the dependent variable in (16). Our first response that problem is to use an
instrument that is similar to IV 1 and similar to the one used in Blanchard and Katz 1992. In
                                         P
particular, we use as an instrument i ηict−1 git , where git is the growth rate of employment
in industry i at the national level. Thus, the instrument is the weighted average of national-
level industrial employment growth rates, where the weights are the start of period industrial
employment shares in the local economy. A city that has a strong weight on an industry that
turns out to grow well at the national level will have a high value for this instrument. Because
the ic s that drive the error term are local demand shocks that sum to zero across cities, their
movements are not correlated with the git s by construction. Finally, under the assumption
that ∆ict is independent of vict  , the changes in 
                                                      ict that constitute ζict will be independent
of the ηict−1 s used as weights in the instrument, resulting in a zero correlation between the
instrument and the error term.
    We can also respond to the reflection problem inherent in (16) by forming a consistent
expression for ∆ ln E Lc as a function of other variables in the model and substituting it in for
                       c


∆ ln E
     Lc . We will also pursue that approach in section (3).

1.5    Worker Heterogeneity
As we have indicated, our aim in this paper is to provide an estimate of how employment, on
average, is affected by an across-the-board increase in the cost of labor. By its very nature,
this question is about an aggregate labor market outcome. In the model developed so far all
workers are identical and so all paramters are “aggregate” by definition. However, in our data,
workers are heterogeneous in, for example, education and experience. We need to address this
heterogeneity in order to provide a consistent answer to our aggregate question. Depending
on the assumptions that one makes, there are several ways to approach this issue.
    Our first approach, which we use for our main set of results, is to treat individuals as
potentially representing different bundles of efficiency units of work, where these bundles
are treated as perfect substitutes in production. Therefore, we control for skill differences in
wages via a regression adjustment. However, the theory indicates that we should not account
for differences in worker attributes when aggregating the number of workers across indus-
tries and cities in the calculation of employment rates. In Appendix C, we present a formal
justification for such an approach. Heuristically, the structure of the basic search model al-
lows one to write the wage of any skill type in reference to the wage of some arbitrary type,
which rationalizes the use of the regression adjusted wages. In addition, random matching
implies that the probability of meeting a worker of a given skill type will equal the prod-
uct of the vacancy filling rate and the proportion of that worker’s type in the local economy.
Thus, the effects of labor market tightness and skill can be separated and, we argue in the
appendix, that the latter effects can be expected to be relatively small. Hence, the value of
a vacancy will depend on the skill distribution of the workforce in general, but it is probably
only of second-order importance. Our approach is to ignore these additional effects in our
baseline specification. However, in the robustness section we will show that our results are
not sensitive to controlling for measures of the aggregate distribution of skill in a locality.
    An alternative assumption is that labor markets are segregated along observable skill
dimensions and that our model applies to homogeneous workers within these markets. Thus,

                                               13
       we also perform our analysis separately by education group as a specification check. Finally,
       if one assumes that the matching function is not over workers but over efficiency units then it
       is appropriate when aggregating workers over industries and cities to use efficiency weighted
       worker counts. When we construct our employment variables in this manner it does not
       substantially affect our main results. However, we choose not to pursue this interpretation
       as it appears quite artificial in the search bargaining context. Nonetheless, results using
       efficiency units are available by request.


       1.6    Mobility
       The model presented above assumes that workers are not mobile across localities. It may
       seem, at first, that allowing for worker mobility could overturn the result that wages differ
       across localities because of local bargaining conditions. However, this will not generally be the
       case, even when we allow for directed search across cities. In Appendix D, we offer two exten-
       sions of the model that take into account worker mobility. In the first extension, unemployed
       workers are not perfectly mobile, but are only occasionally offered the opportunity to switch
       cities. Because of this friction, wages (and outside options) will maintain a local component.
       When the option to switch cities arises, workers choose the city that maximizes the value of
       their search. Since this choice will not depend on the initial location of the worker, it acts
       as a common element across workers and is captured by an intercept.14 In this extension of
       the model, none of our empirical specifications are affected and the model’s implications will
       continue to hold.
           In the second extension, we go further by modeling more explicitly the spacial equilib-
       rium. In particular, we introduce local housing prices and allow workers to choose a city that
       maximizes expected utility, taking into account housing costs and local amenities. In this ex-
       tension, we modify workers’ Bellman equations, (8) and (7), to include a negative function of
       the local housing price. Importantly, housing prices will not directly affect wage negotiation
       because it is a cost that is incurred whether or not an individual is employed (and wages de-
       pend on the difference Uice − Uicu ). However, housing prices will have to adjust to equilibrate
       expected utility across cities. In Appendix D, we present this simple model with housing costs
       that depend positively on local amenities and city size. We show that it implies that a city
       with a higher employment rate or a higher expected wages (i.e., due to higher values of Rct )
       will attract more workers. This in-migration will drive up local housing costs to the point
       where expected utility is equalized across cities, but in-migration will stop before wage equal-
       ization occurs. Thus, the forces we emphasize in our model also have implications for worker
       mobility and housing costs. Toward the end of the paper, we present results which support
       this mechansim.



       2     Data Description and Implementation Issues
       The data we use in this paper come from the U.S. decennial Censuses from the years 1970 to
       2000 and from the American Community Survey (ACS) for 2007. For the 1970 Census data,
14
     Random search across cities has the same implication.


                                                       14
       we use both metro sample Forms 1 and 2 and adjust the weights for the fact that we combine
       two samples.15 We focus on individuals residing in one of our 152 metropolitan areas at the
       time of the Census. Census definitions of metropolitan areas are not comparable over time.
       The definition of cities that we use in this paper attempts to maximize geographic consistency
       across Census years. Since most of our analysis takes place at the city-industry level, we
       also require a consistent definition of industry affiliation. Details on how we construct the
       industry and city definitions are left to Appendix B.
           As discussed earlier, our approach to dealing with worker heterogeneity is to control for
       observed characteristics in a regression context. Since most of our analysis takes place at
       the city-industry level, we use a common two-step procedure. Specifically, using a national
       sample of individuals, we run regressions separately by year of log weekly wages on a vector of
       individual characteristics and a full set of city-by-industry dummy variables.16 We then take
       the estimated coefficients on the city-by-industry dummies as our measure of city-industry
       average wages, eliminating all cells with fewer than 20 observations.
           Our interpretation of the regression adjusted wage measure is that it represents the wage
       paid to workers for a fixed set of skills. However, since we only observe the wage of a worker
       in city j if that worker chooses to live and work in j, self-selection of workers across cities may
       imply that average city wages are correlated with unobserved worker characteristics such as
       ability. In this case, our wage measure will not represent the wage paid per efficiency unit
       but will also reflect (unobservable) skill differences of workers across cities. To address this
       potential concern, when we estimate our wage equations we control for worker self-selection
       across cities with a procedure developed and implemented by Dahl (2002) in a closely related
       context.
           Dahl proposes a two-step procedure in which one first estimates various location choice
       probabilities for individuals, given their characteristics such as birth state. In the second step,
       flexible functions of the estimated probabilities are included in the wage equation to control for
       the non-random location choice of workers.17 The actual procedure that we use is an extension
       of Dahl’s approach to account for the fact we are concerned with cities rather than states, as
       in his paper, and that we also include individuals who are foreign born. When we estimate
       the wage equations, the selection correction terms enter significantly, which suggests that
       there are selection effects. Our results with or without the Dahl procedure are very similar,
       which is to be expected since our instruments should induce movements in wages that are
       uncorrelated with the characteristics of the workforce. Nevertheless, all estimates presented
       below include the selection corrected wages.18
  15
     Our data was extracted from IPUMS, see Ruggles, Sobek, Alexander, Fitch, Goeken, Hall, King, and Ronnander
(2004)
  16
     We take a flexible approach to specifying the first-stage regression. We include indicators for education (4
categories), a quadratic in experience, interactions of the experience and education variables, a gender dummy,
black, hispanic and immigrant dummy variables, and the complete set of interactions of the gender, race and
immigrant dummies with all the education and experience variables.
  17
     Since the number of cities is large, adding the selection probability for each choice is not practical. Therefore,
Dahl (2002) suggests an index sufficiency assumption that allows for the inclusion of a smaller number of selection
terms, such as the first-best or observed choice and the retention probability. This is the approach that we follow.

          One of our main covariates of interest is the ∆Rct variable which is a function of the
      national-industrial wage premia and the proportion of workers in each industry in a city. We
      estimate the wage premia in a regression at the national level in which we control for the
      same set of individual characteristics described for our first-stage wage regression and also
      include a full set of industry dummy variables. This regression is estimated separately for
      each Census year. The coefficients on the industry dummy variables are what we use as the
      industry premia in constructing our R measures.
          The dependent variable in our analysis is the log change in industry-city-level employment
      rates. We construct the industry-level employment rate by summing the number of individ-
      uals working in that particular industry divided by the city working-age population. Using
      employment to population ratios means that we include individuals who are classified as be-
      ing out of the labor force as being relevant for labor market tightness. This is consistent with
      previous work on matching functions (Blanchard and Diamond, 1989) and on local labor mar-
      ket conditions (Bartik, 2006). Nevertheless, we have assessed the sensitivity of our results
      to this assumption and found it to be robust to an alternative definition of employment rates
      that restricts the population to include only those individuals that report themselves as being
      in the labor force.19 For most of our estimates, we use decadal differences within industry-city
      cells for each pair of decades in our data (1980-1970, 1990-1980, 2000-1990) plus the 2007-
      2000 difference, pooling these together into one large dataset and including period specific
      industry dummies. In all the estimation results we calculate standard errors allowing for
      clustering by city and year.20



      3     Results
      We begin the discussion of our results by presenting estimates of the first-stage, or reduced
      form, wage equation. These echo results presented BGS where the focus is precisely on the
      estimation of the impact of industrial composition shifts on wages, though the specifications
      are not identical because our focus, here, is on the reduced form. 21
          The columns of Table 1 contain estimates for potential first-stage wage equations. In
      columns 1 and 2, we regress wage changes on IV 1ct and IV 2ct , respectively. This and all
      subsequent specifications include a full set of year-by-industry dummies (4 × 144), but we
      suppress the presentation of these coefficients for brevity. The key point from these columns
      is that both IV 1ct and IV 2ct are strong and highly significant determinants of ∆ ln wict . Re-
correction are very similar to those reported here, and are available upon request.
   19
      We have also assessed the sensitivity of our results to using efficiency weighted counts of workers. In this case,
we calculate employment rates as before, but weighing observations by the relative average wage of their demo-
graphic group throughout our time period. This has little impact on our results. Estimates using this specification
are available upon request.
   20
      We cluster at the city-year level because this is the level of variation in our data. Clustering only by city has
little effect on the estimates of standard errors that we report.
   21
      BGS focus on investigating and interpreting the impact of ∆Rct on ∆ ln wict . They argue that their estimates
imply that the impact of a change in industrial composition on the average wage in a city is approximately 3.5
times what is implied by a standard decomposition approach once spill-over effects from bargaining are taken into
account.


                                                          16
       call from our earlier discussion that IV 1ct and IV 2ct correspond to quite different parts of the
       variation in ∆Rct but the theory implies that they should have the same effect on bargaining
       power and, hence, on wages. The estimated coefficients on the two variables are very similar,
       and we cannot reject the restriction that they are equal at any conventional significance level.
       We view this as a strong piece of supportive evidence for the model. In the last column of table
       1, we include both IV 1 and IV 2 to show that they are both individually helpful in predicting
       wages.


       3.1     Estimates of the Job Creation Curve: Basic Results
       In Table 2, we present estimates of our main equation of interest (16). As in table 1, all the
       reported regressions include a full set of year-by-industry dummies. Column (1) reports OLS
       results. Both the coefficients on the wage and the city-level employment rate are positive and
       highly significant. This is the opposite of what our theory predicts for consistent estimates
       of the coefficients in (16). However, the employment rate and wage equations derived from
       the model imply that OLS estimation of this equation should not provide consistent estimates.
       Moreover, the fact that productivity shocks, ict , enter the wage and employment rate equation
       error terms suggests that the OLS regression coefficients are likely to be positive.
           Columns (2-4) contain results from estimates of (16) using the IV 1 and IV 2 instruments
       developed in section (1.4). As we saw in Table 1, the instruments perform well in the first-
       stage. F-statistics for wages are reported in the bottom rows of Table (2), supporting our claim
       that our instruments are good predictors of within-industry wage changes and we do not face
       weak instrument concerns.
           The IV results indicate that labor costs are negatively associated with sector employment
       rates, as predicted by theory. The magnitude of the estimated coefficients on ∆ ln wict obtained
       from either IV 1 or IV 2 are nearly identical, and a standard over-id test fails to reject the null
       hypothesis of equality at any conventional significance level.22 As argued earlier, we view this
       result as being particularly important. From a theoretical point of view, bargaining implies
       that improvements in workers’ outside employment opportunities should have the same im-
       pact on wages regardless of whether the improvements arise from growth in a high paying
       industry in a locality (the variation emphasized in IV 1ct ) or increases in industrial premia
       in existing industries (the variation emphasized in IV 2ct ). Given this, we also expect labor
       demand responses estimated from either source of variation to be the same since employers
       are only concerned about the bargained wage. From an empirical point of view, this result
       provides an important test of our identifying assumptions. Heuristically, since both instru-
       ments are valid under the same assumptions but rely on very different sources of variation,
       departures from these assumptions will be weighted differently by the two instruments, caus-
       ing estimates to diverge. The fact that we do not observe this provides a stringent test of the
       validity of our instrumental variables approach and is a strong piece of evidence in favor of
       the search and bargaining model.
           The other key prediction from the model is that an increase in labor market tightness
       in a city (as represented by the city-level employment rate) should negatively affect within
22
     The actual test statistic value is 0.17 with a p-value of 0.68.

     industry employment rates. Once we instrument, we do, in fact, find a strongly significant
                                          Eict
     negative effect of ∆ ln ELct on ∆ ln Lct . This is a striking result since one would normally
                               ct


     expect a positive relationship between these variables. As we discussed earlier, it is difficult
     to reconcile this result with a standard neoclassical model but it is a clear prediction of a
     search and bargaining model.
         We are now in a position to interpret the results. Consider a wage increase in a particular
     industry, holding overall employment rates constant. If the industry in question is not so large
     as to have a significant impact on overall employment rates, the estimates using IV 1 and IV 2
     as instruments in Table 2 imply a labor demand elasticity at the industry level of about −1.
         What about improvements of wages in a city more generally? Since all industries will
     adjust employment downward in response to a general wage increase, there will be feedback
     effects on overall employment rates. Allowing these equilibrium effects to play out implies
                                                ϕ2
     a city-level labor demand elasticity of 1−ϕ   3
                                                     or of about −0.30 given our estimates. In other
     words, since ϕ3 is predicted to be less than zero in a search and bargaining model, overall
     wage increases in a locality have a built in dampening effect on employment responses be-
     cause they simultaneously increase the availability of workers. In our model, this leads to
     reduced search costs for firms (because vacancy contact rates are higher) or improved aver-
     age entrepreneur quality (which can be thought of as a reduction in entry costs). Thus, our
     estimates suggest that city-level job creation curves are relatively wage inelastic; with an in-
     crease in wages of 10% impling a reduction in the city-level employment rate of about 3%.
     Since we are particularly interested in the elasticity of job creation at the city level, in the
     following section we pursue a more direct route to evaluating it.


     3.2    City Wide Specification
     In the previous subsection, we addressed the reflection problem relating to city-wide employ-
     ment rates via instrumental variables. In this subsection, we use the alternative approach
     of solving out for city employment rates. We view this approach as an additional check on
     our identification strategy. We begin by substitituting (20) into (16) to obtain a reduced form
     specification:
                Eict                                                             Ect
         ∆ ln        = (ϕit + ϕ2 · dit ) + ϕ2 · β2 ∆Rct + (ϕ2 · β3 + ϕ3 ) · ∆ ln     + (ϕ2 ∆ξict + ζict ) .                (24)
                Lct                                                              Lct
        Aggregating over industries, we can rewrite (24) as:
                                 Ect X            ςit    ς2          X          ςict
                          ∆ ln       = ηict−1 ·       +       ∆Rct +   ηict−1                                              (25)
                                 Lct            1 − ς3 1 − ς3                 1 − ς3
                                          i                                         i

     where ςit = ϕit + ϕ2 · dit , ς2 = ϕ2 · β2 , ς3 = ϕ2 β3 + ϕ3 , and ςict = ϕ2 ∆ξict + ζict .23 Noticing that
     ςit relates to national-level industry growth rates, it can be shown24 that i ηict · ςit can be
                                                                                            P
                                                                 P
     translated into a set of year dummies and the term i ηict−1 · git , where git is the growth rate
23
                                                                                              ηict−1 ∆ ln ELict ≈ ∆ ln E
                                                                                        P
   In performing this aggregation, we have made use of the approximation                  i                 ct         Lct .
                                                                                                                         ct

24
    To see this, rewrite (24) as

                            ∆ ln Eict = ςit + ς2 ∆Rct + ς3 · ∆ ln Ect + (1 − ς3 ) · ∆ ln Lct + ςict .



                                                              18
      of employment in industry i at the national level, as before. Hence, we can write a specification
      that aggregates over industries as:
                              Ect          1      X                  ς2          X          ςict
                       ∆ ln       = dt +        ·   ηict−1 · git +        ∆Rct +   ηict−1        ,                                   (26)
                              Lct        1 − ς3                    1 − ς3                 1 − ς3
                                                        i                                        i

                                                                               ςict  P
      where dt represents a set of year dummy variables and i ηict−1 1−ς           3
                                                                                     is the new error term.
                      P
      The variable i ηict−1 · git is city-level predicted employment growth and is the same variable
      we used to instrument ∆ ln E    Lct in the industry-city level equations. Under our maintained
                                        ct


      assumption, it is uncorrelated with the error term. Also notice that the model implies that its
                     1
      coefficient, 1−ς 3
                         , should be positive: cities with a high initial concentration in industries that
      grow well at the national level have a greater increase in their city level employment ratio.
                                                                                             ς2
      ∆Rct is our index for changes in industrial composition and its coefficient, 1−ς          3
                                                                                                  is predicted
      to be negative. The specification given in (26) says that if demand conditions are the same in
      cities A and B, in the sense of having the same predicted employment growth rates, the city
      with the greater increase in Rct will have less actual growth in employment rates. In terms of
      the model, this occurs because increases in Rct cause an increase in the bargained wage, thus
      lowering job creation.
          We present estimates of the city-level equation given in (26) in columns (1)-(4) of Table
      3. This table has a format similar to Table 2.25 Because of our concern about the relation-
      ship of ∆Rct with the error term, we instrument for it using IV 1 and IV 2. The instrumental
      variables results, given in columns (2)-(4) are in close accord with theory: increases in work-
      ers’ bargaining positions, as captured by ∆Rct , decrease city-level employment growth while
      predicted growth has positive impacts.
          We can now substitute (26) into (24) to obtain an industry-city level equation that elimi-
      nates ∆ ln ELct and, with it, the reflection problem:
                   ct



                                         Eict                          X
                                  ∆ ln        = λit + λ2 · ∆Rct + λ3 ·   ηict−1 · git + eict ,                                       (27)

      where λit are time-varying industry dummies, εict is an error term. One can easily verify that
      the model implies that λ2 and λ3 should be negative.
          Estimates of (27) are given in columns (5)-(8) of Table 4. As can be seen from the instru-
      mental variables results in columns (6)-(8), the estimated λ2 is indeed negative, as predicted,
      and similar whether we use IV 1 or IV 2. It is also interesting to observe the estimated coef-
      ficient on the predicted growth variable, λ3 . In the industry-city level specifications it is neg-
      ative, significantly different from zero, and very stable in all specifications. In contrast, the

Taking the sum of this equation over cities using the weights ωc =                  PEc0 ,   where 0 denotes the initial year, gives:
                                                                                     c Ec0

             X                              X                    X                               X                   X

This implies that ςit can be written as ςit = c ωc ∆ ln Eict + dt − c ωc ςict , where dt is a year fixed effect. Now

taking the sum over i: i ηict ςit = i ηict · git + dt − i ηict c ωc ςict . Since ςict = ϕ2 ∆ξict + ζict and by assumption,
P           P
  c ∆ξict =  c ζict = 0, this last term behaves approximately like white noise. The term dt varies only by year and
can be captured in an empirical specification by year dummies.
  25
     Although we do not present the coefficients here, all estimates of specification (26) include year fixed effects.


                                                                     19

                                                                                            , is predicted
       and estimated to be positive. This sign reversal is possible because of the different variation
       used in each case. Given the inclusion of time varying industry effects, the estimated effect of
       predicted job growth in (27) is obtained from relative growth in employment rates across cities
       within an industry. National-level growth in that industry is soaked up in the industry effects
       and plays no role in identifying the coefficient on the demand measure. In the aggregate spec-
       ification, (26), however, the national-level growth rates are part of the relevant variation. The
       key point is that the switching of the sign of the coefficient on predicted employment growth
       when we switch the identifying variation in this way is a restriction implied by the theory. 26
       We view the fact that the data are supportive of this restriction as further evidence in favor
       of the model.
           Just as we obtained equation (26) by aggregating over the reduced from specification (24),
       we can perform similar calculations to directly get a specification at the city level by aggre-
       gating over (16):

           Estimates of (28) are presented in Table 5. This table has a similar format to those that
                                                                                                       ϕ2
       proceed it, and also contains a full set of year dummies. IV estimates of the coefficient 1−ϕ       3
       in columns (2)-(4) range from about −0.27 to −0.31, which can be interpreted as city-level
       elasticities of labor demand with respect to wages. Recall from Table 2, which examines the
       baseline industry-city level equation (16), we obtained estimates of ϕ2 and ϕ3 of about −1 and
                                                                                      ϕ2
       −2, respectively. We argued that this implied city-level wage elasticities of 1−ϕ 3
                                                                                           ≈ −0.3, which
       is precisely what is obtained in our alternative, city-level approach.



       4     Robustness and Specification Tests
       In this section, we assess the sensitivity of our results to a variety of specification checks.


       4.1 Exploring the Effects of Labor Force Size on Employment
       Determination
       Table 6 contains results from our baseline specification (16) and our aggregated specification
       (28) where we include labor force growth as an additional control variable. Under the assump-
       tions of the model (specifically, that the matching function exhibits constant returns to scale
  26
     The negative effect of an increase in aggregate demand on job creation within an industry arises in the model
because (1) it lowers the vacancy contact rate (through α2 in equation (13)), and (2) it increases the bargained wage
                                                                 ϕ2 ·β3 +ϕ3         2 ·β3 +α3
(through β3 in equation (20)). The coefficient λ3 is equal to 1−ϕ   2 ·β3 −ϕ3
                                                                              = θ1α−α  2 ·β3 −α3
                                                                                                 < 0. Increases in the bargained
wage occur because lower contact rates for vacancies essentially shifts bargaining power in the workers’ favor.
  27
     In deriving equation (28), we have again made use of the approximation i ηict−1 · ∆ ln ELict                ≈ ∆ ln E
                                                                                            P
                                                                                                                        Lct . The
                                                                                                                          ct
          P                                                                                                  ct
variable i ηict−1 · gct in this specification can be justified along the same lines as footnote 24, except that we must
                                                                                                        P
now take into account changes in national-level industrial premia, resulting in the variable i ηict−1 (∆wict − ∆wit ).


                                                              20
       and that the number of entrepreneurs is proportional to the labor force), changes in the size of
       the labor force should have no impact on employment rates once we control for local demand
       conditions and labor costs. The estimated coefficient on labor force growth in these equa-
       tions serves as a check on these assumptions. The first column shows OLS estimates, while
       in columns (2)-(4) we instrument for changes in within-industry wage and city employment
       rates. In columns (1)-(4), we do not instrument the city’s labor force variable. Interestingly,
       when we instrument the wages and employment rate when including the labor force growth
       variable the estimated coefficients on ∆ ln wict and ∆ ln E  Lct change very little from the results
                                                                     ct


       presented in Table 2. It should be kept in mind that since we are examining decadal differ-
       ences, these results should be interpreted as long-term consequences of increasing the size of
       a city’s labor force.
           Since the growth in labor force is not likely to be exogenous, finding that it does not enter
       significantly in columns (1)-(4) cannot be used to infer that it does not affect the employment
       rate, since its coefficient is likely biased. We attempt to address this possibility by construct-
       ing an instrument set for labor force growth that is based on long-term city climate variables.
       Since mobility is likely driven by local amenities, variation in local amenities would poten-
       tially provide a good set of instruments. However, most amenities (not related to employment
       and wages) are relatively constant over time, making them unhelpful as instruments in our
       difference specification. Nonetheless, measures of amenities can still be used as instruments
       in this case if the value of the amenity has changed over time. For example, if the value of
       living in a nice climate has increased over time then the level of the climate indicator variable
       can be used as an instrument variable for labor force growth.28 Building on this insight, we
       collected data from a number of sources to construct an instrument set consisting of average
       temperatures and precipitation for each city in our sample. Consistent with the idea that
       workers are increasingly drawn to cities by amenity factors, we find that indicators of mild
       climates are significant predictors of city labor force growth.29
           The estimates in column (5) of Table 6 show the results using all of the instruments in-
       cluding the climate variables. The first stage F-statistic on labor force growth, reported in the
       second last row of the table, is 24.0, indicating that we predict labor force growth quite well.
       The estimated coefficient (standard error) on the labor force growth variable is -0.12 (0.072),
       which is larger than the non-instrument results but still not statistically significant. The
       estimated coefficients on ∆ ln wict and ∆ ln ELict
                                                       ct
                                                          , are slightly lower, but still imply a city labor
                                −.77
       demand elasticity of 1+1.28 = −0.34, which is in line with our previous estimates. In column
       6, we report results from the city-level specification (28) with labor force growth included and
       using the climate instruments. This exercise provides support for the idea that a job creation
       curve – which represents a trade-off between wages and employment rates– is likely a bet-
       ter specification for examining the wages effect on employment than a more traditional labor
  28
      This idea comes from Dahl (2002) who empirically tests a Roy (1951) model of self-selection of workers across
states. He finds that while migration patterns of workers are partially motivated by comparative advantage,
amenity differences across states also play a role in worker movements.
   29
      The validity of the climate instruments rests on the assumption that the relationship between city climate and
city-industry job creation and cost advantages (the Ωs and s) is constant over time. In this case, the relationship
is entirely captured in time-invariant city-specific effects that are differenced out of the estimating equation. This
assumption may not be valid if the evolution of these advantages are related to long-term climate conditions.

       4.2     Exploring Worker Heterogeneity
       The model we developed in section 1 conceptually applies to workers of a single skill group.
       In section 1.5 we discussed how we address worker heterogeneity while at the same time
       focusing on the workforce as a whole. In this section, we assess this approach in two ways.
       First, we evaluate the sensitivity of our results to including variables designed to capture
       changes in the skill distribution of a city’s labor force. As discussed earlier, in a version of the
       model with perfectly substitutable bundles of efficiency units of work, the skill distribution of
       the labor force can affect job creation. We argued that we expect this effect to be second order
       in size but we wish to assess that expectation. Second, in keeping with the conceptual idea
       that the model may apply best to workers of a single type, we estimate our basic specification
       separately for workers with high school education or less and those with some post secondary
       or more.
           Table 7 presents results obtained by adding additional regressors to capture changes in the
       skill distribution of a city’s workforce. The first variable we construct is the average efficiency
       units per person.30 Increases in this variable indicate that the workers in a city have become,
       on average, more productive and is designed to capture the effect that a firm opening a new
       vacancy has a higher probability of meeting a higher quality worker. We also construct an
       instrument designed to capture plausibly exogenous movements in this variable. To do this,
       we draw on literature that uses “enclaves” to predict immigration flows. In particular, we
       exploit the fact that immigrants from different sending countries have on average different
       educational attainment as well as other observable characteristics that influence a worker’s
       efficiency weight. We construct this instrument as follows: we assume immigrants from send-
       ing country h entering the country over a particular decade, denoted by Mht , choose cities
       based on where previous waves of immigrants from the same sending country had settled.
       Denote the fraction of immigrants from sending country h living in city c at time t, as λhct .
       The predicted number of immigrants that will move to city c in year t, M̂ct , can be written as:
                                                         X
                                                M̂ct =       λhct−1 · Mht .
                                                         h

       Similarly, we can construct the predicted number of workers in efficiency units that move to
                             EU =
                                  P
       city c in year t as M̂ct    h λhct−1 ·Mht ·ωht−1 , where ωht−1 is the efficiency weight per worker
       from sending country h in the base year. To predict changes in the average efficiency units
       per worker, assuming no other changes in population, we construct the following instrument:
                                                              !
                                             M̂ EU                    M̂ct
                                                ct
                                  IVctEU =          − EUct−1 ·                ,                      (29)
                                              M̂ct               M̂ct + Lct−1
                 EU
               M̂ct
       where           is the predicted average efficiency units per worker arriving in city c in year t.31
                M̂ct

  30
   For additional details on how we calculate efficiency units, see Appendix B.
  31
   The formulation of this instrument is similar to Doms and Lewis (2006), and in the same spirit as Card and
DiNardo (2000) and Card (2001, 2009), among others.


                                                             22
           The results that include changes in efficiency units per worker as an additional control are
       presented in columns (1)-(4) of Table 7. In the first column, where all variables are treated
       as if exogenous, the change in efficiency units per worker does not enter significantly. IV
       results are given in columns (2)-(4), where we include IVctEU in the instrument set. In line
       with previous literature, the immigration enclave instrument predicts changes in a city’s skill
       composition quite well.32 Nevertheless, in no specification is the skill variable significant, and,
       more importantly, it alters the magnitude of the estimated demand elasticities very little. To
       further probe sensitivity of our results to changes in city skill distribution, columns (5)-(8)
       add alternative measures of a city’s skill. In columns (5) and (6), we include the change
       in the fraction of college graduates as an additional control. When treated exogenously, as in
       column (5), it enters significantly but does not change the main conclusions regarding demand
       elasticities. In column (6), we instrument the change in the proportion of college graduates
       with an enclave instrument similar to (29).33 This results in imprecise estimates that are
       not significantly different from zero despite a strong first-stage. In the remaining columns,
       (7) and (8), we include the change in the proportion of workers with education greater than
       high school. Again, inclusion of this variable does not alter the main conclusions of the paper
       thus far. We conclude that changes in a city’s skill distribution have, at best, only a second
       order effect on job creation and do not appreciably affect the estimated magnitude of our key
       parameters.
           In Table 8 we estimate our basic specification separately by education group. The edu-
       cation groups we consider are those with high school education or less and those with some
       post secondary or more.34 When we perform this exercise, we are assuming that there are
       two completely segregated markets defined by education.35 The dependent variable in Table
       8 is the change in log city-industry employment rates for a particular education group. Simi-
       larly, wages and their instruments are constructed separately by education group.36 However,
       we maintain the use of aggregate, city-wide employment rates (over all education groups) to
       capture the effects of limited entrepreneurial talent (which should operate at the city level)
       and vacancy contact rates.37 Columns (1)-(4) pertain to the low-education group and columns
       (5)-(8) to the high-education group. The results for the low education group are very similar to
       those for the full sample. The results for the (smaller) post-secondary group are more erratic
  32
      The first-stage t-ratio on IVctEU in the change in efficiency units per worker equation is over 8.0 in all specifica-
tions.
   33
      In this case, the instrument is constructed in exactly the same way as Doms and Lewis (2006).
   34
      We have assessed the sensitivity of our results to finer breakdowns in education which typically resulted in
very imprecise estimates. Finer skill definitions dramatically reduces the number of city-industry cells to work
with, and, thus, produces sample size problems.
   35
      Empirical evidence suggests that workers within our education classes are perfect substitutes, but that there
is imperfect substitution of workers between the high- and low-education groups (Card, 2009). This latter type of
substitution is ruled out in this framework.
   36
      For example, IV 1 and IV 2 are constructed using city-industry shares and national wage premia that are esti-
mated off of education specific samples.
   37
      While it may be argued that vacancy contact rates for a particular education group would vary with education
specific employment rates, using education specific employment rates made very little difference in practice. In
addition, to the extent that one believes vacancy contact rates play little role in job creation compared to limited
entrepreneurial ability, the aggregate employment rate specification would be preferred.


                                                           23
      but tend to imply a similar sized wage elasticity.


      4.3     Further Model Implications
      The multi-city, multi-sector search and bargaining model that we present implies that shifts
      in industrial composition toward or away from higher paying industries affect the bargained
      wage in all sectors of the local economy. This occurs because these shifts influence the outside
      options of workers, and we use this implication to obtain estimates of the elasticity of the job
      creation curve with respect to wages. As noted in our discussion of an extension of the model
      that incorporates worker mobility in section 1.6, these same shifts should be associated with
      worker mobility and changes in local housing prices. That is, conditional on the tightness of
      the labor market, a pure compositional shift toward higher paying industries will increase the
      average city wage and, thus, be associated with in-migration and higher housing costs. This
      is laid out more formally in Appendix D.
          In this subsection, we briefly explore whether these predictions are born out in the data.
      Table 9 investigates whether changes in the within-industry average city wage and city-level
      employment rates are correlated with in-migration and housing prices, proxied by the rental
      rate of a two or three bedroom apartment.38 The table has a similar lay-out to previous
      ones: it contains regression coefficients estimated on our city-level data and all specifications
      contain year fixed-effects which are suppressed from the table. In the first four columns,
      the dependent variable is the log change of the size of a city’s labor force. The first column
      is estimated via OLS, while the remaining three columns instrument for city wage using
      either IV 1 or IV 2 and using the Blanchard-Katz instrument used earlier for the employment
      rate. When we use our instruments, we find that both wages and employment rates enter
      significantly and indicate a positive association with in-migration as the mobility-extended
      model predicts. In the final four columns of the table, the dependent variable is the log change
      in the rent of a two or three bedroom apartment. Again, the estimated coefficients on city
      wages and employment rates are supportive of our interpretation of the data. That is, the
      forces in our model that drive wages also drive worker mobility flows, with housing prices
      being an equilibrating mechanism.



      5     Conclusion
      In this paper, we extend and estimate an empirically tractable version of a search and bar-
      gaining model. Our goal is to highlight the implications of such a model for labor demand and
      to provide estimates of the responsiveness of employment outcomes to changes in average
      wages. In a search and bargaining model, labor demand is determined by points along the job
      creation curve, which is implicitly defined by a zero marginal profit condition for the creation
      of a vacancy. According to this condition, when wages rise the tightness of the labor market
      must fall in order to maintain the value of creating jobs. Therefore, the job creation curve
      defines a relationship between wages and employment rates rather than employment levels,
      as in more standard set-ups. We argue that this seemingly small difference has substantial
38
     Appendix B contains details on the construction of this variable.


                                                         24
implications. Chief among these is that shifts in labor supply and labor costs can produce
very different labor market outcomes; that is, supply and wage shocks do not imply move-
ments along the same demand curve in a search and bargaining model. This insight has the
potential to explain some of the differences in labor demand elasticities that are presented in
the literature.
    In order to empirically evaluate the relevance of the search and bargaining framework,
we extend an otherwise standard Pissarides (2000) model in several directions. First, our
model includes multiple local labor markets linked through trade and labor mobility. There is
substantial variation in employment levels and rates across cities, allowing for the identifica-
tion of city-level job creation curves. Second, we extend the model to include multiple sectors,
which is crucial for our identification strategy. Using insight developed in BGS, we use pre-
dicted industrial composition shifts to identify movements in average city wages induced by
shifts in the outside options of workers. In a search and bargaining model, improvements in
the outside employment opportunities of workers increases the bargained wage across all sec-
tors within a locality. Finally, we extend the standard model to include heterogeneous talent
across the population in terms of abilities to create jobs in different industries. With this ex-
tension, the job creation curve may be less than perfectly elastic because of both search costs
and the limited availability job creators.
    A key feature of this model is that it implies tight testable implications in the form of over-
identifying restriction. We use U.S. Census data from 1970-2007 to investigate whether city-
level labor market outcomes conform to these restrictions. Working mainly at the industry-
city level, our approach relies on comparing industry level changes in employment rates be-
tween cities with different changes in within-industry wages. We look at effects over periods
of 10 years and, therefore, our estimates should be interpreted as representing long-run labor
market outcomes. Importantly, we find that the model’s main over-identifying restriction is
easily passed in the data. While this observation does not necessarily prove that the theory is
correct, we nevertheless believe that this provides compelling evidence in favor of the model.
Based on this, we view estimates derived from this model as a reliable basis for assessing the
impact of wage changes on employment outcomes.
    The model implies two types of labor demand elasticities. The first corresponds to the effect
of an increase in the cost of labor on a particular sector’s employment rate while holding the
overall tightness of the labor market in the city constant. Our estimate of that, partial equilib-
rium elasticity is close to −1. We also examine how the local labor market as a whole reacts to
a general increase in wages, allowing for interaction across sectors through the availability of
workers and job creators. For this aggregate elasticity we obtain an estimate of approximately
−0.3. We view the aggregate elasticity as the relevant concept for most policy discussions and
see our estimate as indicating a reasonable but relatively inelastic relationship. For example,
our estimates suggest that a 15% increase in wage costs will be associated with an increase in
unemployment of 5% (which in many cases would corrspond to doubling the unemeployment
rate). Our model suggests that the somewhat low elasticity partly reflects a weak propen-
sity for individuals to become more enterpreneurial and create more jobs as labor costs are
reduced. This could arise either because the supply of new entrepreneurs is quite inelastic
or because the creation of more jobs by existing entrepreneurs is limited by span of control


                                                25
       problems. We hope to explore such mechanisms more in depth in future research.
           Finally, the model provides a simple way to reconcile different estimates of the elasticity
       of labor demand obtained from policy shifts such as minimum wage or payroll tax changes
       versus from supply shifts. Within a search and bargaining model, the policy shifts correspond
       to increases in labor costs (a shift up in the wage bargaining curve) and, thus, can identify
       the slope of the job creation curve. In this sense, it is encouraging that our small estimated
       elasticity fits with the main body of estimated effects from these policies. Our estimates,
       though, stem from very different data variation and correspond to general wage increases
       that are relevant for the whole workforce. On the other hand, an increase in the size of
       the labor force, in contrast to a standard supply and demand model, does not trace out the
       equivalent of the labor demand curve in a search and bargaining model. Instead, it potentially
       affects labor market tightness, causing adjustments on both sides of the market. At this point,
       our finding that our results fit with a constant returns to scale specification of the matching
       function and the stock of entrepreneurial talent is important. Given this, an increase in labor
       force size (perhaps due to immigration) will not change the equilibrium employment rate
       or wage. Thus, employment will increase (in order to restore the equilibrium employment
       rate) but wages will not change and in employment - wage space this could be interpreted as
       reflecting a very elastic labor demand curve. Instead, our framework provides an explanation
       to this relation that does not imply that increases in wage costs will be associated with drastic
       reductions in employment.



        A      Consistency
       We are interested in the conditions under which our instruments can provide consistent es-
       timates. Apart from the instruments being correlated with ∆Ric and ∆wic , the condition we
       require for a given instrument, Zc , is
                                                1 1 XX
                                            lim        Zc ∆ζic = 0.                               (A-1)
                                          C,I→∞ I C
                                                     c   i

       We will handle the limiting arguments sequentially, allowing C → ∞ first.39 Recall that IV 1
       is given by:
                                            X
                                       Zc =   ηjc (gj∗ − 1)(wj − w1 ),                        (A-2)
                                                  j

                        1+g
       where gj∗ = P ηkc (1+g
                           j
                              k)
                                 and gj is the growth rate in employment in industry j at the national
                     k
       level. Given this, (A-1) becomes:
                                       1 X            X               X
                                    lim    (wj − w1 )   ηjc (gj∗ − 1)   ∆ζic .                    (A-3)
                                   C→∞ C
                                            j         c                     i

           We can derive an equation for shares as:

                                                       Ω̃ic · F (Vicv )
                                                ηic = P                v
                                                                                                  (A-4)
                                                        i Ω̃ic · F (Vic )

     Throughout this appendix we omit the t subscript for simplicity.


                                                             26
       Taking linear approximation, again, around the point where Ωic = ic = 0 yields the following
       expression:40
                                                      !                      !
                                1             1X                   1X
                           ηic ≈ + π1 ic −        ic + π2 Ωic −        Ωic                    (A-5)
                                I             I                    I
                                                         i                          i

       The πs are positive coefficients obtained from linear approximation. We can decompose the s
                                                                      and Ω = Ω̂ + v Ω , which gives:
       and Ωs into absolute and comparative advantages, ic = ˆc + vic     ic   c   ic

                                                     1                   Ω
                                             ηic =     + π1 · vic + π2 · vic                            (A-6)
                                                     I
                                             and Ω = Ω̂ + v Ω into the last term of (A-3), gives:
       Similarly, substituting ic = ˆc + vic     ic   c   ic
                                       X
                                            ∆ζic = λ1 · I · ∆ˆ
                                                             c + λ2 · I · ∆Ω̂c ,                       (A-7)
                                        i

       which depends only on the increments of the absolute advantage components. From equation
       (A-6), the city-industry shares depend only on the relative advantage components. Thus, (A-
       3) equals zero provided that E(∆ˆ   c ) = E(∆Ω̂c ) = 0, and that ∆ˆ
                                                                          c and ∆Ω̂c are independent
       of past values of the relative advantage components, vic and vcΩ . In other words, general
                                                                   

       improvements in a city must be unrelated to past industry relative advantages.
           Similarly, the relevant condition when using IV 2 is given by
                                         1 X             X     X
                                      lim    ∆(wj − w1 )   ηjc   ∆ζic ,                                 (A-8)
                                     C→∞ C
                                                j        c                 i


       and the same conditions (∆ˆ                                               and of v Ω ) ensure that
                                       c to be independent of past values of vic           ic
       this condition equals zero.
          An important point follows from this discussion. If the key identifying assumption un-
       derlying the IVs is not true (i.e., changes in absolute advantage are not independent of past
       comparative advantage) then the two IV’s weight the problematic correlation (between ∆ˆ            c
             
       and vic ) differently (in particular, IV 1 weights using the weights (wj − w1 ), while IV 2 uses the
       weights ∆(wj − w1 )) and estimates based on the different IVs should differ.



        B     Data
       The Census data was obtained with extractions done using the IPUMS system (see Ruggles,
       Sobek, Alexander, Fitch, Goeken, Hall, King, and Ronnander (2004). The files were the 1980
       5% State (A Sample), 1990 State, 2000 5% Census PUMS, and the 2007 American Community
       Survey. For 1970, Forms 1 and 2 were used for the Metro sample. The initial extraction
       includes all individuals aged 20 - 65 not living in group quarters. All calculations are made
       using the sample weights provided. For the 1970 data, we adjust the weights for the fact
       that we combine two samples. We focus on the log of weekly wages, calculated by dividing
       wage and salary income by annual weeks worked. We impute incomes for top coded values by
  40
    Recall that if Ωic = ic = 0 then the industry shares are equal across cities. We further assume, for simplicity,
that the shares are equal to I1 at this point.


                                                             27
       multiplying the top code value in each year by 1.5. Since top codes vary by State in 1990 and
       2000, we impose common top-code values of 140, 000 in 1990 and 175, 000 in 2000.
           A consistent measure of education is not available for these Census years. We use indi-
       cators based on the IPUMS recoded variable EDUCREC that computes comparable categories
       from the 1980 Census data on years of school completed and later Census years that report
       categorical schooling only. To calculate potential experience (age minus years of education mi-
       nus six), we assign group mean years of education from Table 5 in Park 1994 to the categorical
       education values reported in the 1990 and 2000 Censuses.
           Census definitions of metropolitan areas are not comparable over time since, in general,
       the geographic areas covered by them increase over time and their definitions are updated to
       reflect this expansion. The definition of cities we use attempts to maximize geographic com-
       parability over time and roughly correspond to 1990 definitions of MSAs provided by the U.S.
       Office of Management and Budget.41 To create geographically consistent MSAs, we follow a
       procedure based largely on Deaton and Lubotsky (2001) which uses the geographical equiv-
       alency files for each year to assign individuals to MSAs or PMSAs based on FIPs state and
       PUMA codes (in the case of 1990 and 2000) and county group codes (for 1970 and 1980). Each
       MSA label we use is essentially defined by the PUMAs it spans in 1990. Once we have this
       information, the equivalency files dictate what counties to include in each city for the other
       years. Since the 1970 county group definitions are much courser than those in later years, the
       number of consistent cities we can create is dictated by the 1970 data. This process results
       in our having 152 MSAs that are consistent across all our sample years. Code for this exer-
       cise was generously provided by Ethan G. Lewis. Our definitions differ slightly from those in
       Deaton and Lubotsky (2001) in order to improve the 1970-1980-1990-2000 match.
           We use an industry coding that is consistent across Censuses and is based on the IPUMS
       recoded variable IND1950, which recodes census industry codes to the 1950 definitions. This
       generates 144 consistent industries.42 We have also replicated our results using data only
       for the period 1980 to 2000, where we can use 1980 industry definitions to generate a larger
       number of consistent industry categories.43 We are also able to define more (231) consistent
       cities for that period.
           We create a variable to proxy for the cost of housing in a city by using a measure of the
       rental rate of a two or three bedroom apartment in that city. To construct this variable, we
       use the Census variable for ‘contract rent’ and restrict it to the reported rent for two or three
       bedroom apartments in each of our MSAs. This is a similar procedure to that used recently
       by Moretti (2008). See that paper for a discussion on the appropriateness of this measure for
       local housing costs.
           Efficiency units are constructed by dividing the data, in each year, into demographic cells
       defined by potential experience (5 categories), education (4 categories), gender, and immi-
  41

       The program used to convert 1990 codes to 1980 comparable codes is available at

David Macpherson, Florida State University. Code to convert 2000 industry codes into 1990 codes was provided by
Chris Wheeler and can be found at http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/past/2006. See also a complete
table of 2000-1990 industry crosswalks at http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/ioindex/indcswk2k.pdf

grant status. We then calculate the average weekly wage and share of employment for each
cell by year. We create a set of fixed-weights by averaging the employment shares for each
demographic group across years, and construct an index of wages by year by taking the fixed-
weighted average of wages in each year. Our measure of efficiency weights uses the average
value of index for each cell over the number of years of our data set. When calculating effi-
ciency units of workers, we use the efficiency weight multiplied by the sampling weight for
each worker.


B.1     Enclave Instrument
The construction of the enclave instrument is similar to that of Doms and Lewis (2006) and
uses their origin country groupings. The country of origin groups are (1) Mexico, (2) Central
America, (3) South America, (4) Central Europe and Russia, (4) Caribbean, (5) China, (6)
South East Asia, (7) India, (8) Canada, U.K., and Australia, (10) Africa, (11) Korea and Japan,
(12) Pacific Islands, (13) Israel and NW Europe, (14) Middle East, (15) Central Asia, (16) Cuba,
and (17) Souther Europe and can be identified from the IPUMS variable bpl ‘‘Birthplace
[general version]’’ . To identify the inflows of immigrants, we use the IPUMS variable
yrimmig ‘‘Year of immigration’’.


B.2     Climate Instrument
The city level climate variables were extracted from “Sperling’s Best Places to Live”
    (http://www.bestplaces.net/docs/DataSource.aspx). Their data is compiled from the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The variables we use in this paper are the
average daily high temperatures for July and January in degrees Fahrenheit. Alternative
variables available from the same source are annual rainfall in inches and a comfort index.
The comfort index is a variable created by “Sperling’s Best Places to Live” that uses afternoon
temperature in the summer and local humidity to create an index in which higher values re-
flect greater “comfort”. We have also compiled climate data from an alternative source to use
as a robustness check. These data come from “CityRating.com’s” historical weather data, and
include variables on average annual temperature, number of extreme temperature days per
year, humidity, and annual precipitation. Data from this source could only be collected for 106
cities, and, therefore, not included in this analysis.



 C     Worker Heterogeneity
Consider a simple search and bargaining model in which there are two types of workers:
high- and low-skill. Let θ denote the fraction of high-skill workers and η > 1 denote relative
productivity of high versus low skill workers.




                                              29
          The Bellman equations for firms can be written as:44

                                    rV = −γ + φ · (θ · JH + (1 − θ) · JL − V )                       (C-9)
                                                 rJi = ηi · p − wi + s · (V − Ji )                  (C-10)

       Combining (C-9) and (C-10), gives the value of a vacancy:

                                 −(r + s) · γ + φ (θ · (η · p − wH ) + (1 − θ) · (p − wL ))
                          rV =                                                              .       (C-11)
                                                         r+s+φ

       Workers of each skill type of the following Bellman equations:

                                               rUi = b + ϕ · (Ei − Ui )                             (C-12)
                                               rEi = wi + s (Ui − Ei ) ,                            (C-13)

       for type i ∈ {High, Low}. Wages are set according to the rule (1 − β)(Ei − Ui ) = β(Ji − V ). This
       gives

                                        wi = (1 − β) · rUi + β · (ηi p − rV )                       (C-14)

       The Bellman equations for workers gives rUi as

                                                     b · (r + s) + ϕ (wi )
                                             rUi =                         .                        (C-15)
                                                           r+s+ϕ

       Hence, wages can be written as:

                                                               (1 − β) · Ψ · b(r + s)
                                  wi = βΨ(ηi · p − rV ) +                                           (C-16)
                                                                    r+s+ϕ
                                     r+s+ϕ
       for each type where Ψ =      r+s+βϕ .   Then the wage differential between high- and low-skill
       workers is:

                                          wH − wL = βΨp · (η − 1) > 0.                              (C-17)

       We can also calculate the difference in the flow profits for a firm meeting a high- versus low-
       skill worker:

                              (η · p − wH ) − (p − wL ) = p · (η − 1) · (1 − βΨ) > 0                (C-18)

       Notice that we can write the high-skill wage in terms of the low-skill wage, which rationalizes
       the use of regression adjusted wages. Also, we can rearrange the job creation equation so that
       it depends on low-skill wage, plus θ times the difference in flow of profits. This reduces the
       value of a vacancy to a function of three variables rV = G(θ, E  , wL ; β, η, r, s) where φ = φ E
                                                                                                         
                                                                      L                                L
       and ϕ = ϕ E
                     
                    L are a function of the employment rate.
           Setting γ = 0, we can write
                                      φ
                             rV =         · (θ · p · (η − 1) · (1 − βΨ) + p − wL ) .                (C-19)
                                    r+s+φ
  44
    Here, we assume that firms meeting either high- or low-skill workers will form matches. This can be seen as a
restriction that η cannot be too large.


                                                          30
          The term interacting with the skill variable, θ, in equation (C-19) will be proportional to
       (1 − βΨ), which is equal to:

                                                          (1 − β)(r + s)
                                             1 − βΨ =                                                   (C-20)
                                                            r + s + βψ

       If r +s is small relative to ψ (Blanchard, 1998), this term will also be small. Hence, we assume
       these skill effects only secondary and we can focus on rV = G̃( E   L , wL ; β, η, r, s). This justifies
                                                                        E
       using efficiency wages while not making any adjustments for L in the baseline empirical work.
       We assess the sensitivity of this assumption in a robustness section by including measures of
       city skill, skill breakdowns, and efficiency units. None of our results seem to be sensitive to
       any of these alternative specifications.



        D      Worker Mobility
       The purpose of this section is to extend our search and bargaining model to include worker
       mobility and to demonstrate that this extension does not change the main implications of
       our model. We consider two extensions of the model. In the first case, suppose unemployed
       workers have the option of occasionally switching cities. When this situation arises, with prob-
       ability µ1 , workers choose to move to the city that maximizes their expected utility, maxc0 Ucu0 .
       To incorporate this extension, we can write workers’ unemployment Bellman equation as:
                                                                    
                                                     X
                      ρUcu = b + τc + (1 − µ1 )ψc ·        e
                                                       ηjc Ujc − Ucu  + µ1 · (max
                                                                                0
                                                                                   Ucu0 − Ucu ), (D-21)
                                                                                 c
                                                      j


       where we have assumed that µ = 1 to simplify exposition.45 The outside options of workers are
       now changed and wage negotiation will take this into account. Importantly, the form of this
       change does not alter any of our results because maxc0 Ucu0 does not depend on workers’ initial
       location and, therefore, is captured in our empirical specifications by year-by-industry dummy
       variables. It should be noted that in this case, however, the parameters we estimate will have
       a slightly different interpretation because they will depend on µ1 (the ease of switching cities).
           In the second extension, we include housing prices and local amenities, as in the case of
       the Roback (1982) model. We continue to allow workers to search across cities and choose the
       city that maximizes expected utility, as above. When doing so, workers take into account local
       housing costs and amenities. To incorporate this extension, assume that workers care about
       wages, the price of housing in a city, phct , and about a local amenity, Ψc . In this case, a worker’s
       (indirect) flow utility when employed in industry i in city c could be expressed as, wic −ϑphct +Ψc .
       Accordingly, his or her flow utility when unemployed will be given by b + τc − ϑphct + Ψc . The
       first thing to notice about this extension is that housing prices do not directly impact wage
       negotiation because housing costs are incurred in both the employed and unemployed state.
       In order for expected utilities to equalize across cities, housing prices must adjust. To capture
       this, we summarize the functioning of the housing market by assuming that housing prices
  45
     This is without loss and has the implication that unemployed flows depend only on city rather than industry-
city.



                                                          31
       can be expressed as a positive function of the population of a city and of amenities, given by:

                                              phct = d0 + d1 · Lct + d2 · τc .

           It is straight forward to derive an expression for housing prices, phct , that depends on local
       expected wages (and hence, on Rct ), amenities, and employment rates or labor market tight-
       ness. Housing prices will adjust such that a city with a favorable composition of jobs (due
       to the Ωs and s) and higher amenities have benefits that are captured by local landowners.
       Wage differences across cities will not be equalized because in-migration will drive of local
       housing costs causing the movement of workers between cities to stop before wage equal-
       ization occurs. We conclude this section by noting that the forces emphasized in our model
       have testable implications for labor mobility and housing prices, but do not alter the main
       conclusions of our baseline model.
           Finally, since in equilibrium workers will equalize expected utility across locations the
       term maxc0 Ucu0 − Ucu in equation D-21 will equal zero. Therefore, the equilibrium equations
       derived in the model section of this paper are not affected by this extension of worker mobility.



        E     Selection Correction
       The approach we use to address the issue of selection on unobservables of workers across cities
       follows Dahl (2002). Dahl argues that, under a sufficiency assumption, the error mean term
       in the wage equation for individual i can be expressed as a flexible function of the probability
       that a person born in i’s state of birth actually chooses to live in city c in each Census year.46
       Dahl’s approach is a two-step procedure that first requires estimates of the probability that i
       made the observed choice and then adds functions of these estimates into the wage equation
       to proxy for the error mean term. Dahl also presents a flexible method of estimating the
       migration probabilities that groups individuals based on observable characteristics and uses
       mean migration flows as the probability estimates. We closely follow Dahl’s procedure aside
       from several small changes to account for the fact that we use cities rather than states and to
       account for the location of foreign born workers.
           Dahl’s approach first groups observations based on whether they are “stayers” or “movers”.
       Dahl defines stayers as individuals that reside in their state of birth in the Census year. Since
       we use cities instead of states, we define stayers as those individuals that reside in a city that
       is at least partially located in individual’s state of birth in a given Census year. Movers are
       defined as individuals that reside in a city that is not located in that individual’s state of
       birth in a given Census year. We also retain foreign born workers, whereas Dahl drops them.
       For these workers, we essentially treat them as “movers” and use their country of origin as
       their “state of birth”.47 Within the groups defined as stayers, movers, and immigrants, we
       additionally divide observations based on gender, education (4 groups), age (5 groups), black,
       and hispanic indicators. Movers are further divided by state of birth. For stayers, we further
  46
     This sufficiency assumption essentially says that knowing the probability of an individual’s observed or “first-
best” choice is all that is relevant for determining the selection effect, and that the probabilities of choices that were
not made do not matter in the determination of ones wage in the city where they actually locate.
  47
     We use the same country of origin groups as for the enclave instrument.


                                                            32
       divide the cells based on family characteristics.48 Immigrants are further divided into cells
       based on country of origin as described above.
           As in Dahl (2002), we estimate the relevant migration probabilities using the proportion of
       people within cells, defined above, who made the same move or stayed in their birth state. For
       each group, we calculate the probability that an individual made the observed choice and for
       movers, we follow Dahl in also calculating the retention probability (i.e. the probability that
       individual i was born in a given state, and remained in a city situated at least partly in that
       state in general). For movers, the estimated probabilities that individuals are observed in city
       c in year t differ based on individuals’ state of birth (and other observable characteristics).
       Thus, identification of the error mean term comes from the assumption that the state of birth
       does not affect the determination of individual wages, apart from through the selection term.
       For stayers, identification comes from differences in the probability of remaining in a city
       in ones birth state for individuals with different family circumstances. For immigrants, we
       assign the probability that an individual was observed in city c in a given Census year using
       the probabilities from immigrants with the same observable characteristics in the preceding
       Census year.49 This follows the type of ethnic enclave assumption used in several recent
       papers on immigration, essentially using variation based on the observation that immigrants
       from a particular region tend to migrate to cities where there are already communities of
       people with their background.
           Having estimated the observed choice or “first-best” choice of stayers, movers, and immi-
       grants and the retention probability for movers, we can then proceed to the second step in
       adjusting for selection bias. To do this, we add functions of these estimated probabilities into
       the first stage individual-level regressions used to calculate regression adjusted average city-
       industry wages. For movers, we add a quadratic of the probability that an observationally
       similar individual was born in a given state and was observed in a given city and a quadratic
       of the probability that an observationally similar individual stayed in their birth state. For
       stayers, we add a quadratic of the probability that an individual remained in their state of
       birth. For immigrants, we add a quadratic of the probability that an similar individual was
       observed in a given city in the preceding Census year. Dahl allows the coefficients on these
       functions to differ by state, whereas we assume that they are the same across all cities.
