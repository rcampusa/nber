It has been argued that existing DSGE models cannot properly account for the evolution of key
macroeconomic variables during and following the recent great recession. We challenge this argument
by showing that a standard DSGE model with financial frictions available prior to the recent crisis
successfully predicts a sharp contraction in economic activity along with a modest and protracted
decline in inflation, following the rise in financial stress in 2008Q4. The model does so even though
inflation remains very dependent on the evolution of economic activity and of monetary policy.

1     Introduction

As dramatic as the recent Great Recession has been, it constitutes a potential test for
existing macroeconomic models. Prominent researchers have argued that existing DSGE
models cannot properly account for the evolution of key macroeconomic variables during
and following the crisis. For instance, Hall (2011), in his Presidential Address, has called for
a fundamental reconsideration of models in which inflation depends on a measure of slack
in economic activity. He suggests that all theories based on the concept of non-accelerating
inflation rate of unemployment or NAIRU predict deflation as long as the unemployment
rate remains above a natural rate of, say, six percent. Since inflation has declined somewhat
in early 2009 and then remained contained for a few years, Hall (2011) argues that such
theories based on a concept of slack must be wrong. Most notably, he states that popular
DSGE models based on the simple New Keynesian Phillips curve according to which prices
are set on the basis of a markup over expected future marginal costs “cannot explain the
stabilization of inflation at positive rates in the presence of long-lasting slack” as they rely on
a NAIRU principle. Hall (2011) thus concludes that inflation behaves in a nearly exogenous
fashion.

    Similarly, Ball and Mazumder (2011) argue that Phillips curves estimated over the 1960-
2007 period in the US cannot explain the behavior of inflation in the 2008-2010 period.
Moreover, they conclude that the “Great Recession provides fresh evidence against the New
Keynesian Phillips curve with rational expectations.” They stress the fact that the fit of
that equation deteriorates once data for the years 2008-2010 are added to the sample. One
of the reasons for this is that the labor share, a proxy for firms marginal costs, declines
dramatically during the crisis, resulting in a change in the comovement with other measures
of slack, such as the unemployment rate. A further challenge to the New Keynesian Phillips
curve (henceforth, NKPC) is raised by King and Watson (2012) who find a large discrepancy
between the inflation predicted by a popular DSGE model, the Smets and Wouters (2007)
model, and actual inflation. They thus conclude that the model can successfully explain the
behavior of inflation only when assuming the existence of large exogenous markup shocks.
This is disturbing to the extent that such markup shocks are difficult to interpret and have
This Version: April 8, 2014                                                                            2


small effects on variables other than inflation.

       In this paper, we use such a standard DSGE model, which was available prior to the recent
crisis and that is estimated with data up to 2008, to explain the behavior of output growth,
inflation, and marginal costs since the crisis. The model used is the Smets and Wouters
(2007) model, based on Christiano et al. (2005), extended to include financial frictions as
in Bernanke et al. (1999), Christiano et al. (2003), and Christiano et al. (2014b). We show
that as soon as the financial stress jumps in the Fall of 2008, the model successfully predicts
a sharp contraction in economic activity along with a modest and more protracted decline
in inflation. Price changes are projected to remain in the neighborhood of one percent. This
result contrasts with the commonly held belief that such models are bound to fail to capture
the broad contours of the Great Recession and the near stability of inflation.

       According to the NKPC, inflation is determined by the discounted sum of future expected
marginal costs (fundamental inflation). The key to understanding our result is that inflation
is more dependent on expected future marginal costs than on the current level of economic
activity. Even though GDP and marginal costs contracted by the end of 2008, we will show
that monetary policy has in fact been sufficiently stimulative to ensure that marginal costs
are expected to eventually rise.1 While – with hindsight – the DSGE model understates the
observed drop in marginal costs, conditioning on the realized drop in marginal costs only
leads to a modest downward revision of the inflation forecast, and not to a prediction of an
extended period of deflation. This result stands in sharp contrast to an analysis based on
backward-looking Phillips curve models, which indeed predict a strong deflation conditional
on the observed slack in the economy.

       Because the relationship between inflation and future marginal cost is the defining char-
acteristic of the NKPC, we carefully document that, unlike in King and Watson (2012), the
DSGE model with financial frictions generates a measure of fundamental inflation that has
been accurately tracking the low- and medium-frequency movements of inflation since 1964,
lending credibility to the NKPC relationship. A key reason for the difference is that our
   1
       Instead of solving the NKPC forward, Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2013) replace the inflation-
expectations term in the NKPC by household survey expectations, which rose sharply after 2009 and thereby
capture most of the “missing” deflation.
This Version: April 8, 2014                                                                                    3


estimated model involves a higher degree of price rigidities than is the case in Smets and
Wouters (2007). This results in endogenous and more persistent marginal costs which in
turn allow our model to successfully explain inflation with much smaller markup shocks.
Yet, while the slope of the short-run Phillips curve is lower in our model than in Smets and
Wouters (2007), monetary policy still has important effects on inflation.

       From an ex-post perspective, we decompose the forecast errors made by our DSGE mod-
els into errors due to markup shocks and non-markup shocks. While the non-markup shocks
explain the observed drop in marginal costs, they contribute to a reduction in the inflation
forecast by only about 0.8 percentage point, substantiating our argument that the absence
of deflation after 2008 is perfectly consistent with a DSGE model that is built around an
NKPC.2 These results challenge the claims set forth by Hall (2011), Ball and Mazumder
(2011), and King and Watson (2012). Markup shocks do not appear to constitute an impor-
tant source of fluctuations of inflation over the medium term. They capture high frequency
movements in inflation such as those attributable to temporary energy price changes.

       The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the DSGE model
used for the empirical analysis, defines the concept of fundamental inflation, and discusses
how we solve the model post 2008 to account for the zero lower bound on interest rates and
the forward guidance. Forecasts of output growth, inflation, marginal costs, and interest
rates for the period from 2009 to 2012 are presented in Section 3. In Section 4 we examine
various aspects of the relationship between inflation and marginal cost forecasts: the sensi-
tivity of marginal cost forecasts to price rigidity and the central bank’s reaction to inflation
fluctuations; we show that the DSGE model-implied fundamental inflation is able to track
   2
       Christiano et al. (2011) use the model in Altig et al. (2011), which is similar to the one used here but
without financial financial fictions, to generate simulations of the Great Recession taking the zero lower
bound on interest rates into account. They also find that inflation declines only modestly in their model, in
part because, as is the case here, their estimated Phillips curve is relatively flat. In their model the flatness
of the Phillips curve partly results from the assumption of firm-specific capital. In Christiano et al. (2014a),
instead, inflation does not decline much because total factor productivity drops substantially during the
Great Recession and its aftermath. In contrast, we find that there is considerable slack after 2008, with
actual output being well below the corresponding level that would be obtained if prices and wages were
flexible.

actual inflation; and we assess the DSGE model’s marginal cost forecasts over time. Sec-
tion 5 examines the ex-post forecast errors, demonstrating that non-markup shocks explain
the drop of marginal costs but do not lead to a substantial downward revision of the inflation
forecast. Finally, section 6 concludes. Information on the construction of the data set used
for the empirical analysis as well as detailed estimation results and supplementary tables
and figures are available in the Online Appendix.



2     The DSGE Model

The model considered in this paper is an extension of the model developed in Smets and
Wouters (2007) (SW model), which is in turn based on earlier work by Christiano et al.
(2005). The SW model is a medium-scale DSGE model, which augments the standard
neoclassical stochastic growth model with nominal price and wage rigidities as well as habit
formation in consumption and investment adjustment costs. We extend the SW model
by allowing for a time-varying target inflation rate and incorporating financial frictions as
in Bernanke et al. (1999), Christiano et al. (2003), and Christiano et al. (2014b). The
ingredients of our DSGE model were publicly available prior to 2008. As such, the model does
not include some of the mechanisms that have been developed more recently in response to
the financial crisis. The specification of the model is presented in Section 2.1. An important
concept for our empirical analysis is the so-called fundamental inflation, which is defined
in Section 2.2. The data set as well as the prior distribution used for the estimation is
discussed in Section 2.3. Finally, Section 2.4 discusses how the DSGE model is solved to
generate forecasts as of 2008Q4 and how it is solved to examine the 2009-2012 data in view
of the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates and the forward guidance policy pursued
by the Federal Reserve.



2.1    DSGE Model Specification

Since the derivation of the SW model is discussed in detail in Christiano et al. (2005) we
only present a summary of the log-linearized equilibrium conditions. We first reproduce the

equilibrium conditions for the SW model and then discuss the two extensions that underly
the DSGE model used for our empirical analysis. We refer to our model as SWFF, where
FF highlights the presence of financial frictions.


2.1.1   The SW Model

Let z̃t be the linearly detrended log productivity process which follows the autoregressive
law of motion
                                             z̃t = ρz z̃t−1 + σz εz,t .                                    (1)

Following Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013) we detrend all non stationary variables by
             1
Zt = eγt+ 1−α z̃t , where γ is the steady state growth rate of the economy. The growth rate of
Zt in deviations from γ, denoted by zt , follows the process:

                                                     1                   1
                      zt = ln(Zt /Zt−1 ) − γ =          (ρz − 1)z̃t−1 +     σz ǫz,t .                      (2)
                                                    1−α                 1−α

   All variables in the following equations are expressed in log deviations from their non-
stochastic steady state. Steady state values are denoted by ∗-subscripts and steady state
formulas are provided in the technical appendix of Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013), which
is available online. The consumption Euler equation is given by:

            (1 − he−γ )                                      he−γ
  ct = −                  (R t  − I
                                  E t [π t+1 ] +  b t ) +             (ct−1 − zt )
           σc (1 + he−γ )                                 (1 + he−γ )
                                    1                                  (σc − 1) w∗ l∗
                           +            −γ
                                             IE t [ct+1 + zt+1 ] +                    (lt − IE t [lt+1 ]) , (3)
                               (1 + he )                           σc (1 + he−γ ) c∗

where ct is consumption, lt is labor supply, Rt is the nominal interest rate, and πt is inflation.
The exogenous process bt drives a wedge between the intertemporal ratio of the marginal
utility of consumption and the riskless real return Rt −IE t [πt+1 ], and follows an AR(1) process
with parameters ρb and σb . The parameters σc and h capture the degree of relative risk
aversion and the degree of habit persistence in the utility function, respectively. The following
condition expresses the relationship between the value of capital in terms of consumption qtk
and the level of investment it measured in terms of consumption goods:
                                             1                     β̄                           
             qtk = S ′′ e2γ (1 + β̄) it −          (it−1 − zt ) −        IE t [it+1 + zt+1 ] − µt ,        (4)
                                            1 + β̄                1 + β̄
This Version: April 8, 2014                                                                        6


which is affected by both investment adjustment cost (S ′′ is the second derivative of the
adjustment cost function) and by µt , an exogenous process called the “marginal efficiency
of investment” that affects the rate of transformation between consumption and installed
capital (see Greenwood et al. (1998)). The exogenous process µt follows an AR(1) process
with parameters ρµ and σµ . The parameter β̄ = βe(1−σc )γ depends on the intertemporal
discount rate in the utility function of the households β, the degree of relative risk aversion
σc , and the steady-state growth rate γ.

   The capital stock, k̄t , evolves as
                                   
                                i∗ !             i∗   i∗ ′′
                  k̄t = 1 −           k̄t−1 − zt + it + S e2γ (1 + β̄)µt ,                        (5)
                                k̄∗               k̄∗  k̄∗

where i∗ /k̄∗ is the steady state ratio of investment to capital. The arbitrage condition
between the return to capital and the riskless rate is:

                r∗k            k        1−δ              k
                        IE t [rt+1 ]+ k           IE t [qt+1 ] − qtk = Rt + bt − IE t [πt+1 ],    (6)
           r∗ + (1 − δ)
            k                        r∗ + (1 − δ)

where rtk is the rental rate of capital, r∗k its steady state value, and δ the depreciation rate.
Given that capital is subject to variable capacity utilization ut , the relationship between k̄t
and the amount of capital effectively rented out to firms kt is

                                        kt = ut − zt + k̄t−1 .                                    (7)

The optimality condition determining the rate of utilization is given by

                                            1−ψ k
                                               r = ut ,                                           (8)
                                             ψ t

where ψ captures the utilization costs in terms of foregone consumption. Real marginal costs
for firms are given by
                                      mct = wt + αlt − αkt ,                                      (9)

where wt is the real wage and α is the income share of capital (after paying markups and
fixed costs) in the production function. From the optimality conditions of goods producers
it follows that all firms have the same capital-labor ratio:

                                         kt = wt − rtk + lt .                                    (10)

   The production function is:
                                                                                1
                   yt = Φp (αkt + (1 − α)lt ) + I{ρz < 1}(Φp − 1)                  z̃t ,       (11)
                                                                               1−α
                                                                          1
if the log productivity is trend stationary. The last term (Φp − 1)          z̃t drops out if

technology has a stochastic trend, because in this case one has to assume that the fixed costs
are proportional to the trend. Similarly, the resource constraint is:

                          1

respectively. Finally, the monetary authority follows a generalized feedback rule:

where the flexible price/wage output ytf is obtained from solving the version of the model
without nominal rigidities (that is, Equations (3) through (12) and (15)), and the residual
rtm follows an AR(1) process with parameters ρrm and σrm .


2.1.2   Time-Varying Target Inflation and Long-Run Inflation Expectations

In order to capture the rise and fall of inflation and interest rates in the estimation sample,
we replace the constant target inflation rate by a time-varying target inflation. While time-
varying target rates have been frequently used for the specification of monetary policy rules
in DSGE model (e.g., Erceg and Levin (2003) and Smets and Wouters (2003), among others),
we follow the approach of Aruoba and Schorfheide (2008) and Del Negro and Eusepi (2011)
and include data on long-run inflation expectations as an observable into the estimation of the
DSGE model. At each point in time, the long-run inflation expectations essentially determine
the level of the target inflation rate. To the extent that long-run inflation expectations at
the forecast origin contain information about the central bank’s objective function, e.g. the
desire to stabilize inflation at 2%, this information is automatically included in the forecast.

   More specifically, for the SW model the interest-rate feedback rule of the central bank (16)
is modified as follows:
                                                                                            
                   Rt = ρR Rt−1 + (1 − ρR ) ψ1 (πt −             πt∗ )
                                                          + ψ2 (yt −                 ytf )                           (17)
                                                       
                        +ψ3 (yt − ytf ) − (yt−1 − yt−1
                                                   f
                                                       ) + rtm .

The time-varying inflation target evolves according to:

                                                ∗
                                     πt∗ = ρπ∗ πt−1 + σπ∗ ǫπ∗ ,t ,                                                   (18)
This Version: April 8, 2014                                                                     9


where 0 < ρπ∗ < 1 and ǫπ∗ ,t is an iid shock. We model πt∗ as a stationary process, although
our prior for ρπ∗ forces this process to be highly persistent. The assumption that the changes
in the target inflation rate are exogenous is, to some extent, a short-cut. For instance, the
learning models of Sargent (1999) or Primiceri (2006) imply that the rise in the target
inflation rate in the 1970’s and the subsequent drop is due to policy makers learning about
the output-inflation trade-off and trying to set inflation optimally. We are abstracting from
such a mechanism in our specification.


2.1.3   Financial Frictions

Building on the work of Bernanke et al. (1999), Christiano et al. (2003), De Graeve (2008),
and Christiano et al. (2014b) we also add financial frictions to our DSGE model. We assume
that banks collect deposits from households and lend to entrepreneurs who use these funds
as well as their own wealth to acquire physical capital, which is rented to intermediate goods
producers. Entrepreneurs are subject to idiosyncratic disturbances that affect their ability
to manage capital. Their revenue may thus be too low to pay back the bank loans. Banks
protect themselves against default risk by pooling all loans and charging a spread over the
deposit rate. This spread may vary as a function of the entrepreneurs’ leverage and their
riskiness. Adding these frictions to the SW model amounts to replacing equation (6) with
the following conditions:
                             h                i
                                   k

                        Et       R̃t+1                                                       (19)

and
                                        r∗k             (1 − δ)
                      R̃tk   − πt = k           rtk + k           qtk − qt−1
                                                                         k
                                                                             ,               (20)
                                   r∗ + (1 − δ)      r∗ + (1 − δ)
where R̃tk is the gross nominal return on capital for entrepreneurs, nt is entrepreneurial equity,
and σ̃ω,t captures mean-preserving changes in the cross-sectional dispersion of ability across
entrepreneurs (see Christiano et al. (2014b)) and follows an AR(1) process with parameters
ρσω and σσω . The second condition defines the return on capital, while the first one determines
the spread between the expected return on capital and the riskless rate. Note that if ζsp,b = 0

and the financial friction shocks σ̃ω,t are zero, (19) and (20) coincide with (6). The following

2.2     Fundamental Inflation

To understand the behavior of inflation, it will be useful to extract from the model-implied
inflation series an estimate of “fundamental inflation” as in King and Watson (2012), and
similarly to Galı́ and Gertler (1999) and Sbordone (2005). To obtain this measure, we define
∆ιp πt = πt − ιp πt−1 , and rewrite the expression for the Phillips curve (13) as follows:

                      ∆ιp πt = β̄IE t [∆ιp πt+1 ] + (1 + ιp β̄) (κ mct + λf,t ) .                              (22)

This difference equation can be solved forward to obtain
                                      ∞
                                      X                                          ∞
                                                                                 X
                                             j
              ∆ιp πt = (1 + ιp β̄)κ         β̄ IE t [mct+j ] + (1 + ιp β̄)              β̄ j IE t [λf,t+j ].   (23)
                                      j=0                                         j=0

The first component captures the effect of the sum of discounted future marginal costs on
current inflation, whereas the second term captures the contribution of future markup shocks.
Defining
                                                 ∞
                                                 X
                                      St∞    =         β̄ j IE t [mct+j ],                                     (24)
                                                 j=0

we can decompose inflation into
                                              πt = π̃t + Λf,t ,                                                (25)

where
                                π̃t = κ(1 + ιp β̄)(1 − ιp L)−1 St∞ ,                                           (26)
                                                                  ∞
                                                                  X
                                                             −1
                         Λf,t = (1 + ιp β̄)(1 − ιp L)                   β̄ j IE t [λf,t+j ],                   (27)
                                                                  j=0

and L denotes the lag operator. We refer to the first term on the right-hand-side of (25),
π̃t , as fundamental inflation. Fundamental inflation corresponds to the discounted sum of
expected marginal costs (our measure differs slightly from that of Galı́ and Gertler (1999)
This Version: April 8, 2014                                                                 11


and Sbordone (2005), who define fundamental inflation as π̃t = ιp πt + κ(1 + ιp β̄)St∞ ). Thus,
our decomposition removes the direct effect of markup shocks from the observed inflation.
Note, however, that the summands in (25) are not orthogonal. Fundamental inflation still
depends on λf,t indirectly, through the effect of the markup shock on current and future
expected marginal costs.



2.3    Data and Priors

The estimation of the DSGE model is based on data on real output growth, consumption
growth, investment growth, real wage growth, hours worked, inflation (as measured by the
GDP deflator), interest rates, 10-year inflation expectations, and spreads. Measurement
equations related the model variables that appeared in Section 2.1 to the observables:

                    Output growth          = γ + 100 (yt − yt−1 + zt )
                    Consumption growth = γ + 100 (ct − ct−1 + zt )
                    Investment growth      = γ + 100 (it − it−1 + zt )
                    Real Wage growth       = γ + 100 (wt − wt−1 + zt )

                    Spread                 = SP∗ + 100Et R̃t+1     − Rt

All variables are measured in percent. π∗ and R∗ measure the steady state level of net
inflation and short-term nominal interest rates, respectively, and ¯l captures the mean of
hours (this variable is measured as an index). The first seven series are commonly used in
the estimation of the SW model. The 10-year inflation expectations contain information
about low-frequency inflation movements and are obtained from the Blue Chip Economic
Indicators survey and the Survey of Professional Forecasters. As spread variable we use a Baa
Corporate Bond Yield spread over the 10-Year Treasury Note Yield at constant maturity.
Details on the construction of the data set are provided in Appendix A.

   We use Bayesian techniques in the subsequent empirical analysis, which require the spec-
ification of a prior distribution for the model parameters. For most of the parameters we
use the same marginal prior distributions as Smets and Wouters (2007). There are two im-
portant exceptions. First, the original prior for the quarterly steady state inflation rate π∗
used by Smets and Wouters (2007) is tightly centered around 0.62% (which is about 2.5%
annualized) with a standard deviation of 0.1%. We favor a looser prior, one that has less
influence on the model’s forecasting performance, that is centered at 0.75% and has a stan-
dard deviation of 0.4%. Second, for the financial frictions mechanism we specify priors for
the parameters SP∗ , ζsp,b , ρσω , and σσω . We fix the parameters corresponding to the steady
state default probability and the survival rate of entrepreneurs, respectively. In turn, these
parameters imply values for the parameters of (21). A summary of the priors is provided in
Table A-1 in Appendix B.



2.4    Forecasting and Ex-Post Analysis

Our empirical analysis essentially consists of two parts. In the first part, we are using
the DSGE model to generate forecasts based on information that was available in 2008Q4,
which is the quarter with the largest output growth drop during the Great Recession episode.
These forecasts are generated from a version of the model that ignores the presence of the
zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates, which is partly justified on the ground
that the posterior mean prediction of the short term interest rate does not violate the ZLB.
The second part of the empirical analysis takes an ex-post perspective and examines the
shocks that have contributed to the errors associated with the 2008Q4 forecasts. Ex post it
turned out that the conduct of monetary policy changed after 2008. Policy was constrained
by the ZLB and, in order to alleviate this constraint, the central bank made announcements
that it would deliberately keep interest rate at zero for an extended period of time (forward
guidance). In order to conduct the ex-post analysis we use a solution method that accounts
for the ZLB and forward guidance. Based on this solution we study the contributions of

analysis as well as the solution method that is used for the ex-post analysis. All of our
analysis is based on modal forecasts. This is partly because a full-fledged characterization of
the forecast distribution has already been conducted in Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013),
and partly because explicitly considering parameter uncertainty would not change the main
message of the paper.


2.4.1   Generating Forecasts of the Great Recession

In order to generate forecasts using the information set of a DSGE-model forecaster in 2008Q4
we use the method in Sims (2002) to solve the log-linear approximation of the DSGE model.
We collect all the DSGE model parameters in the vector θ, stack the structural shocks in
the vector ǫt , and derive a state-space representation for our vector of observables yt . The
state-space representation is comprised of a transition equation:

                                   st = T (θ)st−1 + R(θ)ǫt ,                              (29)

which summarizes the evolution of the states st , and a measurement equation:

                                     yt = Z(θ)st + D(θ),                                  (30)

which maps the states onto the vector of observables yt . This measurement equation ex-
presses (28) in a more compact notation.

   We use data from 1964Q1 to 2008Q3 to obtain posterior mode estimates of the DSGE
model parameters θ. These estimates are reported in Table A-2 in Appendix B. We refer
to the estimation sample as Y1:T = {y1 , . . . , yT } and let θ̂ be the mode of the posterior
distribution p(θ|Y1:T ). Our DSGE forecasts are made using information available to the
econometrician in December 2008. Note that at this point the econometrician does not yet
have access to NIPA data for 2008Q4. However, the forecaster already has information on
the fourth quarter federal funds rate and the spread. We let y1,t be the federal funds rate
and the spread in period t and compute multi-step posterior mean forecasts based on the

brevity, we will often refer to the information set
                                                 !                   
                                          Y1:T+ = Y1:T , y1,T +1 , θ̂ .


2.4.2        Ex-Post Accounting for the ZLB and Forward Guidance

Starting in 2009Q1 nominal interest rates in the US hit the ZLB. Moreover, the central bank
engaged in forward guidance regarding the time horizon of the lift-off from the ZLB. Given
the size of our DSGE model, the use of a fully nonlinear solution method as in Judd et al.
(2010), Fernández-Villaverde et al. (2012), Gust et al. (2012), Aruoba and Schorfheide (2013)
is beyond the scope of this paper. Instead, we use an approximation method proposed by
Cagliarini and Kulish (2013) and Chen et al. (2012) to capture the effect of the ZLB and
forward guidance for post-2008Q4 data (t = T + 1 : Tf ull ).

       Suppose in period t the policy rate is expected to be at the ZLB for H̄ periods, that is,

                                     Rτ = −R∗ , for τ = t, .., t + H̄,                                  (31)

and is determined by the feedback rule (17) afterwards (for τ > t + H̄). We can write
the DSGE model’s equilibrium conditions as (omitting the dependence on θ to simplify the
notation)
                            Γ2,τ Eτ [sτ +1 ] + Γ0,τ sτ = Γc,τ + Γ1,τ sτ −1 + Ψτ ετ ,                    (32)

where sτ includes all endogenous and exogenous variables and where the matrices Γ2,τ , Γ0,τ ,
Γc,τ , Γ1,τ , and Ψτ differ depending on whether τ ≤ t + H̄ or not (in fact, only the row
corresponding to the policy rule differs across τ s in this application). For τ > t + H̄ the
solution of (32) is given by the transition equation (29). For τ = t, ..., t + H̄ the solution
takes the time varying form:

                                   sτ = Cτ(t,H̄) + Tτ(t,H̄) sτ −1 + R(t,
                                                                     τ
                                                                        H̄)
                                                                            ετ .                        (33)
   3
       We are taking two short-cuts. First, we do not re-estimate the model with the additional information
contained in y1,T +1 . Given the size of our sample Y1:T , the two additional observations have no noticeable
effect on the posterior. Second, we condition on the posterior mode rather than integrating with respect to
the posterior distribution of θ. Since we mostly focus on point estimates in this paper the conditioning has
only small effects on the results but speeds up the computations considerably.

We used the superscript (t, H̄) to indicate that the solution was obtained under the assump-
tion that the announcement of zero interest rates for a duration of H̄ periods was made in
period t. The matrices Cτ(t,H̄) , Tτ(t,H̄) , and Rτ(t,H̄) can be computed using the recursion

         Cτ(t,H̄) = Γ2,τ Tτ +1 + Γ0,τ              Γc,τ − Γ2,τ Cτ +1 ,                        (34)

         Tτ(t,H̄) = Γ2,τ Tτ +1 + Γ0,τ            Γ1,τ , Rτ(t,H̄) = Γ2,τ Tτ +1 + Γ0,τ     Ψτ ,
                (t,H̄)        (t,H̄)
starting from Tt+H̄+1 = T , Ct+H̄+1 = 0.

    We use overnight index swap (OIS) rates available from the Board of Governors to mea-
sure the duration that the federal funds rate is expected to remain at the ZLB, denoted
by H̄t . In order to construct a time-varying coefficient state-space model for the post-2008

period, in each period t > T we use the matrices Ct t , Tt t , Rt t . We assume that
the agents are myopic in the sense that they do not attempt to forecast changes in the
length of the central bank’s zero-interest rate policy. This assumption is comparable to the
anticipated utility approach in the learning literature, e.g., Sargent et al. (2006). Thus, the
transition equation (29) is replaced by
                                       (t,H̄t )      (t,H̄t )           (t,H̄t )

When applying the Kalman filter and smoother to extract the ex-post states and shocks we
assume that the time t system matrices are known at the end of period t − 1.



3     Forecasts During the Great Recession

We begin the empirical analysis by examining forecasts of inflation, output growth, and
marginal costs during the 2007-2009 recession. We show that the New Keynesian DSGE
model introduced in Section 2 predicts a deep recession and a subsequent weak recovery,
just as observed in the data, and yet it does not predict deflation.

Figure 1. Similar forecasts as well as a detailed description on how to compute them were
reported in Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013).4 When made aware – via the spread data – of
the financial consequences of the Lehman default, the DSGE model with financial frictions
predicts a sharp drop in GDP growth and a very sluggish recovery.5 Indeed, the model’s
forecast for the log level of output in 2012Q3 (shown in the Appendix) is remarkably close to
the actual value. This implies that based on the Y1:T+ information available right after the
Lehman collapse, the DSGE model predicts output to remain well below trend four years
after the financial crisis.

       The center panel of Figure 1 depicts the DSGE model-implied output gap, that is the gap
between actual output and counterfactual output in an economy without nominal rigidities,

       The forecasts in Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013) were based on real-time data, whereas the forecasts
in this paper are based on the 2012Q3 vintage of data. Although revised and unrevised data are somewhat
different as of 2008Q3, the forecasts turn out to be very similar.
    5
      This is consistent with the findings of Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2012) who use a reduced form approach
(and a different measure of spreads).

markup shocks, and financial frictions. The figure illustrates that the low level of output
after 2008Q4 is not an efficient outcome for the economy. Because the counterfactual output
is unobserved, actual values of the output gap have to be replaced by smoothed values.
The solid black line is based on Y1:T+ information and corresponds to E[gapt |Y1:T+ ]. The
solid red line depicts forecasts conditional on Y1:T+ information and the dashed black line
marks ex-post smoothed values E[gapt |Y1:Tf ull , θ̂]. In order to obtain the ex-post smoothed
values we use the time-varying coefficient state-space representation described in Section 2.4,
accounting for the ZLB and the forward guidance after 2008. In 2008Q4 the model forecasts
large and persistent gaps, up to -7%, which are only slightly smaller by the end of the
sample (about -6%). The ex-post output gap is somewhat larger in absolute terms than the
forecasted one: it falls below -10% by the end of 2009, and recovers only gradually.

   The right panel of Figure 1 shows the inflation forecasts (quarter-on-quarter percentages).
The DSGE model prediction misses the deflation in 2009Q1 partly caused by the collapse
in commodity prices and the subsequent reversal in inflation in 2010 and at beginning of
2011, which coincides with the Arab Spring and the associated surge in commodity prices.
But aside from these high frequency movements, the model arguably produces reasonable
inflation forecasts. In terms of the cumulative price change between 2008Q4 and 2012Q3 the
model underpredicts the price level at the end of the sample by about 2%.

   To summarize, using information available at the end of 2008 the DSGE model predicts
a drop in output growth of roughly the same magnitude as the actual one as well as the
subsequent sluggish recovery, and large and persistent output gaps. However, unlike Hall
(2011)’s and Ball and Mazumder (2011)’s conjecture, the model-implied Phillips curve does
not generate negative inflation forecasts.



3.2    Forecasts of Marginal Costs

According to the NKPC, inflation is determined by expectations of future marginal costs.
We therefore inspect the marginal costs forecasts for the Great Recession period. In the
absence of fixed costs in the DSGE model, marginal costs mct are proportional to the labor
share. Moreover, changes in the labor share are spanned by the set of observables used

in the estimation because our data set includes the growth rates of output and real wages
as well as the level of hours worked. The presence of fixed costs in our model breaks the
direct proportionality between marginal costs and the labor share and we have to treat
marginal costs as a latent variable. The left panel of Figure 2 shows three objects: the
smoothed marginal costs E[mct |Y1:T+ ] using data up to the forecast origin (black solid line),
forecasts conditional on Y1:T+ information (solid red line), and ex-post smoothed values
E[ mct |Y1:Tf ull , θ̂] (dashed black line).

    The left panel of Figure 2 makes clear that the DSGE model grossly over-predicts
marginal costs. At first sight, Figure 2 presents damning evidence against this New Keyne-
sian model: Even if the model captured the decline in output growth, it did not forecast the
decline in marginal costs. One might think that if it had, the forecasts of inflation would
have been substantially lower. This is essentially the point made by Ball and Mazumder
(2011). The right panel of Figure 2 reproduces the model’s baseline forecast of inflation
(solid red line) from Figure 1 and depicts an alternative inflation forecast that is obtained by

conditioning on the ex-post path of marginal costs (dashed red line).6 This conditioning en-
sures that the agents’ marginal cost expectations in the model match actual marginal costs
over the period 2008Q4 to 2012Q3. The resulting forecast for inflation is of course lower
than the baseline forecast, but not dramatically so. The key to understanding this, is that
inflation still depends on expected future marginal costs, and that price setters know that
marginal costs will eventually return to their steady state after the large decline between
2009 and 2012. Indeed, in this general equilibrium model, monetary policy provides enough
accommodation for marginal costs to return to their steady state, so that inflation returns
to the central bank’s target.

       For comparison, we also show inflation forecasts from a backward-looking Phillips curve
obtained by feeding in actual realizations of unemployment (dashed blue line).7 The backward-
looking Phillips curve does forecast deflation (about -2% annualized), which may not be sur-
prising given the amount of slack suggested by the level of unemployment. Marginal costs
are also well below steady state, yet the NKPC’s forecasts are not nearly as much at odds
with ex-post outcomes as those from the backward looking Phillips curve. Ironically, it is
precisely the forward-looking nature of the NKPC that keeps its forecasts afloat, as we will
discuss in the next sections.



3.3        Why Doesn’t Inflation Collapse?

In the remainder of this paper we examine the question why the DSGE model does not
forecast deflation. Here, we briefly sketch the argument and provide the reader with a road
   6
       The ex-post marginal costs are obtained using a Kalman smoother based on the time-varying state-
space model described in Section 2.4.2. The conditional forecasts are generated based on the fixed-coefficient
state-space model described in Section 2.4.1 using a generalized version of Algorithm 3 in Del Negro and
Schorfheide (2013).
   7
     Our version of the backward-looking Phillips curve is taken from Stock and Watson (2008) (equation
(9), with four lags for both inflation and unemployment and no other regressor), estimated with quarterly
data on the GDP deflator and unemployment up to 2008Q3. We also tried a version of the Phillips curve
in differences (Equation (10) in Stock and Watson (2008), again with four lags), and obtained very similar
results.

map. The answer lies in the forward-looking nature of the NKPC: Actual inflation is largely
determined by fundamental inflation which depends on the expected present discounted value
of future marginal costs (see Section 2.2). Thus, even if current marginal costs are low and
the current output gap is well below steady state (as in Figures 1 and 2), as long as the
marginal costs are expected to revert back to steady state in the future, the present value of
marginal costs, and therefore inflation, may not fall dramatically.

   This raises the question of what determines the expected reversion of marginal costs.
First, exogenous shocks in the model are mean reverting, though many of the shocks have
autocorrelations that are close to one and generate long-lasting effects on the economy.
Second, monetary policy controls the persistence of marginal costs through the interest
rate feedback rule. If inflation is below steady state or output below potential, the policy
rule promises to lower the real rate for an extended period of time (due to interest rate
smoothing). This promise stimulates consumption and investment demand by reducing the
discounted sum of expected future real rates, and in turn raises marginal costs. Because
inflation is determined by the sum of expected discounted value of future marginal costs, a
fall of inflation is prevented.

   The ZLB imposes a constraint on this mechanism because it limits the central bank’s
ability to lower interest rates. However, Figure 3 indicates that from an ex-ante perspective
this constraint was not important. Indeed, as of the end of 2008, the model’s forecasts of
the federal funds rate (FFR) (red solid line) do not fall below zero. The predicted interest
rate path is not just a feature of our DSGE model. It is very much in line with the January
10, 2009 Blue Chip FFR forecasts – the blue diamonds in Figure 3 – at least for the first
six quarters (the horizon for which Blue Chip forecasts are available). Ex-post it turned
out that interest rates stayed at the ZLB, as revealed by the dashed line, and the Taylor
rule mechanism of reducing current interest rate in responses to below-target inflation and
output was substituted by a policy of forward guidance (captured in the solution method
described in Section 2.4.2) and quantitative easing (not directly modeled here).

   Quantitatively, the arguments we just made rely on the fairly high price rigidities esti-
mated for the model with financial frictions (a Calvo price-rigidity parameter of 0.87). This

estimated degree of price rigidities is higher than the one estimated in the same model with-
out financial frictions (that is, the SW model), and we will discuss in Section 4.4 how the
introduction of credit spreads as an observable affects these estimates.8 One contribution
of this paper is to show that the higher degree of price rigidities is key not only because it
yields a flatter Phillips curve, but also because it implies that the behavior of marginal costs
in this model is largely endogenous. That is, marginal costs are for the most part explained
by shocks other than markup shocks. This endogeneity is important as it makes it possible
for policy to play a role in the determination of inflation.
   8
       Our estimate of price rigidities implies that prices are re-optimized on average every 1/(1 − 0.87) = 7.7
quarters in the SWFF model. This may appear large when compared to microeconomic evidence about the
frequency of price changes reported, e.g., in Bils and Klenow (2004) or Nakamura and Steinsson (2008).
However, recall that prices change in every quarter in this model, as prices that are not re-optimized are
indexed to past inflation. Furthermore, as argued by Boivin et al. (2009), while individual or sectoral prices
may vary frequently in response to sector-specific disturbances, they appear much more sluggish in response
to aggregate shocks, which are arguably more relevant for our purposes. Finally, as shown in Woodford
(2003) and Altig et al. (2011), a relatively flat slope of the NKPC can alternatively be obtained without
large price rigidities by assuming that firms use firm-specific capital, or by assuming a larger curvature
parameter in the Kimball aggregator for prices, ǫp .

4     Marginal Cost Forecasts and Inflation

The NKPC implies that expectations about future marginal costs are a key determinant
of inflation. We closely examine this relationship. In Section 4.1 we show that when price
rigidities are relatively high, as they are in the estimated SWFF model, marginal costs have
three important features: they are persistent, they are largely endogenous, meaning that they
fluctuate in response to shocks other than markup shocks, and their dynamics are strongly
influenced by the degree to which the central bank is committed to stabilize inflation. This
supports our argument that inflation did not fall dramatically during the Great Recession
because monetary policy managed to maintain expectations about future marginal costs and
hence inflation expectations anchored. In Section 4.2 we extend our analysis of the NKPC
relationship to the rest of the sample, prior to 2009. We document that the present value of
marginal costs has historically been able to track low- and medium-frequency movements in
inflation very well. In Section 4.3 we examine the historical accuracy of the SWFF-model-
based marginal cost forecasts. Finally, we explain in Section 4.4 why our DSGE model with
financial frictions delivers relatively high estimates of price stickiness.



4.1    Price Rigidities and Marginal Cost Dynamics

In this section we illustrate the dependence of marginal costs dynamics on the degree of
price stickiness as well as the conduct of monetary policy. First, we compare marginal cost
forecasts based on our posterior mode estimate of ζ̂p = 0.87 to forecasts obtained based
on Smets and Wouters (2007)’s estimate of ζ̂pSW = 0.65. Second, we illustrate the effect of
lowering the central bank’s response to inflation from the estimated value of ψ̂1 = 1.37 to
the counterfactual value of 1.1. The results are summarized in Figure 4.

    The left panel of Figure 4 illustrates the effect of changing the degree of nominal rigidity.
The solid black line corresponds to smoothed estimates of marginal costs in deviations from
steady state E[mct |Y1:Tf ull , θ̂] for the post-2005 period. The red lines departing at two points
in time from the black line are the projected path of future marginal costs. Formally, we are

Thus, the marginal cost forecasts are conditional on the smoothed value of the state st . The
solid red lines are forecasts using our estimated value of ζ̂p = 0.87 whereas the dashed lines
are based on the SW value ζ̂pSW = 0.65.

       Figure 4 shows that marginal costs revert quickly to their state value if prices are relatively
flexible. To understand this result, suppose that the prices are essentially fully flexible.
In this case, firms would set their prices at a markup over the nominal marginal costs.
As a consequence, real marginal costs would only move in response to exogenous markup
shocks and would have no endogenous persistence.9 Similarly, in Figure 4 when prices

       This can be seen by taking the limit as prices become fully flexible in the linearized NKPC (13). Noting
that λf,t is a renormalized version of the markup shock (i.e., λf,t = κλ̃f,t , following SW), this equation

are relatively flexible real marginal costs revert quickly to steady state (to the extent that
exogenous markup shocks are not very persistent) so that the present discounted value of
future marginal costs

defined in (24) essentially coincides with current real marginal costs mct (see figure A-3 in
Appendix C). This is essentially what happens for the red dashed lines. In contrast, if prices
are rigid, a persistent decline in the demand for goods is met by firms with a decline in
the supply of goods, which results in a persistent fall in marginal costs. It follows that the
present discounted value of future marginal costs, St∞ , may differ substantially from current
real marginal costs mct .

    To substantiate the claim that monetary policy also affects future marginal costs, we
depict in the right panel of Figure 4 marginal costs forecasts under the estimated policy rule
coefficient ψ̂1 = 1.3 and the counterfactual value ψ1 = 1.1. The graph shows that a lower
policy response to inflation makes little difference to the expected path of marginal costs for
ζ̂pSW = 0.65 as marginal costs are essentially exogenous, and quickly revert back to steady
state regardless of the conduct of monetary policy. However, under ζ̂p = 0.87, the marginal
cost forecasts are very sensitive to the central bank’s reaction to inflation movements. Thus,
if nominal rigidities are strong, marginal costs have a strong endogenous component which
can be dampened by a monetary policy that reacts strongly to inflation. In turn, monetary
policy is able to anchor current and future inflation.

    The point that policy can exert control on inflation even with a flat Phillips curve (i.e.,
high nominal rigidities) is relevant for the current policy debate. Box 3.1 of the 2013 World
Economic Outlook (International Monetary Fund (2013)) asks “Does Inflation Targeting
Still Make Sense with a Flatter Phillips Curve?” The premise of this question is that with
anchored inflation expectations and a flat Phillips curve it has become harder for central
banks to affect inflation. Seen from the perspective of our model, the anchoring of inflation
expectations is part and parcel of policy’s influence on expected future marginal costs. In
fact, to the extent that the dynamics of marginal costs are more affected by policy when

the Phillips curve is relatively flat than when it is steep, policy may have more control of
inflation under the former than the latter.



4.2        Price Rigidities and Fundamental Inflation

The analysis in Section 4.1 focused on the effect of price rigidities and monetary policy on the
persistence of marginal costs. While policy affects inflation dynamics through the NKPC,
a change in nominal rigidities not only affects the persistence of marginal costs, hence St∞ ,
but also the slope κ of the Phillips curve. Recall that in Section 2.2 we decomposed inflation
into fundamental inflation defined as

                                      π̃t = κ(1 + ιp β̄)(1 − ιp L)−1 St∞

and Λf,t which is the exogenous present discounted value of markup shocks. It is well
understood that a larger value of ζp implies a flatter Phillips curve, i.e., a smaller slope
coefficient κ, as more rigid prices are less responsive to given changes in marginal costs.
Our estimate of ζ̂p = 0.87 and the Smets and Wouters (2007) estimate of ζ̂pSW = 0.65 offer
two competing explanations for the historical U.S. inflation dynamics: ζ̂p = 0.87 implies a
relatively flat Phillips curve in conjunction with large movements in St∞ . The SW value,
on the other hand, implies a steep Phillips curve but little movement in St∞ . Which one
is the most plausible? In order to address this question we will examine the behavior of
fundamental inflation.

       Figure 5 compares fundamental inflation π̃t (solid blue line) to actual GDP deflator in-
flation (solid black line). For the NKPC to be a compelling model of inflation, fundamental
inflation should explain a substantial portion of the variation in actual inflation. We can see
that this is indeed the case for E[π̃t |Y1:Tf ull , θ̂] computed from our SWFF model.10 Funda-
mental inflation from the SWFF model captures the low frequency variation of GDP deflator
inflation. We also compared fundamental inflation to core PCE inflation and it turns out
that the time paths of these two series are very similar (see Appendix C for details). The

       In computing these smoothed estimates, we are using the time-varying coefficient solution described in
Section 2.4.2 that accounts for the ZLB and forward guidance.

difference between core PCE and GDP deflator inflation typically reflects abrupt changes
in commodity prices, which are attributed to markup shocks in our estimation results. We
deduce that the NKPC of the SWFF model is successful in capturing the low- and medium-
frequency movements of inflation, not just during the Great Recession and its aftermath but
also over the historical period from 1964 to 2008.

       To put the SWFF fundamental inflation into perspective, we also compute it for the
SW model (dashed purple line in Figure 5). Our SW-model-based estimate of fundamental
inflation essentially reproduces the estimate reported by King and Watson (2012), henceforth
KW.11 The discrepancy with actual inflation is staggering. In the first part of the sample, the
SW/KW measure grossly overestimates actual inflation, whereas in the second part of the
sample it underestimates GDP-deflator inflation, in particular since 2007. Were inflation to
coincide with the SW/KW fundamental inflation, it would be of the order of -12% annualized
in the aftermath of the Great Recession. The difference between our estimate of fundamental

       We use a different vintage of data from KW, so the smoothed series are not identical, but this makes
little difference.

inflation and the KW estimate is mainly driven by the degree of price rigidity ζp . If we replace
our modal estimate of ζ̂p = 0.87 with ζ̂pSW = 0.65 we obtain results that are very similar to
the ones depicted by the dashed purple line in Figure 5.

       Recall from the analysis in Section 4.1 that for ζ̂pSW = 0.65 marginal costs are strongly
mean reverting and mostly driven by exogenous markup shocks. This implies that funda-
mental inflation under the SW estimate of ζp mainly tracks current marginal costs. Markup
shocks now play two roles: first, they are the main driver of marginal costs and fundamen-
tal inflation; second, the present discounted valued of markup shocks has to explain the
discrepancy between actual inflation and fundamental inflation. Figure A-4 in Appendix C
illustrate these points. Conversely, under the high estimate of ζ̂p = 0.87 associated with the
SWFF model, markup shocks are only important in matching high frequency movements in
inflation, and play only a small role in driving fluctuations in marginal costs and fundamen-
tal inflation. Fluctuations in marginal costs and in S ∞ are mostly explained endogenously
by changes in economic activity.



4.3        How Accurate Were Agents’ Marginal Cost Forecasts?

To assess the accuracy of agents’ (and econometricians’) marginal cost forecasts in the SWFF
model, we depict in Figure 6 for the full sample what we previously showed in Figure 4
for only two periods toward the end of the sample: smoothed historical marginal costs in
deviations from steady state (E[mct |Y1:Tf ull , θ̂], solid black) and for each period t the projected
path of future marginal costs (E[mct+h |ŝt|Tf ull , θ̂], red “hairs”). The forecasts are strongly
mean-reverting, more so than the ex-post realized path of marginal costs. While there were
some historical episodes in which the forecasts seem to systematically miss the prolonged
fall in marginal costs, e.g., 1987 to 1995, there are other periods, e.g., 1995 to 2005, in
which the forecasts captured the future movements of marginal costs quite well. To put the
model’s marginal cost forecasts into perspective, we compare them with forecasts from two
reduced-form alternatives: a random walk model and an AR(2) model.12 While the marginal
cost forecast differ across specifications, the root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of the three

types of forecasts are quite similar, with the AR(2) model performing slightly worse than
the SWFF and the random walk model (details are reported in Appendix C). In sum, even if
the marginal cost forecasts for the most recent years have been consistently over-optimistic,
the historical forecast record of the model (and the agents in the model) is comparable with
alternative reduced-form specifications.

       The SWFF model assumes that marginal costs eventually return to their original steady-
state level. The left panel of Figure 6 may, however, cast some doubts on that assumption as
the historical path of marginal costs suggests the presence of a possible long-run downward
trend in addition to the business cycle fluctuations. This trend captures a downward trend
in the labor share since the early 1980s.13 The decline in the labor share reflects two separate
phenomena: a long-term decline in the labor share attributable to a slower growth of per
capita labor compensation relative to per capita output from 1985 to 2000 and a sharp drop
in employment during the Great Recession.
  13
       While ex-post smoothed marginal costs in the SWFF model are not exactly equal to the labor share,
the time paths of the two series are very similar.
This Version: April 8, 2014                                                                                29



       To make sure that our results are not sensitive to the assumption of stationary marginal
costs, we consider a robustness exercise in which we reproduce our calculations with the
same model parameters, but we use an alternative wage series that is corrected to offset the
drop in the wage-output ratio that occurred in the mid 1980s. We refer to this alternative
wage series as “detrended.” This detrending is achieved by changing the long-run growth
rate of labor compensation so that it is equal to that of output from 1980 on.14 The right
panel of Figure 6 depicts marginal costs and their forecasts obtained by replacing actual real
wage growth with the growth rate of detrended real wages when computing the smoothed
estimate E[mct |Y1:Tf ull , θ̂]. We find that the output growth and inflation forecasts for the
Great Recession generated based on the detrended wage series are almost identical to those
reported for the raw wage series in Figure 1 (see Appendix C for further details), except that
now the model’s marginal costs forecasts for the Great Recession period appear much more in
line with ex-post outcomes. The fact that the inflation forecast remains broadly unchanged
reflect two offsetting forces: as evident from the right panel of Figure 6, smoothed marginal
costs are higher than in the baseline case, which tends to push inflation up, but the marginal
costs are not expected to revert back to steady state as quickly, which contributes to keeping
inflation at level that was predicted with the non-detrended data.



4.4        Financial Frictions and Estimates of Price Rigidities

Our results are sensitive to the estimate of the price rigidity parameter ζp and are based on
a value that is larger than the one reported in Smets and Wouters (2007). Why does the
model with financial frictions and spreads as an observable yields a higher estimate of ζp ?

       The argument can be explained using Figure 7. Imagine that we knew for sure that we
just observed a negative demand shock (a leftward shift in the AD curve), and that as a
  14
       Altering the compensation data in this way addresses also in part the measurement issues identified
by Elsby et al. (2013) regarding the compensation data. Indeed, they argue that around one third of the
decline in the published labor share is an artifact of a progressive understatement of the labor income of the
self-employed. However, they point out that offshoring of the labor-intensive component of the U.S. supply
chain may also have contributed to the decline in the U.S. labor share over the past 25 years.

result of this shock output dropped a lot but inflation fell only a little. A model with a steep
Phillips curve (AS curve) would have to rationalize this chain of events with a joint shift of
the AD and the AS curve (left panel), the latter caused by a positive markup shock — given
that an AD shift only would cause a large fall in inflation. Conversely, a model with a flat
Phillips curve would have no problem explaining this with a simple shift in the AD curve
only (right panel). The first explanation would involve a negative correlation of demand and
markup shocks — one that is at odds with the model’s assumptions. The second explanation
would be more natural, in that the outcomes can be explained as the result of one shock
only.

   If we knew that a good portion of business cycle fluctuations is explained by such demand
shocks, we would arguably be more comfortable with the second, simpler, explanation (flat
AS curve) than with the first one (steep AS curve and correlated markup shocks). It turns
out that by including spreads as observables, the shocks that are predominantly responsible
for explaining the variation in spreads, namely the “discount rate” (b) and the “spread”
(σw ) shocks, play a more important role for aggregate fluctuations, overall. These shocks
by and large operate like the demand shocks described above. We substantiate this claim
as follows. First, we re-estimate the SW model using spreads as an additional observable.
This Version: April 8, 2014                                                                               31



This raises the estimate of ζp from 0.65 to 0.81.15 Second, we computed the correlation
between demand and markup shocks in the SWFF and SW models. As suggested by the
left panel of Figure 7, this correlation is negative for the SW model (-0.37), implying that
adverse demand shocks are associated with positive markup shocks, and slightly positive for
the SWFF model (0.18).



5        What Explains the Ex-post Forecast Errors?

We have argued that as of the end of 2008 the SWFF model could successfully predict the
output and inflation behavior during the Great Recession and its aftermath. Marginal costs
and interest rates, however, turned out to be substantially lower than had initially been
forecast. Why is that? As we now discuss, this reflects both adverse shocks and considerable
monetary policy accommodation. The policy accommodation sufficiently compensated for
the averse shocks such that output growth and inflation did not differ too much, ex post,
from their path predicted in 2008.

       Figure 8 shows the paths of inflation and marginal costs, comparing actuals (black), the
baseline forecasts made in 2008Q4 and discussed in Section 3 (solid red), and forecasts that
are computed conditional on the ZLB, the forward guidance provided after 2008 and, in
addition, ex-post realized shocks (solid blue). Specifically, the blue lines in the left panels
show the paths computed using the solution described in section 2.4.2 and setting all shocks
to zero (“No Shocks”). The difference between these paths and the baseline forecasts are
due to the fact that ex-post policy is different from the anticipated one. The other two
  15
       It has been documented, e.g., in Schorfheide (2008) that DSGE model-based estimates of the slope of
the Phillips curve can vary widely across studies. The variation can be caused by a combination of model
specification, data set, and choice of the prior distribution. Del Negro and Schorfheide (2008) document that
reasonable changes in the prior distribution can generate estimates of ζp ranging between 0.54 and 0.84, well
within the range reported here. In addition, Herbst and Schorfheide (forthcoming) document that under a
diffuse prior the SW model can generate a posterior distribution with two modes, one with ζp = 0.59 and
another one with ζp = 0.70. Including the spread data as an additional observable contributes to shifting
the posterior mass from one modal region to another.

panels show the impact of the realized shocks. Given that one of the main question this
paper wants to address is “Does the model need strong positive markup shocks in the post-
recession period to explain why we did not observe deflation?” we focus our discussion
on the effect of markup versus non-markup shocks. The forecasts conditional on realized
shocks are obtained as follows. We condition on the full-sample smoothed vector of states
E[sT |Y1:Tf ull , θ̂], the additional interest rate and spread information y1,T +1 that is available at
the end of 2008Q4, and the set of smoothed shock innovations E[ǫj,T +1:Tf ull |Y1:Tf ull , θ̂].16 Here
ǫj,t corresponds to either the markup shock or the vector of non-markup shocks. Because
post-2008 policy is different from that assumed in the baseline forecasts, the contribution
of markup and non-markup shocks does not add up to the difference between realized data
and the baseline forecasts.

       Our results are as follows: First, the two left panels of Figure 8 show that monetary
policy has provided considerable accommodation through forward guidance, especially in the
post-2010 period. In the absence of shocks this policy would have implied a sharp increase
in marginal costs, relative to the baseline forecast, and an associated increase in inflation
after 2010. Second, the sharp decline in marginal costs is almost completely explained
by non-markup shocks (upper middle panel of Figure 8). This result is not surprising in
view of the discussion in Section 4: given the high degree of estimated price rigidities in
the SWFF model, marginal costs are largely endogenous and not very much affected by
markup shocks. Third, non-markup shocks cause only a modest fall in inflation relative to
the baseline forecast – about 20 basis points (quarter-on-quarter, lower middle panel). This
finding is consistent with that shown in Figure 2: even conditional on a set of shocks that
imply accurate predictions for marginal costs, the model does not predict a deflationary
episode. The intuition behind this result is the one discussed in Section 3.2: by being
accommodative, monetary policy is expected to push marginal costs up, which prevents
inflation from declining too much. Fourth, ex-post markup shocks essentially explain all of
the high frequency movements in inflation, but have little effect on marginal costs (upper
and lower right panels of Figure 8). The model holds markup shocks responsible for the
large but short-lived swings registered in inflation between 2009 and 2011. These swings

arguably reflect movements in energy prices, which collapsed in the last quarter of 2008
before jumping again in early 2011, during the Arab Spring.17

       On balance, we conclude that the economy experienced generally negative shocks that
pushed inflation, activity and marginal costs down. At the same time, monetary policy
counteracted these shocks by deviating from the historical rule and providing more stimulus.
This stimulus resulted in a much lower interest rate path than initially forecasted.



6        Conclusions

In this paper we examined the behavior of inflation forecasts generated from a standard,
medium-sized DSGE model, augmented with a time-varying target inflation rate and finan-
cial frictions. The model embodies a New Keynesian Phillips curve relating current inflation
to expected future real marginal costs. Several authors recently argued that the Phillips
curve relationship seemed to have broken down during the Great Recession. The basis for
this argument is the observation that real activity dropped sharply without generating a cor-
responding drop of inflation. We challenge this argument by showing that this observation
can be reconciled with predictions of a standard DSGE model. As of 2008Q3 our DSGE
model is able to predict a sharp decline in output without forecasting a large drop in infla-
tion. The model predicts marginal costs to revert back to steady state after the crisis, which,
through the forward-looking Phillips curve, prevents a prolonged deflationary episode. While
the underlying marginal cost forecasts turned out to be overly optimistic ex post, we show
that even taking into account the ex-post realizations of marginal costs, the model does not
imply deflation. We also document that our DSGE model generates a plausible measure of
fundamental inflation for the post-1964 era which explains the low- to medium- frequency
fluctuations of inflation and tracks core PCE inflation without relying on markup shocks.
  17
       This is consistent with the findings of Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2013) who emphasize the rise in
inflation expectations due to increases in oil prices during this time period.

A     Data

Data on Real GDP (GDPC), the GDP deflator (GDPDEF), nominal personal consump-
tion expenditures (PCEC), and nominal fixed private investment (FPI) are produced at a
quarterly frequency by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and are included in the National
Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). Average weekly hours of production and nonsupervi-
sory employees for total private industries (AWHNONAG), civilian employment (CE16OV),
and civilian noninstitutional population (LNSINDEX) are produced by the Bureau of La-
bor Statistics (BLS) at the monthly frequency. The first of these series is obtained from
the Establishment Survey, and the remaining from the Household Survey. Both surveys
are released in the BLS Employment Situation Summary. Since our models are estimated
on quarterly data, we take averages of the monthly data. Compensation per hour for the
nonfarm business sector (COMPNFB) is obtained from the Labor Productvity and Costs
release, and produced by the BLS at the quarterly frequency. All data are transformed
following Smets and Wouters (2007). The federal funds rate is obtained from the Federal
Reserve Board’s H.15 release at the business day frequency. We take quarterly averages of
the annualized daily data and divide by four. Let ∆ denote the temporal difference operator.

Then:

  Output growth          = 100 ∗ ∆LN ((GDP C)/LN SIN DEX)
  Consumption growth = 100 ∗ ∆LN ((P CEC/GDP DEF )/LN SIN DEX)
  Investment growth      = 100 ∗ ∆LN ((F P I/GDP DEF )/LN SIN DEX)
  Real Wage growth       = 100 ∗ ∆LN (COM P N F B/GDP DEF )
  Hours worked           = 100 ∗ LN ((AW HN ON AG ∗ CE16OV /100)/LN SIN DEX)
  Inflation              = 100 ∗ ∆LN (GDP DEF )
  FFR                    = (1/4) ∗ F EDERAL F U N DS RAT E

   Long-run inflation expectations are obtained from the Blue Chip Economic Indicators
survey and the Survey of Professional Forecasters available from the FRB Philadelphia’s
Real-Time Data Research Center. Long-run inflation expectations (average CPI inflation
over the next 10 years) are available from 1991Q4 onwards. Prior to 1991Q4, we use the
10-year expectations data from the Blue Chip survey to construct a long time series that
begins in 1979Q4. Since the Blue Chip survey reports long-run inflation expectations only
twice a year, we treat these expectations in the remaining quarters as missing observations
and adjust the measurement equation of the Kalman filter accordingly. Long-run inflation
expectations πtO,40 are therefore measured as

     10y Infl Exp = (10-YEAR AVERAGE CPI INFLATION FORECAST − 0.50)/4.

where 0.50 is the average difference between CPI and GDP annualized inflation from the
beginning of the sample to 1992. We divide by 4 to express the data in quarterly terms.
Finally, we measure Spread as the annualized Moody’s Seasoned Baa Corporate Bond Yield
spread over the 10-Year Treasury Note Yield at Constant Maturity. Both series are available
from the Federal Reserve Board’s H.15 release. Like the federal funds rate, the spread data
is also averaged over each quarter and measured at the quarterly frequency. This leads to:

                  Spread = (1/4) ∗ (BaaCorporate − 10yearT reasury).

Notes: SWFF refers to the baseline model, i.e., Smets and Wouters (2007)’s model with financial frictions
and time-varying inflation target. SWπ is the SW model with time-varying inflation target but no financial
frictions. SW+Sp represents the SW model estimated with the same observables as Smets and Wouters plus
credit spread data. SW refers to the SW model estimated using the same observables as Smets and Wouters
but with the 2012Q3 vintage of data. SW[2007] indicates the parameter estimates reported in Smets and
Wouters (2007).

C.2      Section 4.2

Figure A-2 shows SWFF fundamental inflation π̃t , core PCE inflation (since a core measure
for the GDP Deflator is not available), as well as a measure of fundamental inflation stripped
of the indirect effect that arises from the impact of markup shocks on the evolution of
marginal costs (πtno       mkup
                                  ). π̃t and πtno   mkup
                                                           are close to one another and track core inflation
even better than they track the GDP deflator inflation. The comparison between core and
actual inflation is also revealing: differences between core and headline inflation usually
reflect abrupt changes in commodity prices, as in the latest period or in the mid-2000s, and
these changes are captured by markup shocks in the model. But markup shocks also have
an effect on marginal costs: positive markup shocks depress economic activity and make
fundamental inflation lower, opening a gap between π̃t and πtno                 mkup
                                                                                       .

Figure A-3 compares SW fundamental inflation and SW marginal costs. The two series look
almost identical, illustrating that for low ζp fundamental inflation tracks marginal costs.

Figure A-4 shows that the fraction of fundamental inflation attributable to markup shocks
is very small for the SWFF model, whereas markup shocks explain most of fundamental

Figure A-6 depicts output growth and inflation forecasts that are obtained by replacing real
wage growth with the growth rate of detrended real wages. We do not re-estimate the DSGE
model parameter; we only re-run the Kalman filter to generate the forecasts.
