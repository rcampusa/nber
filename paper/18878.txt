                                               ABSTRACT

We construct a model to capture the Keynesian idea that production and employment decisions are
based on expectations of aggregate demand driven by sentiments, and that realized demand follows
from the production and employment decisions of firms. We cast the Keynesian idea into a simple
model with imperfect information about aggregate demand and we characterize the rational expectations
equilibria of this model. We find that the equilibrium is not unique despite the absence of any non-convexities
or strategic complementarity in the model. In addition to multiple fundamental equilibria, there can
be serially correlated stochastic equilibria driven by self-fulfilling consumer sentiments. Furthermore,
these sentiment-driven equilibria are not based on randomizations of the fundamental equilibria

             Even if economic fundamentals were certain, economic outcomes would
        still be random. This is because economies are social organizations. Each
        economic actor is uncertain about the strategies of the others. Business
        people, for example, are uncertain about the plans of their customers and
        rivals and of the government tax, monetary, and regulatory authorities. This
        type of economic randomness is generated by the market economy: it is thus
        endogenous to the economy, but extrinsic to the economic fundamentals.

1       Introduction
We construct a model to capture the Keynesian insight that employment and produc-
tion decisions are based on consumer sentiments of aggregate demand, and that realized
aggregate demand follows …rms’ production and employment decisions. We cast the
Keynesian insight in a simple model in which (i) …rms must make employment and
production decisions before aggregate demand and prices are realized, and (ii) realized
demand and income depend on …rms’output and employment decisions. We character-
ize the rational expectations equilibria of this model. We …nd that despite the lack of
any non-convexities in technologies and preferences, there can be multiple rational ex-
pectations equilibria. Fluctuations are driven by waves of optimism or pessimism, or as
in Keynes’terminology, by "animal spirits".1 Sentiment-driven equilibria arise because
…rms must make production decisions based on signals about aggregate demand, prior
to its realization.
    In our baseline model trades take place in centralized markets and at the end of the
period all trading history is public knowledge. Firms produce di¤erentiated goods and
make production and employment decisions based on aggregate demand signals from
consumers. Consumer demand re‡ects fundamental preference or productivity shocks
as well as pure sentiments shocks. The …rms therefore face a signal extraction problem:
their optimal response to fundamental shocks is di¤erent from their optimal response
to sentiment shocks. We show that under reasonable conditions the signal extraction
problem of …rms gives rise to a continuum of sentiment-driven self-fulling equilibria,
in addition to equilibria solely driven by fundamental shocks.2 Such equilibria can be
serially correlated over time, and are not based on randomizations over the fundamental
equilibria.3

     Contrary to Keynes’ contention, "animal spirits" in our model are the outcome of the "weighted
average of quantitative bene…ts multiplied by quantitative probabilities".See Keynes (1936), pp.161-161.
   2
     In contrast to Benhabib, Wang, and Wen (2012), sentiment-driven equilibria can arise here without
any idiosyncratic noise in …rms’information sets.

     For the classical work on extrinsic uncertainty and sunspot equilibria with a unique fundamental
equilibrium under incomplete markets, see Cass and Shell (1983). In Benhabib, Wang, and Wen (2012),
the fundamental equilibrium is unique but, in contrast to models of global games, as in Morris and Shin
(1998), with a unique rational expectations equilibrium, an additional stochastic equilibrium emerges
with the introduction of private but correlated signals for aggregate demand. See also Spear (1989) for
an OLG model with two islands where prices in one island act as sunspots for the other and vice versa.



                                                   1
    Our model is in the spirit of sentiment-driven ‡uctuations of Angeletos and La’o
(2011), as well as the Lucas (1972) island model. Our multiplicity of equilibria however
is related to the correlated equilibria of Aumann (1974, 1987). Correlated equilibria
in market economies are discussed by Maskin and Tirole (1987) and by Aumann, Peck
and Shell (1988).4 They emerge naturally in our Keynesian model. Employment and
output decisions of …rms are correlated through their signals. The signals are imperfectly
correlated because consumers directly observe both the sentiment and the fundamental
shocks, while …rms observe them imperfectly through a signal of aggregate demand.5 In
equilibrium, for every realization of sentiment shocks, the aggregate demand expectations
of consumers are equal to the realized aggregate output, and real wage expectations are
equal to realized real wages.
    We describe the baseline model, the behavior of …rms and households, and the various
equilibria in the Sections that follow. In Section 5 we explore the persistence properties
of the model when the preference shock is an autoregressive process.6 Finally we extend
our model to the case where consumer sentiments are heterogenous but correlated, and
show that the results continue to hold.7


2       Baseline Model
We consider a simple Dixit-Stiglitz model where the …nal consumption good is produced
by a representative …nal-good …rm from a continuum of intermediate goods. Each in-
termediate good is produced by a single monopolistic …rm. Producers of intermediate
goods must make production and employment decisions before the demand for interme-
diate goods is realized.8 The output from each …rm is then combined by a representative
…nal-good producer to yield the …nal consumption good. Producers can perfectly ob-

mann, D., & Morris, S (2011), Bergemann, D., & Morris, S and T. Heinmann, (2013).
    5
      As noted by Maskin and Tirole (1987), "Our observation that signals "matter" only if they are
imperfectly correlated corresponds to the game theoretic principle that perfectly correlated equilibrium
payo¤ vectors lie in the convex hull of the ordinary Nash equilibrium payo¤s, but imperfectly correlated
equilibrium payo¤s need not." In Maskin and Tirole (1987) however the uninformed agents do not have
a signal extraction problem as we do, so in their model they show that in addition to the certainty Nash
equilibrium, they have correlated equilibria only if there are Gi¤en goods.
    6
      We leave the straightforward exploration of Markov sunspots that randomize over the fundamental
and sentiment driven equilibria to the reader. For constructing such sunspot equilibria see Benhabib,
Wang, and Wen (2012).
    7
      For related work on the possibility of multiple equilibria in the context asymmetic information and
global games see Amador and Weill (2010), Angeletos and Werning (2006), Angeletos, Hellwig, and
Pavan (2006), Gaballo (2012), Hellwig, Mukherji, and Tsyvinski (2006), and Hellwig and Veldkamp
(2009). In particular Manzano and Vives (2010) survey the literature and study the emegerce of mul-
tiplicity when correlated private information induces strategic compementarity in the actions of agents
trading in …nancial markets. In a number of the papers cited, prices can convey noisy information
about asset returns. By contrast in our model production and employment decisions are made based on
expectations, but prior to the realization of real prices.
    8
      Since demand depends on income, income in turn depends on …rms’ production, which depends
on expected consumer demand, we can in principle, make a distinction between planned demand and
realized demand, following the traditional Keynesian literature.


                                                   2
serve the entire history of the economy up to the current decision period. At this stage
production has not yet taken place so households, in addition to aggregate shocks to
their preferences, have only expectations or sentiments about their real wage and their
employment to guide their consumption plans. The aggregate shock to preferences is the
only fundamental shock that we consider in this paper.9
    Households infer the real wage given their sentiments about aggregate demand and
their aggregate preference shock. The …rms on the other hand engage in market research
and consumer surveys to get a sense, or a noisy signal, about consumer sentiments and
aggregate demand. They then try to infer the demand for their particular intermediate
goods based on imperfect signals, so they face a signal extraction problem. They hire
workers from households by o¤ering a nominal wage. As already noted, households have
an expectation of the realization of output, and therefore of the price level and the real
wage.
    We show that in equilibrium …rms’ expectations household sentiments will be self-
ful…lling, in the sense that at realized prices the goods markets and the labor market
will clear, household expectations of the price level and the real wage will be correct,
and …rms’forecasts of aggregate consumption demand will be con…rmed. Furthermore
the actual equilibrium distribution of output in this set-up will be consistent with the
distribution of consumer sentiments in a stochastic self-ful…lling equilibrium. We obtain,
therefore, a stochastic rational expectations equilibrium driven by consumer sentiments.
This equilibrium is not based on randomizations over multiple fundamental equilibria, in
contrast to the indeterminacy literature (e.g., Benhabib and Farmer, 1994; and Farmer
2012). In addition to the sentiment-driven equilibria, we can also obtain multiple fun-
damental rational expectations equilibria driven only by fundamental shocks but not by
sentiments, despite the lack of any non-convexities in technologies and preferences.
    To generate aggregate ‡uctuations, sentiments in our model must be correlated across
households. In the benchmark model, the aggregate sentiment is identical for all con-
sumers. In the extension in Section 6 the consumer sentiments have a common as well
as an i.i.d. idiosyncratic component. In this extension we obtain essentially the same
results.
    To be more explicit, a representative household derives utility from a …nal good
and leisure. The …nal good is produced by a representative …nal goods producer using
a continuum of intermediate goods indexed by j 2 [0; 1]. Each intermediate good is
produced using labor. We use labor as the numéraire so the wage rate is …xed at 1. The
real wage (in terms of …nal goods) can of course ‡uctuate with the price of the …nal goods.
The households are subject to aggregate preference (fundamental) shocks and sentiment
(non-fundamental) shocks in each period. In the equilibrium of the benchmark model the
households have perfect foresight. Namely, conditional on the aggregate shock and their
sentiments, they can perfectly forecast the price level. Based on the forecasted price, and
therefore the real wage, they make their consumption and labor supply decisions. The
consumption decisions made by the households are the source of noisy demand signals
for the intermediate goods producers. Based on their demand signals, obtained through
   9
    We can also interpret the preference shock as an aggregate productivity shock to the production of
the aggregate …nal good that uses intermediate goods as inputs.

market research, intermediate goods producers decide how much to produce, and the
price of each intermediate good adjusts to equalize demand and supply on each island.
These prices then determine the average cost of the …nal good and hence the price
of the …nal good. In equilibrium this realized price coincides with the price expected
by households based on sentiments. The results extend to the case where consumer
sentiments are heterogenous but correlated.

2.1       Households
A representative household derives utility from …nal goods and leisure according to the
utility function
                                         C1      Nt1+
                                  Ut = At t           ;                             (1)

where Ct is consumption of the …nal good, At is the preference shock, and Nt is labor
supply. We assume that = 0 for convenience.10 The parameter is the inverse of
the price elasticity of …nal good consumption. We normalize the nominal wage to 1 and
write the household’s budget constraint as Pt Ct Nt + t , where Pt is the price of the
…nal good and t is the aggregate pro…t income from all intermediate …rms. De…ne P1t
as the real wage, then the budget constraint becomes
                                                   1       t

Note that the real incomes of households ‡uctuate with Pt . The …rst-order condition for
Ct is
                                     At Ct = Pt :                                    (3)
    A conjectured decrease in the price level Pt will induce the household to consume
more. Households observe the aggregate preference shock At and an aggregate sentiment
("sunspot") shock Zt and conjecture that the equilibrium aggregate price is given by
Pt = P (At ; Zt ) and therefore that the real wage is (Pt ) 1 . We assume zt    log(Zt ) is
normally distributed with zero mean and unit variance. An equilibrium is a "fundamental
equilibrium" if it is not a¤ected by zt . Otherwise we call the equilibrium a "sentiment-
driven equilibrium".

2.2       Firms
The supply side has a representative …nal good producer and a continuum of intermediate
goods producers indexed by j 2 [0; 1]. The …nal good producer serves as an aggregator
of all intermediate goods, and it does not play an active role in the model. We assume
the …nal good producer makes decisions after all shocks are realized, so its decisions are
not subject to any uncertainty.
    The …nal good …rm. The …nal good …rm solves

only input to produce output according to
                                                Cjt = Njt :                                       (8)
Unlike the households and the …nal good producer, the intermediate goods producers
face uncertainty in making their production decisions: they do not have full information
regarding the aggregate demand shock At and the aggregate price Pt . We assume that
intermediate …rm j has to choose its production based on a noisy signal about aggregate
demand. Denote the signal as Sjt . The intermediate good …rm j solves
                                     max E[(Pjt Cjt                    Cjt )jSjt ];               (9)
                                      Cjt

with the constraint (6). Substituting out Pjt , the …rst-order condition for Cjt is
                                                     1                            1
                                 Cjt =      E[Pt Ct jSjt ] 1                              :      (10)

Using the …rst-order condition of the household in equation (3), we then have
                                      1 n          1      o
                         Cjt = 1            E[At Ct jSjt ] :                                     (11)

We assume that the signal is a mixture of aggregate demand (Ct ) and idiosyncratic noise
(vjt ) given by
                        sjt log Sjt = log Ct + vjt ct + vjt ;                       (12)
where vjt is normally distributed with mean of 0 and variance of 2v . For notational
convenience we will re-scale the aggregate preference shock At as At =          1
                                                                                  exp(at = ),
                                                                 2
where at is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance a .
    We note that in what follows, the noise vjt will not be essential for our results: we
could have set 2v = 0: In that case the signal sjt would fully reveal aggregate consumption
ct to the intermediate goods …rms; but, as we will see in Section 4, sentiment-driven
rational expectations equilibria would still exist.11
 11
      We can also replace the …rm speci…c noise vjt with iid noise vt so the signal is public, without


                                                            5
2.3     General Equilibrium
We de…ne the general equilibrium recursively as follows:

      Based on the preference shock At and sentiment Zt , households conjecture that the
      aggregate price is Pt = P (At ; Zt );and real wage is (Pt ) 1 ;

      Based on the conjectured price Pt and real wage is (Pt ) 1 ; the households choose
      their consumption plan Ct = C(At ; Zt ) according to (3) to maximize their utility;

      The consumption decisions create signals to …rms j as log Sjt = ct + vjt ;

      Based on the signal Sjt , …rm j hires workers and produces Cjt according to (11) to
      maximize its expected pro…t;

      Given the production of Cjt , price Pjt adjusts to equate demand and supply ac-
      cording to equation (6);

      The total production of …nal good Ct ; according to (5), equals the households’
      planned consumption. Hence the realized aggregate price is equal to the conjec-
      tured price Pt and the realized real wage is the conjectured real wage is (Pt ) 1 .

    It turns out that equations (5), (11), and (12) are su¢ cient to characterize the general
equilibrium. We conjecture that the equilibrium production (in logarithm) can be written
as log Cjt = c~ + cjt and log Ct = c + ct and that cjt and ct are solutions to the following
systems of equations:


                                    cjt = Ef[at + ct ]jsjt g;                                (13)

output cit would decrease with aggregate demand ct if < 0, which implies that inter-
mediate goods are strategic substitutes; whereas > 0 would correspond to the case
of strategic complementarity among intermediate goods. Hence, our model is ‡exible
enough to characterize both strategic complementarity and strategic substitutability in

3     Fundamental Equilibria
We …rst study the equilibria driven only by fundamentals, in particular by preference
shocks at . In a fundamental equilibrium neither aggregate consumption ct nor the pro-
duction of each intermediate good cjt is a¤ected by consumer sentiments. We show that
this simple model permits multiple fundamental equilibria.
    We use a conjecture-and-veri…cation strategy to …nd the equilibria. A guess for the
solution to the system of equations (13) to (15) is

                                          ct = at ;                                                  (17)

where is an undetermined coe¢ cient. Finding equilibrium is then equivalent to deter-
mining the coe¢ cient .

3.1    A Constant Output Equilibrium
Proposition 1 The allocation with pt        log Pt    p = at = and cjt = ct = 0 is always an
equilibrium.

Proof: See Appendix A.1
    In this case consumption does not respond to preference shock at ; namely, the demand
elasticity = 0 and the equilibrium aggregate price Pt = exp (p + at = ). To see the
intuition, suppose that there is an increase in at , which makes households want to spend
more if all else is equal. But whether households actually spend more also depends
on their expectation of the aggregate price (or real wage). In the above equilibrium,
households conjecture that the price will rise exactly in proportion to preference shocks
so their incentive to consume more is completely curbed.

3.2    Stochastic Fundamental Equilibria
In this case consumption responds to the preference shock at with the demand elasticity
  2 0; 1 . We show that there can be two such equilibria in the model under certain
conditions. Suppose household consumption in logarithm is given by log Ct c = ct = at ,
with > 0. Households conjecture that price is given by

                                                      1
                            log Pt   p=    p at   =           at :                                   (18)

Note that equation (3) is satis…ed, implying that the households’consumption is opti-
mal. In what follows we use the method of undetermined coe¢ cients to determine the
coe¢ cient and the constants c and p.
     To solve for , we utilize equation (13). Using the above conjectured equilibrium for
ct , we express the production of each intermediate goods …rm as

Proof: See Appendix A.2

    This proposition shows that for any given value of the noise ratio 2 0; 4(11 ) ,
there exist two additional fundamental equilibria: each corresponds to a particular value
of . In the special case where vjt         0 so that 2v = 0 and the signal fully reveals
aggregate demand ct to the …rms, it is easy to see from equation (20) that one of the
equilibria now coincides with the constant output equilibrium with = 0. In the second
equilibrium we have = (1          ) 1 . Since the signal reveals ct fully, by equation (23)
at is also fully revealed to …rms in equilibrium, so we may call this type of equilibrium
(with 2v = 0) the full information equilibrium.
    In the two additional fundamental equilibria of Proposition 2, the equilibrium price
does not respond fully to preference shocks, and acts as an imperfect shock-absorber. If

                                                                 8
the households think price will respond to the preference shocks less strongly, they will
consume more in the aggregate when at increases. This then sends a more precise signal
to the intermediate goods producers, as consumption volatility would be relatively larger
relative to the noise in the signal. As a result, the …rms produce more and, indeed, the
aggregate market clearing price rises less, con…rming the initial belief of the households.12


4      Sentiment-Driven Equilibria
Now we consider another type of equilibrium in which consumption responds to a pure
sentiment variable zt that is completely unrelated to the fundamental shock at . More
importantly, the variance (uncertainty) of sentiment is itself a self-ful…lling object. We
note that the existence of sentiment-driven equilibria is not based on randomizations
over the fundamental equilibria studied above.
   Suppose households incur a sentiment shock called zt . After knowing the sentiment
shock and observing aggregate preference shock at , households choose their optimal con-
sumption based on their conjecture of the price level. Let us conjecture an equilibrium
in which household consumption takes the form

                                          ct = at +               z zt ;                       (28)

along with the conjectured price pt = a at + z zt . For notational convenience, we have
normalize the variance of zt to unity, so the scaler z represents the standard deviation
of the sentiment shock (i.e., var( z zt ) = 2z ). Given aggregate consumption demand, the
production of the individual …rm j is

                      cjt = E(at + ct )j(ct + vjt )                                            (29)
                          = E(at + at + z zt )j( at + z zt + vjt )                             (30)
                            ( + 2 ) 2a + 2z
                          =    2 2    2      2
                                                ( at + z zt + vjt ):
                                 a+ v + z

Aggregating …rm-level production across j and comparing coe¢ cients of at and zt between
this aggregated equation and equation (28) gives

    In Benhabib, Wang, and Wen (2012), where …rms that produce intermediate goods face idiosyncratic
demand shocks as opposed to aggregate demand shocks, there also are sentiment-driven stochastic
equilibria, but the fundamental equilibrium is always unique.

Hence, the equilibrium aggregate demand (production) is determined by
                                  s
                                     (1 (1     ) ) 2a    2

                        ct = at +                          zt ;                                                                (40)
                                            1

which shows that not only the level of sentiments zt matters but the variance of sentiments
also matters (since depends on z by equation (36)). More importantly, the degree of
uncertainty, that is 2z ; is itself self-ful…lling in a sentiment-driven equilibrium.



                                                                     10
   We can use equation (39) to rewrite Equation (37) as
                                          1                     2                           2

    The intuition for the sentiment-driven equilibria is similar to the intuition for multiple
fundamental equilibria. Which equilibrium prevails depends on consumer’s expectation
of the aggregate price level, which depends negatively on the sentiments (equation (34)).
If consumers are optimistic, they would anticipate a lower aggregate price level (cheaper
consumption goods, higher real wage), so they choose to consume more. Since …rms
cannot distinguish the fundamental shock at from the sentiment shock zt , they choose to
produce more to meet the higher expected consumption demand indicated by the signal,
which ful…lls the consumer sentiments. On the other hand, if demand is more volatile
due to more variable sentiments, …rms would opt to attach less weight to fundamentals
(preferences) in signal extraction, rendering production more volatile. Namely, at each
sentiment-driven equilibrium (indexed by z ), the intermediate goods …rms produce ex-
actly the amount of goods, aggregated into the …nal good, that the households want to
consume, and markets clear.




                                                                                        2
            Figure 1. Contour of the relationship between                        and    v   for any given       z.

    The results of Proposition 3 still hold even if we set 2v = 0, that is if we allow the
signal sjt to fully reveal aggregate consumption ct to intermediate goods …rms. Nev-
ertheless, as we see from (30), the all …rms set their optimal outputs under imperfect
information using their signal sjt = ct because they do not directly observe at and zt


                                                                11
separately. So in this case even if aggregate consumption ct is fully observed by inter-
mediate goods …rms, we see from (35) that sentiments zt still drive aggregate and …rm
outputs in rational expectations equilibria.
    In Figure 1 we plot the coe¢ cients for the fundamental stochastic equilibria in
Proposition 2, and the corresponding coe¢ cients for the sentiment-driven equilibria in
Proposition 3, against variance of the noise 2v . We calibrate = 1013 , = 1, the variance
of log At at 4:5, and we plot against feasible 2v for various variances of sentiments
  2
  z = f0; 0:25; 0:5; 1g.
    Note that 2z = 0 (the outmost contour or hyperbola) yields the pairs of for the
two fundamental stochastic equilibria for each value of 2v . Figure 1 thus makes it clear
that these fundamental equilibria may be viewed as a special case of sentiment-driven
equilibria where the variance of sentiments 2z go to zero. We can also observe in Figure
1 how changing 2z generates additional pairs of centering sentiment-driven stochastic
equilibria for various values of 2v . For each 2v we may have up to …ve types of equilibria:
a continuum of pairs of sentiment-driven equilibria indexed by 2z , a pair of stochastic
fundamental equilibria where aggregate consumption ct is driven only by fundamental
shocks at , and a constant output equilibrium.


5       Persistence
In this section we show that the sentiment-driven equilibria can be serially correlated over
time under reasonable information structures and that the persistence in the sentiment-
driven equilibria mimics the serial correlation property of the fundamental shocks. Note
that so far the noise vjt is not essential for producing sentiment-driven equilibria and,
hence, we drop it from the signal. Suppose that the aggregate shock follows
                                            at = a t     1   +    a "t ;                 (42)
where = 0 is the special case we considered before. We assume that each …rm can ob-
serve the entire history of aggregate production (or aggregate demand ct k , k = 0; 1; 2; :::)
but not the history of preference shocks separately. Namely,
                                      sjt = [ct ; ct 1 ; ct 2 ; :::ct      1 ]:          (43)
In this case, as in the benchmark model, the stochastic fundamental equilibria still exist.
It is easy to show that at a fundamental equilibrium, we have cjt = ct = 1 1 at , where
  =1        .
    We conjecture the existence of sentiment-driven equilibria where zt is serially corre-
lated. Aggregate output takes the form
                                             ct = at +           z zt ;                  (44)
where for simplicity, the sentiment zt follows a law of motion with the same persistence
parameter as the aggregate preference shocks,
                                             zt = zt     1   + "z;t :                    (45)
 13
      In typical calibrations   = 10 implies a markup of about 11%.


                                                      12
Again we have normalized the variance of "zt to unity. At a sentiment-driven equilibrium
the past realizations of aggregate consumption cannot help …rms pin down the innova-
tions in fundamental shock "t k ; k = 1; 2; ::. The history, however, can reveal the sum of
"t k and "z;t k for k 1. So the signal for …rm j is

                          sjt = [ "t +      z "z;t ; :::;        "t       k   +       z "z;t k ; :::]:   (46)

The e¤ective signal for a …rm’s decision making can be simpli…ed to sjt = [ "t + z "z;t ;
 at 1 + z zt 1 ]. Proposition 4 shows the conditions for the existence of serially correlated
sentiment-driven equilibria.

Proposition 4 There exists a continuum of sentiment-driven equilibria indexed by the
             2
noise ratio az 2 0; 4(1 1 )2 . For each permissible value of 2z , the aggregate price is

6       An Extension
In the baseline model we assumed that all households have the same sentiment zt . In this
section, we show that our results are robust to heterogenous sentiment shocks. We index
individual households by i 2 [0; 1] : Suppose in the beginning of each period households
receive a noisy sentiment signal zit ,

                                                zit = zt + eit ;                                         (51)

so that the sentiments are correlated across households because of the common compo-
nent zt .14 Suppose consumers choose their consumption expenditure Cit on the basis of
  14
     In this case if …rms survey a subset of consumers they will obtain a noisy signal (the sample mean)
of the average sentiment zt : In Benhabib, Wang and Wen (2012), in addition to a private signal, we
directly introduce a second noisy public signal of the common sentiments. In both cases …rms can
observe the average sentiment only with noise, so they still face the problem of extracting the separate
fundamental and productivity shocks from their signals.



                                                            13
expected price given their signal zit . As before, suppose each household conjectures that
the aggregate price will be determined by
                                                                          p                p
                                        log Pt         p = pt =           a at   +         z zt ;                                    (52)

with undetermined coe¢ cients f pa ; pz g. In a competitive environment, consumers have
the incentive to …gure out the aggregate sentiment zt because it matters for the aggre-
gate price level and the real wage. Each consumer therefore faces a signal extraction
problem.15
   The …rst-order condition for consumers now changes to
                                                                                                             1

Aggregating
    R1         across consumers, we obtain the aggregate consumption ct = log Ct =
log( 0 Cit di). As before, we assume that each …rm receives a noisy signal log Sjt = ct +vjt .
The production decision by the …rms is given by equation (10) as before, namely,

                                                                1                     1

    It is easy to see that the fundamental equilibrium is not a¤ected by heterogeneous sentiments: if
the aggregate price depends only on the aggregate preference shock, the sentiment shocks will not a¤ect
the consumption decision of the households.

7    Conclusion
We explore the Keynesian idea that sentiments or animal spirits can in‡uence the level
of aggregate income and give rise to recurrent boom-bust cycles. We show that in a
production economy, pure sentiments (completely unrelated to fundamentals) can in-
deed a¤ect economic performance and the business cycle even though (i) expectations
are fully rational and (ii) there are no externalities or non-convexities or even strate-
gic complementarities. In particular, we show that when consumption and production
decisions must be made separately by consumers and …rms based on mutual forecasts
of each other’s actions, the equilibrium outcome can indeed be in‡uenced by animal
spirits or sentiments, even though all agents are fully rational. Furthermore the exis-
tence of sentiment-driven equilibria is not based on randomizations over the fundamental
equilibria studied above. The key to generating our results is a natural friction in infor-
mation: Even if …rms can perfectly observe or forecast consumption demand, they cannot
separately identify the components of demand stemming from consumer sentiments as
opposed to preference shocks (fundamentals). Sentiments matter because they are corre-
lated across households, so they a¤ect aggregate demand and real wages di¤erently than
shocks to aggregate productivity (or preferences). Faced with a signal extraction prob-
lem, …rms make optimal production decisions that depend on the degree of sentiment
uncertainty or the variance of sentiment shocks. In our model there exists a continuum
of (normal) distributions for sentiment shocks indexed by their variances that give rise
to self-ful…lling rational expectations equilibria.

 A. 1     Proof of Proposition 1
Proof: Suppose households conjecture that the aggregate price is given by

                                   pt = log Pt          p = at = ;                                                 (A.1)

where Pt satis…es equation (3). Then aggregate consumption must be a constant C. This
implies that the signal sjt = log Ct + vjt is nothing but pure noise. Hence, by equation
(10) each …rm’s production is also a constant given by Cjt = Ct = C. Equation (11) can
be written as
                    n               1        o
              Cjt = E[exp(at = )Ct jSjt ] = Ct1         fE[exp(at = )jSjt ]g ;     (A.2)

which, under the log-normal assumptions, implies
                                                                                      2
                                                                             1        a
                              log Ct = log E exp(at = ) =                             2:                           (A.3)
                                                                             2
This implies
                                                                         1        2
                             log Ct = log Cjt = c = c~ =                     2    a:                               (A.4)

Since the conjecture of the aggregate price is self-ful…lling, the total supply is indeed a
constant and all markets clear under the conjectured prices.

 A. 2     Proof of Proposition 2
Proof: From the de…nition of       we obtain

Note that there are two solutions for if 0 < < max                               (1        (1   ) )=   4(1    )

It is easy to see that for   >0

Given , we can calculate the three constants c~; c and p to fully characterize the equilib-
rium. The fact that aggregate consumption is log-normally distributed implies that we
can obtain c~ from equation (11),

Finally, notice that cjt = at +vjt , so the dispersion in the production of the intermediate
goods is purely due to the noisy signal. We then obtain
                                                          1            1    2

by equation (5). With the two equations and two unknowns c and c~, we obtain
                             1 1                     2                                                                  2

                             2 2
Once we obtain c, by equation (3) we can obtain p = log                                                 1

Since both households and the …rms’optimization conditions are satis…ed and the planned
consumption equals the actual consumption, we have a rational expectations equilibrium.



 A. 3        Proof of Proposition 3
Proof: Notice that for > 0 equations (31) and (32) are identical, so we only need to
consider equation (32). After re-arranging terms we obtain
                                                               2            2          2

Notice that for 2v < 4(11 ) 2a , we can …nd a continuum of 2z to satisfy the above
equation. Namely, there exists a continuum of sentiment-driven equilibria indexed by

so we also have

Since all …rst-order conditions are satis…ed and markets clear, we have an equilibrium.

Since aggregate production is ct = at +                                 z zt ,   comparing coe¢ cients yields

Aggregating across consumers we then obtain

Since

we then have

Hence we obtain

Taking the log of equation (54) gives

We still have several remaining constants to be determined. First, by equation (53), we

Then by equation (54) we obtain

                                                                                                    1

Finally, from the aggregate production we obtain
                                                       1               1       2

                                                       2
We then solve
                                                                                   1   2        1

and hence
                               1         1    2        1                   1                    2

Finally, the relationship between c^ and c is

                    2
When ! 1 (or        e   ! 0), the above equation reduces to the case with homogenous
sentiments.
