What Do Measures of Real-time Corporate Sales Tell Us about Earnings Surprises and Post-Announcement
Returns?

                                         ABSTRACT

We develop real-time proxies of retail corporate sales from multiple sources, including ~50
million mobile devices. These measures contain information from both the earnings quarter
(“within quarter”) and the period between that quarter’s end and the earnings announcement date
(“post quarter”). Our within-quarter measure is powerful in explaining quarterly sales growth,
revenue surprises, and earnings surprises, generating average excess returns at announcement of
3.4%. However, surprisingly, our post-quarter measure is related negatively to announcement
returns, and positively to post-announcement returns. When post-quarter private information is
directionally strong, managers, at announcement, provide guidance and use language that points
statistically in the opposite direction. This effect is more pronounced when, post-announcement,
management insiders trade. We conclude managers do not fully disclose their private information
and instead message to shareholders and analysts something of opposite sign. The data suggest
they may be motivated in part by subsequent personal stock-trading opportunities.

Introduction

The information asymmetry around earnings announcements has long been near the center of finance

and accounting research. At the time of an earnings announcement, managers know not only about

their firm’s performance over the last accounting quarter (“within quarter”) but also about

performance since the quarter’s end (“post quarter”). The announced numbers – non-discretionary

accounting disclosures – of course help remove within-quarter information asymmetries. But these

accounting numbers cannot, by definition, eliminate any post-quarter information asymmetries that

managers may possess. Additional tools – discretionary accruals, formal guidance and informal call

tone – have therefore evolved wherein managers have the opportunity to convey post-quarter

information in the current, rather than the next, quarterly announcement. Are these discretionary tools

– whose transmitted content is difficult for shareholders to verify – used in the interests of

shareholders, as intended? Might they be used instead against shareholders, but in the interests of

managers?

       This is the question we ask in this paper. We gain some edge in answering it by constructing

proxies for managers’ within-quarter and post-quarter internal-corporate information around earnings

announcements. These proxies are real-time measures of sales activity covering both within- and post-

quarter periods, right up until the announcement date, typically 4-6 weeks after quarter end. The

proxies are constructed from multiple big-data sources that provide real-time information about

consumer sales at US retailers.

       To construct our firm-level real-time corporate sales (RTCS) index, we estimate the amount

of consumer activity at retail stores utilizing proprietary data sources. An example would be the data

we collect from approximately 50 million mobile phones, as well as tablets and desktops, pertaining




                                                  2
to consumer activity at large US retailers.1 We focus on US retail firms whose main revenue source

comes from their own retail stores. The within-quarter RTCS index for a given firm in quarter t is

obtained from the quarterly growth rate of consumer activity – defined to be a data event associated

with consumer intention to visit a particular retail store – by taking the log difference between the

number of events aggregated over quarter t and the quarterly average of the number of events

aggregated over quarters t-1 to t-4.

         The innovation here is twofold. First, we are capturing firm-specific real-time economic

activity that tracks consumer activity. Our measure is distinct from social media variables (e.g., Chen,

De, Hu, and Hwang, 2015) because it seeks to measure actual consumer activity, rather than derived

opinions or sentiment and is therefore more tightly linked to underlying sales fundamentals. Second,

because a firm’s managers likely have access to up-to-date information on the firm’s operations, our

within- and post-quarter RTCS indexes are, at the time of announcement, useful proxies for managers’

private information, not available to the public.

         We first demonstrate that our within-quarter RTCS measure is – as hoped – related to

previously-unannounced within-quarter fundamentals. Specifically, we find that within-quarter RTCS

significantly predicts current-period revenue growth, announcement surprises and analyst forecast

errors. For example, the R2 from a regression of quarterly revenue growth on our within-quarter RTCS

is 39%. Also, the average announcement excess return for stocks in the highest quintile of within-

quarter RTCS is 2.14%, while that for stocks in the lowest quintile is -1.26%, resulting in an

economically significant return differential of 3.4% for the five-day period around earnings

announcement dates. Our information is therefore strongly correlated with previously unannounced


1 There are many anecdotes that sophisticated investors have increased efforts to achieve an informational edge by
analyzing unique data to predict firms’ fundamental activities. For example, a UBS analyst was reported to have purchased
satellite images of Walmart’s parking lots to estimate business activity ahead of the release of quarterly earnings (Ozik and
Sadka, 2013).

                                                             3
within-quarter sales. These predictions are not really surprising, but they do confirm that our novel

informational measures are potent.

         Next, we focus on post-quarter RTCS. We ask about its relationship with post-announcement

returns, discretionary accruals, announced “guidance” forecasts, conference-call tone, and managers’

private discretionary trades in the post-announcement trading window. The organizing concept is

what we call the Timely Disclosure Hypothesis, i.e., the notion that managers release through available

channels all of their private post-quarter information at announcement. Our first and most important

test of this null attempts to detect predictability in post-announcement returns using post-quarter

RTCS. If managers disclose all of their private information as measured by post-quarter RTCS, we

should observe none. Second, such timely disclosure implies that post-quarter RTCS is positively

related to the announcement return over and above the effects of within-quarter information,

including within-quarter RTCS.

         The natural alternative to Timely Disclosure is the hypothesis we call ‘Leaning Against the

Wind’ (LAW). Under this alternative, managers use discretionary channels to understate, even reverse,

the private information contained in post-quarter RTCS. That is, managers don’t disclose their private

signal, withholding some of the surprise for the future. They thereby induce opposite-sign predictable

components in announcement and post-announcement returns.2 Thus, under the LAW alternative,

we should find that post-quarter RTCS is: i) correlated negatively with the announcement returns over

what we would have forecast using within-quarter RTCS and other controls; and ii) correlated

positively with post-announcement returns.




2 There is already some evidence in the literature of a related effect, in which managers appear to behave asymmetrically

when they fail Timely Disclosure. (Our hypothesis is symmetric.) Specifically they withhold by delaying bad news and
withhold less -- more fully announcing -- good news. See Kothari, Shu, and Wysocki (2008) and Roychowdhury and
Sletten (2012).

                                                           4
        We can confirm and potentially strengthen these results by also examining the attributes of

announcements. That is, if there is a LAW understatement or reversal of private information, we

should see it in direct measures of discretionary disclosures. For us, these disclosure channels are three:

discretionary accruals; guidance (in this case, managers’ “bundled forecasts”); and conference call tone,

measured through natural language processing modules. If we reject Timely Disclosure in favor of the

LAW alternative, these should each, all else equal, be negatively related to post-quarter RTCS.

Naturally if we find a positive correlations between the measures of disclosures and post-quarter

RTCS, then we cannot reject the Timely Disclosure null.

        Our results attest to strong power in favor of the LAW alternative, however. First we look at

stock returns themselves. We find that post-quarter RTCS strongly positively predicts post-

announcement returns. This same conclusion holds using excess announcement returns, which, over

and above other effects (e.g., within-quarter RTCS, earnings forecast and surprise, etc.), are negatively

correlated with post-quarter RTCS. Thus, the basic stock return data show managers understate their

post-quarter private information.

        Second, we look at the three direct measures of discretionary disclosure. Do these provide

evidence, independent of that from stock return data, that managers don’t fully disclose and instead

lean against the wind of their private signals?

        First, we examine discretionary accruals. The LAW alternative predicts that discretionary

accruals appear suppressed when post-quarter RTCS is high – a negative correlation. Our empirical

tests do not show a strong relation between discretionary accruals and post-quarter RTCS, so we

cannot reject Timely Disclosure in favor of LAW alternative based on the accruals of all firms.

However, we find evidence of a negative relationship across a smaller group of firms where we might

expect this test to have greater power: i.e., for firms that marginally miss analyst consensus forecasts.


                                                    5
The managers of these firms may not have so much at stake vis a vis current earnings and so may

reduce discretionary accruals to lower market expectations in the presence of positive post-quarter

sales performance.

        Second, we ask whether management forecasts or “guidance” issued around earnings

announcement dates (often called “bundled” forecasts) reject Timely Disclosure, and, if so, if they do

so in favor of LAW. The evidence here is similar, but considerably stronger: bundled forecasts are

systematically negatively related to post-quarter RTCS. The probability of realized future earnings (or

revenue) exceeding bundled forecasts is positively and significantly associated with post-quarter

RTCS. As the LAW alternative would predict, managers issue more pessimistic (optimistic) forecasts

– in this case, guidance -- in the presence of more positive (negative) post-quarter sales information.

        Finally, we examine managerial tone in announcement conference calls. Specifically, we

generate sentiment scores measuring managerial tone from managers’ speech using conference call

transcripts. Managerial tone is defined as the ratio of the number of positive words to the sum of the

number of positive and negative words, where the list of positive and negative words is from Loughran

and McDonald (2011). Just as with discretionary accruals and bundled forecasts, we test sentiment

scores against post-quarter RTCS. And as above, we find that call sentiment is significantly and

negatively related to post-quarter RTCS. This holds with and without controls alike.

        Summarizing thus far, the conclusions we derive about managerial behavior from post-quarter

RTCS are the same whether we look to announcement and post-announcement returns or whether

we look to direct channels of managerial discretion – discretionary accruals, guidance, and conference-

call tone – offered at announcement. All these data sources point toward rejection of Timely

Disclosure in favor of the LAW alternative.




                                                   6
        The next logical question is why. Why would managers consistently across channels, choose

to understate or even reverse their private signal, leading the information withheld to leak out only

slowly, post-announcement?

        Clearly, if managers at announcement obscure fundamental information for a quarter, they

enjoy a transitory informational asymmetry versus analysts and the market. This improves their post-

announcement trade opportunities. We note that managers could in principal also induce equal-sized

asymmetries by magnifying – i.e., overstating – their private signals instead of reversing them.

However, managers’ observed preference – to ‘lean against the wind’, rather than ‘run with the wind’

– makes sense in the presence of imperfect credibility. To see this, suppose the private signal is an 1-

standard-deviation good news. A 2-standard-deviation downward distortion would have managers

conveying 1-standard-deviation bad news, while an equivalent 2-standard-deviation upward distortion

would require conveying 3-standard-deviation good news. If the market did a complete statistical

analysis, these same-sized distortions would reduce credibility equally. However, in the absence of

more complete sampling information, magnification sounds hyperbolic. Reversal announcements can

be of the same magnitude as true signals, yet provide managers substantial distortionary effects.

        Thus our rejection of Timely Disclosure suggests reversal in discretionary announcements.

Are insiders’ trades after earnings announcements consistent with this? While there are relatively few

such insider trades in our sample, we find that the negative relation between post-quarter RTCS and

announcement return is stronger when insiders subsequently purchase their firms’ shares. We also

show that the positive predictability of post-quarter RTCS for announcement returns is even stronger

in the presence of subsequent insider purchases.

        The rest of this paper is organized as follow. In the next section, we review related literature.

Section 2 describes our methodology and the main variable, RTCS. Section 3 demonstrates the


                                                   7
predictability of RTCS for fundamentals as well as announcement returns. In Section 4, we study

returns around earnings announcement dates and the information contained in post-quarter RTCS.

In Section 5, we examine the mechanisms through which managers can potentially manipulate the

market’s expectation as well as their post-announcement trades. In Section 6, we provide our

concluding remarks.




1. Related Literature

Our paper adds to the literature on managers’ asymmetric incentives to disclose good news versus bad

news. In general, the literature has shown that bad news tends to be delayed and good news tends to

be accelerated. For example, Kothari, Shu, and Wysocki (2008) show that managers delay the release

of bad news up to a certain threshold, but release good news immediately. Roychowdhury and Sletten

(2012) discuss the earnings reporting process as a mechanism that forces managers to disclose bad

news that they otherwise have incentives to withhold. Graham, Harvey, and Rajgopal (2005) document

that some CFOs claim that they delay bad news disclosures in the hope that the firm’s status will

improve. However, there are opposing incentives to release bad news early. For example, Skinner

(1994, 1997) and Baginski, Hassell, and Kimbrough (2002) show that litigation risk can motivate

managers to quickly reveal bad news. Contrary to the discussion on bad news disclosure, only a few

papers study managerial incentives to delay the disclosure of good news. Yermack (1997) (see also

Aboody and Kasznik, 2000) shows that CEOs receive option awards shortly before favorable news,

implying a delay of good news. Our paper contributes to the literature, showing that managers’

departures from the Timely Disclosure Hypothesis may be sensitive to post-quarter private

information held by managers at announcement and that managers may act through their stock trading

to benefit from these departures.


                                                 8
       Our paper also touches on the literature on insider trading. Rogers (2008) shows that managers

provide high-quality disclosures before selling shares and low-quality disclosure prior to purchasing

them. Piotroski and Roulstone (2005) show that insider trades are positively related to firms’ future

earnings performance and inversely related to recent returns, indicating that insiders possess superior

information and that this information is most valuable when the market has it wrong. Jenter (2005)

also finds that top managers act to express contrarian views on firm value. Roychowdhury and Sletten

(2012) provide evidence that managers delay the disclosure of bad news when they are net sellers. Our

findings are generally consistent with these views, but further show that insiders may be able to manage

the market’s impression through their announcements in ways that make their private information at

announcement more valuable to their personal trading.

       Finally, this paper is related to a growing literature that uses textual analysis to understand

financial markets (Tetlock (2007), Tetlock, Saar-Tsechansky, and Macskassy (2008), Loughran and

McDonald (2011)). Mayew and Venkatachalam (2012) use vocal emotion analysis software to show

that managerial vocal cues contain useful information on firms’ fundamentals. Chen, De, Hu, and

Hwang (2015) study Seeking Alpha, a popular financial blog, and find that positive sentiment predicts

earnings announcements and future stock returns. Druz, Petzev, Wagner, and Zeckhauser (2016)

show that conference call tone predict future earnings and uncertainty. Bartov, Faurel, and Mohanram

(2015) use the Tweeter feed to extract aggregate sentiment before earnings announcements. Our paper

studies the textual tone of managerial conference calls to see if it conforms to the Timely Disclosure

Hypothesis.

2. Methodology and the Main Variable

2.1. Research Questions and Methodology


We construct the main proxy for real-time corporate sales, which we call “RTCS,” to mimic firms’

sales systems, but using the proprietary outside data sources described below. In Section 3, we show

that RTCS indeed contains superior information and predicts revenue surprises, earnings surprises,

and returns around earnings announcements.

       Once we establish the informativeness of RTCS, we ask how managers’ private information

affects their incentives for disclosure and their trading behavior. Our analysis centers on earnings

announcement dates. Earnings announcements are events during which operating results of the

previous quarter are disclosed and discussed. Investors naturally attempt to process the implications

of this new information for future operating performance. Our null hypothesis – the Timely

Disclosure Hypothesis – states that managers truthfully communicate their private information

pertaining to the following quarters to reduce information asymmetry proxied by post-quarter RTCS.

Our alternative hypothesis is that managers conceal or even alter the contents of their private

information for various reasons discussed below.

       Figure 1 helps to explain how we construct our main variables to examine the relation between

managerial private information and reported earnings. The figure plots the time line around the

earnings announcement date for Quarter t. The post-quarter period is defined as the time period

between the beginning of the fiscal-quarter t+1 and the announcement date of quarter-t earnings. We

denote within-quarter sales information measured by RTCS for fiscal quarter t as WQSt, and post-

quarter sales information measured by RTCS for the post-quarter period as PQSt.




                                                   10
       The primary source of private information is probably a manager’s superior ability to forecast

revenues and earnings. Based on the demonstrated strong ability of WQS to proxy for within-quarter

variables, we find it reasonable to assume that PQS proxies analogously for post-quarter business

activities and that it is therefore correlated with managers’ performance expectations for quarter t+1.

       First, we examine whether managers convey their private information in a timely manner. If

managers inform market participants of their private information at announcement dates, then,

according to the Timely Disclosure Hypothesis, the post-quarter RTCS should not be associated with

post-announcement returns. We therefore investigate the relation between PQS and the post-

earnings-announcement returns.

       Next, we ask about whether managers simply withhold private information, or whether they

influence its interpretation in some way. Delaying the announcement of good news contained in PQS,

would of course result in a positive correlation between PQS and post-announcement returns, as

stated above. However manager go farther. Rather than simply delay the release of private

information, they may seek to distort it, in particular by leaning against, rather than remaining silent

about, their private information. Of course such behavior strengthens the positive correlation we will

find between PQS and post-announcement returns. But, in addition, it induces a dispositive

correlation between current announcement returns and PQS. That is, if managers in possession of

more positive private information alter negatively accruals, bundled forecasts and conference call tone,

then they are actively leaning against their private information and creating a more negative

announcement return. If this is the case, we will observe that PQS is negatively correlated with

announcement returns and with these measures of announcement disclosures.

       Next, and more importantly, we robustify by testing three completely different channels of

communication through which managers may convey their private information at announcement to


                                                  11
market participants. Specifically managers can use discretionary accruals (Demski, 1998), guidance

issued at announcement (e.g., “bundled” forecasts), and conference call tone to convey their private

information through their reporting discretion. We test the Time Disclosure Hypothesis on each of

these.

         Finally, having found evidence of negative correlations of PQS with announcement returns

and with measures of announcement disclosures, we then – naturally – ask whether managers’ trading

patterns are associated with their announcement disclosures. If managers possess a positive private

signal but can nevertheless convey to investors a negative estimate of that signal, announcement

returns are reduced and post-announcement returns are predictably increased. The benefits of post-

announcement purchases of stock are then greater. Indeed, if managers are aware ahead of time of

their ability to benefit from these circumstances, then the negative correlation between PQS and

announcement returns would be stronger when insider purchases take place. The positive correlation

of PQS with post-announcement returns would also be stronger if insider purchases occur, post-

announcements. Therefore, we examine the relation among PQS, insider trades after announcement

dates, and price movements during and after announcement dates.




2.2. Real-Time Corporate Sales Index


We obtain measures of real-time consumer activity from MKT MEDIASTATS, LLC. The data is

collected from millions of consumer devices, including approximately 350 million mobile phones,

tablets, as well as desktop computers worldwide, of which approximately 50 million are US based. The

data only include large big-box retailers whose main revenue source comes from their physical retail

stores, and does not include online shops or other types of retailers, such as telecommunication

companies or restaurants. Therefore, the sample consists of 50 US big-box retail firms.

                                                 12
        Table 1 provides the list of firms in the sample, their ticker symbols and US based revenues

as of 2014. There are 29 firms in the sample included in the top 100 US retailers by National Retail

Federation (NRF). NRF data include private firms, online retailers, restaurants, and

telecommunication companies, as well as big-box retailers. Total US 2014 revenue of sample firms is

$1.2 trillion and average (median) revenue is $24.4 billion ($7.3 billion). Total revenue of sample firms

is about 64% of total revenue of the NRF 100. Sample firms cover 77% of total revenue of the pure

retailers of top NRF 100 firms, when we exclude non-pure retailers, such as restaurants and

telecommunications, from the list.

        Our consumer activity data records specific types of events. Specifically, an individual event is

defined by what appears to be a consumer’s intention to visit a particular retail store. These events are

counted and aggregated per retailer each week. For example, a search for driving directions to a

geographical location of a Walmart is counted toward Walmart’s consumer activity for the week. Some

retailers have multiple brand name stores. For example, GAP has several brand name stores, including

Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Piperlime, Athleta and INTERMIX. Thus, total events for GAP

aggregate across these brand name stores.

        The real-time corporate sales index (RTCS) is derived using weekly consumer activity data

described above aggregated to the firm level. First, individual events are aggregated over a quarter per

firm. We define within-quarter RTCS (WQS) for quarter t and firm i using the quarterly growth rate

of firm i’s events over the previously four quarters, taking log differences between the number of

events aggregated over the quarter t and the quarterly average of the number of events aggregated

over quarters t-1 to t-4.

        Post-quarter RTCS (PQS) is measured in a similar fashion. First, we aggregate individual

events during the post-quarter period and express in full-quarterly growth units. Specifically, we


                                                   13
multiply the aggregated consumer events by the number of weeks in quarter t+1 and divide the

product by the number of weeks in the post-quarter period to reach the estimated quarterly number

for t+1. PQS is then, analogously to WQS, the log difference of the estimated number of events for

the quarter t+1 and the quarterly average of the number of events aggregated over quarter t to quarter

t-3.

        Figure 2 illustrates an example of one of the data sources on consumer activities that are used

to construct real-time corporate sales index. The first and second panels provide daily time series of

individual events pertaining to GAP and Target Corporation over the period of Dec. 2012 to Nov.

2013, while the third panel shows the time series of events for a larger sample derived from data

extracted from Android mobile devices in the United States. The time series are normalized by scaling

the highest value of the daily activities during the time period. The figure shows that observed patterns

are correlated with consumption. For example, all three panels share a similar pattern, displaying

higher levels of activity during holiday seasons and spikes in volumes during weekends. The mid-year

spike in GAP coincides with a mid-year sale event.




2.3. Variable Definitions and Summary Statistics


We use CRSP to obtain stock market variables, including stock returns, prices, and number of shares

outstanding for the firms in our sample. IBES detail history file is used to obtain analyst forecasts and

earnings announcement dates. And, firms’ financial statements are obtained from Compustat.

        Table 2 shows the summary statistics of main variables. The variables are defined as follow;

The quarterly revenue growth for firm i as of fiscal quarter t is calculated as Si,t/Si,t-1 – 1, where Si,t is

the quarterly revenue as of fiscal quarter t for firm i; To estimate the standardized unexpected revenue

(SUR), we assume that the revenue follows a seasonal random walk with a drift. Specifically, the SUR

                                                     14
for stock i in quarter t is defined as [(Si,t – Si,t-4) - ri,t]/σi,t where σi,t and ri,t are the standard deviation and

average, respectively, of (Si,t – Si,t-4) over the preceding eight quarters; The standardized unexpected

earnings (SUE) is estimated as (AEi,t – FEi,t) /Pi,t, where AEi,t is quarterly earnings per share announced

for quarter t of stock i, FEi,t is the mean of analysts’ forecasted EPS, and Pi,t is quarter-end price; The

announcement return is calculated as the return in excess over the market during the period of one

day before the earnings announcement date and three days after the announcement date; The post-

earnings-announcement return (PAR) is the return of each firm in excess over the market for the

period beginning on four days after the announcement dates for fiscal quarter-t earnings and ending

on 60 days after the announcement dates.

         Panel A shows the descriptive statistics of main variables, including the mean and standard

deviations as well as quartiles of each variable. The within-quarter RTCS (WQS) has slightly higher

average, median, and standard deviation compared to revenue growth. The mean (median) of WQS is

0.034 (0.024) with the standard deviation of 0.316, while the revenue growth has the mean (median)

of 0.027 (0.015) and standard deviation of 0.209. Announcement returns are positive on average,

having the mean of 0.7% and the median of 0.3%. The average PAR is also slightly positive being

0.2%, but the median of the post-earnings-announcement returns has a negative value of -0.2%.

         Panel B reports correlations of the variables. The upper right corner of Panel B reports

Pearson correlations and the lower left corner of the table provides Spearman’s rank correlations. The

WQS has significant and positive correlations with revenue growth, SUR, SUE, and announcement

return. The correlation between WQS and PAR is significantly positive at 10% level using Pearson

correlation and 1% using Spearman’s rank correlation. As expected, revenue growth and SUR have

significantly positive correlations with SUE, and announcement returns, and a positive correlation

with PAR, implying that revenue growth and surprises are important sources for SUE and

announcement returns, as well as for post-earnings-announcement returns.

3. Predictability of RTCS

In this section, we examine the informativeness of RTCS with respect to firms’ fundamentals. We

create RTCS with the intention of estimating customer activities at US retailers. We assume that this

measure is directly related with the real consumption in retail stores, which in turn is correlated with

firms’ sales and earnings. Therefore, we test the validity of RTCS as a predictor of revenue and

earnings as well as announcement returns around quarterly earnings announcements.




3.1. Sales and Earnings


Table 3 shows the predictive power of RTCS for revenue growth and surprises. Panel A shows the

regressions of the quarterly revenue growth on the quarterly growth of consumer activities, where a

consumer activity is a consumer’s intention to visit a particular retail store as defined in Section 2.

Panel A uses the quarterly growth of consumer activities as the independent variable, instead of the

within-quarter RTCS (WQS), to map with the time horizon of the dependent variable which is the

revenue growth of quarter t from quarter t-1. Thus, the purpose of analysis in Panel A is to test whether

the consumer activity data utilized to calculate WQS is informative in predicting firms’ revenue.

        Models (1) to (4) show the results of pooled time-series cross-sectional regressions. For

Models (2) to (4), we include time (year-quarter) fixed effect, firm fixed effect, and both time and firm

fixed effect. Model (5) shows the result of Fama-MacBeth regression. Specifically, each quarter, we

estimate cross-sectional regressions of revenue growth on the quarterly growth rate of consumer

activities. Then, we calculate the time-series average of coefficients of the regressions and its t-value.

For Models (1) to (4), we report the adjusted R2, while the average R2 is reported for Model (5). The



                                                   16
sample consists of firm-quarters of US retailers with fiscal quarter ending between March 2009 and

July 2014.

        Panel A shows a strong predictability of our consumer activity data for revenue growth. The

simple regression (Model 1) shows that R2 of the regression is 39%. The coefficient is 0.4 with a

significant t-value of 24, implying that 1% increase in consumer activities is associated with 0.4%

increase in revenue. The predictability is robust to firm and time fixed effects, as well as Fama-

MacBeth regression in Model (5). The magnitude of coefficient is somewhat smaller being 0.29 in

Model (5). However, the t-value is significant at 8.62 and the average R2 of each cross-sectional

regression is 23%.

        Figure 3 shows the results of Table 3 graphically. The figure scatter-plots revenue growth on

the growth of consumer activities. The vertical axis is the quarterly revenue growth and the horizontal

axis is the consumer-activity growth. The red line is the predicted value of revenue growth using

consumer activities. As in Table 3, the slope of the fitted line is less than one, which implies that not

all traffic to stores leads to actual consumption. However, the scatter plot shows a strong correlation,

confirming the predictability of revenue growth using the consumer activity data.

        In Panel B, we study revenue surprises using the within-quarter measure of RTCS (WQS),

defined in Section 2, as the explanatory variable. Specifically, Panel B reports the results of regressions

of the SUR on WQS, using the same specifications as in Panel A. Panel B demonstrates that WQS

has a strong predictability for revenue surprises, and the predictability is robust to firm and time fixed

effects. For example, the specification with both time and firm fixed effect (Model 4) yields a

coefficient of 0.7 on WQS with a t-value of 2.92. Fama-MacBeth regression model provides very

similar results, implying that the predictability of WQS is unlikely due to specific periods in time or

unobserved firm characteristics.


                                                    17
        Now, we examine the relation between earnings and WQS. Table 4 shows that WQS has a

predictive power for earnings beyond revenue surprises. Model (1) shows the result of simple

regression of SUE on WQS. The WQS enters the model with a significant and positive coefficient

with t-value of 2.37. In Model (2), we analyze the effect of revenue surprises on earnings surprises.

Jagadeesh and Livnat (2006) shows that stock price reaction on the earnings announcement date and

drift after announcements is significantly related to revenue surprises. Ertimur, Livnat, and

Martikainen (2003) study different sources of earnings surprises and find that investors value revenue

surprises more highly than expense surprises. Consistent with these studies, we find that SUR is highly

correlated with SUE, implying SUR is important source of earnings surprises.

        Model (3) includes both WQS and SUR. Although the magnitude of both SUR and WQS

become slightly smaller than previous specifications, both variables remain statistically significant.

Model (4) controls the lag of SUE to address the persistence of SUE (Bernard and Thomas 1989,

1990, Arbarnell and Bernard, 1992). The lagged SUE has an insignificant coefficient, implying the

persistence of SUE is not observed in our sample. In addition, the inclusion of the lag of SUE does

not affect WQS and SUR, both of which remain statistically significant.

        Models (5) to (8) examine whether time-specific effects or firm-specific heterogeneity drive

the results. Specifically, we add time and firm fixed effects or use Fama-MacBeth method. With the

exception of the Fama-McBeth regression which yields a positive but insignificant coefficient on

WQS, the predictability of WQS for earnings surprises is robust. For example, WQS enters Model (7)

– a regression of SUE on WQS, SUR and time and firm fixed effects – with a coefficient of 0.172 and

a t-value of 2. Interestingly, the lagged SUE has the opposite signs for different specifications, implying

that the persistence of SUE is not robust in our sample. Overall, the analysis in Table 4 demonstrates

the predictability of earnings surprises using WQS.



                                                    18
3.2. Return Predictability


Now, we turn our attention to announcement returns. Table 5 examines the return predictability of

WQS around earnings announcements. We use a five-day event window around earnings

announcement beginning one day prior to the announcement date and ending three days afterward.

Berkman and Troung (2009) document that the proportion of Russell 3000 firms which make after-

hours earnings announcements is more than 40%. For after-hours announcements, earnings related

price changes are not observed on day 0 but observed on day one. In addition, forecasts for following

quarters are usually announced within one-trading day, thus a longer event window help to capture

the complete reaction of the market to the announcement.3

           Panel A shows the average announcement returns during the event window by quintiles of

WQS. Returns are calculated in excess of the market returns of the corresponding periods. Quintiles

of WQS are calculated using the following process. At the end of month t, we group the firms that

have fiscal quarter ending during the three-month rolling period starting month t-2 and ending t. Using

the group of firms, we rank firms based on WQS to obtain quintile cutoff values. Then, we use the

quintile cutoff values to assign quintile ranks for the firms that have fiscal quarter ending in month t.

Thus, each quintile can have a different number of events. We follow this process to make sure that

we use all the sample firms in ranking them in quintiles. Different ways to assign quintile scores – for

example, each month t, rank firms only using firms that have fiscal quarter end at t – does not change

our results.

           Panel A shows the significant relation between WQS and announcement returns. The average

announcement returns are monotonic with the quintiles of WQS. The average return around the

earnings announcements of firms in the lowest quintile is negative 1.26%, which is statistically


3   Choosing different event windows does not alter the inference.

                                                            19
significant at 10% level. On the contrary, the average announcement returns of quintile 4 and 5 are

1.67% and 2.14%, respectively, and both are statistically significant at 1% level. The last column of

the panel shows the result of hypothesis testing for the mean difference between highest and lowest

quintiles. The difference between the highest and the lowest quintile is economically significant 3.40%

for the five-day holding period, and is also statistically significant with t-value of 3.43.

        In Panel B, we take a regression approach to address the concern whether specific time period

or small group of firm drive the return predictability. Thus, we estimate various regression models of

announcement returns on WQS. Models (1) to (4) show the results of pooled regressions, while Model

(5) uses the method of Fama-MacBeth. For Models (1) to (4), we report the adjusted R2, while the

average R2 is reported for Model (5).

        Consistent with Panel A, results in Panel B show there is a significant relation between

announcement returns and WQS. In Model (1), WQS enters the regression with a significant positive

coefficient of 0.035 and a t-value of 3.86. This significant predictability of WQS for announcement

returns is robust to time (year-quarter), firm, and both time and firm fixed effects. The Fama-MacBeth

regression model also gives consistent results. The magnitudes of the coefficients on WQS from all

the specifications are very similar around 0.035. This is economically significant, implying that a one

standard deviation increase in WQS is related with about a 1.1% increase in announcement return.

        The informativeness of WQS in predicting announcement returns is apparent in Figure 4. The

figure plots the average buy-and-hold returns during the event window from 10 days prior to the

earnings announcement date (day 0) to 10 days afterward. Returns are calculated in excess of the

market returns of corresponding periods. The first panel shows the average buy-and-hold return of

firms in the lowest quintile, while the second panel shows the results of the highest quintile. The graph

shows the power of WQS as a predictor of earnings surprises. The pattern of event time returns for


                                                     20
the firms in the lowest quintile is strikingly contrasting to that of the firms in the highest quintile.

There is a statistically significant negative jump around announcement dates for the firms in the lowest

quintile, while there is a positive jump around announcements for the firms in quintile five. This result

reinforces the predictive power of WQS for earnings surprises and announcement returns.




4. Private Information and Corporate Disclosure

Previously, we demonstrate that the within-quarter RTCS (WQS) contains important information on

firms’ fundamentals, thus has strong predictive power for earnings surprises and announcement

returns. In this section, we use post-quarter RTCS (PQS) as a proxy for managers’ private information

and study how it affects managers’ incentives for disclosure timing and contents. The strong

predictability of WQS for firms’ fundamentals justify the use of PQS as a proxy for managers’

expectation for the following quarter. And, the reliability of PQS as proxy for managers’ private

information provides a unique opportunity for studying managerial behavior toward corporate

disclosure.




4.1. Post-Earnings-Announcement Returns and Private Information


We examine how managements’ private information affects managers’ decision on disclosure timing.

We use the RTCS for the post-quarter period – the period beginning fiscal-quarter t+1 and ending

prior to the announcement date for quarter-t earnings – as a proxy for the management’s expectation

of the quarter t+1 earnings and revenue. As described in Figure 1, we denote this post-quarter RTCS

as PQS. Managers of a firm have private information due to their superior ability to forecast revenues

and earnings. One of the main sources of their superior forecasting ability is the access to operating

systems which provide real-time information on the firm’s fundamental activities. And, the

                                                   21
information on business activities during the post-quarter period is likely to be an important source

of managers’ forecast for quarter t+1. Based on the predictability of WQS, it is reasonable to assume

that PQS reliably measures the business activities during this post-quarter period, therefore is

correlated with managers’ expectation for quarter t+1.

        Do managers convey their private information at the time of earnings announcement upon

seeing good post-quarter sales? The literature has documented managerial incentives to withhold bad

news while releasing good news immediately. Thus, we study whether managers release good private

information at the time of announcements by investigating the relation between post-earnings-

announcement returns and PQS. If managers inform market participants of their private information

at announcement dates, then PQS should not be associated with post-announcement returns.

        Table 6 reports the regression results of the post-earnings-announcement returns on PQS,

WQS, and other control variables. Specifically, we run the following regression model.

                           PARi,t = α + β1 PQSi,t + β2 WQSi,t + γ' Xi,t + εi,t,                     (1)


where PARi,t is the post-earnings-announcement return for firm i and quarter t, and is calculated as

the return in excess over the market for the period beginning on the fourth day and ending on 60th

day past the announcement date of fiscal quarter-t earnings. Xi,t is the control variables, including SUE,

SUR, Size, BE/ME, and PastReturn; Size is the natural logarithm of the market capitalization as of

fiscal quarter-t end; BE/ME is the natural logarithm of the book-to-market ratio as of the most recent

fiscal year ending at least three month prior to fiscal quarter-t end; and PastReturn is the cumulative

return in excess over the market from thirty to three days prior to the earnings announcement.

        Model (1) shows that the regression of PAR on PQS yields a significant and positive

coefficient. Model (2) shows that WQS is positive and significant at 10% level. However, Model (3)

shows that WQS is subsumed by PQS, while the latter remains statistically significant at 10% level.

                                                   22
Thus, managers’ private information on quarter t+1 is not immediately observed by investors at

earnings announcement dates, but is gradually disseminated and reflected in stock prices with a delay.

        We control SUE and SUR, as well as lags of SUE and SUR, since various studies show that

lags of SUE and SUR have predictive power for post-earnings-announcement returns (Bernard and

Thomas (1990), Jagadeesh and Livnat (2006)). As expected, both SUE and SUR have positive

coefficients although they are not significant for some specifications. Interestingly, Lagged SUE and

SUR have negative coefficients. However, the significance is not robust to fixed effects, or Fama-

MacBeth method. Model (6) includes all the control variables. The result shows that PQS remains

significantly positive. Also, Models (7) to (9) show that the predictability of PQS for the post-earnings-

announcement returns is robust to fixed effects or Fama-MacBeth procedure.

        Overall, Table 6 shows that across various specifications, PQS is the most consistent variable

in predicting the post-earnings-announcement returns. The positive coefficient on PQS indicates a

delayed response of stock prices to the information in PQS, suggesting that the information in PQS

is not revealed completely at earnings announcement dates. These results provide an interesting

perspective relative to previous studies which discuss about asymmetric incentives of managers to

disclose good news versus bad news. Some studies show managers withhold bad news while releasing

good news quickly (e.g., Kothari, Shu, and Wysocki (2008), Roychowdhury and Sletten (2012)). Others

examine managerial incentives to delay good news for personal benefits, such as stock option awards

(e.g., Yermack (1997), Aboody and Kasznik (2000)). Our results regarding the post-announcement

returns are consistent with delaying good news. To further investigate managerial incentives behind

delaying good news, we examine the relation between announcement returns and PQS.




                                                   23
4.2. Announcement Returns and Private Information


The relation between PQS and the post-announcement returns implies that managers do not reveal

private information at the time earnings announcements, upon seeing a strong post-quarter

performance. Then, do managers actively maneuver the market’s expectation at announcements? We

try to answer this question by examining the relation between the announcement returns and PQS.

Specifically, we regress announcement returns on PQS, WQS, and control variables. Table 7 provides

our results.

        First, we comment on control variables. Consistent with the literature, Size tends to have

significant and negative coefficients and the relation is robust to the most specifications. BE/ME has

positive coefficients, but they are insignificant once SUE is controlled. PastReturn is negatively related

with announcement return, albeit often insignificant, implying that there is return reversal after

announcements. This is consistent with the notion that market makers demand higher expected

returns (thus, higher return reversal) around earnings announcements (So and Wang, 2014). Overall,

examining control variables suggests that our sample shares the common characteristics of asset

pricing relations with bigger samples of other financial studies.

        We also include contemporaneous SUE and SUR as well as lagged SUE and SUR. As expected,

SUE and SUR both are significantly related with announcement returns. Both lagged SUE and lagged

SUR tend to have negative coefficients, albeit insignificant for many specifications, implying our

sample does not display the persistence of earnings surprises and revenue surprises.

        Now, we turn our attention to the main explanatory variables. Consistent with Table 5, WQS

has a positive and significant relation with announcement returns even after various firm

characteristics, SUE, and SUR are controlled for. Interestingly, PQS enters the regression models with

a significantly negative coefficient for the most specifications. This implies that PQS affects the tone

                                                   24
of disclosures at the time of announcements. In fact, our results suggest that managers may issue

negative soft “guidance” with respect to the future when post-quarter-end sales information is

positive. In the next section, we provide evidence that when PQS is high, managers indeed issue

pessimistic forecasts and use negative tone in conference calls.

       The negative relation between PQS and announcement return can have several interpretation.

One would be the litigation risk. Extant studies suggest that litigation risks discourage managers to

make optimistic projections (Skinner, 1994, 1997). Therefore, when their expectation for the next

quarter is high, managers may lower investors’ expectation to avoid potential lawsuits. Another

possible interpretation is that managers, upon seeing strong post-quarter-end results, may not simply

defer that good news, but actually use a negative tone to increase the predictable portion of their

company’s stock price. This would be to their private advantage if they could use the open window

following announcements to trade their company’s stock. We examine this explanation further in the

next section by investigating the stock price movement and insider trades after announcement dates.

       In sum, Table 7 documents the negative relation between PQS and announcement returns.

This result, together with the predictability of PQS for the post-announcement returns, suggests that

managers may intentionally understate their expectation for the next quarter at the time of earnings

announcements. Thus, the predictability of stock prices increases as managers’ private information is

gradually diffused and reflected in stock prices. This opens up opportunities for managers to take

advantage for their personal gain.




5. Accruals, Bundled Forecasts, Managerial Tones, and Insider Trading

The documented patterns in returns around announcement dates and PQS suggest corporate insiders

maneuver the market’s expectation during earnings announcements. In this section, we formally test

                                                  25
whether managers indeed try to influence market’s expectation given strong post-quarter performance.

There are various available channels managers may make use of to manipulate the expectation. For

example, managers can affect the market by directly altering earnings through discretionary accruals.

Or they can use softer channels such as management forecasts or nuanced tone in conference calls.

We also examine how managers’ private information, measured using PQS, affects managers’

incentives for personal trading.




5.1. Discretionary Accruals

A few papers suggest managers use discretionary accruals to communicate their private information,

showing discretionary accruals are positively associated with future profitability or dividend changes

(e.g., Demski (1998), Subramanyam (1996), Louis and Robinson (2005)). Therefore, we study whether

managers send a signal using discretionary accruals to lower the market’s expectation of future

earnings.

         Each quarter, discretionary accruals (DA) are estimated using an extended Jones (1991) model

from a cross-section regression as follow (Larcker and Richardson, 2004).4

              TA = α0 + α1 (1/A) + α2 (ΔREV – ΔREC)+ α3 PPE + BE/ME + CFO + ε,                                       (2)


where TA is total accruals scaled by lagged total assets; A is total assets; PPE is gross property plant

and equipment in quarter t scaled by total assets at t-1; ΔREV is the change in revenue from quarter

t-1 to t scaled by total asset at t-1; and ΔREC is net receivables in quarter t less net receivables in t-1



4 We follow Larcker and Richardson (2004) who extend the modified Jones model by adding book-to-market ratio and

cash flow from operation. Dechow, Sloan, and Sweeney (1995) show that the modified Jones model exhibits the most
power in detecting earnings management. However, McNichols (2002) highlights the importance of operating cash flows
in accrual estimation. We also measure accruals from the statement of cash flows instead of balance sheet, following Hribar
and Collins (2001).

                                                            26
scaled by total assets at t-1; BE/ME is the book-to-market ratio; CFO is the operating cash flow scaled

by lagged total asset. Fiscal quarter dummies are also included in the regression. And, the discretionary

accruals (DA) is obtained from the residuals of the regression, ε.

        If managers indeed lower the expectation through discretionary accruals, we expect to observe

a negative relation between discretionary accruals and PQS. We run the following regression to test

this prediction.

                          DA = α + β1 WQS + β2 PQS+ β3 SUE + β4 SUR +ε.                             (3)




        Panel A of Table 8 reports the results of above regression model. Model (1) shows the result

of a simple regression of DA on WQS. The regression suggests that within-quarter sales measure for

quarter t is not significantly related with the level of discretionary accruals. The insignificance of WQS

is sensible, because WQS is strongly correlated with the revenue growth and earnings growth which

are already accounted for when discretionary accruals are estimated. Model (2) regresses DA on PQS,

which enters the model with an insignificant coefficient. Insignificance of PQS are observed

throughout different specifications, implying that the negative relation between announcement returns

and PQS is not due to earnings management through discretionary accruals.

        The only variable that enters regression models with a significant coefficient is SUE. The

positive coefficient on SUE implies that there is a high correlation between the level of discretionary

accruals and earnings surprises. However, a caution should be made not to interpret this result such

that a higher SUE is due to earnings management. It may be the case that firms with high SUE tend

to have high growth expectation, thus need additional working capital which is captured as

discretionary accruals.




                                                   27
        Studies on earnings management have shown that firms have strong incentives to manage

earnings to meet and beat a benchmark, such as analysts’ earnings forecasts or previous year’s reported

earnings (Burgstahler and Dichev (1997), Bartov, Givoly, and Hayn (2002), Bhojraj, Hribar, Picconi,

McInnis (2009), Roychowdhury (2006)). Therefore, in Panel B, we introduce dummy variables that

indicate whether firms are on the verge of beating or missing analysts’ forecasts, and examine whether

managers’ incentives for earnings management through discretionary accruals are affected by the

likelihood of beating or missing analysts’ forecasts.

        We follow Bhojraj, Hribar, Picconi, McInnis (2009) to define three dummy variables – Meet,

Beat, and Miss; Meet is a dummy variable that takes one if a firm has earnings that were within plus

or minus half-a-cent of the consensus forecast, and zero otherwise; Beat is a dummy variable that

takes one if a firm has reported earnings between half-a-cent and one-and-a-half cents above the

consensus forecast, and zero otherwise; Miss is a dummy variable that takes one if a firm has reported

earnings between half-a-cent and one-and-a-half cents below the consensus forecast, and zero

otherwise. We also include interaction terms of these dummy variables with PQS to the regression

model in Equation (3).

        Panel B shows that Beat has a significant and positive coefficient, suggesting that firms tend

to use discretionary accruals more aggressively when they are on the verge of beating the benchmark.

The coefficients on Miss are negative and significant for many specifications. This result suggest that

firms that are unable to beat the benchmark actually tend to increase earnings quality (i.e., decrease

discretionary accruals) for future fiscal quarters.

        The more interesting variables are the interaction terms of the dummies with PQS. If managers

use discretionary accruals to manage down the market’s expectation, we would observe negative

coefficients on the interaction terms. We find some evidence, albeit weak, that for firms that marginally


                                                      28
miss analyst consensus, the PQS is negatively related to discretionary accruals. This suggests that

managers of firms that marginally miss analysts’ forecasts may use discretionary accruals to lower the

market’s expectation, upon facing positive post-quarter sales performance. However, PQS is not

strongly related to discretionary accruals for other types of firms, indicating that the discretionary

accruals are not the main source of the negative relation between PQS and announcement returns.




5.2. Bundled forecasts

Can the negative relation between PQS and announcement returns be attributed to the pessimistic

forecasts provided by managements at the time of announcements? To answer this, we create a sample

of managements’ forecasts issued concurrently with earnings announcements (“bundled” forecasts)

and investigate the relation between the bundled forecasts and PQS.5 If managers issue pessimistically

biased forecasts of next quarter earnings (or revenue) amid high prospects, the likelihood of ex-post

realized earnings being higher than managements’ forecasts would be positively related to PQS. We

test this prediction using a Probit model.

        The dependent variable of our model is a dummy variable equal to one if the management

forecast is pessimistic compared to realized earnings (or revenue) and zero otherwise. We assume the

management forecast to be pessimistic if the related management forecast error is less than a cutoff

value. The management forecasting error for EPS is defined as (MFi,t+1 – Ai,t+1) scaled by Pi,t+1, where

MFi,t+1 is the management forecast for quarter t+1, and Ai,t+1 is realized quarterly EPS amount. The




5Approximately, 32% of earnings announcements in our sample are bundled with managements’ forecast of the next
quarter. This ratio is consistent with Rogers and Van Buskirk (2013) who document that about 29% of announcements
are bundled for the post-Reg FD period.


                                                       29
forecasting error for revenue is defined as (MFi,t+1 – Ai,t+1) scaled by MFi,t+1. We use the cutoff value

of -0.002 for earnings (10 cents for a stock of $50) and -0.001 for revenue.6

         Table 9 reports the results of the Probit regressions. Panel A uses management forecasts of

EPS to calculate the dependent variable, while Panel B makes use of revenue forecasts of

managements. We report the average marginal probability change for a one-standard deviation change

in the values of the covariates.

         The results shows that the likelihood of ex-post earnings or revenue being higher than

management forecasts is positively and significantly related to PQS. A one standard deviation increase

in PQS is associated about 5% to 7% (6% to 8%) increase in the probability of management forecasts

at the time of announcements being ex-post pessimistic relative to realized earnings (revenue). Thus,

Table 9 provides evidence consistent with our conjecture that managers actively attempt to depress

stock prices through guidance upon seeing high level of PQS.



5.3. Managerial Tone of Conference Calls

We also examine whether managers make use of a negative tone in communicating with market

participants to manage down their expectation. We investigates the relation between the managerial

tone in conference call transcripts and their private information, proxied by PQS. The dependent

variable is TONE, defined as log (1 + number of positive words) minus log (1 + number of positive

words + number of negative words). We follow Loughran and McDonald (2011) for the classification

of positive and negative words.

         Table 10 reports the results of regression of TONE on PQS and control variables. The results

show that TONE is positively related to WQS, while it has a negative relation with PQS. However,


6
  Both of the threshold values are at approximately 40 percentile of the distributions. This number is roughly consistent
with Rogers and Van Buskirk (2013) who classify about 35% of announcements as negative surprises. Using different
threshold values does not change the inference.

                                                           30
WQS is subsumed once SUE and SUR are controlled for, while PQS remains significant. The

significant and negative relation of PQS with TONE implies that when managers have positive private

information, they use more negative tone in communicating with the market.

       Overall, the analyses in Table 9 and 10 provide evidence that managers intentionally maneuver

stock prices when they have good information with respect to following quarter. Consequently,

announcement returns are negatively related with PQS, while the post-announcement returns are

positively related with PQS. In sum, evidence from bundled forecasts and managerial tone in

conference calls suggest that managers use various “soft” sources of communication to intentionally

manage down stock prices.



5.4. Insider Trading

We show a negative relation of PQS with announcement returns and a positive relation with post-

announcement returns. PQS is also related to more pessimistic guidance or less positive managerial

tone of conference calls. These results suggest that managers may intentionally understate their

expectation to create an opportunity for insider trading. Thus, we conjecture that the negative relation

between PQS and announcement returns is stronger when insiders buy their firms’ shares

subsequently. We also conjecture that the positive predictability of PQS for the post-earnings-

announcement returns is stronger when insiders’ purchase takes place. Table 11 examines insiders’

trades around earnings announcements. Specifically, we run the following regression;

         R(t,T) = α + β1 PQS + β2 Buy + β3 Sell + β4 Buy×PQS + β5 Sell×PQS + γ' X + ε,               (4)


where R(t,T) is excess return over the market around announcement dates; Buy is an indicator variable

that equals one if management team is a net buyer during the 20 trading day period following earnings

announcement, and zero otherwise; Sell is an indicator variable that equals one if management team

                                                  31
is a net seller, and zero otherwise; X is a set of control variables. Firm and time subscripts are

suppressed. In estimating Equation (4), we do not use firm fixed effects or Fama-MacBeth regressions,

because there is no observed insider trade for a few firms and quarters. Instead, we report the t-

statistics based standard errors clustered at firm level.

        Panel A summarizes the frequencies of insider purchases and sales based on quartiles of PQS

and signs of announcement returns. The panel shows that there are significantly more insider sales

than purchases. Only 2% of announcements are followed by insider purchases, while approximately

31% of announcements are followed by insider sales. This suggests that insiders typically obtain stocks

through stock options and sell those vested stocks due to reasons such as diversification or liquidity.

        Panel B uses announcement returns, R(-1,3), as a dependent variable. Negative coefficients on

Buy and positive coefficients on Sell indicate that insiders tend to purchase following a negative

announcement and sell subsequently after a positive announcement. These results are consistent with

the literature that shows insiders are contrarian (Piotroski and Roulstone (2005), and Jenter (2005)).

        More interestingly, we find negative coefficients on the interaction between Buy and PQS

throughout different specifications. Consistent with our conjecture, the negative relation between

post-quarter RTCS and announcement returns is stronger when insiders purchase their firms’ shares

subsequently. This implies that insiders understate their private information to purchase undervalued

stocks prior to the price increase.

        The interaction between Sell and PQS is not significant, appearing to be inconsistent with our

conjecture. However, the literature shows that managers provide higher quality disclosures before

selling shares due to litigation cost, while they provide lower quality disclosure prior to purchasing for

personal advantage (Rogers, 2008). Thus, the negative coefficients on the interaction term of PQS




                                                    32
with Buy and the insignificant coefficients on its interaction with Sell is consistent with the extant

literature.

         Panel C reports the regression results of post-earnings announcement returns over various

holding periods. The first two columns of the panel use R(4,60) as the dependent variable. Neither of

Buy and Sell is strongly related with the post-announcement returns. However, consistent with our

conjecture, the positive predictability of PQS for the post-earnings-announcement returns is

particularly strong when insiders’ purchases take place.

         The post-announcement price increases may indicate price pressure due to insider purchases,

rather than insiders’ superior information with respect to PQS. Therefore, we divide post-

announcement returns into two holding periods; R(4,20) and R(21,60). R(4,20) is contemporaneous

return with insider trades, since Buy and Sell are defined from insider trades during the 20 trading day

period following earnings announcement.

         The results show that the positive relation between insider purchases with post-announcement

returns is not due to price pressure, reinforcing our conjecture that insiders intentionally understate

their expectation at the announcements upon seeing strong post-quarter-end results. The coefficient

on the interaction between PQS and Buy is not significant for the contemporaneous return, R(4,20),

while it is significantly positive for R(21,60), indicating that the price movement is due to information

diffusion rather than price pressure.

         Overall, the results in Table 11 are consistent with our conjecture, suggesting that corporate

insiders attenuate guidance information during announcements to purchase undervalued stocks prior

to the price increase.

6. Conclusion

In this paper, we study the relation between managers’ private information and its effects on corporate

disclosures and insider trading, utilizing multiple proprietary big data sources. First, we develop a firm-

level real-time corporate sales index for US retail stores and demonstrate the usefulness of the index

in predicting firms’ fundamentals and future returns. We show that the within-quarter RTCS has

strong predictive power for revenue surprises, earnings surprises, and excess returns around quarterly

earnings announcements. The return differential between high and low RTCS firms around earnings

announcement dates is 3.40%.

        Second, we use post-quarter RTCS as proxy for managers’ private information and study how

their decision for disclosure timing and contents are affected by their private information. We provide

evidence against the Timely Disclosure Hypothesis – managers not only withhold, but attenuate or

reverse, good post-quarter private information. Our post-quarter RTCS is negatively related to

announcement returns, but positively to post-announcement returns. This pattern in returns is more

pronounced in the presence of post-announcement insider purchases. Our central interpretation is

that managers intentionally understate their expectations about the next quarter to increase the

predictability of stock prices post announcement for their personal advantage.

        Finally, our analyses show that managers’ forecasts and tones in conference calls are, according

to objective measures, more pessimistic when managers have positive post-quarter information,

suggesting that at announcement they actively manage down investor expectations and stock price.

This last fact – that objective measures of guidance and tone are negatively correlated with post-

quarter private information – is important. One could otherwise argue that managers cannot control

how investors and analysts hear their announcement guidance and voluntary disclosures. If there is

noise in the process (and there undoubtedly is) and, say, investors hear something more negative than


                                                    34
managers intend, then it wouldn’t be surprising to see our observed post-announcement return

reversals and greater insider purchases. However, this explanation becomes badly stretched because it

predicts managers at announcement offer more positive – not more negative – guidance and call-

transcript sentiment.

       Unfortunately, we do not see any coherent alternative hypothesis – other than managerial

manipulation for personal gain – to explain our particular rejection of the Timely Disclosure

Hypothesis.

Table 2: Summary Statistics

 Panel A shows the descriptive statistics of main variables, and Panel B reports correlations. The upper right corner of
 Panel B reports Pearson correlations and the lower left corner of the table provides Spearman correlations. WQS is the
 real‐time corporate sales measured for fiscal quarter t. The quarterly revenue growth for firm i as of fiscal quarter t is
 calculated as Si,t/Si,t‐1 minus one, where Si,t is the quarterly revenue as of fiscal quarter t for firm i. The SUR for stock i in
 quarter t is calculated as [(Si,t – Si,t‐4) – ri,t]/σi,t where σi,t and ri,t are the standard deviation and average, respectively, of
 (Si,t – Si,t‐4) over the preceding eight quarters. The SUE is estimated as (AEi,t – FEi,t) /Pi,t, where AEi,t is quarterly earnings
 per share announced for quarter t of stock i, FEi,t is mean analysts’ forecasted EPS, and Pi,t is quarter‐end price. The
 announcement return is calculated as the return in excess over the market during the period of one day before the
 earnings announcement date and three days after the announcement date. The post‐earnings‐announcement return
 (PAR) is the return of each firm in excess over the market for the period beginning on 4 days after the announcement
 dates for fiscal quarter‐t earnings and ending on 60 days after the announcement dates. p‐values of correlations are
 reported in square brackets.

Table 3: Revenue growth, SUR, and Real‐Time Corporate Sales Index

 Panel A shows the regressions of the quarterly revenue growth on the quarterly growth of consumer activities.
 Panel B reports the results of regressions of the standardized unexpected revenue (SUR) on WQS. The quarterly
 growth of consumer activities is calculated as the log difference between aggregated consumer activities during
 fiscal quarter t and those during fiscal quarter t‐1. WQS is RTCS for fiscal quarter t. The quarterly revenue growth
 for firm i as of fiscal quarter t is calculated as Si,t/Si,t‐1 minus one, where Si,t is the quarterly revenue as of fiscal
 quarter t for firm i. The SUR for stock i in quarter t is calculated as [(Si,t – Si,t‐4) – ri,t]/σi,t where σi,t and ri,t are the
 standard deviation and average, respectively, of (Si,t – Si,t‐4) over the preceding eight quarters. Models (1) to (4)
 show the results of pooled regressions, while Model (5) shows the result of Fama‐MacBeth regressions. Adjusted
 R2 (for pooled regressions) and the average R2 (for Fama‐MacBeth regressions) are reported. The sample includes
 firm‐quarters of US retailers with fiscal quarter ending between March 2009 and July 2014.

Table 4: Regression of SUE on WQS

 This table reports the regression results of standardized unexpected earnings (SUE) on the within‐quarter real‐time corporate sales index (WQS). The SUE is
 estimated as (AEi,t – FEi,t) /Pi,t, where AEi,t is quarterly earnings per share announced for quarter t of stock i, FEi,t is mean analysts’ forecasted EPS, and Pi,t is
 quarter‐end price. Firm quarters with stock prices below $5 are excluded. The SUR for stock i in quarter t is calculated as [(Si,t – Si,t‐4) – ri,t]/σi,t where σi,t and
 ri,t are the standard deviation and average, respectively, of (Si,t – Si,t‐4) over the preceding eight quarters. Adjusted R2 (for pooled regressions) and the
 average R2 (for Fama‐MacBeth regressions) are reported. The sample includes firm‐quarters of US retailers with fiscal quarter ending between March 2009
 and July 2014.

Table 5: Returns Around Earnings Announcement Dates

 Panel A shows the average returns during the event window by quintiles of within‐quarter real‐time corporate sales
 index (WQS). The event window is the period between one day prior to the earnings announcement date and three
 days afterward. Returns are calculated in excess of the market returns of the corresponding periods. Quintiles of WQS
 are calculated using the following process. In month t, we pool firms that have fiscal quarter ending during the three‐
 month rolling period of t‐2 to t, and rank the firms based on WQS to obtain quintile cutoff values. Then, we use the
 quintile cutoff values to assign quintile ranks for the firms that have fiscal quarter ending in month t. The last row of
 Panel A reports the results of the hypothesis testing for the mean difference between the highest and the lowest
 quintiles. Panel B reports the regressions of event returns on WQS. Models (1) to (4) show the results of pooled
 regressions, while Model (5) shows the results of Fama‐MacBeth regressions. Adjusted R2 (for pooled regressions) and
 the average R2 (for Fama‐MacBeth regressions) are reported. The sample includes firm‐quarters of US retailers with
 fiscal quarter ending between March 2009 and July 2014.

Table 6: Post‐Earning‐Announcement Returns and Real‐Time Corporate Sales

 This table reports the regression results of the post‐earnings‐announcement returns on PQS, WQS, and other control variables. The dependent variables are the return of
 each firm in excess over the market for the period beginning on 4 days after the quarter‐t earnings announcement dates and ending on 60 days after the announcement
 dates. The PQS is obtained from the RTCS for the period beginning after the fiscal‐quarter‐t end and ending prior to the announcement date for quarter‐t earnings, and used
 as a proxy for managements’ private information on the fiscal quarter t+1. The SUE is estimated as (AEi,t – FEi,t) /Pi,t, where AEi,t is quarterly earnings per share announced for
 quarter t of stock i, FEi,t is mean analysts’ forecasted EPS, and Pi,t is quarter‐end price. The SUR for stock i in quarter t is calculated as [(Si,t – Si,t‐4) – ri,t]/σi,t where σi,t and ri,t are
 the standard deviation and average, respectively, of (Si,t – Si,t‐4) over the preceding eight quarters. Size is the natural logarithm of the market capitalization as of fiscal
 quarter‐t end. BE/ME is the natural logarithm of the book‐to‐market ratio as of the most recent fiscal year ending at least three month prior to fiscal quarter‐t end.
 PastReturn is the cumulative return in excess over the market from thirty to three days prior to the earnings announcement. Adjusted R2 (for pooled regressions) and the
 average R2 (for Fama‐MacBeth regressions) are reported. The sample includes firm‐quarters of US retailers with fiscal quarter ending between March 2009 and July 2014.

Table 8: Regressions of Discretionary Accruals

 This table examines managers’ private information and discretionary accruals. Each quarter, discretionary accruals are estimated from the
 modified Jones model that includes book‐to‐market ratio and cash flow from operation (Lacker and Richardson, 2004), using a cross‐
 sectional regression. Meet is a dummy variable that takes one if a firm has earnings that were within plus or minus half‐a‐cent of the
 consensus forecast, and zero otherwise. Beat is a dummy variable that takes one if a firm has reported earnings between half‐a‐cent and
 one‐and‐a‐half cents above the consensus forecast, and zero otherwise. Miss is a dummy variable that takes one if a firm has reported
 earnings between half‐a‐cent and one‐and‐a‐half cents below the consensus forecast, and zero otherwise. The PQS is obtained from the
 RTCS for the period beginning after the fiscal‐quarter‐t end and ending prior to the announcement date for quarter‐t earnings, and used as
 a proxy for managements’ private information on the revenue for the fiscal quarter t+1. The SUE is estimated as (AEi,t – FEi,t) /Pi,t, where
 AEi,t is quarterly earnings per share announced for quarter t of stock i, FEi,t is mean analysts’ forecasted EPS, and Pi,t is quarter‐end price.
 The SUR for stock i in quarter t is calculated as [(Si,t – Si,t‐4) – ri,t]/σi,t where σi,t and ri,t are the standard deviation and average, respectively,
 of (Si,t – Si,t‐4) over the preceding eight quarters. Adjusted R2 (for pooled regressions) and the average R2 (for Fama‐MacBeth regressions)
 are reported. The sample includes firm‐quarters of US retailers with fiscal quarter ending between March 2009 and July 2014.

 to one if the management forecast is pessimistic compared to realized earnings (or revenue) and zero otherwise. We assume the management forecast to be pessimistic if the related management forecast error is
 less than a cutoff value. The management forecasting error is defined as (MFi,t+1 – Ai,t+1) scaled by Pi,t+1 for EPS, or by MFi,t+1 for revenue, where MFi,t+1 is the management forecast for quarterly EPS or for revenue of
 quarter t+1, and Ai,t+1 is realized quarterly EPS or revenue amount. Panel A uses management forecasts of EPS, while Panel B makes use of revenue forecasts of managements. The PQS is obtained from the RTCS
 for the period beginning after the fiscal‐quarter‐t end and ending prior to the announcement date for quarter‐t earnings, and used as a proxy for managements’ private information on the revenue for the fiscal
 quarter t+1. The SUE is estimated as (AEi,t – FEi,t) /Pi,t, where AEi,t is quarterly earnings per share announced for quarter t of stock i, FEi,t is mean analysts’ forecasted EPS, and Pi,t is quarter‐end price. The SUR for
 stock i in quarter t is calculated as [(Si,t – Si,t‐4) – ri,t]/σi,t where σi,t and ri,t are the standard deviation and average, respectively, of (Si,t – Si,t‐4) over the preceding eight quarters. Panel B uses analysts’ forecast errors
 for revenue, AFE, as an explanatory variable. AFE is computed as (ARi,t – FRi,t) /FRi,t, where ARi,t is quarterly sales amount announced for quarter t of stock i, and FRi,t is mean analysts’ forecast for quarterly sales.
 Size is the natural logarithm of the market capitalization as of fiscal quarter‐t end. BE/ME is the natural logarithm of the book‐to‐market ratio as of the most recent fiscal year ending at least three month prior to
 fiscal quarter‐t end. Return(4,60) is the cumulative return in excess over the market for the period between four days and 60 days post the earnings announcement. We report the marginal probability change that
 is obtained by multiplying the average marginal effect of individual observations with a one‐standard deviation change in the values of the covariates. Pseudo R2 based on McFadden’s method are reported. The
 sample consists of the firm‐quarters of companies which provided forecasts for the next quarter EPS on or within three days after the earnings announcement dates.

Table 10: Managerial Tones in Conference Calls
 This table investigates the relation between the managerial tone in conference call transcripts and their private information, proxied by PQS. The dependent variable is TONE, defined as
 log (1 + number of positive words) minus log (1 + number of positive words + number of negative words). We use the list of positive and negative words from Loughran and McDonald
 (2011). The PQS is obtained from the RTCS for the period beginning after the fiscal‐quarter‐t end and ending prior to the announcement date for quarter‐t earnings, and used as a proxy
 for managements’ private information on the revenue for the fiscal quarter t+1. The SUE is estimated as (AEi,t – FEi,t) /Pi,t, where AEi,t is quarterly earnings per share announced for
 quarter t of stock i, FEi,t is mean analysts’ forecasted EPS, and Pi,t is quarter‐end price. The SUR for stock i in quarter t is calculated as [(Si,t – Si,t‐4) – ri,t]/σi,t where σi,t and ri,t are the
 standard deviation and average, respectively, of (Si,t – Si,t‐4) over the preceding eight quarters. Size is the natural logarithm of the market capitalization as of fiscal quarter‐t end. BE/ME is
 the natural logarithm of the book‐to‐market ratio as of the most recent fiscal year ending at least three month prior to fiscal quarter‐t end. PastReturn is the cumulative return in excess
 over the market from thirty to three days prior to the earnings announcement. Adjusted R2 are reported. The sample includes firm‐quarters of US retailers with fiscal quarter ending
 between March 2009 and July 2014.

Table 11: Insider Trading Around Earnings Announcements

 This table investigates the insiders’ trading activities around earnings announcements and the private information. Panel A shows the frequency of
 insider trades as a percentage of the number of earnings announcements. Earnings announcements are grouped based on PQS quartiles and the signs
 of announcement returns. Quartiles of PQS are calculated every quarter. Panel B shows the regression results of the announcement returns on insider
 trading variables and their interaction terms with PQS. Panel C reports the regression results of post‐earnings announcement returns over various
 holding periods. The PQS is obtained from the RTCS for the period beginning after the fiscal‐quarter‐t end and ending prior to the announcement date
 for quarter‐t earnings, and used as a proxy for managements’ private information on the revenue for the fiscal quarter t+1. Buy is an indicator variable
 that equals one if management team is a net buyer during the 20 trading day period following earnings announcement, and zero otherwise. Sell is an
 indicator variable that equals one if management team is a net seller, and zero otherwise. The SUE is estimated as (AEi,t – FEi,t) /Pi,t, where AEi,t is
 quarterly earnings per share announced for quarter t of stock i, FEi,t is mean analysts’ forecasted EPS, and Pi,t is quarter‐end price. The SUR for stock i in
 quarter t is calculated as [(Si,t – Si,t‐4) – ri,t]/σi,t where σi,t and ri,t are the standard deviation and average, respectively, of (Si,t – Si,t‐4) over the preceding
 eight quarters. The DA is discretionary accrual estimated using the modified Jones model, by estimating a cross‐section regression each quarter. Size is
 the natural logarithm of the market capitalization as of fiscal quarter‐t end. BE/ME is the natural logarithm of the book‐to‐market ratio as of the most
 recent fiscal year ending at least three month prior to fiscal quarter‐t end. PastReturn is the cumulative return in excess over the market from thirty to
 three days prior to the earnings announcement. Standard errors are clustered at firm level. Adjusted R2 are reported. The sample includes firm‐
 quarters of US retailers with fiscal quarter ending between March 2009 and July 2014.
