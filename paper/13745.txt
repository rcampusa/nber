                                            ABSTRACT

This paper discusses how the effects of taxes on economic behavior are important for revenue estimation,
for calculating efficiency effects, and for understanding short-term macroeconomoic consequences.
The primary focus is on taxes on labor income but some attention is given to taxes on income from
saving. Specific calculations illustrate the importance of behavioral responses for accurate calculation
of the revenue effects and deadweight losses of tax changes.

                                             Martin Feldstein*


         I am pleased to be part of this National Tax Journal forum celebrating the 100th

anniversary of the National Tax Association and grateful for the invitation to discuss the effects

of taxes on economic behavior, a subject that has been central in my research since my 1967

paper on the effects of tax rules on corporate dividends (Feldstein, 1967) . Over the years, my

tax research has focused primarily on the ways that taxes affect household behavior and on the

welfare implications of those changes. That will be the focus of this paper.

         The effect of taxes on economic behavior is important for three distinct reasons. First, the

behavioral response of taxpayers affects the revenue consequences of changes in tax rates and

tax rules. Second, the effects on economic efficiency or deadweight loss depend on taxpayers’

compensated behavioral responses, i.e. on the behavioral effects excluding pure income effects.

And, third, behavior is important for understanding the short-run macroeconomic consequences

of tax changes on aggregate demand and employment.

         I have long been an advocate of reforming the revenue estimation process to reflect

explicitly the impact of taxes on behavior and the implications of that behavior for tax revenue

(e.g., Feldstein, 1997). I am pleased therefore that in recent years the revenue estimators of the

Treasury and the Congress have been taking behavior into account more fully in their revenue

meeting of the National Tax Association at which the past recipients of the Daniel Holland
Award were asked to speak about an important aspect of their own research.

estimates, going beyond the traditional so-called “static estimates” that assume that taxes have

no effect on taxpayer behavior. But the very limited nature of the behavior that is taken into

account means that official analyses of tax rate increases still overstate the resulting revenue gain

while official analyses of tax rate reductions overstate the resulting revenue losses. These

revenue estimates therefore bias the political decision process to favor tax rate increases over tax

cuts. Although much can be done to improve these calculations, I am encouraged by the

willingness of the revenue estimators to improve their earlier methods and by their participation

in the annual meeting of the NBER group that focuses on these revenue estimation issues. I will

return later in this paper to the issue of improving the revenue estimates.

         Unfortunately, there is no reason to be pleased about the analysis in policy discussions

of the efficiency effects of tax changes. Explicit estimates of the welfare consequences of

proposed tax changes are completely absent in the Congressional and White House discussions

of tax policy. Although policy makers understand that higher taxes hurt the economy by

distorting behavior – reducing work effort, saving, and risk-taking – there is no attempt to

quantify these adverse effects or translate them into reductions in economic efficiency. My own

experience is that the concept of the deadweight loss of a tax increase, i.e., the amount that

individuals would have to be paid to make them as well off as they would be without the

proposed tax change, is much easier to teach in a classroom than to convey in a Congressional

hearing. And yet any sensible policy analysis of alternative tax structures should involve

comparing the revenue, deadweight loss, and distributional consequences of the alternative tax

options. Later in this paper I will illustrate this with an example from the current debate about

raising payroll tax revenue to fund future Social Security benefits. I will also comment on two

common conceptual errors that economists make in assessing the deadweight losses of tax

changes.

         The short-run macroeconomic consequences of tax changes depend on how the Federal

Reserve changes monetary policy in response to the tax change. If a tax change produces a fiscal

stimulus that exceeds what the Fed believes to be prudent, it will neutralize it by raising interest

rates. Alternatively, a fiscal stimulus may simply substitute for an easier monetary policy that

the Fed would otherwise implement. As a general rule, it would seem best to assume that a

change in fiscal stimulus would be offset by the induced change in monetary policy. One

exception would occur when interest rates are so low that the Fed cannot lower rates any further.

In such a liquidity trap, a fiscal stimulus would raise aggregate demand. A second exception

would occur when financial market conditions or the availability of bank capital make it

difficult for the Fed to stimulate economic activity. In this case, the Fed would welcome a fiscal

stimulus and would not seek to offset it. Because of these exceptions to the general rule, the

possible fiscal stimulus effect of a tax change must be considered on a case by basis to assess

the likely reaction of the Federal Reserve to the proposed change in tax rates or tax rules. Note

that this discussion of the cyclical effects of tax policies is very different from the longer-term

supply side effects of tax changes on GDP that cannot be offset or reversed by monetaray policy.




Revenue Estimation



         I turn now to the issue of revenue estimation, focusing on the effect of changes in tax

rates on labor income. It would of course be desirable to have a fully specified dynamic

microeconomic model that could trace out the revenue consequences through time of any

EffectsOfTaxes.NTJ.01082008.wpd                  -3-
proposed tax change, including the full general equilibrium effects. A variety of such models

have been studied by academic researchers (e.g., Golosov and Tsyvinsky, 2005) and by the staffs

of the Joint Tax Committee and the Treasury Department (e.g., Carroll et al) . In my judgement,

they are helpful in shaping our understanding of the complex economic interactions but are not a

suitable base for policy analysis now and will not be at any time in the foreseeable future. I will

therefore concentrate my comments on the more practical estimates that focus on the direct first-

order behavioral responses to tax changes.



         When studying a proposed tax change it would also be desirable to know what current or

future change in taxes or spending will be made to maintain an unchanged level of the national

debt. This would be easy if the purpose of the tax increase is to finance some particular

program, e.g., a revenue increase to fund increased Social Security benefits or to allow the

elimination of another tax like the alternative minimum tax. In general, however, major tax

changes are not earmarked in this way. In such cases, I think we should follow the same analytic

approach that was done by Richard Musgrave and others in their studies of tax incidence, i.e., to

assume a concurrent budget balance achieved by a lump sum change in taxes or spending

(Musgrave, 1957).

         In what follows I will focus first on the revenue and efficiency effects of changes in the

general tax rates on labor income. I will then comment briefly on the efficiency effects of taxing

the return to saving. I will not discuss the substantial amount of work that has been done on the

impact of capital gains taxes on the realization of capital gains and the resulting changes in

revenue (e.g., Feldstein and Yitzhaki, 1978). There has also been substantial work on the effect

of dividend tax rules on corporate payout rates. The results of this research on capital gains and

EffectsOfTaxes.NTJ.01082008.wpd                  -4-
dividends has been adopted by the official revenue estimators because it does not violate their

self-imposed rule that their estimates assume no change in GDP, a subject to which I return

below. There has, however, been no work on quantifying the efficiency effects of these taxes.

There is also relatively little work on the impact of taxes on the composition of individuals’

portfolios (Feldstein, 1976).




Taxes on Labor Income



          Labor economists have produced a large body of research estimating the effects of

wages on labor force participation and total working hours. Public finance economists have

contributed to this literature by focusing on net-of-tax wages and showing that individuals

respond to the tax component of the net-of-tax wage. But what matters for revenue estimation is

not the change in working hours but the change in labor supply more broadly defined – including

effort, occupation, human capital, etc. – and in the mix between taxable cash wages and untaxed

fringe benefits and nice working conditions. Although it is not possible to estimate each of these

two components separately, the public use files of individual tax returns that the Treasury makes

available to researchers does permit estimating their combined effect, i.e., how changes in tax

rates affect tax revenue through the combination of changes in labor supply and in the form of

compensation.



         Changes in tax rates also affect taxpayers’ behavior as consumers, altering the quantities

of tax-favored consumption (including owner-occupied housing, charitable contributions, and

EffectsOfTaxes.NTJ.01082008.wpd                  -5-
local property taxes). The overall revenue effect of a change in tax rates depends therefore on

the extent to which the tax base is reduced, including the effects on labor supply broadly defined,

on the form of compensation, and on the magnitude of tax deductions.

         Several studies have now used the Treasury’s public use files of individual tax returns to

estimate the elasticity of taxable income with respect to the net-of-tax rate (i.e., one minus the

marginal tax rate). My 1995 paper (Feldstein, 1995) used panel data that followed the same

individuals before and after the major tax rate reductions of the 1987 Tax Reform Act in which

the top tax rate fell from 50 percent to 28 percent. The difference in difference estimates based

on comparing incomes in 1985 and in 1988 implied a compensated elasticity of about one.

Subsequent work by others (e.g., Auten and Carroll, 1998 and Gruber and Saez,2002) using

different data sets and different estimating methods found a range of estimates from about 0.4 to

1.0 for middle and upper income taxpayers.



         There are of course disputes about the interpretation of this behavioral response. Gordon

and Slemrod (2000) have suggested that some of this reaction may reflect a shift between

corporate and personal income. In the opposite direction, it should be noted that this relatively

short-run response does not allow for the effect of the tax rate reduction on decisions about the

choice of occupation and the accumulation of human capital.



         A more fundamental issue in the estimation of behavioral response is that it assumes that

the taxpaying unit is the decision making unit even when there are two working adults in the

unit. This is of practical importance when the husband and wife face different marginal tax rates

as they do in the United States when one of them but not both of them is earning below the

EffectsOfTaxes.NTJ.01082008.wpd                  -6-
ceiling on Social Security taxable income.    Because of the ceiling on the payroll tax base, some

couples will have different marginal tax rates for the husband and wife. In a study of data on

Swedish households Alex Gelber (2007) has shown that there are important differences between

husbands and wives in their income and substitution elasticities and in cross-elasticities.

         My judgement, based on the existing studies, is that an elasticity of 0.5 for middle and

upper income taxpayers (who pay the overwhelming bulk of the taxes) is a reasonable estimate

and probably a conservative one. It is substantially higher than the response implicit in the

revenue estimates of the Treasury and the Joint Tax Committee. In presenting illustrative

calculations of tax proposals, such as the ones discussed below, I have generally been cautious

and assumed elasticities of 0.4 and 0.5.



         The official estimates used by the Treasury and the Joint Tax Committee are generally

depressed by the quite remarkable self-imposed restriction that the changes of behavior implied

by changes in tax rates do not result in any change in GDP. In their analysis, a change in tax

rates can change the form of compensation, can change the realization of capital gains, and can

shift portfolios between taxable and tax exempt securities but it cannot alter the supply of labor

or the level of real compensation. To the extent that any change is admitted that alters GDP,

some offsetting assumption is made to keep GDP unchanged.



         This “constant GDP” assumption eliminates the important effect of changes in labor

supply broadly defined, i.e., changes in labor force participation rates, in hours worked, in the

choice of jobs, in the degree of effort, etc.. Although the revenue estimators wish to allow for

changes in the form of compensation, the restriction that there be no change in GDP makes it

EffectsOfTaxes.NTJ.01082008.wpd                  -7-
impossible to use the tax return data to estimate the change in the form of compensation since

the observed changes in taxable incomes reflect both the change in total labor supply (i.e., in

potential labor income ) and in the extent to which the resulting change in potential income is

taken in the form of taxable cash. Since the changes in the form of compensation cannot be

observed or estimated separately, the revenue estimators are forced to make a judgement based

on their intuition, something very difficult for a civil servant whose working conditions and

degree of discretion in the form of compensation are quite different from those in many private

sector jobs.



         The rationale for the “constant GDP” assumption is that the projected level of GDP is

established by the administration or the Congressional Budget Office and must therefore be

taken as a fixed parameter by the revenue estimators. In my judgement, this makes no sense at

all. The GDP forecast can be taken as a baseline number on which the effects of proposed tax

changes can be superimposed. I wonder how many members of Congress realize that the

“revenue estimates” given by the Joint Tax Committee staff have made this arbitrary assumption

of constant GDP.



         Fortunately, the restricted nature of the estimated behavioral effects is beginning to

change and the official estimates of some proposed tax changes do attempt to use the

accumulating evidence on behavioral responses. It would be good to have more transparent

descriptions of these changes so that the economics profession could comment on the

assumptions and the resulting estimates.

Two Examples



         Before turning to other aspects of taxpayer behavior, I will illustrate the importance of

the behavioral response by looking at two examples. Consider first an across the board tax

increase in which every tax rate is raised by one percent: the 10 percent marginal tax rate goes

to 10.1 percent, the 25 percent to 25.25 percent, etc.. My NBER colleague, Dan Feenberg, used

the NBER’s TAXSIM model to estimate how taxpayer behavior alters the estimated revenue

effect of this tax change. The analysis, based on 100,000 random tax returns for 2001 adjusted to

income levels of 2004, calculates that with no behavioral response (i.e., the so-called “static”

estimate) tax revenue would rise by $7.5 billion.



         Using a very conservative compensated elasticity of tax revenue with respect to the net of

tax rate of 0.4 and an income elasticity of 0.15 (implying an uncompensated behavioral response

elasticity of less than 0.4) implied that the additional personal income tax revenue would be only

$5.0 billion or two-thirds of the “static” revenue estimate. The reduced taxable income would

also lower the payroll tax revenue by some $400 million, bringing the total additional revenue to

just $4.6 billion or 57 percent of the “static” revenue estimate.



         The effect of taxpayer behavior on revenue can be even more dramatic when the

proposed tax change is not simply proportional. A few years ago, I analyzed the proposal to

raise the maximum taxable income for the Social Security payroll tax by 25 percent, from

$87,900 to $110,000 (Feldstein, 2004) . For someone with initial income at the top of the new

range, i.e., of $110,000, the tax base would rise by $22,100 if there is no behavioral response. In

EffectsOfTaxes.NTJ.01082008.wpd                  -9-
that case, the tax revenue would rise by 12.4 percent (the payroll tax rate) of this increased tax

base or $2740. But with a behavioral elasticity of 0.5 with respect to the net of tax rate – a

reasonable assumption for these high income individuals – the taxpayer would reduce taxable

earnings (by working less and taking more income as a fringe benefit) to $102,000. This lowers

the extra payroll tax and, more importantly, also lowers the personal income tax revenue and the

Medicare payroll tax revenue. Calculations show that the reductions in the personal tax revenue

and in the Medicare payroll revenue would actually exceed the extra Social Security payroll tax

revenue. The total taxes paid by this high income individual would actually decline if the payroll

tax base were increased in this way.



         Extending this type of calculation to the entire population of taxpayers with incomes over

$87,900 , Feenberg and I found that the rise in the payroll tax revenue would be $19 billion a

year with no behavioral response but only $16 billion with the elasticity of 0.5. The lower tax

base shrinks the Medicare and Personal Income tax revenue by a total of $11 billion, bringing

the total revenue gain down to just $5 billion instead of the $19 billion “static” estimate,

implying that some two-thirds of the extra Social Security funds would come as the result of a

back door transfer from personal income taxes and Medicare taxes.



         Although these examples show the importance of taking behavioral responses into

account when calculating the revenue effects of major changes in tax rates, there are strong

advocates of continuing to use the current “static” revenue estimates. They make two

arguments. First, since the behavioral elasticity is only a rough estimate, it is inappropriate for

use in revenue estimation. Second, there are a very large number of detailed and complex tax

EffectsOfTaxes.NTJ.01082008.wpd                 -10-
proposals for which revenue estimates must be produced. There would never be enough time to

do the research on the needed behavioral elasticities for these many proposals. These arguments

carry particular force because of the legislative requirement that any projected increase in the

budget deficit (through a tax cut or spending increase) must be financed by a decrease in the

projected deficit (by a tax increase or spending cut.) In this context, revenue “scoring “ must be

“precise” and must apply to all proposals.



         Although there is much to recommend the marginal self-financing rule that Congress has

imposed on itself, it should not be an excuse for using grossly incorrect revenue estimates. As a

minimum, for proposals with large revenue implications (e.g, static revenue effects of more than

$10 billion a year), the members of Congress should see the revenue estimates based on

plausible behavioral assumptions as well as the traditional static analysis. The budget

committees should then have the option to replace the traditional static revenue estimate with the

more accurate (although imprecise) behavioral estimate.



Calculating Dead Weight Losses



         Efficiency calculations are central to the analysis that public finance economists bring to

tax policy. But introducing these ideas into the actual Congressional evaluation of tax policies

involves three separate challenges. First, the politically responsible officials and their staffs

must come to understand the basic idea of deadweight loss. Second, the nature of the distortion

that gives rise to the deadweight loss must be correctly identified. And, third, the relevant

parameters must be estimated.

EffectsOfTaxes.NTJ.01082008.wpd                  -11-
         In my experience, the concept of deadweight loss is difficult to explain because it does

not correspond to any observable number. Perhaps that is why the staff of the Joint Tax

Committee , even in its theoretical infinite horizon dynamic simulations, summarizes the

economic effects of alternative tax systems by the change in GDP rather than by an estimated

deadweight loss or gain. But a tax change could create deadweight losses even though it caused

GDP to rise (e.g., because of income effects or even because of incentives that lead to more

labor input than individuals would otherwise choose to supply). So economists have still not

gotten across the notion that taxes distort choices and that the revenue that the government

collects understates how much worse off an individual is because of a tax.

         Perhaps an example would help noneconomists to grasp the idea. Consider a law that

prevented people from buying apples. That law would not transfer money to the government

but individuals would consider themselves worse off than in the absence of such a law. The

amount that the government would have to give people to make them feel as well off as they

would have been without the law is its deadweight loss, i.e., the loss to the individuals in excess

of the revenue to the government. Now consider a less draconian law that merely reduces the

number of apples that anyone can buy. That implies a smaller deadweight loss. But what if,

instead of a law limiting the purchase of apples, the government levies a tax on apples that

reduces the number of apples that the individual chooses to buy? The individual would then be

worse off relative to no law for two reasons: he consumes fewer apples and he must pay a higher

price per apple (which goes to the government as tax revenue). The extent to which the

individual is worse off because of the tax can be divided into two parts – the revenue transferred

to the government and the deadweight loss due to the reduced consumption of apples.

Similarly, a tax that induces someone to work less not only transfers revenue to the government

EffectsOfTaxes.NTJ.01082008.wpd                 -12-
but also causes a distortion in the individual’s behavior (reduces the extent to which the

individual supplies labor and obtains money with which to buy goods and services) and therefore

a deadweight loss.



         More generally, the income tax causes a much broader set of distortions, reducing all

aspects of labor supply, causing a shift in the form of compensation, and inducing individuals to

substitute tax favored consumption (i.e., deductible expenditures ) for other types of

consumption. Fortunately, despite the multiple sources of deadweight loss, the total deadweight

loss can be calculated easily by focusing on the elasticity of taxable income with respect to the

net-of-tax rate. This simplification is appropriate because each of the three sources of distortion

is based on the same marginal tax rate: the individual buys “leisure” at one-minus the marginal

tax rate, he buys fringe benefits at this rate, and he buys tax deductible consumption at this rate.

The marginal deadweight loss is thus the same for any behavior that reduces the taxable income.

More technically, the three forms of behavior that reduce taxable income constitute a Hicksian

composite good and can therefore be treated as if they are one good for the purpose of welfare

analysis. (Feldstein, 1999)

         Using an estimated compensated elasticity of 0.4 and the usual formula based on the

square of the marginal tax rate for approximating the incremental deadweight loss implies that

the one percent across the board increase in all tax rates that yielded incremental revenue of $4.6

billion would result in a deadweight loss of $3.5 billion. The deadweight loss is thus 76 percent

of the incremental revenue. This means that the total cost of an additional billion dollars of

government spending financed by an across the board increase in tax rates is $1.76 billion.

Similarly, cutting government spending by a billion dollars and passing the funds back in the

EffectsOfTaxes.NTJ.01082008.wpd                 -13-
form of an across the board proportional tax cut would raise taxpayers real incomes – including

the reduced deadweight losses – by $1.76 billion. Wouldn’t the Congressional process of

setting tax rates and authorizing government spending be improved if this were better

understood?



         The implications of this analysis is even more striking when applied to a possible non-

proportional change in the payroll tax. Recall that the proposal to raise the maximum income

subject to the Social Security payroll tax from $87,900 to $110,000 would result in net revenue

of $5 billion when the behavioral response is taken into account. The deadweight loss calculation

in this case implies an increased deadweight loss of $9 billion. The total cost of the $5 billion of

additional revenue is thus $14 billion, nearly three times as much as the revenue itself. It is

useful to contrast this with the implications of the static revenue analysis that implies additional

revenue of $19 billion and that ignores the deadweight loss.



         An alternative way to raise payroll tax revenue by $5 billion would be to raise the payroll

tax rate instead of increasing the ceiling on the taxable payroll. With a payroll tax base of

approximately $5 trillion, the required increase in the tax rate is only 0.1 percent. The overall

marginal tax rate - including personal income tax, state income tax and payroll taxes - would rise

from about 45 percent to 45.1 percent, depending on the individual’s particular situation. The

resulting deadweight loss would be only about $1.6 billion, less than one-fifth of the deadweight

loss that would result from increasing the ceiling on taxable payroll. I believe the political

process should consider these two ways of raising the $5 billion, noting the difference in the

distribution of the increased tax burden and the difference in the deadweight losses.

EffectsOfTaxes.NTJ.01082008.wpd                 -14-
Taxes on Investment Income



         I turn briefly now to the taxation of investment income. Tax rules affect many types of

behavior that influence investment income: the volume of saving, the allocation of that saving

among alternative investments, the realization of capital gains, etc.. I will focus on just one of

these: the effect of taxes on household saving.

         I want to make a single important point about the deadweight loss associated with taxing

the return to saving . For a discussion of how taxes on the return to saving interacts with taxes

on labor income, see Feldstein (2006)

         A common fallacy in discussing taxes on the return to saving is to note that the elasticity

of saving with respect to the net-of-tax interest rate is very low and to conclude from that

observation that taxing the return to saving has very little adverse efficiency effect (Feldstein,

1978). Even if one accepts the premise that the elasticity of saving with respect to the net-of-tax

interest rate is very low, the conclusion about the deadweight loss does not follow.



         Why? Because the deadweight loss in this case depends not on the change in the level of

saving but on the distortion in the timing of consumption. It is consumption that matters for this

because it is consumption that enters the individual’s utility function. Even if saving is not

changed at all in response to a higher rate of tax on investment income, the level of future

consumption can fall substantially. It is that fall in future consumption that is the source of the

deadweight loss.



EffectsOfTaxes.NTJ.01082008.wpd                  -15-
         An analogy may help to clarify this point. Consider a simple excise tax on the

consumption of apples. If the pretax price of apples remains constant, an individual with a unit

elasticity of demand for apples will consume fewer apples but spend the same total amount on

the purchase of apples. It is clear in this case that the deadweight loss depends on the change in

the number of apples consumed and not on the unchanged spending on apples. By analogy,

saving is the “expenditure” today to purchase future consumption. The welfare loss depends on

the change in that future consumption and not on the spending today to purchase that future

consumption.



Future Research



         I will conclude by pointing to some fruitful directions for future research in the study of

taxpayer behavior.

         First, it would be good to reduce the uncertainty about the effect of the net-of-tax rate on

taxable labor income. New research should distinguish the response by different income levels,

marital status, and age/sex groups. More panel data from the Treasury would be enormously

helpful in this research. The separate payroll and income taxes should be used to distinguish the

own and cross elasticities of husbands and wives.



         Second, we need better estimates of the income effect of changes in tax rates. These are

needed to calculate the revenue effect of tax changes.



         Third, we need to develop a better analysis of the welfare effects of different aspects of

EffectsOfTaxes.NTJ.01082008.wpd                  -16-
capital taxation, particularly the effect of changes in dividends and in capital gains and in

outright tax evasion.



         And finally we need to develop better ways of incorporating this research into the
