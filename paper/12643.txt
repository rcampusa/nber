                                             ABSTRACT

Broad claims are frequently made that new medications will offset all or part of their costs by reducing
other areas of Medicaid spending. In this paper we examine the net impact on spending for new drugs
used to treat schizophrenia. We extend research in this area by taking a new approach to identification
of spending impacts of new drugs. We specify and estimate models of spending on treatment of schizophrenia
using 7 years of Florida Medicaid data. The estimates indicate that use of the new drugs result in net
spending increases. This may be due to increased adherence to treatment.

    Introduction

    Most researchers, while recognizing the benefits of medical innovations, regard

adoption of new technologies as the primary determinant of increasing health care costs

(Cutler 2002). At the same time, promoters of new medical technologies – a drug, device

or other treatment -- often claim that the innovation will offset all or part of its costs by

reducing other areas of medical spending. Drugs and devices are vetted by regulators for

advances in effectiveness. If the innovation also reduces cost, it obviously satisfies any

criterion for cost-effectiveness and the innovation merits immediate adoption. Broad

claims about cost offsets have recently been made with respect to innovations in

prescription drugs. Lichtenberg (2001) concludes that overall, new drugs more than pay

for themselves in the form of reduced medical spending elsewhere. If such findings

survive scrutiny they cast a very different light on the cost of medical innovation,

implying it may reduce, not increase health care costs.     In this paper, we focus on a

clinical area where cost offsets from a new drug are plausible, treatment for

schizophrenia. We test for the link between introduction of new drugs to treat

schizophrenia and total costs of treating the disease.

    Schizophrenia is a chronic and relapsing illness. It is very expensive to treat and

episodes of inpatient care are common. Older anti-psychotic drugs are effective in control

of symptoms but produce side effects, such as tardive dyskensia, that are uncomfortable,

impairing and stigmatizing. Low adherence inhibited effective treatment regimens

(Lehman, 1999, USDHHS, 1999). The new generation of anti-psychotic medications,

referred to as atypical anti-psychotic drugs, are also effective in treating symptoms and

generally regarded as better tolerated, although they do have side effects of their own




                                                                                                2
(weight gain and diabetes). The offset hypothesis in this clinical area is that the greater

tolerability of the new anti-psychotics will improve adherence to treatment regimens and

thereby reduce relapses, which in turn will result in declines in the use of hospital and

emergence room services.

   To test for this effect, we use data on a sample of people with schizophrenia enrolled

in Florida’s Medicaid program. We make use of the timing of FDA approval for three

atypical antipsychotic agents (Olanzapine, Serquel and Geodon) along with geographic

variation in take-up of these new agents to identify the effect of the use of atypical

antipsychotic on total mental health spending for people with schizophrenia. Our

findings confirm results found in another context by Duggan (2005): the evidence does

not support the presence of a cost offset.

   The paper is organized into four additional sections. In section I we provide some

background on treatment of schizophrenia and clinical research on office effects

stemming from use of new drugs. Section II sets out our approach to modeling the cost

offset using Medicaid data. Section III reports results form several empirical models.

The final section discusses some implications and conclusions drawn from the results.

   Background

   Schizophrenia is severe, persistent and disabling. Most people with schizophrenia

qualify for public disability program such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and

Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) making Medicaid the largest single purchaser

of anti-psychotic drugs in the nation (accounting for about 75% of all sales (Frank, Conti

and Goldman, 2005). Schizophrenia is also very expensive to treat. In 2001, Florida

Medicaid spent an average of approximately $9600 per year for the mental health care of




                                                                                              3
Medicaid enrollees with schizophrenia. Approximately 30% of Medicaid enrollees with

schizophrenia are hospitalized each year and 13% have two or more hospital admissions

each year. The average payment by Medicaid for an inpatient stay for schizophrenia is

about $4,700. Hospitalization can occur if patients stop taking their medications and

their symptoms worsen (US DHHS, 1999, p 282). If the atypical drugs lead to higher

levels of treatment adherence, hospitalizations and emergency room visits that occur in

connection to acute flare ups of symptoms might be reduced.

   Clozapine, introduced in 1990, was the first atypical anti-psychotic drug, followed by

Risperidone in 1994, Olanzapine in 1996 and Seroquel in 1997. Clozapine poses the risk

of agranularcytosis, a life threatening condition that affects white blood cell levels.

Clozapine users must be monitored very closely, making administration of the drug

costly and cumbersome, and limiting the use of this drug.

   A number of studies in the clinical literature have examined the offset hypothesis for

the atypical anti-psychotic drugs, with inconsistent methods and findings. We discuss

several key papers here (see Busch et al 2006, for a review of this literature). Schiller,

Shumway and Hargreaves (1999) compared 56 schizophrenic patients treated with

Risperidone to a matched group of 56 patients treated with conventional antipsychotic

medication (eg. haloperidol) and followed them for 12 months. The study also collected

data on the 12 months prior to the initiation of Risperidone for both groups. There was

no significant difference in spending between people taking Risperidone and those taking

conventional antipsychotic drugs except for the prescription drug category, which was

higher for the Risperidone group. Schiller et al (1999) compared expenses for

Risperidone and conventional drug users for the experimental year. It is possible, using




                                                                                             4
the per-year data reported in the paper, to conduct a crude differences-in-differences

estimate for total mental health spending and inpatient spending. These estimates would

lead to different results if the baseline spending of the experimental and control were

different. In fact, in the “before” period the Risperidone group spent about twice as much

on average as the control population ($8,800 vs. $4,450). The results obtained from the

difference in difference calculations are somewhat different from those reported in the

paper. Total spending attributable to the new drug was $1051 higher compared to the

cross section estimate of $370. Inpatient spending attributable to the new drug was $-

1571 compared to $129 reported in the paper. Nevertheless, there was no overall offset

observed in either case.

   Nightengale and colleagues (1998) used medical records and administrative data to

study the experience of a matched cohort of schizophrenic patients that were taking one

older anti-psychotic medication (Haloperidol) or a newer atypical agent (Risperidone).

The study compared the two groups for 17-months with a covariance model to estimate

the spending differences attributable to the use of the newer anti-psychotic agent.

Statistically significant inpatient offsets of $424 were found for Risperidone, but overall

savings of (including the higher costs of the newer medication) $123 were not

significantly different from zero.

   Duggan (2005) used nine years of Medicaid claims data from California to study the

experience of people with schizophrenia. He used three approaches to identify estimates

of the impact of atypical antipsychotic medication on total spending. First, he used

discontinuities in the use of atypical antipsychotic medications during the 1990s to

examine changes in spending patterns for people treated for schizophrenia. The second




                                                                                              5
approach used differential rates of diffusion in the use of atypical antipsychotic

medications across geographic areas (zipcodes) to examine differential spending changes

for treatment of schizophrenia. A third approach made use of differential rates of

prescribing atypical antipsychotics across psychiatrists (after controlling for patient mix)

as an instrument to examine spending patterns for patients treated with the newer

antipsychotic medications. For all methods, Duggan estimated a positive and significant

impact of the new drugs on spending for the treatment of schizophrenia, thereby rejecting

the net offset hypothesis.

   In this paper we extend the literature by taking a different approach to identifying the

“offset effect” and by using data from another large state with different local mental

health delivery arrangements.

   Modeling Cost Offsets

   If a new more effective treatment technology is introduced into practice, it may

substitute for other treatment inputs (e.g. antidepressants may substitute for

psychotherapy achieving comparable or superior outcomes) or the new treatment may

contribute to improved health to such a degree that the use of downstream health services

might be prevented (e.g. hospitalizations). Both of these mechanisms might produce cost

offsets for a new treatment. Of course new treatment may be effective and worthwhile

without any offset. If a new treatment is complementary to other health care inputs, the

new treatment would both increase cost and improve outcome.

   We build on Duggan’s approach and use Medicaid data from two urban communities

(Jacksonville and Orlando) Florida for the years 1994-2001 and estimate models of

person – year mental health care spending for individuals with schizophrenia enrolled in




                                                                                               6
Florida’s Medicaid program. We regard treatment with an atypical antipsychotic drug as

endogeneous to spending. That is, we recognize that factors that we do not measure (e.g.

illness severity) likely affect both the choice of drug to be prescribed and the level of

mental health spending. We use an instrumental variables approach to estimating the

effect of atypical antipsychotics. Like Duggan, we use differences across geographic

areas to help identify the impact of the new medications on spending levels. However, we

also use a set of clearly exogenous shocks to drug availability, the timing of FDA

approval of specific agents for marketing. We interact time related shocks with

geography to help in identification. We estimate offset effects for both the class of

atypical antipsychotic agents as well as for individual agents that were introduced into the

market between July 1994 and July 2001.

   A.          Identification:

   The U.S. health care system has long been characterized by clear but hard to explain

variation in clinical practice across geographic areas (Wennberg and Gittleson, 1973).

Physician practice patterns lie behind the geographic irregularities and one recent paper

(Perry 2006) uses treating physicians as an instrument for whether a mother is likely to be

treated for depression.   Variations in diffusion of new health technologies have

frequently been shown to be driven in important respects by factors that are not directly

related to total spending on treatment. Recent research on diffusion of prescription drugs

shows that prescribing patterns are explained by local conditions not associated with the

severity of patient illnesses across regions (Coscelli and Shum 2004; Block and Kollinger

2006). This suggests that the interaction of an indicator of the launch of a new product

and a geographic region would capture exogenous differences in response to new product




                                                                                            7
introductions. We choose two areas of Florida that are geographically separate, have

similar mental health supply conditions and similar trends in the use of new antipsychotic

drugs during the initial introduction of the new agents 1994-1997. The diffusion paths for

atypical antipsychotic agents (Seroquel and Geodon) differ starting in 1997. We make

use of this variation to identify the impact of the new drugs on total mental health care

spending.

       During the period from July 1994 to July 2001 there were three new drugs

(Olanzapine, Seroquel and Geodon) approved by the FDA. The decision by the FDA is

clearly independent of mental health spending levels in geographic regions of Florida.

This time-related variation is one of our instruments. In sum, our instruments measure

the time of introduction of specific new products and the interaction of approval timing

with the geographic area.

       We measure the supply shocks from FDA decisions in two ways. In the first

approach, we specify a set of dummy variables that take a value of one if a specific drug

was approved for sale during a fiscal year and zero otherwise (three indicators during the

observed time period). The second approach specifies a count of the number of agents in

the class available for sale in each year. The interaction of these variables with an

indicator for geographic region are additional instruments in the model. Figure 1 shows

the differential rates of take-up of the new drug class across the two geographic regions.

Note that the lines clearly separate beginning in the latter half of 1997, after the third

drug in the class (Seroquel) was launched.

       In the models reported below we use both sets of specifications of the

instrumental variables. We test the power of the instruments (Staiger and Stock 1999) and




                                                                                             8
examine the effect of the instruments by comparing the estimated coefficients from an

ordinary least squares model to the instrumental variables estimates.

    B.           Data:

    Schizophrenia is defined by ICD-9 codes in diagnostic category 295. A person is

regarded as having schizophrenia and is included in the data if there are claims for two 2

face-to-face outpatient visits with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or one inpatient admission

with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia. The unit of analysis is the person fiscal year

over a span of 7 years (1994-1995 through 2000-01). Inclusion required enrollment in

Florida Medicaid for at least 10 months in a fiscal year. The resulting sample consisted of

between 1764 and 2103 people per year. The analysis file used for estimation consisted

of 13, 449 person-years of data.

    Enrollment files report basic demographic information such as age, gender,

race/ethnicity and reason for eligibility (e.g. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families

(TANF) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI)). Claims were used to identify diagnoses

(schizophrenia and co-morbid substance abuse), mental health care spending levels, and

type of psychotropic drugs being used. Spending was calculated by summing all the

payments made for services with a mental health diagnosis, a mental health procedure

(e.g. psychotherapy) or a psychotropic drug that is primarily used for mental health

treatment (antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers).1 Table 1 reports

descriptive statistics for the sample used in the analysis.

                                                                                                         9
    C. Estimation

    The instrumental variables model consists of two equations.2 The first-stage equation

explains whether or not a Medicaid patient with schizophrenia was treated with an

atypical antipsychotic drug, a qualitative outcome.3 In the second stage we estimate an

equation for per year spending on all mental health care by a Medicaid patient with

schizophrenia. Most but not all people in the data appear in multiple years.

    The key outcome in this analysis is the level of mental health spending. Since mental

health spending is skewed right we use a logarithmic transformation to achieve

approximate normality. This transformation implies that the response to the introduction

of new technology is proportional to spending not a constant amount independent of

spending level, a plausible specification in this context.

    We use a dichotomous indicator to measure whether someone was treated with an

atypical antipsychotic drug, an endogenous regressor. The instrumental variables model

can be specified as either as a structural shift (Heckman, 1976) or as a latent index (Lee,

1982). The structural shift approach, our choice, implies that changes in the underlying

propensity to use atypical antipsychotic agents have no impact on spending unless the

change moves the patient above a threshold where they actually fill a prescription and

take the drug. The latent index model, in contrast, assumes that an incremental change in

the latent index will continuously effect spending levels on treatment of schizophrenia.

Since one either takes or does not take a particular type of antipsychotic drug the

structural shift approach was more natural. The method of moments estimator is used to

  We also conduct sensitivity analysis where we estimate a model with three endogenous indicators, one for
each atypical antipsychotic drug that entered the market between 1994 and 2001.

  Some have suggested using class of antipsychotic agent and appropriate level of dosing (Lehman, 1999).
We investigated this and found that the levels of dosing for both the newer and older drugs were similar at
about 70% and constant overtime. Thus there was little informative variance in dosing levels.


                                                                                                        10
implement the structural shift IV model.4 We account for repeated measures using

White’s correction.

    The exogenous right hand side variables used in the model are listed in Table 1. As

noted above we use two sets of instruments. In one model we specify dummy variables

for each of the three atypical antipsychotic agents that were approved by the FDA for

marketing during the study period and their interaction with the geographical area

indicator (six instruments). The second model included a count of the number of atypical

antipsychotic drugs on the market and the interaction of that variable with the geographic

region (two instruments).

    Results

     Figure 2 shows mental health spending per person year for the sample of people with

schizophrenia in the Orlando and Jacksonville regions for 1994-1995 through 2000-01.

The Orlando region had both a higher take up rate of atypical antipsychotic drugs (figure

1) and greater growth in mental health spending than the Jacksonville region (figure 2).

    A. First Stage Results and Implications for Diffusion

    Table 2 presents the first stage estimates for the structural shift model. There are

several notable findings regarding patterns of diffusion for atypical anti-psychotic drugs.

Blacks are about 12.2% less likely to receive an atypical anti-psychotic drug than whites.

This is particularly important since blacks have been found to be more susceptible to side

effects from conventional anti-psychotic drugs than area whites (Glazer Morgenstern and

Doucette 1994). Thus one would expect that based on clinical criteria alone rates of use

of atypical anti-psychotics would be higher for blacks (USDHHS, 1999). Schizophrenic

identical results.


                                                                                                   11
patients with co-occurring substance abuse conditions are more likely to be treated with

an atypical anti-psychotic medication. Prescribing drugs with fewer neurological side

effects may be viewed as strategy for bolstering adherence for this group with low

adherence rates. As the number of atypical anti-psychotic drugs approved for marketing

increases by one drug the overall impact is to increase sales of the class of drugs by about

3.2% (p<0.05 joint t test). Most of the effect of drug entry occurs through the increased

levels of use in Orlando. Finally, the baseline rate of growth for the class of atypical anti-

psychotic agents was about 7.1% per year during the late 1990s.

   B. Simple Regression Results

   Column 1 in Table 3 reports results from a least squares regression of the log of

mental health spending assuming that use of an atypical antipsychotic agent is

exogenous. These results are a baseline against which the instrumental variables results

can be assessed. The model represents a reasonably good fit to the data as evidenced by

the R2 of 0.15. The main coefficient of interest is the indicator of use of an atypical

antipsychotic agent (apsy-at). Holding constant other variables in the model, Medicaid

patients with schizophrenia that are treated with the atypical antipsychotic agents incur

mental health spending levels that are significantly higher than otherwise similar

schizophrenic patients. Our OLS estimate implies that the spending impact of the new

atypicals on total spending on care for schizophrenia when evaluated at the mean of

spending was about $5410 which is very close to the estimate of $5244 reported by

Duggan (2005). The average difference between annual spending on atypical versus

traditional agents in Florida Medicaid was between $1200 and $1500. Hence the net

impact of the new agents from the OLS results was about $4,000.




                                                                                            12
   C. Instrumental Variables Results

   The second and third columns of Table 3 report results from instrumental variables

models using the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. The second column

results are based on a model where the instruments are the count of different atypical

antipsychotic agents approved by the FDA for sale and the interaction of that count with

the geographic region indicator (Orlando). In this model the coefficient estimate for being

treated with an atypical antipsychotic agent (apsy-at) is positive and significantly

different from zero at conventional levels (p<0.05). The magnitude of the estimate is

larger than in the simple regression reported in column 1 of Table 3, although the

difference between the two estimates is not significant. Other estimates in the model are

consistent with prior research. Blacks and other racial and ethnic minorities with

schizophrenia incur lower levels of spending for mental health care than do whites (20%).

People with schizophrenia who are also treated for substance abuse problems incur

mental health care spending levels that are roughly 56% more than otherwise similar

people who do not get treated for substance abuse problems. Finally, Medicaid spent

about 24% less on people with schizophrenia in the Orlando area compared to those in

Jacksonville. The F test (25.83) indicates our instruments are not “weak” according to the

criterion of Staiger and Stock (1997).

   The third column of Table 3 reports GMM estimates using instruments that include

indicators of entry by the individual atypical antipsychotic agents and the interaction of

those indicators with the geographic region (6 instruments). The impact of the use of

atypical antipsychotic agents was estimated to be positive but the estimate was imprecise.

The coefficient estimate of 0.63 is neither significantly different from zero at




                                                                                             13
conventional levels nor different from either the OLS or the other GMM estimate

reported in column 2. By and large the other coefficient estimates are robust to the

differences in the first stage specification.

    The magnitude of the estimates evaluated at the mean level of spending suggest gross

increases in spending of between $5413 and $11256. Subtracting the high estimate of the

difference in payments for new drugs of $1500 yield net increases in spending of $3010

and $9756. The F test for the instruments was 10.23, just above Staiger Stock value for

the test for weak instruments.

    D. Sensitivity Analysis

    We also examined an instrumental variables model where we specified three

endogenous regressors in our mental health spending models. In this model whether or

not a schizophrenic patient used a specific atypical antipsychotic agent (Olanzapine,

Seroquel, Geodon) were the endogenous indicators of use of new drugs. The instruments

were the indicators of individual product approval for sales and the interaction of those

indicators with geographic region. Table 4 reports the estimated coefficients and the test

for weak instruments. Only the use of Seroquel in the Instrumental Variables models had

an estimated impact that was significantly different from zero, and the estimated effect on

spending of using the new drug was positive. Use of the other two drugs had no

significant effect on spending. The F-tests suggest that the instruments used were not

weak.

    We also considered models within a geographic area (Orlando and Jacksonville)

where we allowed for a differential rate take up of new psychotropic medications by

racial groups. Blacks have lower take up rates after accounting for other factors. We




                                                                                            14
specified a model in the second stage (mental health spending) including an interaction

was included between the indicator for being an African American and the endogenous

were always positive however some were significantly different from zero and others

not.5

    II.      Implications and Conclusions

    Writing in 1999, the Surgeon General of the United States noted that atypical

antipsychotic agents offer some important therapeutic advantages over their older

counterparts. He stated, “The newer medications…appear in preliminary studies to be

more effective against negative symptoms, display fewer side effects, and show promise

for treating people for whom the older medications were ineffective” (USDHHS, 1999).

It was also the hope of many that these advantages would result in greater adherence to

treatment regimens and the ability to effectively treat a larger segment of the population

of people with schizophrenia. Because people with schizophrenia carry a high risk of

hospitalization it has been hypothesized that the therapeutic advantages would result in

decreased use of inpatient care and lower total spending levels on treatment. A finding

that the newer medications offset their own costs would imply that they represented a

cost effective innovation.

    The empirical evidence offered in this paper does not support the existence of a cost

offset for the introduction of atypical antipsychotic agents, including the one with the

largest market share today, Olanzapine. Recent clinical research shows that the newer

drugs produce some troubling side effects of their own that differ from those of the older

 We also examine the inclusion of a quadratic time trend in a specifications. The linear term was always
negative and the positive offset estimate was obtained in all cases.


                                                                                                       15
drugs, namely weight gain and the risk of diabetes. Thus there are no easy answers

concerning whether the atypical antipsychotic agents are globally superior to

conventional drugs in the area. Our results offer some evidence that informs the debate

over how carefully the use of new antipsychotic agents should be scrutinized with respect

to their efficiency. One finding is that the take up of atypical antispychotic drugs has

been quite rapid reaching 70% in 6 years. The empirical analysis conducted implies an

annual growth rate in use of the newer drugs of 7.3%. We also show that the take up of

the new drugs varies by race, clinical circumstances and geography. Particularly

troubling is the lower rate of take up for blacks who may benefit from the specific side

effect profiles offered by the new drugs. A second finding is our failure to find any

evidence of a cost offset for the new generation of antipsychotic medications. The

evidence is consistent with the previous work by Duggan (2005) that used data from a

different state and a different approach to identification.

       The higher levels of spending for patients treated with the newer atypical

antipsychotic medications appear to be explained by higher levels of contact with

treatment providers among patients using the newer drugs, possibly die to great

adherence to treatment plans. For example, patients treated with the newer drugs made

35% to 45% more visits per year for treatment that did those using the older medications

(10.3 vs. 13.9 visits in 1996 and 9 vs. 6.2 visits in 2000). The 13.9 and 9 visits are closer

to recommended levels of care (Lehman 1999).

       Answers about what drugs are most efficiently prescribed for treatment of

schizophrenia are not simple, and require a consideration of what constitutes an efficient

match with respect to preferences for different patterns of side effects. Patient response to

regimens needs considerably more investigation.
