                  The Wage-Productivity Hypothesis:
   It's Economic Consequences and Policy Implications for L.D.C..s



                               ABSTRACT



    This paper explores the implications for less developed countries o
the hypothesis that workers' productivity depends on the wages they
receive. In particular, we show that this hypothesis may explain the
high urban wages and unemployment found in many such countries.
    The market equilibrium is shown not to be pareto efficient. If the
government could not control urbaxv'rural migration, but could control
wages and urban employment, it would, in general, set wages and
employment levels differently. The sources of Inefficiency are
identified. The (constrained) pareto optimal policy can be implemented
via taxes and subsidies; but two instruments (both specific and ad
valorern wage tax/subsidies) are required.
    More generally, policy changes will affect both the urban wage and
the level of unemployment, and these consequences need to be taken into
accounce, both In the determination of shadow wages to be used In co3t
benefit analysis and In the analysisis of the incidence of any set of
taxes and subsIdIes. The shadow price of labor may differ markedly from
what it would be if wages were arbitrarily fixed and there were no
migration. In particular, in the special case of the HarrisTodaro
migration model, with fixed rural wages and productivity depending only
on the absolute wage received, the shadow wage is the market wage,
regardless of the relative evaluation of current and future consumption.
Shadow prices under other specifications of the wage'productlvlty
relationship are analyzed.

    Under a variety of circumstances, the wage which a firm pays has an

important effect on the productivity of its labor force. This simple

observation has profon Implications on the nature of market

equllibriim. It implies, for instance, that there may be competitive

equilibria In which demand doe3 not equal supply: wages may not be cut,

even in the face of an excess supply of labor, for to do so mIght lower

the productivity of the labor force more than proportionately to the

reduction in the wage, and hence labor costs would rise. The law of

supply and denand is repealed! It also implies that, since the wage

productivity relationship may differ for different jobs, equilibrium may

be characterized by (ex ante) Identical workers receiving different

wages. Indeed, even with identical firms, equilibrium may be

characterized by a wage   distribution   with tne higher wages paid by some

firms being exactly offset by   the   higher productivity.    f   the   ware

productivity curves characterizing different groups differ, there may be

high rates of unemployment In some groups while other groups are fully

employed. Moreover, reductions in the demand for labor (associated,

say, with business cycles) may have their Impact concentrated on

particular groups, those for whom the (maximal) ratio of proctlvIty to

wage Is lowest. Cyclical reductions in demand may be accompanied by

layoffs rather than work sharing (as predicted by most of the standard

Implied contract theory).

    This paper Is particularly concerned with explorinc some of the

policy implications in the context of' L.D.C.'s, e.g. for wage sus1die

and shadow pricing. The fact that the wage is endogenously determ inec,

rather than arbitrarily given, has, we believe, some important

consequences which may be fundamentally different from those in which,

say, the urban wage is arbitrarily set at a level above that which would

clear the market. Such models provide no Insight Into what will happen

when the government changes some policy. In particular, they provide no

insight into the circumstances in which such changes will lead to

changes in the urban wage. A central thesis of this risearch is that

policy changes will affect the urban wage, and thus affect the level of'

unemployment; and that these consequences need to be taken into account,

for instance, both in the determination of shadow wages to be used in

cost benefit analysis and in   the   analysis of the full incidence of' any

st of taxes and subsidies.

   We show that the presence of unemployment of wages in excess of the
mar<et clearing level does not, in itself, indicate that tne economy is

inefficient. In a planned economy, wages too might well be in excess of

the market clearing level. On the other hand, In the class of models

with which we are concerned here, there Is no presumption that the

competitive equilibrium Is efficient; and in particular, that the level

of i.employment which emerges In the maret equilibrium •* what

macrofteconomists might be tempted to refer to as the natural level of

unemployment    has any optimality properties.

    This paper is divided into five sections. In section I, we revie.

the basic arguments for why wages affect productivity; section II

discusses the implications of the dependence of productivity on wages

for marks €quillbrIurn. Section III assesses the efficiency of the

market equilibrium. The presence of unemployment, of wages In exceos of

the market clearing level, does not, in itself, Indicate that the

economy Is Inefficient. In a planned economy, wages too m1t well be

in excess of the market clearing level. We show, however, that there Is

no presumption that the competitive equilibrium is efficient; and In

particular, that the level of une:nployment which emerges in the market

equilibrium, what macroseconornists might be tempted to refer to as the

natural level of unemployment, has any optimality properties. Section

IV then explores the policy implications, focusing in particular on the

implications for tax policy and cost benefit analysis. Section V

presents some concluding remarks.



I. Why do Wages Affect Productivity.

   There are a large number of reasons that a firm may expect that an

Increase in the wage it pays may have a positive effect on the
productivity of its labor force.

    (a) The efficiency wage hypothesis. Tnis is the oldest explanation

provided within the development literature (see e.g. Leibenstein).2

hen workers are close to the subsistance level, then increases in their

nutritiomal level and         health   care will lead to an increase In their

productivity.3 An Increase In wages is generally believed to result In

an Increase In nutrition and hence in productivity. The relationship

between the paid by         the   Ith firm, wage, w1 and the productivity of its
labor   force,   'j,   is   conventionally depicted as in figure 1, wIth an

Initial region in which increases In wages lead to more than

proportionate increases In productivity. We write




            A11(w1), A'>O, A1"(w1)<> 0 as w1 <>          w                 (1)

The curve Sho.4s that for low wages, Increases in wages have a marked

(and an Increasing) effect on productivity; at high wages, however,

diminishing returns sets In: though Increases In wages continue to

increase productivity somewhat, the increment in productivity from each

successive increase in wage becomes smaller and smaller. The shape of

the curve is Important for many of the results obtained below.

    If the urban worker Is sharing his wage with family members in the

rural sector who receive a wage of Wr, then the productivity of an urban

worker will depend not only on the firm's wage, Wj; but also on the

rural wage w
             r



2Some of the analytic implications have been explored by Mirrlees
(1975).  Stiglitz(1976), and Dasgupta and   [19814a, 19514b].

3Recently Bliss and Stern have examined the empirical validity of this
hypothesis.

 Moreover, the magnitude of the increase in productivity from a iven

 change In wages will he smaller than It would be if they did not share.

 As a consequence, firms may attempt to provide meals and health care to

their workers, to ensure that a larger proportion of the wage Is sent

on productivity enhancing expenditures. They may also subsidize other

prduct1vIty enhancing expenditures, e.g. through a company store.

Trius, (2)   can be generalized to A
                                        1(w1w    p)   where p Is the price
vector. Firms may also hire members of the same family, to reduce the

dissipation of the benefits of high wages from sharing. If the worker

Is sharin his income with family members who are unemployed or whc        are
employed elsewhere in the urban sector, then productivity may he

positively   related to the amount of wages paid by other firms, w,'

negatively related to the unemployment rate.

    An   alternative   explanation of the dependence of A on the

unemployment rate is that individuals go Into debt during job search;

they must repay these debts after obtaining employment, thus reducing

the funds available for consumption.

    In the limiting case where the interest rate is zero arid where

Individuals engage In rent seeking activity to the point where the

lifetime consumption of the individual who obtain the high wage jobs is



   is the vector of' wage3 paid by other firms. Since we focus on
symmetric equilibria, all components of w are identical.
the same as those wno remain in low wage jobs (and do not search), them

an increase in the wage increases expenditures on job search, Lt does

not increase labor productivity.5 3ut this is an extreme case. If

there is a positive interest rate, then even if lifetime expected

utilities are equalized by rent seeking expenditures, consumption during

periods of employment will be higher in high wage firms. Moreover, to

the extent that this is an important problem, firms 1ll he induced to

recruit workers In ways which ameliorate these effects.

     (b) Labor turnover. A second Important way that workers' behavior

affects the productivity of firms Is through labor turnover.6 In most

jobs, there are costs of hiring and training which are specific to the

firm. So long as individuals do not pay these full costs at the moment

they are hired (recouping them later In the form of higher wages', them

the greater the quit rate, the greater the firm's expenditures om

training and hiring costs. Increasing the wage rate will, in general,

l•ad to a reduction In the quit rate, and hence to an increase in the

profits of the firm.

    The retention rate r (which equals one minus the quit rate and

hence the turnover costs, depend on the relationship between the given

firm's wage and all other wages in the economy. Lower wage individuals

have a higher probability of finding a job at a higher wage, and thus of



Assuming, that is, that productivity depends on 1ifet1me consumption,
or, if it depends on current consumption, at a zero interest rate
individual smooth their con.gumption evenly throughout their life.

61n the context of developed countries, this hypothesis has been
explored by Salop (1973), Stlglitz (1972, 1985), and Hall (1975) among
others. In the context of less developed countries, eee Stiglltz
(19714).
 quitting. This is true whether there Is costly search, or whether all

 individuals apply to all firms offering a higher wage than             their present
 firm, au the firm simply randomly picks among the ap:licants.

 1oreover, the greater the unemployment rate, the less likely it is that

 the worker will find a better job. Thus, in this hypothesis



         r=r (w1,    ,
                         w,   U),
                                    r1>O,r2<o,r3<o,r,>O                   ()


       The effect of higher quite rates Is to decrease the "net"

 productivity (net of turnover cost). Firms would not have to pay higher

wages to reduce turnover costs if either (a) they could force workers to

sign binding contracts; or (b) workers paid for all of the training

costs. Indentured servitude Is,         in most   coxitries,   illegal.
       As an empirical matter, It appears that workers seldom pay the full

turnover costs at the moment they are hired; and so long as workers are

risk averse and there Is some chance that they will leave the firm

(either because they are badly "matched" with the firm or because of

some   exogenous reasons which Induces them to leave) the optimal contract
between the firm and the worker will entail the firm bearing some of the

risks associated with the costs of labor turnover (so turnover will be

costly to the firm). (See Arnott and Stlglitz [19853). There are

further reasons for workers not bearing the entire costs of training and

hiring. Workers may have insufficient capital; arid the costs             of
training   and   hiring   may not be verifiable. Were the worker to have to

pay the full training and hiring costs, there might be an incentive for

firms to overstate these costs, and       then    to fire workers, making a

profit out of the difference between the payments and           the   true training
costs.

      (c) Incentive Effects.7 It Is, in general, costly to monitor

workers. If there were no unemployment and if all firms paid the market

clearing wage, then the threat of being fired would not lead individuals

to reduce their shirking: they would know that they could quickly obtain

another job. But If firms pay wage In excess of that of other firms, or

if there Is unemployment (so that a fired worker must spend a period in

the unemployment pool before he again obtains a job) then workers have

an Incentive not to shirk; there Is a real cost to being fired.

      This again gives rise to a productivity wage relationship of the

form (3), with



                      BA         BA          BA
               > 0,        <0,         <0,        >0:
                                 Bvr         BU

An increase in other's wages reduces productivity, an increase in

unemployment increases productivity.

      Cd) Morale Effects. It is sometimes postulated that an Individual's

behavior Is affected by his views of how fairly he is being treated, or

more generally, how he sees himself being treated in relationship to



Tme Incentive effect of paying high wages, within the context of
developed countries, has been analyzed by Shapiro and Stiglitz (198),
Calvo (1979), and Calvo and Phelps (1977).

8A   full
        analysis of this motive for paying higher wages again requires
an investigation into alternative methods of providing incentives. One
such method is to provide a bond, which the individual forfeits if he
shirks. The difficulties with this are similar to those discussed
above. Alternatively, the firm cotfid threaten to lower the wage of any
individual caught shirking. But lowering the wage simply Increases the
likelihood that the individual will shirk in subsequent periods, and
hence Is not an effective incentive device. (See Shapiro and Stig].itz).
 otners. Thus, the wage relative to others' wages enters into the

 utility function, and consequently also enters Into the effort supply
 function.9

     (e) Quality effects.° Changes In the wage affect the mix of

 applicants for a job. If reservation wages are correlated with

 productjvltjes on the job, by offering a higher wage,   a firm   obtains, on

 average, a higher quality labor force.11 Again, in this hypothesis th

 productivity of the worker is a function of the wage paid by the given

 firm relative to the wages paid by all other firms.12

     (f) Recruitment effects. It is costly for firms to recruit workers,

 particularly to find workers who are "well*matched" with the firm. Fve

If search were costless, a firm paying a higher wage would have a larger

applicant pool among which to choose workers, and this would enable his.

tc recruit a more productive labor force.13




9Like the previous explanation, this requires that it be costly to
monitor the actual leveL of effort put out by the individual. For a
discussion of evidence for this effect in the psychological literature,
see Akerlof, 198L. For an earlier dicusjon of these morale effects,
see Stiglltz, 1973, 197'4a.

101n the context of developed countries, this model has been explored by
Stiglitz (1976a), Weiss (1980), and Nalebuff and Stlglltz. For L.D.C.'s
see Stiglltz (1982a).

The assumptions that firms can Imperfectly observe the inputs of
individuals (as in the previous two explanations), and that they can
imperfectly screen individuals prior to hiring them are critical.
Moreover, we also require that individuals not be able to guarantee
their peformancc (either for one of the reasons presented above, or
because individuals are risk averse, and Imperfectly informed concerning
their skills relative to the job.)

12When workers are heterogeneous, there is not, In general, a single
rural wage; what turns out to be relevant for most of the analysis Is
the wage of the marginal migrant. When labor is heterogeneous, this is
                          (Footnote continued)
II. Implications     of the     Dependence   of productivity on sages for rnar-:et

equilibrium.

      Regardless of the explanation, the dependence of productivity on

wages has one critical consequence: firms may not lower wages in the

presence of an excess supply of laDor. For to lower the wage will lower

the productivity of the labor force, and if its prouctivitv is lowerec

enough, the profits of the firm will be reduced.



2.1 IntroduotiQn: The basic efficiency             wage rQdel. This is seen most

simply in the basic efficiency wage model (equatIon 1). We assume that

output of the firm is a function of the effective labor supply

where L is the number of workers. We call this technology the
u1ti1icative technology. Then profits of the firm,     , are

(taking Output 35       our   nurneraire so w    is   the real wage); the firm

maximizes this with respect to w and L to obtain

            F'A'L — L,                                                   (7a)

what wr will denote.

131n models with costly search, it may take some time before a firm Is
successful In filling a vacancy. The expected length of time is
dependent on the wages the firm pays. The effect of this is analagous
to that of a direct Increase in productivity resulting from a wage
increase.

depicted as the point of tangency of the line through the origin with

the productivity curve. The solution to (8) Is referred to as the

efficiency wage, w. At the efficiency wage, the demand for labor,

given by



               d     F'(w/A)
              L =          -
                      A                                         (10)

may be less than the supply; nonetheless firms will not be induced to

lower their wages. A firm knows that an unemployed worker who offers tc

work for a wage less than w will have a lower productivity, a

sufficiently lower productivity that its labor costs will be higher, an:

its profits lower.

    This argument holds, with equal force, for any of the other

explanations we have proferred for the dependence of productivity on

wages. Thus, for instance, in the labor turnover model firms will not

lower their wages, even in the face of an excess supply of labor,

knowing that If they do so, they will face higher turnover costs, which

may more than offset the direct savings from the lower wages.

    Though all of the models can yield equilibrium unemployment, the

different models do, however, differ in their welfare consequences and

policy Implications. Some of these differences we shall note below.



2.2 A eeral M9de1, In this section, we analyze the equilibrium of a
more general version of the wageproductivitY model.      We focus our

attention on symmetric equilibria, in which all firms in the urban

sector pay the same wage. Then the productivity curve facing the itn

firm can be written as



              A =                                                (11)

               T1 (A)     T*j (q + p   ),                             (15a)
so (15b) takes on the familiar form

Thus, if B' - 0, increases In productivity are purely capital
augmenting.
       The quit rate function facing any firm, taking the wages of other

firms, the wage in the rural sector, and the unemployment rate a given,

is usually depicted as in figure 2; the solution to (114b') Is

represented by the tangency between the quit rate function, and the

1socost curve (15a). Thus, there exists an optimal wage for the firrr,

In excess of w,th, the minimum wage at which the firm can recruit

2.2.2 r-baR etr Libiwi
      We assume a fix number. of identical competitive firms. It is easy

to establish that the aggregative behavior of the sector is determined

by functions of the form (1La) and (14b) (or 16), where we substitute

the aggregate production function for the firm's production function.

From no on, L1     will      denote the aggregate urban employment,    average

urban wages, W1,      the   wage of a representative firm. Thus (lila) and
(11th) can be thought of       as   determining the demand for labor and the wage

rate as a function of N, the supply of       labor to the urban sector. To
see   how this Is d   re, we note that the rural wage is simply a function
 of tne number of            rural     workers N. but workers are either in the irban

Substituting this into (16) we can solve for the equilibrium urban wagc

       We can solve (1'a) for the demand for labor by                 the   ith firm as a

                                                                            we write L as a

    We can solve (19) and (20) simultaneously to obtain the demand for
labor and the wage as functions of

    An increase in supply of labor increases unemployment, which
increases productivity at any given wage, and hence increases demand if
the elasticity of demand for labor Is large, but may decrease demand if
the elasticity is srnall.1
    The effect of a change of         is more complicated, and is

discussed below.



2.2.3       igration
          When the wage in the urban sector exceeds that in the rural sector,

we need to have a theory to determine how labor allocates itself between

the two sectors. We assume that the supply of laborers to the urban

sector, N, is a function of the urban wage, , the unemployment rate,

the number of urban jobs, L            and the   rural wage.

                       H(*ULu,wr)                                   (22)

We    can simplify (20)     using   (19) and (16):

               N   -




giving       the supply of workers to the urban sector as a function of urbar

wages and employment.

          The Harris   Todarø MQel. A special case of our migration model (22)
is the socalled HarrisTodaro migration hypothesis, in which migration

continues until the expected urban wage equals the rural wage



Then (23) takes on the form

                                                                    (23'

and, using (17), (23) becomes


16
     It
     is apparent with elastic demands that there will be a unique
equilibrium. With elastic demands,           it is difficult
                                                    to rule out multiple
equilibrium.

 2.2.1    aret   1lbrium
     Notice that in this model, the supply     of   labor In the urban sector-'

 Is a functIon of the demand: just as we noted earlier thatthe demand for

 labor Is a function of the unemployment rate, and hence indirectly of

 supply. There Is not the simple dichotomy between supply and demand

 tnat characterized simple equilibrium models.       Moreover, while in

 traditional competitive supply and demand analysis, firms and workers

 tre3t the wage parametrically, now firms     determine   the wage. Thus,
 while traditional analysis depicts demand and supply as a function of

 the wage, here, the wage   is   eniogenous., and the demand can, accordingly,

 be thoaght of as simply a function of the Supply (eq. 21a an. the

 Supply slnply as a function of demand. The derivation of the

pseudosupply curve is straightforward. Substituting (21b) into (23 we
obtain:

           Nuu((Nu),Lu)                                             (2)
At a fixed wage, an Increase in the demand for labor reduces

unemployment, so leads to an increase in the supply of labor. The same

holds even if wages adjust, so long as the wage does not fall too much

as a result of an increase in N
                                   U.
    The equilibrium, the intersection of the pseudosupp1y curve (2L4)

and the pseudo demand curve (21a), is depicted in figure 3.



2.3 Sorie Speoja]. Ga3e

    To gain insight Into the nature of the equilibrium, It is useful to

Investigate three special cases of our     general model (22).
2.3.1 The aaoute wage hypotheLs.
     In the first, we postulate that the production function taves on the

multiplicative             form. Then, as   we noted earlier, (16),   giving    the

optimal wage, takes on the simple form:


         A1 /wi
                      =
                           A1/wj                                            (16')
     If we now postulate further that proauctivity depends               simply on the

wage paid by the firm, the simple nutritional model (1), then the

efficiency wage (the solution to (16')) is independent of both the

number of workers In the urban sector, the unemployment rate, and the

employment level. Thus, (21b) takes on the simple form

         =       w                                                             (71;' )
     The         derIvation of the    pseudodemand curve is now straightforward:

     L       =            (w*/A (w'))/A (w*).

     Notice that the demand for labor is independent of the sup1y: th

pseudodemand curve is a vertical straight line. (See Figure L4a).

     We focus         on the special supply equation (22' ) correspon1ng to the

HarrisTodaro Model. We simplify further by assuming a land surplus

economy, where the rural wage is independent of the number               of
individuals          in the rural sector,

     w
      r r'


then (22') takes on the particularly simple form



17
  We emphasize that this Is still not the most general model. We have,
in particular, Ignored the dependence of productivity on relative
prices. The omission of this would be particularly serious In the
analysis of a closed economy model, where the relative price of
agricultural and industrial goods affects industrial productivity. See
Sah and Stiglitz (1985).
         uuwr/                                                        (19')
  (See   Figure 14a).   There is a unique Intersection of the pseudo4demand

 and pseudomsuppy schedules. The level of unerp1oyment         is   also easy to
 see diagramatically: it is simply the vertical distance between the

 equilibrium value of L and the 115 degree line.



 2.3.2 The    Relative Wage HyQtesjs, Mltipleatjye TelRol9gy, The
 second special case we Investigate Is that where we retain all of the

 assurptions employed In the previous one, except that productivity is

 postulated to be homogeneous of degree zero In
                                                      w, and Wr.
      The productivity equation can be written as
                 4
           Ai(wi/W9Wr/W1L



      The migration equilibrium condition is generalized so that       te
equilibrium      unemployment rate is assumed to be a (monotonically

decreasing) function solely of the ratio of rural-'urban wage ratio:



                                      M' < o                         (25)


or   inverting

                              m(U).                                  (25a)


In equilibrium, WI , so           A Is simply a function of the unemployment

rate, or using (18),     of


     A - Aj(1,m(U),U)
      I                                                             (16")
Thus, (21b) takes on the special form of

                = (L•                                                                 (19')




.'e would normally           expect       that an Increase in the unemployment rate would

lower the optimal wage paid by the firm; hence '                      >    0.
Substituting         (16")    into (10), it is       Immediate    that the demand for labor

is   simply a function of


                 =                                                                            (21a')
                         i[(Lu/Nu)/A(1,m(1_(Lu/Nu)), 1(L/N))/A
                 =   z(U)

      We would normally expect that an increase in the unemployment rate
reduced the cost of an efficiency unit of labor; the effect of tnis on
the demand for laborers would depend on the elasticity of the demand for
labor. If, for instance, the elasticity of demand                         for   labor is low,
then      the demand for workers actually decreases.

      The supply of labor equation from (25a) is now



      N
               Lu11M[wr/


lBThis Is, however, not necessarily the case. Under the assumption that
productivity Is homogeneous of degree zero In w1 , and Wr, the first
orer condition for the optimal wage can be written as




The   effect of a change in U on the equilibrium level of w thus depends
on the sign of

                              m'      +
                                           Ai                m'
In the case of a fixed rural wage, we can write



                                                                                    (2")

Though       (21a")           and (214'fl thus describe the equilibriun for this model, it

is easier to see the effects of various policies if we express both the

"supply         wage" (the wage at which a given unemployment is generated by

the market) and the demand wage (the wage set by firms) as functions of

the unemloyment rate. For 5inplicity, we focus on the case where wr                        Ic
fixed. Then



                      =
                              r/(1"      (migration equilibrium)



and

                      =                                      (wage determination)
                              A(1,m(U),U)/A1(1,m(u),U).


See figure 30. Notice that in this case, the unemployment rate and the

wage are          determined independently of the demand for labor. Rural

employment is determined essentially as a residual:19

N     =    NN             N      Lu (u*)/1*u*.



2.3.2       The    Relative Wage HypothesL           The    Labor TwrQveP MQdel.

          The   labor turnover          model yields similar results. Labor turnover



     the more general case, where wr is a function of Nr, the
pseudosupply function takes on the form

                  *   (1U)          W(N) wr(N4Nu)          wr(N 0 Lu(u)/14u).
depends only on relative wages arid the unemployment rate. But the

efficiency wage condition takes on the form (15b), again yielding

               =   h(U).
        The demand for labor equation is slightly different from flU). It

takes on the form:

             F'(L)     w +   T.
where, it will be recalled, T is the turnover costs per wor<er (given by

(1 5"


        Both T and w are     functions    of U, so, Inverting, we obtain

             L =     F'1   (h(U) + T (U)).

        The demand for labor Is again simply a function of the unemployment

rate. The equilibrium is again depicted by a diagram, such as figure               .
III.     cciceny of te Market qwiliFtur
        The fact that some workers are unemployed suggests that resources

are not being used         efficiently.     However, assessing the efficiency of

the market In the presence of the wage*productivity nexis Is not an easy

matter. We need to specify what the government's objectives are, as

well as the set of available Instruments. If, for Instance, the

government could       control    migration directly, then It could eliminate

unemployment. It might, for instance, randomly assign some Individuals

to the high paying urban          jobs,   but require all other Individuals to

remain In the rural sector. Such control of migration requires a level

of repression that many L.D.C.'s find objectionable. Accordingly, the

more relevant question may be, It the government could control directly

the urban wage rate and the level of urban            emp1oymet   would It set these

variables at levels different from those of competitive markets?
     iternat1veiy, the government may not be able to control                                        wae and
 employment directly; it may have to resort to wage subsidies or taxes.

 gain, we need to ask, if these are the only instruments availaLje,

 gould   the government wish to impose such subsidies taxes, and If so, at
 what rates?

     In this section, we assume the government has direct control of

 and L. We first assume that the government wishes to maxinize nztIcmal

 output,   and then consider the more general objective of (constrained)

 pareto efficiency.

though there Is unep1oyment. Moreover If a = 0 and                            =   0 (the wage in

3.1.2 elative Wage Effic1nQy Model.

    Under the relative wage efficiency hypothesis, with a fixed rural

wage, and the Harrls4Todaro migration equilibrium condition, a Is again

zero, employment is at the right level, contingent on the wage being

offered, but the wage may be either too large or too small. Which
depends on hether a proportionate increase In the employment rate has a

greater or less effect on productivity than a proportionate Increase in

the average urban wage.

    Under the relative wage efficiency hypothesis, and the Harris—Todaro

migration equilibrium condition, but with a variable rural wage, a <      0.

Hence, from   (28a), it      is clear that employment, conditional on the we,

may be either too large or too small (since the above expression does

not depend on the properties of the productivity function but clearly

does, the right hand side of (28a) may be either positive or negative.)

    Similarly, from (28b), it is clear that the wage may be either too

high or too low. While



                        dlnL,dlfl



                        dlnN/dlflL



will be less than unity if individuals are risk averse, the sign of b

depends on the sensitivity of productivity to changes in the average

urban wage relative to its sensitivity to the rural wage rate and the

level of unemployment.
  3.2 ParQt efficiocy, The fact that the competitive allocation does

 not maximize net national output does not Imply that the market economy

 Is not pareto efficient. Pareto efficiency may be most easily examined

 in the context of the case where the rural wage is fixed and hence

 (under the HarrisMTodaro hYpothesis), so is the welfare of workers, Is

 fixed. Pareto efficiency then requires the maximization of pro1ts jr

 the urban sector, i.e.

Contrasting (314)   and   (35) wIth (15) and (16), it is clear that the

market will essentially never be pareto efficient unless A2 =             -

3.3 So&pces of Market Faj1pe. There are several sources of market

failure in this economy. First, firms fall to take into account the

effect of their wage and employment policy on the productivity of

workers at other firms, both directly and indirectly through their

effect on the unemployment rate and rural wages. (These productivity

externalities21 would arise regardless of the explanation of the



21Some of the externalities appear to be pecuniary externalities, which
in traditional economic theory do not interfere with the productive
efficiency of the economy. But the result that pecuniary externalities
                          (Footnote continued)
wageproductivlty relationship.) Some of these externalities are

positive, some are negative. Policies -which lead    to a reduced
unemployment rate are likely to reduce productivity (e.g. as a result of

incentive effects). Increases in productivity as a conseqence of a

higher quality applicant pool are at the expense of the quality of those

working at other firms, except to the extent that the wage/employment

policy has resulted in a better matching of workers with firms (on the

basis of comparative advantage.)

    As a result, in this class of models the wage does not measure the

correct opportunity cost of labor. For instance, if the reason that

productivity Increases with the wage is that reservation wages are

correlated with productivity, then the applicant pool consists of all of

those whose productivity in the rural sector is less than the wage

offered by the firm; In that case, the wage clearly exceeds the

opportunity cost of a randomly selected applicant.

    If by hiring an additional worker, more than one worker migrates

from the rural sector (to seek employment in the urban sector) the loss

in output exceeds the rural wage. Later, we present an example where

the loss in Output equals the urban wage.

    Thro shout this section we have assumed that the government cannot

effect migration indirectly through subsidies to the rural sector. As

we show later, such subsidies are, in general, desirable (though It will

not be in the interest of any firm to provide such a subsidy). -

         Indirect Intepwention. Tne government can attempt             to   use taxes and

 sbsidles to effect the constrained optimum. Since there were two

 variables that the government controlled, it requires at least two

 Instruments to attain the constrained optimum. In particular, If we

then the market solution will be a constrained optimum.

      Note that a pure ad valorem subsidy leaves unchanged the equation

for the optimal wage (dividing (38) by (37)) but does increase the level

of employment. Thus, in the pure wage efficiency model, where the

market wage was optimal, the governnent will only employ an ad valorem

wage subsidy. A specific wage subsidy will increase the wage paid: it

will be partly shifted backwards towards workers (see Figure 5).

      If the wage subsidy is shifted backwards towards workers, it will
result in an increase in the unemployment rate, as depicted in figure 6.

In contrast, in the pure efficiency wage model, where an ad valorem wage

sbiCy leaves the market wage unaffected, the unemployment ratQ is

unchanged, if     the   rural wage is fixed (under the HarrisTodaro migration

hypothesis)   but because the number of    employed workers increases, the

number   of unemployed increases. On the other hand, if the rural          wage   Is

not fixed, the out—migration from the rural sector        raises   the rural

wage, and this reduces the level of unemployment. The consequences of

this are described more fully below.



Additional Taxes. Although by assumption, the government cannot

directly control migration, it may be able to affect the level of

migration (and the associated unemployment) by providing subsidies to

the rural sector, financed, for instance, by      a tax   on profits in the

urban   sector.   In the pure efficiency wage model, such subsidies

unambiguously increase national output and lower unemployment. In

models where productivity in the urban sector is affected by the rural

wage, such a policy has a positive effect on rural output and a negative

effect on urban output. The optimal rural subsidy entails a balancing

of these two effects.

Shadow Prices. The models formulated in this paper have very different

implications for shadow pricing from those of the standard model. First

the opportunity cost of having an additional worker in the urban sector

depends critically on the effect this has on the unemployment rate. If

the government's hiring of an additional worker left unemployment

unchanged, it would imply an induced migration of 1/14U workers, and

hence a loss in output in the rural sector of
                                                  wr/1MU, If W      is   the

                      W (1J)
                  U

 so that the o?portunity cost of hiring an additional worker is bust the

 urban wage. It is easy to ascertain, within the context of the models

 formulated here, the effects of a change In urban employment      on U. or
 instance If the rural wage is constant and equal to the value of the

marginal product and if the urban wage remains unchanged (as It will be

in the pure efficiency wage model or in any other model in which the

urban    wage depenas simply on the rural wage and the unemployment rate,
as in the labor turnover model or the incentive models)22 then U ill
remain unchanged. If the rural wage Increases as workers leave the
rural sector, It implies that as the government hire more workers, the
supply   wage (the urban wage     where generates the indicted level of
umemployment) will        be higher.23


22
  But in the efficiency quality model, the mix of applicants applying
to 30b8 In the urban sector changes as urban employment changes, and
this may lead to a change in the urban wage.

In the relative wage model, and

                                (Footnote continued)
       As figure 7 Illustrates, the new equilibrium level of unemployment

will be lower, provided the efficiency wage decreases with the

unempoy:nent rate. (But just the opposite occurs If the efficiency wage

increases witn U).

       Note too, in the case where the rural wage is fixed, that changing

the level of urban employment has no effect on aggregate workers'

consumption; hence If all profits are invested, investment is maximized

by maximizing net national output. Regardless of the relative weight

associated with investment, the shadow price on labor Is the urban wage.

(Tnese results are In marked contrast to the earlier studies of Sen,

Marglin, etc., which ignored the endogenity of migration and of tirban

wage determination.)

       If the rural wage increases as Individuals leave the rural sector,

then at a fixed urban wage, the unemployment rate wil be reduced, and

hence the opportunity cost of labor is less than the urban wage (but

still greater than the rural wage). The reduction in the unemployment

rate may lead to an increase in urban wage, but presumably by an amount

which Is less than proportionate to the rise in the rural wage.

V. Disequilibrium versus equilibrium models and wage dispersion.

       In all of the models presented here, we have assumed that the wage

is determined endogenously. There is another important class of models

in which wages are set arbitrarily (say by custom, unions, or government

flat). Such models do not provide a basis for inferring what will

in the absolute wage model.
  happen as a result of a change in, say, taxes, and thus provide an

  inadequate basis for the analysis of policy.     Since the pure efficiency
 wage model is one in which the wage does not depend either on the level

 of' hirjn In the sector, on
                                 unemployment, public employment, wages paid
 by other firms, or ad valorem
                                   subsidies, the analysis of the rigid wage
 model corresponds (for these policy variables) to that special case of
 our   general model. On the other hand, our    model predicts that even In
 the   pure   efficiency wage model, a specific wage subsidy will have an

 effect on wages paid in the urban sector.

       In the c1sequIlibri models, the observed productivity differences

 between different sectors (or different firms within a given sector) may

 ce viewed as cause by differences In the exogeneously given waze. In

or more general equillbrjun formulation, there may exist differences In

the wages paid by different firms; labor turnover may be more important

to some firms than to others; physical health may be more Important in

some   occupations than in others; in such   cases, wages may be higher.

Even more interesting, however, Is the possibility that identical firms

(identical jobs) may pay different wages; the differences In wages being

perfectly     offset by differences In productivity. Equilibrium may be

characterized by wage disperion, even among otherwise Identical firms.

In these models, there is no single direction of causation: productivity

is higher because wages are higher, and wages are higher because

productivity Is higher.

    This paper has considered only some of the Important facets of the

wage productivity nexus and its implications for development policy. It

has, not considered, for Instance, Important consequences for education

policy (whether education is for screening or human capital formation)
and investent   policy (includIng the allocation of capital between the

urban and rural sector). These are questions which we hope to explore

elsewhere.

        The dead fcr labor is a function of the supply, and the
        supply a function of demand. While          supply noa1ly increases
        with demand,   demand   may increase   or decrease with supply.
        here we depict the former case.
