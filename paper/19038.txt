                                              ABSTRACT

We investigate global factors associated with cross-border capital flows. We formulate a model of
gross capital flows through the international banking system and derive a closed form solution that
highlights the leverage cycle of global banks as being a prime determinant of the transmission of financial
conditions across borders. We then test the predictions of our model in a panel study of 46 countries
and find that global factors dominate local factors as determinants of banking sector capital flows.

1     Introduction
It is a cliché that the world has become more connected, but the …nancial crisis and the boom
that preceded it have renewed attention on the global factors that drive …nancial conditions
worldwide.    Calvo, Leiderman and Reinhart (1993, 1996) famously distinguished the global
“push” factors for capital ‡ows from the country-speci…c “pull” factors, and emphasized the
importance of external push factors in explaining capital ‡ows to emerging economies in the
1990s.   More recently, researchers and policy makers have drawn attention to the notion of
“global liquidity”whereby permissive credit conditions in …nancial centers are transmitted across
borders to other parts of the world (see BIS (2011) and Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2013)).
    The objective of our paper is to formulate a framework for global liquidity and to shed light
on the possible mechanisms behind its operation. We make two contributions.
    Our …rst contribution is to construct a model of global liquidity built around the operation
of international banks, where one party’s obligation is another party’s asset.      When global
banks apply more lenient conditions on local banks in supplying wholesale funding, the local
banks transmit the more lenient conditions to their borrowers through greater availability of
local credit. In this way, global liquidity is transmitted across borders through the interactions
of global and local banks.
    Our model builds on recent advances in understanding the procyclical nature of bank lending
and leverage in which leverage builds up in booms and falls in busts (Adrian and Shin (2012)).
Procyclicality of leverage is the mirror image of increased collateral requirements (increased
“haircuts”) during downturns, and Geanakoplos (2010) and Fostel and Geanakoplos (2008, 2012)
have examined how the risk bearing capacity of the …nancial system can be severely diminished
when leverage falls through an increase in collateral requirements.     Similarly, Gorton (2009,
2010) and Gorton and Metrick (2012) have explored the analogy between classical bank runs
and the modern run in capital markets driven by increased collateral requirements and hence
the reduced capacity to borrow.
    Our model of global banking combines these earlier insights with the institutional features


                                                2
underpinning the international banking system such as the centralized funding and credit alloca-
tion decisions of international banks, as documented by Cetorelli and Goldberg (2012a, 2012b).
We construct a “double-decker” model of international banking where regional banks borrow
from global banks, who in turn borrow from money market funds in …nancial centers. Regional
banks can diversify away idiosyncratic credit risk of regional borrowers, but cannot diversify
away region-wide shocks. Global banks in turn can diversify away region-speci…c shocks, but
cannot diversify away global shocks. In such a setting, we show that the leverage of the global
banks are pinned down uniquely from the funding constraint applied by creditors in the whole-
sale funding market, while the leverage of the local banks are uniquely determined from their
own funding constraint combined with the lending by the global banks. The borrowing rate
for the local banks (which is the lending rate for the global banks) is determined by market
clearing. By combining the leverage limits that arise from each layer, we show that total credit
and cross-border claims can be solved uniquely and in closed form.
   Our second contribution is empirical. We investigate how closely the theoretical predictions
are borne out empirically. Thanks to the closed-form solution given by our model, we can draw
on a number of clear-cut hypotheses on the determinants of cross-border capital ‡ows.
   A sharp prediction of our model is that both the level of bank leverage (which determines
the rate at which one dollar’s increase in bank capital is turned into lending) and the change in
the leverage (which determines the lending based on existing, or infra-marginal bank capital)
should enter as “supply push” determinants of capital ‡ows. The model also predicts that the
book equity of global banks should enter as an additional “supply push” factor. Finally, the
model gives an analogous set of predictions concerning local “demand pull” factors that drive
cross-border capital ‡ows. We …nd strong support for these predictions in our panel regression
study of 46 countries thereby verifying that the factors driving capital ‡ows can be found in the
determinants of the balance sheet capacity of banks. In particular, we …nd that global “supply
push” factors play the dominant role relative to local “demand pull” in determining banking
sector capital ‡ows.
   We further show how the VIX index of implied volatility of S&P 500 equity index options

                                               3
enters as an explanatory variable for capital ‡ows, both in levels and changes, thereby cor-
roborating the …ndings from earlier work1 that has identi…ed banks’Value-at-Risk (a quantile
measure of potential losses) as a key determinant of intermediary leverage and which has found
that the VIX index mirrors banks’Value-at-Risk (VaR). These results therefore shed light both
on Forbes and Warnock’s (2012) …nding of the explanatory power of the VIX index for gross
capital ‡ows in surge episodes, as well as the importance of leverage as a pre-condition for crises
as identi…ed by Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012). Our framework serves as the common thread
that ties together these two strands of the literature.
   Our …ndings address a wider set of issues that have attracted recent attention in international
…nance. Whereas current account gaps have traditionally been considered as the determinant of
capital ‡ows, many recent papers have drawn attention to the dramatic increase in gross capital
‡ows, especially through the banking sector - see Borio and Disyatat (2011), Forbes and Warnock
(2012), Lane and Pels (2011), Obstfeld (2012a, 2012b) and Shin (2012). Indeed, Obstfeld (2012b
p.3) concludes that “large gross …nancial ‡ows entail potential stability risks that may be only
distantly related, if related at all, to the global con…guration of saving-investment discrepancies.”
One reason for the caution is that the growth in gross capital ‡ows was associated with increased
leverage and the size of the banking sector as a whole, as emphasized by Gourinchas and Obstfeld
(2012) and Schularick and Taylor (2012). Our contribution relative to the existing literature
is to highlight the interaction of global and local banks as the driver of ‡uctuations in …nancial
conditions.
   In highlighting the role of the banking sector, our paper complements earlier research that
has focused on portfolio ‡ows (such as Hau and Rey (2009) who examined equity portfoliio
‡ows). Our paper is intended to shed further light on the distinctive behavioral footprint of the
banking sector and its consequences for …nancial stability. These issues have received renewed
attention in the context of the Euro area crisis (see Allen, Beck, Carletti, Lane, Schoenmaker
and Wagner (2011), Lane (2013) and Lane and Pels (2011)).
   In the next section, we formulate our model of cross-border banking by …rst laying out the

sheet management that our model aims to capture faithfully. Our model of global banking then
builds on this discussion. We then follow up with our empirical investigation.


2     Model of Bank Capital Flows
2.1    Institutional Background
The structure of the global banking system is sketched in Figure 1. The direction of …nancial
‡ows goes from right to left, in keeping with the convention of having assets on the left hand
side of the balance sheet and liabilities on the right. In Figure 1, global banks raise wholesale
funding and then lend to local banks in other jurisdictions. The local banks draw on the cross-
border funding (stage 2) in order to lend to their local borrowers (stage 3). Our analysis applies
irrespective of whether the local bank is separately owned from the global bank, or whether the
local and global banks belong to the same banking organization. Cetorelli and Goldberg (2012a,
2012b) provide extensive evidence using bank level data that internal capital markets serve to
reallocate funding within global banking organizations. Further details are discussed in a BIS
(2010) study that describes how the branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks in the United
States borrow from money market funds and then channel the funds to their headquarters for

on-lending to other parts of the world.2 Stage 2 in Figure 1 corresponds to the lending by global
banks with access to US wholesale funding to other parts of the world, and will be re‡ected in
cross-border capital ‡ows through the banking sector, as measured by the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS).
    Figure 2 plots the cross-border claims of BIS-reporting banks on counterparties listed in the
countries on the right. The series have been normalized to equal 100 in March 2003. Although
the borrowers have wide geographical spread, we see a synchronized boom in cross-border lending
before the recent …nancial crisis, suggesting a role for external “supply push”factors in capital
‡ows.
    Figure 3 plots the foreign currency assets and liabilities of banks globally, as measured by
the BIS locational banking statistics, which are organized according to the residence principle.

Our model captures the intermediation of US dollar lending using out‡ows from the US. This feature distinguishes
our model from the consumption risk-sharing model of Maggiori (2011), in which deposit funding ‡ows into the
US. Maggiori’s (2011) model re‡ects the aggregate US balance sheet, including the government. Our focus is
on explaining ‡ows in the banking sector alone.

The US dollar series in Figure 3 show the US dollar-denominated assets and liabilities of banks
outside the United States. The Euro series show the corresponding Euro-denominated assets
and liabilities of banks that are outside the Euro area, and so on. The US dollar asset series
exceeded 10 trillion dollars in 2008Q1, brie‡y exceeding the total assets of the US chartered
commercial bank sector (Shin (2012)).                                                                                                       The sizeable magnitudes involved suggest that the
mechanisms to be sketched in our paper have taken on increasing importance in recent years.

Our model of bank credit supply is designed to capture some key features of bank balance sheet
management.        An illustration for a typical global bank is given in Figure 4 that shows the

changes in debt, equity and risk-weighted assets (Source: Bankscope)




  RWAt are the corresponding changes in equity, debt, and risk-weighted assets, respectively.
    The …rst notable feature is how changes in assets are re‡ected dollar for dollar (or pound
for pound) in the change in debt, not equity. We see this from the slope of the scatter chart
relating changes in assets and changes in debt, which is very close to one.                                                                           Leverage is thus
procyclical; leverage is high when the balance sheet is large.
    The second notable feature in Figure 4 is how the relationship between the changes in the
total assets and its risk-weighted assets is very ‡at. In other words, the risk-weighted assets
barely change, even as the raw assets change by large amounts.                                                                          The fact that risk-weighted
assets change little even as raw assets ‡uctuate by large amounts indicates the compression of
measured risks during lending booms and heightened measured risks during busts.
    The equity in Figure 4 is book equity, giving us the di¤erence between the value of the
bank’s portfolio of claims and its liabilities. An alternative measure of equity would have been
the bank’s market capitalization, which gives the market price of its traded shares.                                                                           Market

capitalization is the discounted value of the future free cash ‡ows, and will depend on cash ‡ows
such as fee income that do not depend directly on the portfolio held by the bank. Focus on
market capitalization leads naturally to the consideration of the enterprise value of the bank,
de…ned as the sum of market capitalization and debt. Enterprise value addresses how much the
bank is worth.
   However, our concern is with the availability of credit through the bank, and hence with
the portfolio choice of the bank.       Thus, the appropriate balance sheet concept for us is the
total assets of the bank, rather than its enterprise value. The corresponding equity concept is
book equity, and the appropriate concept of leverage is the ratio of total assets to book equity.
Adrian and Shin (2012) discuss the conceptual distinctions between lending and enterprise value
in more detail.
   Our model attempts to capture the two key features of Figure 4 - the procyclicality of leverage
and the countercyclicality of measured risk - and uses this combination to explain surges and
reversals of capital ‡ows.

2.3    Model
We now describe our model. The notation is given in Figure 5. In each region, there is an
in…nitely elastic credit demand at the rate 1 + r, where r > 0 is a known constant. Regional
banks provide credit (denoted C) to local borrowers. This credit is funded by wholesale funding

market clearing. For global banks, wholesale lending L appears on the asset side of the balance
sheet. Global banks …nance lending by drawing on money market funds M at the interest rate
1 + i, to be solved below. The equity of the regional bank is denoted by ER while the equity
of the global bank is denoted by EG . As we will see, our model has an aggregation property
across banks, so that ER and EG can be interpreted as the aggregate banking sector capital of
the regional banks and global banks, respectively.

2.3.1   Regional Banks

Each regional bank has a well diversi…ed loan portfolio consisting of loans to many borrowers.
Credit risk follows the Vasicek (2002) model, based on the Merton (1974) model of credit risk.
   There are many identical borrowers indexed by j.                   Figure 6 illustrates the value of an
individual borrower’s project, whose value at date 0 is denoted by V0 .               Each borrower j has
debt with face value F , maturing at date T . The value of the borrower’s project at date T is
denoted VT , and is a lognormal random variable given by
                                                       s2        p
                              VT = V0 exp                   T + s T Wj                                 (1)

                                                   10
where Wj is a standard normal random variable, and      and s > 0 are constants. The borrower
defaults when VT < F . In what follows, we set T = 1 and F = 1.
   The probability of default viewed from date 0 is
                                                                       s2

where   (:) is the c.d.f. of the standard normal and dj is the distance to default in units of
standard deviations of the standard normal Wj .

                                               s T
The standard normal Wj is given by the linear combination:
                                        p       p
                                 Wj =      Y + 1      Xj                                         (5)

where Y and fXj g are mutually independent standard normals.                Y has the interpretation
as the common risk factor for all borrowers in the region while each Xj are the idiosyncratic
component of credit risk for borrower j. The parameter       2 (0; 1) determines the weight given
to the common factor Y .
   Thus, borrower j repays the loan when Zj     0, where Zj is the random variable:
                                        p       p
                            Zj   = dj +     Y + 1       Xj
                                        1       p      p
                                 =        (") +    Y + 1       Xj                                (6)

where " is the probability of default of borrower j, de…ned as " =     ( dj ).

2.3.2   Contracting Problem for Regional Bank

The regional bank is risk-neutral and chooses C to maximize expected pro…t subject to a funding
constraint imposed by its creditors, with the book equity ER exogenously given. The funding
constraint is derived from the following contracting problem.

                                              11
     Each regional bank has the choice of selecting its portfolio of loans, but can choose between
two alternative portfolios - good and bad.          The good portfolio consists of loans which have
a probability of default ", and pairwise correlation                       > 0 of default across loans.           The bad
portfolio consists of loans with a higher probability of default " + k, for known constant k > 0,
                                                                0                 0
as well as a higher pairwise correlation of default                 , with            > . The bad portfolio generates
greater dispersion in the outcome density for the loan portfolio, and hence a higher option value
arising from the limited liability of the bank.
     Private credit extended by the bank is C at interest rate r so that the notional value of
assets (the amount owed to the bank at date T ) is (1 + r) C. Conditional on Y , defaults are
independent. Taking the limit where the number of borrowers becomes large while keeping the
notional assets …xed, the realized value of the bank’s assets can be written as a deterministic
function of Y , by the law of large numbers.
     If the bank chooses the good portfolio, the realized value of assets at date T is the random
variable wG (Y ) de…ned as:
                                                 p                  p                           1
                   wG (Y ) = (1 + r) C Pr               Y +               1           Xj            (") jY
                                                    p           1 (")
                                                Y
                             = (1 + r) C                p
                                                            1
                                                                                                                        (7)

De…ne the normalized asset realization function w^G (Y )                              wG (Y ) = (1 + r) C. The c.d.f. of

Figure 7. The two charts plot the densities over realized assets when C (1 + r) = 1. The left hand charts plots
the density over asset realizations of the bank when = 0:1 and " is varied from 0.1 to 0.3. The right hand
chart plots the asset realization density when " = 0:2 and varies from 0.01 to 0.3.




Figure 7 plots the densities over asset realizations, and shows how the density shifts to changes
in the default probability " (left hand panel) or to changes in                                                                                                     (right hand panel).   Higher
values of " imply a …rst degree stochastic dominance shift left for the asset realization density,
while shifts in                                     imply a mean-preserving shift in the density around the mean 1 ". Comparing
(8) and (9), we note that FG (z) cuts FB (z) once from below. We appeal to this property of
the payo¤ distributions below.
    Let ' be the notional debt ratio of the bank, de…ned as

                                                                                     ' = (1 + f ) L= (1 + r) C                                                                              (10)

In other words, ' is the default point of the bank as a proportion of its notional assets, and has
the interpretation of the strike price of the embedded put option arising from limited liability.
The risk-neutral bank maximizes expected pro…t net of funding cost. Following Merton (1974),
the market value of debt is the notional repayment amount minus the option value of default.


                                                                                                   13
Hence, the bank’s objective function can be written as

                                         E (w)
                                            ^         ['         (')]                                      (11)

where E (w)
         ^ is the expected payo¤ from the loan book, ' is the notional debt and                          (') is
the value of the put option when the strike price is given by ' = (1 + f ) L= (1 + r) C.                   This
formulation of the bank’s optimization problem follows Adrian and Shin (2012).
     Given equity E, the bank chooses C to maximize the bank’s expected payo¤ (11) subject to
the incentive compatibility constraint for the bank to choose the good portfolio, which is

                         EG (w)
                             ^      ['     G   (')]        EB (w)
                                                               ^        ['   B   (')]                      (12)

where EG (w)
          ^ is the expected payo¤ from the good portfolio and                    G   (') is the value of the put
option with strike price ' under the outcome distribution for the good portfolio. EB (w)
                                                                                      ^ and
 B   (') are de…ned analogously for the expected payo¤ and option values associated with the
bad portfolio. Writing      (') =    B   (')     G    ('), (12) can be written more simply as

                                                  (')        k                                             (13)

The left hand side is the additional option value to default from the bad portfolio and the right
hand side is EG (w)
                 ^        ^ = k, since the probability of default of loans in the bad portfolio is
                      EB (w)
" + k while the probability of default of loans in the good portfolio is ". Incentive compatibility
entails keeping leverage low enough that the higher option value to default does not exceed the
greater expected payo¤ of the good portfolio. Our solution rests on the following key result.

Lemma 1 There is a unique ' that solves                (') = k.

     Lemma 1 can be proved as follows. From Breeden and Litzenberger (1978), the state price
density is given by the second derivative of the option price with respect to its strike price.
                                R'
Given risk-neutrality,    (') = 0 [FB (s) FG (s)] ds. Since FG (z) cuts FB (z) once from



                                                      14
below,       (') is single-peaked. In particular,
                                       Z 1
                       lim     (') =       [FB (s) FG (s)] ds
                       '!1              0
                                       Z 1                  Z 1
                                   =       [1 FG (s)] ds        [1 FB (s)] ds
                                        0                    0
                                       Z 1             Z 1
                                   =       sFG (s) ds      sFB (s) ds = k                          (14)
                                        0                     0

so that      (') approaches k from above as ' ! 1. Since ' < 1 for any bank with positive
notional equity, we have a unique solution to           (') = k. This proves the lemma.
   Given risk-neutrality of the bank, the incentive compatibility constraint binds. To solve for
the funding rate 1 + f , we …rst derive the demand for wholesale funding by the regional banks.
From the de…nition ' = (1 + f ) L= (1 + r) C and the balance sheet identity ER + L = C, we
can write:
                                                     ER
                                            L=    1+f 1
                                                                                                   (15)
                                                  1+r '
                                                              1
which is the demand for wholesale funding as a function of f . The supply of wholesale funding
will be obtained from the global banks’lending decision. For now, note that L is proportional
to ER , and so (15) also denotes the aggregate demand for wholesale funding when ER is the
aggregate equity of the regional banks.
   Under the incentive compatibility constraint, the asset realizations follow the distribution
FG (:), so that the probability of default by the bank is given by FG ('), where ' is the solution
given by Lemma 1. Denoting by          the bank’s probability of default, we have          = FG (') so
that                                                    p
                                            1                     1
                                                (") +     1           (')
                                  =                     p                                          (16)

   Since ' is uniquely solved by Lemma 1, and " and                   are parameters of the contracting
problem,      is also uniquely de…ned. We now turn to the supply of wholesale funding by the
global banks.

2.3.3     Global Banks

Lending by global banks is solved from a “double-decker”version of the Vasicek model. There
are many regions and each global bank has a well-diversi…ed portfolio of cross-border loans across
many regions. However, the global banks bear global risk that cannot be diversi…ed away.
   The rectangle in Figure 8 represents the population of borrowers across all regions. Regional
bank k holds a portfolio that is diversi…ed against idiosyncratic shocks, but not to regional
shocks.    Global banks hold a portfolio of loans to regional banks, and is diversi…ed against
regional shocks, but it faces undiversi…able global shocks.
   In equation (6), we introduced the random variable Zj that determined whether a particular
borrower j defaults or not.         We now introduce a subscript k to indicate the region that the
borrower belongs to. Thus, let

                                                  1            p             p
                                   Zkj                 (") +        Yk +         1     Xkj                        (17)

where
                                                      p             p
                                            Yk =           G+           1      Rk                                 (18)

                                                               16
   In (18), the risk factor Yk is further decomposed into a regional risk factor Rk that a¤ects
all the private credit recipients in region k and a global risk factor G. The random variables
G; fRk g and fXkj g are mutually independent standard normals.
   The credit risk borne by a global bank arises from the possibility (which happens with
probability   ) that a regional bank defaults on the cross-border loan granted by the global
bank. Although each regional bank has a diversi…ed portfolio against the idiosyncratic risk of
its regional borrowers, it bears the risk Yk , which is the linear combination of the global risk G
and the region-speci…c risk Rk .
   A global bank has a fully-diversi…ed portfolio across regions, and it can diversify away the
regional risks Rk . A regional bank k defaults when w^G (Yk ) < ', or

                                         1                            1
                               Yk < w^       (') =                  p

                                                            1
                                                  =             ( )                                                (19)

Equivalently, regional bank k defaults when       k   < 0, where                k    is the random variable:
                                             1
                              k                ( ) + Yk
                                             1
                                                     p    p
                                    =          ( )+     G+ 1                           Rk                          (20)

   Note the formal symmetry between (20) and the expression for Zj for the regional bank in
(6).   The global bank faces borrowers who default with probability                              , whereas the regional
bank faces borrowers who default with probability ". The global bank faces uncertainty with
both a diversi…able element Rk and undiversi…able element G, whereas the regional bank faces
diversi…able risk Xj and undiversi…able risk Y . The parameter                              plays the analogous role for
the global bank as parameter       does for the regional bank.
   For a global bank with notional assets of (1 + f ) L which is fully diversi…ed across regions,
its asset realization is a deterministic function of the global risk factor G only, and is given by

                        w (G) = (1 + f ) L Pr (         k           0jG)

2.3.4     Contracting Problem for Global Bank

The global bank is risk-neutral and maximizes expected pro…t subject to a funding constraint,
which arises from the following contracting problem.                      The global bank chooses between two
alternative portfolios - the good portfolio or the bad portfolio.                              The good portfolio consists
of loans which default with probability        but where                  = 0, so that correlation in defaults are
eliminated.
      The bad portfolio consists of loans with a higher probability of default                                 + h, for known
                                                                     0
constant h > 0, and non-zero correlation of default                      > 0. The greater correlation in defaults
generates dispersion in the asset realization and hence higher option value of default.                                   If the
bank chooses the bad portfolio, the realized value of assets is the random variable wB (G) de…ned
as:
                                              p              p
                                                   0                        0                  1
                   wB (G) = (1 + f ) L Pr              G+            1          Rj                 ( + h) jG
                                               p   0        1(
                                              G                   +h)
                          = (1 + f ) L             p         0
                                                                                                                           (23)
                                                        1


 We normalize wB by the face value of assets and de…ne w^B (G)                                     wB (G) = (1 + f ) L.    The
c.d.f. of w^B is

                                FB (z) = Pr (w^B                 z)
                                         = Pr G             w^B 1 (z)
                                         =        w^B 1 (z)
                                                       1(
                                                                p                1 (z)
                                                            +h)+ 1
                                         =                     p                                                           (24)

                                                       18
     If the bank chooses the good portfolio, the default probability is             and correlation in defaults
is zero. The outcome distribution for the good portfolio is obtained from (24) by setting h = 0
and letting    ! 0. In this limit, the numerator of the expression inside the brackets in (24) is
positive when z > 1         and negative when z < 1                  . Thus, the outcome distribution of the
good portfolio in the limit as      ! 0 is
                                                      0 if z < 1
                                     FG (z) =                                                             (25)
                                                      1 if z 1
The good portfolio allows full diversi…cation by the bank.
     Denote by     the ratio (1 + i) M= (1 + f ) L, which is the notional debt ratio of the global
bank, and also plays the role of the strike price of the embedded option due to limited liability.
Then, the bank’s objective function can be written as

                                             E (w)
                                                ^         [       ( )]                                    (26)

where E (w)
         ^ is the expected realization of the (normalized) loan portfolio, and the expression
in square brackets is the expected repayment by the bank to wholesale creditors, which can be
decomposed as the repayment made in full in all states of the world minus the option value to
default due to the limited liability of the bank.               ( ) is the value of the put option when the
strike price is given by    = (1 + i) M= (1 + f ) L.
     The contracting problem takes equity EG as given and chooses L to maximize the bank’s
expected payo¤ (11) subject to the incentive compatibility constraint for the bank to choose
the good portfolio, and the break-even constraint for the creditors to the global bank.                   The
incentive compatibility constraint is

                           EG (w)
                               ^     [         G   ( )]        EB (w)
                                                                   ^     [     B   ( )]                   (27)

where EG (w)
          ^ is the expected payo¤ of the good portfolio and                    G   ( ) is the value of the put
option with strike price     under the outcome distribution for the good portfolio. EB (w)
                                                                                        ^ and
 B   ( ) are de…ned analogously for the expected outcome and option values associated with the
bad portfolio. Writing        ( )=       B   ( )     G    ( ), (12) can be written more simply as

                                                      ( )        h                                        (28)

                                                          19
Incentive compatibility entails keeping leverage low enough that the higher option value to
default does not exceed the greater expected payo¤ of the good portfolio.

Lemma 2 There is a unique           that solves           ( ) = h, where      <1     .

   Lemma 2 is the global bank analogue of Lemma 1.                         Since the state price density is
given by the second derivative of the option price with respect to its strike price,                   ( ) =

                                0                 1


Thus       ( ) is single-peaked, reaching its maximum at = 1        . In particular,
                                               Z 1
                              lim     ( ) =        [FB (s) FG (s)] ds

                                            = EG (w)
                                                  ^               EB (w)
                                                                      ^ =h                               (30)

so that      ( ) approaches h from above as                ! 1.    Since     < 1 for a bank with positive
notional equity, we have a unique solution to                ( ) = h where the solution is in the range
where      ( ) is increasing. Therefore      <1            . This proves the lemma.

2.3.5     Solution for Cross-Border Capital Flows

We can now solve the contracting problem fully and close the model.                      For the global bank,
the good portfolio has payo¤ 1          with certainty (as seen in (25)). Since the bank has zero
probability of default whenever      <1       , Lemma 2 implies that the global bank’s probability
of default is zero.   From the participation constraint of the creditors to the global bank, the
funding rate is therefore given by the risk-free rate.

where i is the risk-free interest rate.

   The solution is fully determined by the parameters of the problem.                First, ' and    are
uniquely determined by the underlying parameters of the contracting problem, as stated in
Lemma 1 and Lemma 2. Next, our assumption that the regional demand for credit is perfectly
elastic pins down the regional lending rate at 1 + r. Finally, the borrowing rate 1 + i for the
global bank is the risk-free rate.
   This last feature is reminiscent of Geanakoplos (2009) and Fostel and Geanakoplos (2012),
who also have the feature that borrowers’probability of default is zero, but for reasons that are

                                                          21
di¤erent from our model. However, the common thread is that actual default does not happen
precisely because the contract addresses the possibility of default.
     The expressions for total credit in the regions (34) can be written in long hand as:

                   Total private   Aggregate bank capital (regional + global)
                                 =                                                              (36)
                      credit                        regional      global
                                     1    spread
                                                    leverage     leverage
Here, ' and      are interpreted as normalized leverage measures (regional and global) that lie
in the unit interval (0; 1). The expression for total cross-border lending (35) can similarly be
expressed in long hand as

                    Total cross-    Global and weighted regional bank capital
                                  =                                                             (37)

                                                    leverage     leverage
     The BIS banking statistics on external claims is our empirical counterpart to L. The solution
highlights how cross-border lending is a combination “push”and “pull”factors.

2.4     Global Factors in Capital Flows
In preparation for our empirical investigation, consider the impact on L of shocks to global
bank equity EG and global bank (normalized) leverage . Then, neglecting for the moment the
interest spread term for notational economy, the comparative statics impact on L can be written
as
                       @L       @L
                 L '       EG +
                      @ER       @
                         1          (1 ' ) ER ' (EG + ER ' ) ( ')
                    =        EG +
                      1 '                      (1 ' )2
                         1            '
                    =        EG + C                                                             (38)
                      1 '           1 '
where C is private credit in the recipient economy, as given in (34).
     The …rst term in (38) gives the impact of a marginal increase in global bank equity         EG
through the leverage of the banking sector.      When global bank leverage is high (        is high),

                                                22
each dollar of global bank equity translates into higher capital ‡ows through the coe¢ cient
1= (1    ' ).    Thus, the …rst term in (38) suggests that capital ‡ows are increasing in global
bank equity and banking sector leverage.
     The second term in (38) gives the impact of the change in the leverage of global banks, given
by       . The intuition is that the change in leverage will impact lending through the existing
infra-marginal capital held by global banks, where each dollar of the global bank’s existing
equity is leveraged up to a higher multiple. We can summarize the empirical implications of
our comparative statics on the global factors as follows

Empirical Hypothesis 1. Cross-border lending is increasing in the level of global banks’
        leverage, the growth in the global banks’leverage, and the growth of global banks’equity.

     There is an analogous set of predictions concerning local factors that rest on the equity and
leverage of the local banks from our closed form solution for L given by (35). We can summarize
the empirical implications on the local factors as follows

Empirical Hypothesis 2. Cross-border lending is increasing in the level of local banks’lever-
        age, the growth in the local banks’leverage, and the growth of local banks’equity.

     The …nal prediction concerns the spread (1 + r) = (1 + i), which is the spread between the
local lending rate 1 + r and the risk-free interest rate 1 + i, which is the funding rate of the
global banks.

Empirical Hypothesis 3 Cross-border lending is increasing in the interest rate spread between
        the local lending rate r and the risk-free interest rate of the wholesale funding currency i.

     Our empirical investigation addresses these three hypotheses by …nding empirical proxies for
the global and local variables, and gauge their relative impact.

3     Sample and Variable De…nitions
Our sample draws on data from 46 countries, encompassing both developed economies and
emerging and developing economies, but excluding o¤shore …nancial centers. Because we wish
to analyze the global banking channel, the criterion for inclusion is whether foreign banks play
an economically signi…cant role in the country’s …nancial system.       In addition to developed
economies, we select countries with the largest foreign bank penetration, as measured by the
number of foreign banks and by the share of domestic banking assets held by foreign-owned
local institutions from the Claessens, van Horen, Gurcanlar and Mercado (2008) dataset.
    The countries included in our sample are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil,
Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania,
Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia,
Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom
and Uruguay.
    Our de…nition of capital ‡ows   L is the growth (log di¤erence) of the claims of BIS-reporting
banks on counterparties in a particular country as given by the BIS Locational Statistics Table
7A. The key organizational criteria of the BIS locational statistics data are the country of
residence of the reporting banks and their counterparties as well as the recording of all positions
on a gross basis, including those vis-à-vis own a¢ liates. This methodology is consistent with
the principles underlying the compilation of national accounts and balances of payments, thus
making the locational statistics appropriate for measuring capital ‡ows in a given period.

3.1    Proxies for Global Factors
Empirical hypothesis 1 highlights the leverage and (book) equity of global banks that facilitate
cross-border bank lending. As for the leverage of the global banks, our empirical counterpart
should ideally be measured as the leverage of the broker dealer subsidiaries of the European
global banks that facilitate cross-border lending. However, the reported balance sheet data for

European banks are the consolidated numbers at the holding company level that includes the
much larger commercial banking unit, rather than the wholesale investment banking subsidiary
alone.                              For the reasons discussed in Adrian and Shin (2010), broker dealers and commercial
banks will di¤er in important ways in their balance sheet management and with the broker
dealer sector being a closer mirror on the wholesale funding operations of the global banks. For
this reason, we use instead the leverage of the US broker dealer sector from the Flow of Funds
series published by the Federal Reserve as our empirical proxy for global bank leverage (Global
Leverage). To the extent that US broker dealers dance to the same tune as the broker dealer
subsidiaries of the European global banks, we may expect to capture the main forces at work.
     The left panel of Figure 8 plots the leverage series of the US broker dealer sector from 1990.
Leverage increases gradually up to 2007, and then falls abruptly with the onset of the …nancial
crisis. The right panel of Figure 8 shows how US broker dealer leverage is closely associated
with the risk measure given by the VIX index of the implied volatility in S&P 500 stock index

chart corroborates the …ndings in Adrian and Shin (2010) who pointed to the close association
between the leverage of the Wall Street investment banks and the VIX index.
   Table 1 presents OLS regressions with robust standard errors where broker dealer leverage is
the dependent variable and the one quarter-lagged log of the VIX index as the right-hand side
variable. Column 2 includes also a post-crisis dummy. Thus, Table 1 suggests an alternative
approach to our empirical investigation where we use the VIX index as an alternative empirical
proxy for the leverage of the global banks. Such an approach has the virtue of grounding our
analysis on a variable which has also been used by …nance researchers for asset pricing exercises.
It also provides a point of contact with Forbes and Warnock (2012) who have highlighted the
explanatory power of the VIX index for gross capital ‡ows.
   Importantly, we will investigate whether the VIX index fully captures the information value
inherent in broker dealer leverage by including the residuals from the OLS regressions in Table
1 as an explanatory variable and see whether the variable is signi…cant.
   The other global variable predicted by the theory is the growth in the equity of global banks.
Non-US global banks, especially European global banks, were active in US dollar intermediation,
as mentioned above. To capture the role of global banks’equity, we use the change in the total


                                                     26
book value of equity of the largest (top 10) non-US commercial banks by assets from Bankscope
as a proxy for the growth in equity of international banks (Global Equity growth). Ideally, we
would like to capture the equity of the broker dealer subsidiary of the bank, rather than the
equity of the bank as a whole. However, provided that the book equity devoted to the wholesale
banking business remains a steady proportion of the bank’s overall equity, the use of our proxy
would be justi…ed. Bankscope has historical banking data from 1997, hence the variable Global
Equity growth is available since 1998.

3.2       Proxies for Local Factors
Our empirical hypothesis 2 highlights the leverage and equity of local banks that facilitate cross-
border bank lending. As a proxy for local leverage we use the ratio of bank assets to capital
(Local Leverage) from the World Bank WDI database. Following a similar argument for the use
of the VIX as a proxy for global bank leverage, we also use the log volatility of the local stock
market index computed as the 360-day standard deviation (from the World Bank Financial
Development and Structure Dataset, updated September 2012).
   As a proxy for local equity growth, we use the commercial banks’ net income to yearly
averaged total assets (ROA) (Local Equity growth) from the World Bank Financial Development
and Structure Dataset. By using this proxy we implicitly assume that a constant fraction of the
earnings is retained as equity.
   In addition to the variables considered by our theory, we also include several local control
variables as possible push and pull factors of capital ‡ows. We include the log di¤erence of the
real exchange rate ( RER), where RER is computed as the log of nominal exchange rate*(US
CPI/local CPI). The nominal exchange rate is in units of national currency per U.S. Dollar (from
the IMF’s IFS database). Bruno and Shin (2013) …nd in vector autoregression (VAR) exercises
that a decline in the US Fed Funds rate is followed by an increase in US broker dealer leverage,
acceleration of capital ‡ows and a depreciation of the US dollar. In our setting, therefore, we
include    RER as an additional control.
   The annual growth rate in money supply ( M2) is measured as the di¤erence in end-of-

                                                27
year totals relative to the level of M2 in the preceding year (from the World Bank WDI). Our
rationale for examining the growth in M2 arises from the domestic monetary implications of
capital ‡ows.   The regional banks in Figure 5 do not have a currency mismatch, raising US
dollar funding and lending in dollars.      However, the local borrowers - typically non-…nancial
corporates - may have a currency mismatch either to hedge export receivables or to engage in
outright speculation on local currency appreciation. One way for them to do so is to borrow
in US dollars and then deposit the local currency proceeds into the domestic banking system.
Such deposits would be captured as corporate deposits, a component of M2. Thus, we would
predict that capital in‡ows are associated with increases in M2.
     GDP and In‡ation are the country percentage change in GDP and In‡ation, respectively,
from the previous year (data from the WEO). Speci…cally, faster growing economies could have
greater demand for credit whereas higher in‡ation could limit the supply of credit.       Debt to
GDP is the change in government gross debt to GDP (from WEO) and it another factor that
potentially a¤ects credit conditions. Overall, with the inclusion of these additional variables and
of country …xed e¤ects we aim at capturing both observable and unobservable country factors
related to credit and supply demand that a¤ect banking ‡ows.
   Finally, our empirical hypothesis 3 predicts that cross-border lending is increasing in the
interest rate spread between the funding rate f and the risk-free interest rate of the wholesale
funding currency i. We construct the variable         Interest Spread as the di¤erence between the
local lending rate and the US Fed Fund rate (from the IMF IFS) and then take the di¤erences
between quarters t and t    1.
   The variables    L,   Debt/GDP, In‡ation, and Bank ROA are winsorized at the 2.5% per-
centile to limit the e¤ect of the outliers. The sample period spans from the …rst quarter of 1996
(the …rst date covered in Table 7A of the BIS locational data) to the last quarter of 2011 but the
coverage of years and countries varies depending on data availability. Table 2 gives summary
statistics of our sample of 46 countries.

4.1     Panel Regressions for Bank Capital Flows
We now report the results of our panel regressions on the determinants of banking sector capital
‡ows. The speci…cation follows our closed-form solution for banking sector capital ‡ows given
by (37) and the empirical predictions from (38). Our closed form solution suggests that leverage
should enter both in levels and in changes (both positively) and the growth in banking sector
equity should enter positively. Our panel regressions are with country …xed e¤ects and clustered
standard errors at the country level:

where

        Lc;t is banking sector capital in‡ow into country c in period t, as given by the quarterly
      log di¤erence in the external claims of BIS reporting country banks on country c between
      quarters t and t   1;

      Global Factors encompass the leverage of the US broker dealer sector in levels and log
      di¤erence (Global Leverage and Global Leverage growth) and the log di¤erence in equity
      of global banks (Global Equity growth).

      Local Factors encompass the bank assets to capital ratio and its growth (Local Leverage
      and Local Leverage growth) and Bank return on assets ROA (Local Equity growth).

        Interest Spread is the …rst di¤erence in the spread between the local lending rate and
      the US Fed Fund rate.

      Other controls are as described in the data section and they aim at capturing local con-
      ditions that could drive capital ‡ows. In addition we use country-…xed e¤ects to control

                                                  30
        for any additional country-level e¤ect not captured by our control variables, including
        controlling for changes in credit demand at the country level.

      To reduce endogeneity concerns and maximize the period coverage, all variables are lagged
by one quarter (if at quarterly frequency) or by four quarters (if at yearly frequency), with the
exception of Global and Local Leverage growth and Global and Local Equity growth. The results
are presented in Table 3.      Global variables are listed in the top half of the table and local
variables are listed in the bottom half.
      We see from Table 3 that the global variables are highly signi…cant and enter with the
predicted signs. Column (1) is the speci…cation that includes only the variables Global Leverage,
Global Leverage growth and Global Equity. The panel within R2 is 11.1% in this speci…cation.
      We also see from Table 3 that the evidence on Local Leverage is less strong than for the
global variables. Only Local Equity growth is consistently positive and signi…cant, as predicted
by our theory. The panel within R2 of the speci…cation with Local Leverage in levels and growth
(column 2) is only 0.6% and it increases to 5.6% when Local Equity growth is included (column
3).
      The additional local variables in Table 3 enter with the predicted signs, albeit not statis-
tically signi…cant in every speci…cation, but they do not diminish the role of global variables.
Particularly notable is the variable RER which gives the price of dollars in local currency in
real terms, so that a fall in RER represents an appreciation of the local currency.       We see
that the coe¢ cient on     RER (which is lagged by one quarter in the estimation speci…cation) is
negative and highly signi…cant, indicating that a real appreciation between date t 1 to date t is
associated with acceleration in bank capital ‡ows between date t to date t + 1. In other words,
an appreciation of the currency leads to an acceleration of capital in‡ows, which is counter to
the intuition that a higher price should lead to a fall in demand, but which is consistent with
the evidence found in Bruno and Shin (2013).
      In addition, higher GDP growth, proxing for high domestic demand conditions, is positively
associated with capital ‡ows, whereas the deterioration of lending conditions (higher in‡ation)

Table 3. Determinants of banking sector capital ‡ows. This table reports the panel regressions for banking
sector capital ‡ows with country …xed e¤ects. The dependent variable is the quarterly log di¤erence of external
loans of BIS reporting banks to the country given by BIS Locational Statistics Table 7A. Global Leverage is
the leverage of the US broker dealer sector and Global Leverage growth is its quarterly growth. Global Equity
growth is the change in the dollar value of equity of the top 10 non-US banks. Local Leverage and Local Leverage
growth are the bank assets to capital ratio in levels and its growth, respectively. Local Equity growth is the
commercial banks’net income to total assets ratio. Interest Spread is the …rst di¤erence in the spread between
the local lending rate and the US Fed Fund rate. Other local variables are the log di¤erence of the real exchange
rate, GDP growth, Debt to GDP ratio growth, growth of M2 money stock, and In‡ation. p-values are reported
in parantheses. Standard errors are clustered at the country level.

and of public debt conditions act as push factors against cross-border lending. The expansion of
the domestic money stock is also associated with capital ‡ows, as consistently found in earlier
studies of capital ‡ows to emerging economies (for instance, Berg and Patillo (1998))
   Finally, we observe that the coe¢ cient of the   Interest Spread is positive and signi…cant as
predicted by our theory in speci…cation (6) when other variables are not included. However, it
loses signi…cance when used in conjunction with all other variables. Overall, Table 3 reveals
that our theoretical predictions receive broad support in the data. However, the role of global
bank leverage and global equity dominate on the local variables and hence the global variables
appear to be the factors that drive banking capital ‡ows.

4.2    Panel Regressions with VIX
Having con…rmed the main predictions of our theory, we now turn to our second set of panel
regressions where we employ the VIX index as an alternative empirical proxy for the global bank
leverage term    in our theory rather than using broker dealer leverage. Hence, we include the
(log of) VIX variable entering both in levels (Global VIX ) as well as in its quarterly growth
(Global VIX growth). In a similar vein, we use the historical volatility of the local stock index
both in levels (Local Leverage) as well as in its growth (Local Leverage growth) in lieu of bank
assets to capital ratio as our proxy for the ' variable. Unfortunately in this speci…cation we
cannot include Global Equity growth because its correlation with the VIX is about 57% and
the inclusion of both variables creates serious multicollinearity problems. Other controls are as
identical to those used in panel regressions in Table 3. We maintain the use of country-…xed
e¤ects to control for any additional country-level e¤ect not captured by our control variables.
The results are presented in Table 4.
   In Table 4, we see that the VIX in levels and in its growth are highly signi…cant and of the
predicted sign. Indeed, looking across the columns of Table 4, we see that the coe¢ cients on
these variables remain fairly stable to di¤erent speci…cations and highly signi…cant throughout.
In this context, ‡uctuations in the VIX Index (both in the level as well as its quarterly log
di¤erence) are (inversely) associated with shifts in the leverage of the banking sectors and hence

Table 4. Determinants of banking sector capital ‡ows. This table reports the panel regressions for banking
sector capital ‡ows with country …xed e¤ects. The dependent variable is the quarterly log di¤erence of external
loans by BIS reporting banks given by BIS Locational Statistics Table 7A. Global VIX is the log of the end-
quarter VIX index and Global VIX growth is its quarterly growth. Local Volatility and Local Volatility growth
are the volatility of the local stock market index in levels and its growth, respectively. Local Equity growth is
the ratio of commercial banks’net income to total assets in the country. Interest Spread is the …rst di¤erence
in the spread between the local lending rate and the US Fed Fund rate. Global Leverage residual is the residual
from the OLS regression of the US broker-dealer leverage on lagged log VIX with the post-crisis dummy, as given
in column (2) of Table 1. Other local variables are the log di¤erence of the real exchange rate, GDP growth,
Debt to GDP ratio growth, growth of M2 money stock, and In‡ation. p-values are reported in parantheses.
Standard errors are clustered at the country level.

in the capital ‡ows through the banking sector. This con…rms the evidence on Global Leverage
found in Table 3.
   The economic magnitudes are also sizeable. For instance, the coe¢ cient on the VIX level is
around 3%. The size of the coe¢ cient implies a large impact of the VIX level on capital ‡ows.
For instance, compare the VIX index at 25 and the index at 15. In log term, the comparison
is between 3.22 and 2.71, so that the di¤erence is 0.51. Our results indicate that the di¤erence
in quarterly capital in‡ow rate with VIX at 15% versus 25% is roughly 0:51         0:03 ' 0:015,
implying a di¤erence in quarterly ‡ows of 1.5%. When annualized, this translates into a roughly
6.1% di¤erence. This sizeable impact illustrates well the important role played by measured
risks in determining capital ‡ows.
   We observe similar results when using Local Volatility, implying that ‡uctuations in the
local stock market volatility are (inversely) associated with shifts in the leverage of the local
banking sectors and consequently in banking capital ‡ows. The evidence on Local Volatility is
much stronger than the evidence on the bank assets to capital ratio found in Table 3 and it is
consistent with the role played by local leverage predicted by our theory. Once again,   Interest
Spread is not signi…cant.
   In columns (5) and (6) we add the residual from the OLS regression of the broker-dealer
leverage variable on lagged log VIX and the post-crisis dummy, as given in column (2) of Table
2. The variable is called “Global Leverage Residual”. This residual captures the unexplained
portion of broker-dealer leverage not explained by the VIX. We however observe that the earlier
evidence remains unchanged. Actually, the residual becomes insigni…cant in column (6). We
interpret this as evidence that the VIX is an appropriate proxy for bank leverage, echoing the
earlier …nding in Adrian and Shin (2010) that the VIX index captures well the ‡uctuations in
the leverage of the Wall Street investment banks.
   Taking the comparative statics from equation (38) as a package, we conclude that the the-
oretical predictions receive broad support from both Table 3 and Table 4, although the role of
the global factors strongly dominate the local ones. As discussed already, global banks real-
locate internal funds raised in the US across locations which impacts capital ‡ows. Cetorelli

and Goldberg (2012a, 2012b) have documented such reallocations, providing evidence of cross
border, intra-bank funding ‡ows between US global banks and their foreign operations which
has an impact on foreign lending decisions. Our results build on their discussion by showing the
consequences of the internal capital market reallocations on aggregate outcomes and the global
nature of the bank leverage channel.

4.3     Robustness tests
4.3.1   Endogeneity

Our use of lagged variables in proxying for both global and local factors, as well as the use of
country …xed e¤ects mitigates the endogeneity problems in our panel estimates. Nevertheless,
it is important to complement our panel regressions with a more systematic investigation of
the robustness of our estimates to endogeneity. We do so by using dynamic panel Generalized
Method of Moments (GMM) methods due to Arellano and Bover (1995).             The panel GMM
estimator can be used to control for the dynamic nature of the banking ‡ows-banking leverage
relationships, while accounting for other sources of endogeneity like credit demand from local
banks, funding and lending costs (monetary policy) and other local country characteristics.
   Speci…cally, we implement a dynamic system GMM that uses a stacked system consisting of
both …rst-di¤erenced and level equations. Our assumption in the system GMM regression is that
all the regressors are endogenous. As discussed in Wintoki et al (2012) we need to choose with
parsimony the number of lags of the instrumental variables because the quadratic increase in the
number of instruments as the number of periods increases. The potential danger is that this may
bias the OLS estimates and bias the Hansen test for joint validity of the instruments towards
over-accepting the null hypothesis. In order to avoid over…tting and instrument proliferation,
we use one lag (the second quarter lag or the …rst annual lag depending on whether the variable
has a quarter or annual frequency) and combine instruments into smaller sets. By adopting this
speci…cation we end up using 23 instruments.
   The AR(1) test yields a p-value of 0.000. The AR(2) test yields a p-value of 0.585 which
means that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no second-order serial correlation. The

                                               36
results also reveal a Hansen J-statistic test of overidenti…cation with a p-value of 0.274 and
as such, we cannot reject the hypothesis that our instruments are valid. The system GMM
estimator makes the following additional exogeneity assumption that any correlation between
our endogenous variables and the unobserved (…xed) e¤ect is constant over time. We test this
assumption directly using a di¤erence- in-Hansen test of exogeneity. This test yields a p-value of
0.151 for the J-statistic produced by the di¤erence-in-Hansen test and as such we cannot reject
the hypothesis that the additional subset of instruments used in the system GMM estimates is
exogenous.
   Column 1 in Table 5 reports the results of the system GMM speci…cation which includes
one lag of the dependent variable     L as an explanatory variable. We see that all the global
variables remain statistically signi…cant at the 10.4% or 1% signi…cance level. In contrast, Local
Leverage remains insigni…cant and also Local Equity growth becomes insigni…cant. Overall,
the dynamic system GMM estimation gives us some assurance that the potential problems due
to endogeneity do not undermine our main conclusions drawn from our panel regressions and
con…rms the role of the global factors in driving banking capital ‡ows.

4.3.2   Additional Speci…cations

We then verify that our results are robust to the inclusion of year dummies. It may be the case
that unobserved global factors drive capital ‡ows. When adding year dummies, the variable
Global Equity growth is dropped for collinearity reasons; however, column 2 in Table 5 shows
that Global Leverage in levels and growth remain signi…cant.
   We then further check that our results are robust to the di¤erent country-level regulations
that may a¤ect the leverage decisions of banks in each country. Following the established
literature, we construct the Capital regulatory index from the Barth, Caprio, Levine (2001, and
subsequently updated) Bank Regulation and Supervision database. The index measures capital
stringency in the banking system, with higher values indicating greater stringency. Because the
index is available only for two years (2003 and 2007), it gets dropped in the panel estimation
by the country …xed e¤ects. We therefore run an OLS of our main speci…cation and include the

                                               37
Capital Regulatory index but not the country-…xed e¤ects. Column 3 shows that the earlier
evidence remains unchanged.
    We also address whether our results vary systematically between developed and developing
countries. We create a dummy Dev which is equal to 1 when a country is a developing economy,
and 0 otherwise.3 We then interact the dummy Dev with our global variables. Columns 4, 5, and
6 of Table 5 show that the global variables by themselves are signi…cant in all the speci…cations,
while their interaction terms with the dummy Dev are not signi…cant. This suggests that there
is little di¤erence between the group of developing countries from the developed countries and
that bank leverage decisions have global impact that is not di¤erentially larger for emerging
economies. In other words, the e¤ect of our global factors in indeed global.
    Finally, we use an additional variable the captures the e¤ect of global banks borrowing
activities on cross-border ‡ows as documented by Cetorelli and Goldberg (2012b). Cross-border
banking has been closely associated with the activity of European global banks that borrow
in US dollars from money market funds in the United States.                     The institutional backdrop
given by the role of European global banks points to the importance of the supply of cross-
border bank funding, which we capture through the series on net intero¢ ce assets of foreign
banks in the United States published by the Federal Reserve in its H8 data on commercial
banks, for the speci…c category of foreign-related institutions. We then construct the variable
Intero¢ ce growth as the percentage growth in net intero¢ ce assets of foreign banks in the US,
winsorized at the 2.5%, and we add it to our main speci…cation 39. Column 7 shows that the
variable Intero¢ ce growth is positive and signi…cant, while the other results remain unchanged,
re‡ecting the consequences on cross-border ‡ows of global banks activities engaged in supplying
US dollar funding to other parts of the world.
    In untabulated regressions we also add additional control variables to our main speci…cation
39, like the Chinn-Ito Index measuring a country’s degree of capital account openness or the

level of legal enforcement in a country (the ICRG Law and Order Index), and the previous
results remain unchanged.

4.4       Banking and Financial Crises
We now ask to what extent are our empirical results are a¤ected by …nancial and banking crisis.
We start by considering the period of the European sovereign debt crisis. In 2009 fears of a
sovereign debt crisis started developing among investors. European banks funding conditions
worsened forcing European banks the process of deleveraging. To the extend that European
banks are primary responsible for cross-border capital ‡ows, we verify that our main conclusions
remain unchanged if we exclude the period post-2008 (Table 6, column 1).
   We further verify the sensitivity of our results to the period of the US crisis. Chudik and
Fratzscher (2012) …nd that the US crisis di¤ers from the European crisis in terms of their
dynamic properties. In addition, the years 2007 and 2008 saw a rapid deleveraging of the US
broker dealer balance sheets. Table 6 column 2 shows that our results remain unchanged also
to the exclusion of the period 2007-2008.
   We then include individual local country bank crisis dummies, for each year in which a
country experiences a banking sector crisis as classi…ed by Laeven and Valencia (2010). Column
3 shows that during a local banking crisis, the individual country banking crisis dummy has a
negative e¤ect on banking ‡ows but this does not alter the role of our global variables.

4.5       Accounting for Global Factors
One of our key motivations has been to ascertain the extent to which global “supply push”vari-
ables are responsible in driving cross-border banking sector ‡ows rather than the local “demand
pull”factors. Although we have veri…ed that Global Leverage and Global Equity are signi…cant
factors driving ‡ows, we now go one step further and address the explanatory power of global
factors
   We run six di¤erent OLS regression as modi…ed speci…cations of our benchmark panel regres-
sion 39. The regressions include the following variables: 1) all the local variables (Local Leverage

benchmark panel regression augmented by yearly dummies. Column 3 reports OLS results with the Capital
Regulatory Index added to our main speci…cation but excluding country …xed e¤ects due to collinearity. Columns
4 to 6 report regressions where global variables are interacted with a dummy Dev, which is equal to 1 when a
country is a developing economy and 0 otherwise. Column 7 includes the variable Intero¢ ce growth in our main

rate, GDP growth, Debt to GDP ratio growth, growth of M2 money stock, and In‡ation as additional local
control variables. Standard errors are clustered at the country level.

variables plus country dummies plus all the global variables (i.e. our main speci…cation 39); 6)
all the local variables plus country dummies plus time dummies. We then compare the adjusted
R-squared from each regressions. In essence, model (4) estimates a statistical upper bound on
the importance of global-speci…c factors in driving banking ‡ows by projecting the dependent
variable      L on time dummy variables. By comparing the relative size of the R2 between our
favored speci…cation and the one using time dummies or local variables , we can ascertain the
proportion of variation that can be explained by our global and local variables.4
    Table 7 reports the adjusted R-squared statistics obtained from the above 6 OLS speci…ca-
tions. In Panel A we report the results for the full sample. We see that local variables alone
explain 10.9% of the variation (model 1), while the global variables alone explain 12.5% (model
3). When comparing model 3 with the hypothetical upper bound for a model that has all global
factors (model 4), we see that our global variables account for 0:125=0:236 = 53% of the total
global variation. Comparing model (4) to model (2), we see that the adjusted R-squared of
the time dummy regression is 2.16 times that of the regression with country-speci…c variables
and country-dummies. Consequently, the global characteristics dominate local characteristics
in explaining the variation in banking ‡ows. In model (6), we estimate our main speci…cation
(5) but with time dummies instead of global characteristics. The improvement in adjusted R2
is trivial.
    We then extend our analysis by exploring the extent to which speci…c country characteristics

     Our approach is in the spirit similar to the analysis performed by Doidge, Karolyi Stulz (2007) in an unrelated
context of cross-country comparisons of corporate governance. Doidge, Karolyi Stulz (2007) attempt to measure
the relative importance of …rm-level factors and country-level factors in corporate governance. Their method
proceeds by running regressions with di¤erent speci…cations with country-level variables and …rm-level variables
(See, Doidge, Karolyi Stulz (2007, Table 2)). They compare their results with that from a regression with
country dummies, which gives a statistical upper bound on the importance of country-speci…c characteristics.
By comparing the R2 obtained from their favored speci…cation with the R2 from the country dummy regressions
that give the upper bound, they are able to gauge the proportion of the total variation that can be captured by
the country level variables.

in‡uence our results. In other words, we are interested in exploring the country heterogeneity
that may explain cross border ‡ows. We split the countries between the upper (High) and lower
(Low) tercile distribution of the size of cross-border ‡ows (BIS Table 7A, Panel B), country
openness (Chinn-Ito Index, Panel C), developed versus developing countries (Panel D) and legal
enforcement (Law and Order, Panel E).
    Panels B and C show that global factors have a signi…cantly larger impact than local factors
in countries more …nancially open and where the ‡ow of capital is bigger. For instance, for
countries subject to a large size of capital in‡ows (Panel B, High) model 3 gives R2 = 0:189,
which is 3.15 times higher than model 2 R2 = 0:06 meaning that our global variables explain
more of the variation in banking ‡ows than local characteristics. The greater importance of
global characteristics is most obvious when we use time dummy variables (0:462=0:06 = 7:7
times larger). In countries with lower capital in‡ows (Panel B, Low) global factors still explain
more than local factors but such a di¤erence is lower in magnitude.
    Panel D shows results for the sample of developed and developing countries. Albeit global
factors remain more important then local factors (model 4 versus model 2) in explaining the
banking ‡ows in both developed and developing countries, local factors appear to gauge impor-
tance more in developing countries than in developed ones (model 2, Developed vs Developing).
A similar picture emerge from Panel E where, in the absence of strong legal foundations pro-
tecting and favoring global cross border transactions, local pull and push factors explain more
of the variation in banking ‡ows (model 2, High vs Low).
    Taken together, this analysis con…rms that global factors explain much more of the variation
in cross-border ‡ows. At the same time, they point out at heterogenous e¤ects of global factors
depending on the magnitude of the in‡ows, level of …nancial openness and legal development.


5     Concluding Remarks
Our framework suggests a way of identifying and measuring global liquidity in terms of the
aggregate cross-border lending through the banking sector. Observed capital ‡ows re‡ect the


                                               44
interaction of the supply and demand for wholesale funding between global and local banks,
where the liabilities of local banks serve as the assets of the global banks. The evidence in our
paper suggests that the global “supply push” factors in the form of the leverage cycle of the
global banks are the key determinants of capital ‡ows. Our …ndings reinforce the argument in
Borio and Disyatat (2011), Obstfeld (2012a, 2012b) and Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012) on the
importance of gross capital ‡ows between countries in determining …nancial conditions. Our
…ndings complement the traditional emphasis on the current account and the net external asset
positions of countries as the determinant of the long-run sustainability of the current account,
as discussed in Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007) and Gourinchas and Rey (2007).5
   Our framework is geared toward the banking sector, and complements earlier research that
has focused on portfolio ‡ows (such as Hau and Rey (2009) who examined equity portfoliio ‡ows).
In this sense, our framework addresses the renewed focus on the banking sector when examining
the causes of the European …nancial crisis. The credit boom in Ireland and Spain were …nanced
primarily through the banking sector (see Allen, Beck, Carletti, Lane, Schoenmaker and Wagner
(2011), Lane (2013) and Lane and Pels (2011)).
   Our …ndings open up a number of avenues for future research, both theoretical and empirical.
We have highlighted the role of …nancial intermediaries in their use of wholesale bank funding.
Cross-border banks intermediate such funding, and the composition of their liabilities can be
expected to re‡ect the state of the …nancial cycle and risk premiums ruling in the …nancial
system. Thus, future work on early warning indicators may usefully draw on the behavior of
the banking sector over the cycle.6 Although banking sector ‡ows are just one component of
overall capital ‡ows, it is a procyclical component that plays a prominent role in transmitting
…nancial conditions.      The incorporation of the banking sector in traditional macroeconomic
models is at an early stage, but the development of such an agenda would be a promising way
to address the outstanding issues in international …nance.
