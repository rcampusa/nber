                                             ABSTRACT

Gains from productivity and knowledge transmission arising from the presence of foreign firms have
received a good deal of empirical attention, but theoretical micro-foundations for this mechanism are
limited. Here we develop a dynamic model in which foreign experts may train domestic workers who
work with them. Gains from training can in turn be decomposed into two types: (a) obtaining knowledge
and skills at a lower cost than if they were self-learnt at home, (b) producing domestic skilled workers
earlier in time than if the domestic economy had to rediscover the relevant knowledge through "reinventing
the wheel." We use fixed effects and nearest neighbour matching estimators on a panel of plant-level
data for Colombia that identifies the use of foreign experts, to show that these experts have substantial,
although not always immediate, positive effects on the wages of domestic workers and on the value
added per worker.

1.     Introduction

There now exists a well-developed empirical literature on the transmission of

technical/managerial knowledge and productivity “spillovers” between countries and whether

trade or investment is a more important channel of transmission (Keller 1998, 2002ab, Haskel

and Slaughter 2002, Gong and Keller 2003, Javorcik and Spatareanu 2003 and Javorcik 2004).

       In the latter vein of literature, several different ideas for the micro-foundations of the

transmission mechanism have been proposed or modelled. Theoretical models have looked at

linkages as a source of productivity spillovers, so that upstream and/or downstream firms benefit

from the arrival of multinationals (Markusen and Venables, 1999). This has generally been in the

form of variety effects from supporting an increased number of intermediate or final goods.

Rodriguez-Clare (1996), for example, develops a model of how the multinationals can improve

welfare by generating more linkages compared to the linkages that would be generated by the

domestic firms they displace from the labor market. The second stream of theoretical analysis

looks at workers or local firms learning from watching or working for foreign firms with a

resulting increase in their productivity (Ethier and Markusen 1996, Fosfuri, Motta, and Rønde

2001, Markusen 2001, Glass and Saggi 2002). Empirical work in search of spillovers to local

firms include Haddad and Harrison (1993), Aiken and Harrison and Lipsey (1996), Blomström

and Kokko (1998), Blomström and Sjöholm (1999), Aitken and Harrison (1999), Blalock (2002),

Javorcik and Spatareanu (2003) and Javorcik (2004). Other empirical literature has documented

that local firms and their managers often get their start as employees of multinational firms (Katz

1987, Hobday 1995, Hall and Khan 2003).

       Very little in this literature is directed at modelling the precise micro-mechanism of how

foreign skilled workers impart those skills to domestic workers. To close this gap is the purpose

of our paper. We focus on direct imports of the services of foreign experts as a method of both


                                                  2
providing an important good or service and for training domestic workers faster and/or cheaper

than they can learn on their own. We depart from the tradition of comparative steady-state

analysis used in new growth theory, since we want to explicitly consider timing issues rather than

merely steady-state levels and growth rates. For this reason, we use a very simple competitive

constant-returns model with no spillovers, externalities, or other bells-and-whistles.

       Firms and workers are initially identical in the model in period 1. In period 2, any/all

firms can choose to hire foreign experts for one period. Due to the general-equilibrium structure

of the model, there are ranges of parameters for which some firms do and some do not hire

foreign experts. Workers in firms hiring foreign experts have a higher productivity in period 2

and (generally) in period 3. In period 4, productivity in firms not hiring foreign experts catches

up to those that do.

       The model solves for the wage profiles of workers in firms that use foreign experts and

those that do not as a basis for our empirical section. In general, the model predicts that workers

in firms with foreign experts should accept lower wages in period 2 in exchange for higher wages

in period 3. However, if there are perfect spillovers to the other firms or if foreigners are just

used to substitute for scarce skilled workers in period 2, this effect is not present; that is, there is

no observed effect of foreign experts on the wages of those in firms with versus without foreign

experts.

       Our empirical section uses Colombian Manufacturing Surveys (1977-1991), where the use

of foreign experts is identified in each period (if any) for each plant. The surveys contain a

sample of 304 plants for which we observe three distinct stages – before employing any foreign

experts, while foreign experts remain with the plant, and after they leave – and this information

allows us to evaluate contemporaneous and posterior impact of the experts on the wages of

skilled and unskilled workers and labor productivity. We find the impact to be large and positive


                                                    3
(although not always immediate). However, the longer the plant postpones the decision to hire

foreign experts, the smaller is the experts’ contribution to the increased wages or productivity.

       Perhaps the most important challenge to our analysis is that the decision to hire a foreign

expert is non-random, and the factors that enter into this decision are likely to have an element of

personal choice on behalf of the plant’s manager and are not directly observable. Plant fixed-

effects and nearest neighbor matching estimators are used to overcome this problem. In the

former we include plant fixed effects to remove the impact of any time-invariant characteristics

and find that the use of foreign experts increases the wages of skilled workers and value added

per worker by about 11 percent in the post-expert period. In the latter we use a number of

observable plant characteristics to pair the plants employing foreign experts with similar plants

who don’t and find that the use of foreign experts raises wages of unskilled and skilled workers

by 5 and 6 percent respectively in the post-expert period. The impact on the value added per

worker is approximately 8 percent and is present in both contemporaneous and post-expert

periods.

2.      The four-period model

Our model is a competitive, perfect-foresight Arrow-Debreu style general-equilibrium model.

There are four time periods, which deserves some comment. The first period is to establish a

“before” wage for skilled workers. Foreign experts can be used in the second period. Two “after”

periods are used in order to focus on the timing effects of using foreign experts. Workers in firms

that use foreign experts at t = 2 get a productivity boost in period 3, while workers that don’t

catch up to the former in period 41. The following outlines the model.

     (a) There are four time periods

     (b) There are two goods, X and Y; both sectors competitive, constant returns to scale

     (c) There are two factors, R and a (initially) homogeneous supply of unskilled labor L

     (d) Y is produced from a sector-specific factor R and unskilled labor L

     (e) X is produced using labor that grows in productivity over time through learning-by-doing.

         X is non-traded.

     (f) Foreign experts may also be used in X production in period 2 working with domestic

         labor in fixed proportions.

     (g) Learning by X sector workers is embodied in the workers and is sector specific.

     Let subscript t denote time period. Yt is produced from Rt , and Lt :

         Yt = Y ( Rt , L yt )                                                                           (1)

The role of R is to add convexity to the model: unskilled workers going to train must be drawn

from the Y sector at increasing cost in terms of Y.

         At time t = 1, there is a once-and-for all division of the homogeneous labor supply L1 into

Y sector workers and X sector workers. With homogeneity and perfect foresight, all workers earn

the same present value of wages over the four time periods.
1
 “Firms” are not well defined in such a model, but we will use that term rather than talk about production activities,
which would probably be more elegant.

                                                          5
        L1 = L y + Lx                                                                          (2)

        In period 1, X sector workers produce output according to the simple relationship

         X 1 = π 1 Lx                                                                          (3)

where π is a measure of productivity. At t = 2, there can exist either or both of two firm types

(more correctly, there are two production activities), one that uses only domestic workers (type-d)

and one that uses foreign experts, F, (type-f) working with domestic workers, where the total

number of domestic workers is the number given by Lx in (2) and (3).

         X d 2 = π d 2 Ld                      [
                            X f 2 = π f 2 min L f , αF   ]       Lx = Ld + L f   πd2 < π f 2   (4)

where α is just a scaling parameter (the number of domestic workers per foreign worker) that

plays little role in our analysis. Outputs from the two firm types are homogeneous.

        Workers who work with foreign experts may learn more, and this is then reflected in

period 3 outputs.

         X d 3 = π d Ld     X f 3 = π f 3L f       π d3 ≤ π f 3                                (5)

The special case where πd3 = πf3 has two interpretations. The first is that foreign experts simply

relieve a labor shortage and allow more output to be produced at t = 2 while domestic workers

learn by doing. There is no lasting effect on the workers who work with the foreign experts

relative to those that don’t. They are just substitutes for scarce, or still not very productive,

domestic workers. The second interpretation is that there is a perfect spillover of learning to

workers in type-d firms and this cannot be internalized by market charges (in other words, we are

defining a perfect spillover as πd3 = πf3 if type-f firms are present, πd3 < πf3 if they are not. More

on this later.




                                                             6
       It seems cheap to just assume that foreign experts have a permanent effect on the domestic

workers they are paired with, so we assume that all X sector workers have the same productivity

in period 4.

        X d 4 = π d 4 Ld      X f 4 = π f 4Lf         πd4 = π f 4                         (6)

This assumes that the domestic workers would eventually have figured out which nob to turn.

Foreign experts allow more or cheaper X production early on (πd2 < πf2), and quicken the

learning process of domestic workers if πd3 < πf3 or if there are spillovers.

       Foreign experts can be hired for a fixed price pfr in terms of good Y (X is non-traded as

noted earlier). In a partial-equilibrium model with fixed factor prices, only one of the two

activities to produce X at t = 2 in (4) would be active: either all domestic workers would work

with a foreign expert or no foreign experts would be hired. But in our general-equilibrium model,

hiring foreign experts is increasing costly in terms of foregone consumption, and so there are a

range of values of pfr, given values of other parameters, such that there can co-exist both type-d

and type-f firms in period 2. We are going to concentrate on this range, since it provides an

interesting comparison of the wage paths of workers in the type-d and type-f firms.

       Finally, we assume a positive rate of time preference in consumption, equal to a world

rate of interest. The country can pay for its foreign experts at t = 2 by selling Y in any period,

borrowing or lending at this interest rate. We have run the model assuming experts must be paid

with Y2 (no international borrowing or lending), and found that this makes no qualitative

difference.

       While the model seems conceptually simple, it involves a large number of dimensions:

inequalities/equations and unknowns. Secondly, which relationships hold with equality and

which are slack is determined in equilibrium. Together these two features make many of the

analytical tools of traditional comparative-statics analysis of little value. Thus we will solve the

                                                  7
model numerically. Each weak inequality is associated with a complementary non-negative

variable, so the model is formally called a non-linear complementarity problem.

       The model conceptually decomposes into three sets of relationships:

   (a) Zero-profit inequalities for all production activities, including the “production” of utility

       from inputs of X and Y; complementary variables are activity levels (quantities).

   (b) Market-clearing inequalities for all “commodities”, which is a general name for goods,

       factor, and utility (utility is modeled as produced and then purchased by the representative

       consumer). “Foreign exchange” is a commodity that is earned by exporting Y in one or

       more periods and is used to buy experts.

   (c) An income-balance equation for the representative consumer.

   The entire model is 56 weak inequalities in 56 unknowns. This is presented in the next section

which can be skimmed or even skipped with (we hope) little loss of continuity.

3.          The full model: inequalities and unknowns (may be skipped)

Notation is as follows, where prices are measured in real or utility terms (numeraire is the price

of buying one unit of intertemporal utility:

Yi , pyi             quantity and price of good Y at time t = i

Ri , pri             quantity and price of Y-sector-specific factor R at time t = i

L1 , pl1                      quantity and asset price (not rental price) of unskilled labor L at time t = 12

Ui , pui             quantity and (rental) price of unskilled labor U at time t = i

S1 , ps1                      quantity and (rental) price of X sector (skilled) labor S at time t = 1

Sdi , pdi            quantity and (rental) price of X sector (skilled) labor S at time t = i who do not

                     work with foreign experts at t = 2 (i = 2,3,4)

Sfi , pfi            quantity and (rental) price of X sector (skilled) labor S at time t = i who work with

                     foreign experts at t = 2 (i = 2,3,4)

F , pfr              quantity and price of foreign experts F at time t = 2

Ei , pe              quantity of “foreign exchange” at time t = i, price of foreign exchange at t=1.

X1 , pxi             quantity and price of good X at time t = i

Xdi , pxi            quantity and price of good X at time t = i (i=2,3,4) produced by workers who have

                     not worked with foreign experts

Xf1 , pxi            quantity and price of good X at time t = i (i=2.3.4) produced by workers who are

                     working with or have worked with foreign experts

            Factors Ri and L1 are fixed quantities. E is an artificial good: Y can be exchanged

(exported) for E and E can then be exchanged for imported foreign experts F. With borrowing

and lending allowed, E carries no subscript and thus exports of Y in any period can be exchanged

for foreign experts in any period at the world interest rate, denoted ρ.

2
    Analogous to the price of a unit of capital, p11 is the present value at t=1 of a unit of unskilled labor.
    pui, following line, is the single period rental price of unskilled labor at t=i.

                                                               9
          A key parameter in the model is cost, which is the number of units of Y that must be

exchanged for one for expert. Higher levels of cost are bad.

          Convexity in the model comes from the fixed factor R in the Y sector, which is assumed

Cobb-Douglas in the simulations: labor is drawn into training and X production at increasing cost

in terms of Y, with cyi(pui, pri) denoting the unit cost function for Yi.

          Utility or welfare is treated as a produced good. The flow of utility in period i and the

price of obtaining a unit of utility is

Wi , pwi                    quantity and price of welfare at t = i

W, pw                       quantity and price of intertemporal utility

The price of utility in period i and overall are given by standard cost or unit expenditure

functions, denoted cwi(pyi, pxi) and cw(pw1, pw2, pw3, pw4) respectively. A CES with an elasticity of

substitution greater than one is assumed in these functions (a value of 2 is used in the simulations

within and between periods) and future consumption is discounted at rate ρ.

          Here is the full model. Commodity and factor demands are found by the application of

Shepard’s lemma to cost and expenditure functions.

Inequalities are written as supply greater than or equal to demand, where a strictly greater-than

relationship implies that the price is zero (a free good) in equilibrium. Demands for goods/factors

exploit Shephard’s lemma in activities Yi and Wi where there is variable substitution among

inputs.

redundant by Walras’ Law, so the price of a unit of welfare, pw is used as numeraire and the

corresponding equation is dropped from the model. The model is coded in Rutherford’s MPS/GE,

a subsystem of GAMS and solve using the non-linear complementarity solver in GAMS.

4.     Results

We have run countless simulations of the model, altering the basic structure and parameter values

to see what qualitative and quantitative conclusions emerge. We will present a very sparse set of

outcomes here, but we feel that these are generally representative and robust to wide ranges in

parameter values and to minor changes in model specification.

       We do concentrate on parameter values such that the solution to the model has both typed

and type-f firms active in equilibrium. This puts some restrictions on the π’s and on the cost

parameter, where cost is the amount of Y that must be exchanged for a foreign expert as

discussed in the previous section. For higher values of cost, for example, only type-d firms

operate in equilibrium and only type-f for much lower values. The following are the productivity

parameters for our first simulation.

       π1 = 0.5        π d2 = 0.7      π d3 = 0.8        π d4 = 1.2

       π 1 = 0.5       π f2 = 1.0      π f3 = 1.0        π f4 = 1.2

       These are rather arbitrary indeed. Given equal productivities at t = 1 and t = 4, many

simulations show that the important feature of this is that π d3 < π f3 . Workers who worked with

foreign experts at t = 2 have an advantage over workers who didn’t at t = 3. This is very

important in determining the qualitative nature of the solution, as we shall see. Productivity

differences at t = 2 are not so important.

       Figures 1 and 2 give a solution to this model for a value of cost that supports both firm

types in equilibrium. Figure 1 shows the time path of wages for unskilled Y-sector workers (PU),

X sector workers in type-d firms (PD) and X sector workers in type-f firms (PF). Given the

competitive assumptions of the model and the initial homogeneity of labor, all workers earn the

same present value of earnings over the four time periods. Type-d and type-f workers have the

same productivity in period 4, type-d workers “catch up”, so they must have the same

                                                    13
competitive wage at t = 4 as shown. Type-f workers have a higher productivity at t = 3, and hence

they earn more than type-d workers at t = 3. This in turn is compensated for by workers in type-f

firms having to accept a lower wage at t = 2. Both types of X-sector workers earn less in periods

1 and 2 than Y-sector workers in compensation for higher earnings later on.

           Figure 1 offers several empirical predictions about what we might see in the data. Most

useful is the comparison between the firms that use foreign experts and those that don’t (recall

that all firms are ex ante identical in our model, so by assumption there is no firm-level

heterogeneity).3 We observe before, during and after periods for the foreign experts in Figure 1,

just as we can in our empirical section to follow. One result from Figure 1 is that wages in the

“during” period t = 2 are predicted to be lower for firms that use foreign experts, in compensation

for building the human capital of the workers later. Second, wages are predicted to be higher in

the “after” period t = 3 in the firms that use foreign experts. We will test these predictions in our

empirical section.

           Figure 2 shows real consumption profiles for our simulated economy, and then also

computes the profile with no foreign experts allowed. Here we see that the use of foreign experts

allows higher consumption in periods 2 and 3, the “learning on the quick” idea in terms of

consumption. Gains from trade are taken in the form of higher consumption in earlier periods.

           It is interesting and important to note, that the no-experts results in Figure 2 also occurs if

we switch the assumptions to allow for perfect spillovers to the firms that do not use foreign

experts. This is computed by raising π d3 from 0.8 to π d3 = 1.0 = π f3 if foreign experts are used

(type-f firms are active) but holding it at 0.8 otherwise. The effect of this, for the value of cost

and other parameters used, is that it is not profitable for type-f firms to enter, and thus the

existence of the spillovers blocks the beneficial effects that foreign experts might bring. It is often


3
    We shall relax the assumption of homogeneous firms in our empirical analyses.

                                                         14
forgotten in discussions about the beneficial effects of spillovers that these are market failures,

and the inability to internalize this positive externality can mean that the economy is worse off.

That is precisely what happens in this particular case: the lack of “property rights” prevents the

use of foreign experts and their beneficial effect is lost.

        Figures 3 and 4 compute a second interesting case by raising the value of π d3 to 1.0 as just

considered but by also lowering cost so that foreign experts will be used. Productivity parameters

are now:

        π 1 = 0.5      π d2 = 0.7      π d3 = 1.0        π d4 = 1.2

        π 1 = 0.5      π f2 = 1.0      π f3 = 1.0        π f4 = 1.2

        As suggested above, this case has two interpretations. First, the foreign experts just have a

temporary effect, they are like having additional workers around in an environment where skilled

workers are scarce. Once they go, productivity returns to the same level for all skilled workers.

Second, there is a perfect spillover to workers who have not worked with foreign experts in

period 3 (but caution, π d3 = 1.0 if foreign experts are present in period 2, it is 0.8 otherwise).

        With the lower value of cost relative to that in Figures 1-2, foreign experts are used in the

simulation of Figures 3-4. The wage path shown in Figure 3 is interesting and important. The

wage profile is identical for workers in both type-f and type-d firms. In general equilibrium,

wages for both types of skilled workers must be the same in periods 1,3,4, and so must be the

same in period 2 as well. The difference in productivity between the type-d and type-f workers at

t = 2 is exactly the payment to the foreign experts when both firm types exist in equilibrium.

        The importance of this result lies in its implications for empirical work that tries to

discern the productivity benefits from foreign experts by comparing firms that do and do not use

these experts. In the present case, we would detect no difference in the data, yet under the

spillovers interpretation, the economy is certainly getting a productivity boost from the foreign

                                                    15
experts. Somewhat ironically, the existence of spillovers may prevent the researcher from

discovering the benefits of foreign workers.

        Figure 4 presents three consumption profiles. The one denoted “equilibrium” corresponds

to the results in Figure 3. Then we assume that this is a case of perfect spillovers, and compute

the counterfactual of no spillovers, lowering π d3 to 0.8 regardless of whether or not foreign

experts are present. The difference between these two is interesting and instructive. The

elimination of spillovers leads to more foreign experts being hired at t = 2, and so consumption is

higher at t= 2 without spillovers. As emphasized above, the existence of non-internalized positive

externality may mean less, not more, following the general-equilibrium response of firms. But the

productivity gained by workers in type-d firms in period 3 leads to a higher consumption level

with spillovers at t = 3 and t = 4. The overall effect on intertemporal welfare is slightly higher

with spillovers in this case (not shown), but we cannot feel confident that this is a general result,

and such a general result is certainly not suggested by general theory (recall in the previous

simulation that introducing spillovers unambiguously decrease welfare).

        The dashed line in Figure 4 plots the consumption profile when foreign experts are

banned. Unlike the case of Figure 2, this is not the same as that with spillovers, since in the

present case foreign experts are used in spite of the spillover. This curve “no F” is identical to

that in Figure 2, and is reproduced just for comparison. Again, we see that the effect of foreign

experts is to increase consumption in the middle periods, raising welfare quicker than without

their services.

        Before continuing, we might note that there are surely institutional constraints which may

lead to difference wage paths even if our model is an otherwise good representation of reality. In

particular, it may not be possible for firms to pay (competitive equilibrium) low wages in early

periods in exchange for higher ones later. There are all sorts of reasons why this could be true,

                                                 16
ranging from minimum wages, to industry-wide wage setting (requiring common wages in typed

and type-f firms) to an imperfect ability to predict future productivity, and so forth.

       Of course, in a world of complete and enforceable contracts, this is not a problem: higher

earlier wages may be absorbed by lower later wages relative to the paths shown in Figures 1 and

3. Note that in our model, type-f workers are indifferent between either the PD or PF wage

profiles. While this is fine in theory, it will of course confound the empirical analysis since, as in

the case of Figure 3, there will be little measurable difference between workers in type-f and

type-d firms. This could be wrongly interpreted as the foreign experts having no effect.

       As a point of theory, having to pay higher wages early on in exchange for lower wages

later leads to precisely the type of hold-up problem in later periods that has been the subject of

much interest in the offshoring/outsourcing literature (see for example Ethier and Markusen

(1996), Fosfuri, Motta, and Rønde (2001), Markusen (2001), Antrás (2002, 2003), and Glass and

Saggi (2002)). While this is a very interesting issue, it is unfortunately beyond the scope of the

present paper. But the empirical caveat of the previous paragraph must be noted.

       With the results of Figures 1 and 3 in mind, we now turn to an empirical analysis.



5.     Empirical Analysis

Our theory model is primarily focused on the timing of learning and productivity increases, since

firms go to the same productivity values in the long-run regardless of whether or not foreign

experts are used. The latter allow the accumulation of skills cheaper and especially earlier. This

is not an easy thing to test empirically, at least with available data that we are aware of. Further,

the competitive labor-market assumption means that all workers share in the benefits, not just

those who work directly with the foreign experts.




                                                  17
       We are able to test the hypothesis that foreign experts visiting local plants share their

knowledge and improve the plant’s productivity. As a data source we employ plant level data

from the the Annual Manufacturing Survey (1977 – 1991) collected by Colombia’s

Departamento Administrative Nacional de Estadistica (DANE). AMS data covers all

establishments employing ten or more workers and, among other things, reports values of

production, domestic and foreign sales, imported and domestically purchased intermediate inputs,

wage bills by skill category, capital stocks, ownership, taxes and subsidies. Roberts and Tybout

(1996) provide a more comprehensive description of the data. There are several advantages using

these data. First, the plants report directly the number of foreign experts employed in a given

period. Secondly, the panel nature of the data allows us to discern the within-plant changes in

productivity resulting from the assistance from foreign experts. Thirdly, these statistics can be

supplemented by the interviews of the plant managers covering the same time frame to provide

more detail on the learning process (Morawetz, 1981; Berry and Escandon, 1994).

       We start by comparing the profiles of 715 plants who report having employed foreign

experts at least once during the period in question with the plants who have never done so. To

these means, we run a series of regressions, in which plant characteristics are regressed on the

dummy variable indicating whether the plant has employed any foreign experts during at least

one period over the 1977-1991 span, plant size and a set of industry, year and region fixed

effects. The findings from these regressions are presented in Table 1. The reported coefficients

can be interpreted as percentage difference between the two types of plants. Irrespective of

whether size is added as an additional covariate, the firms opting for the help from foreign expert

are more capital and skilled labor intensive, import a higher share of raw materials, and export a

higher share of their output. Their workers are more productive (measured by value added per

worker or sales per worker) and are better paid irrespective of the skill level.


                                                 18
        To truly exploit the panel nature of the data, for the rest of the analysis we restrict our

sample to 304 plants, which we observe during three distinct stages – before employing any

foreign experts, while foreign experts remain with the plant and after they leave.

To discern how foreign experts affect productivity, we estimate variations of the following wage

equation:

(1) ln(w) ijkt = α 0 + α 1 During ijkt + α 2 Afterijkt + δZ ijkt + Ind j + Timet + Area k + ε ijkt

        The subscripts i, j, k, and t denote plant, industry, region and time. Our dependent

variable is the natural logarithms of real wages for skilled and unskilled workers. We have

selected these variables on the supposition that wages are sufficiently correlated with the

workers’ marginal productivity. In fact, Verner (1999) finds that wages do not keep pace with

productivity gains, a finding that suggests that, if anything, we underestimate the effect of foreign

experts on the productivity of local workers. However, we also repeat the analysis using value

added per worker as the measure of worker productivity (see Cahuc et al. (2002) for discussion

against the use of output per worker).

        Our main independent variables are indicators for whether the plant is currently

employing foreign experts (“During”) or has employed them in the past (“After”). The omitted

category is the period prior to the employment of foreign experts. The coefficient on the variable

“During” can be potentially interpreted as the immediate impact of experts on productivity, since

more than half of the plants report only one period in which they employ a foreign expert.

        Drawing on the literature on firm-level determinants of wages, our vector of additional

controls, Z, includes total labor force, skill intensity, capital intensity, share of imported raw

materials (on the assumption that plants investing in imported and better quality raw materials are

also the ones seeking out higher quality workers), and regional wages to reflect opportunity costs.

Following the literature on rent sharing and efficiency wages, we also include plant’s market

                                                          19
share and sales per worker. All specifications include industry, year and region fixed effects. We

also experiment with other covariates, such as unemployment rates (to reflect opportunity costs),

industry protection measures, industry growth rates, and Herfindahl index of industry

concentration (on the assumption that the increasing degree of competition may raise the effort

level that the managers must exert to remain viable and will motivate them to turn to outside

sources). None of these factors is found to be important in the determination of wages or value

added per worker in our sample. Given a relatively small sample size, we choose a more

parsimonious specification and do not include these variables. To account for general forms of

heteroskedasticity and serial correlation in the error term, we compute robust standard errors

clustered by plant.

       We gather a general idea of the impact of foreign experts on domestic workers by

considering a specification in which we control only for industry, year and region effects. As

shown in Table 2, the percentage increase in wages and value added per worker relative to the

period prior to the employment of foreign experts is positive and significant. The wages increase

by approximately 8 percent. This increase is immediate (as evidenced by the positive coefficient

on the variable “During”) and is retained after the foreign experts leave. The instantaneous

increase in the value added per worker is a walloping 19 percent, which remains at a high 7

percent after the expert leaves the plant.

       Apart from the coefficient on the “During” variable in the specifications with wages for

skilled workers and value added per worker, the inclusion of additional controls does not change

much either the magnitude or the significance level of the impact of foreign experts on

productivity. Table 3 shows that after the foreign expert leaves the plant, workers’ wages are 5.3-

7.3 percent and value added per worker is 8.5 percent higher than during the period prior to the

visit by the foreign expert.


                                                20
       One may wonder whether the “intensity of the treatment” matters, i.e. whether the number

of employed foreign experts or the time they spend at the local plant matters for the productivity

gains. Unfortunately, there is not much variation in the data to test the first hypothesis: of all

non-zero values for the number of foreign experts, 85% report only 1 expert present. Similar

problem arises when we look at the number of periods with non-zero values for foreign experts –

half of the plants invite a foreign expert for only one period.

       As an alternative to using the number of periods the expert stays at the plant as a

continuous independent variable, in panels A and B of Table 4 we report the findings from the

analyses conducted separately for two types of plants: those who invite an expert only once and

those keep the experts for a longer time. The plants that invite an expert for only one period

experience a 12 percent jump in value added per worker. The wages of unskilled workers

increase by 8 percent after the expert leaves. Such pattern appears to be consistent with the

situation in which an expert is invited to fix (or set up) equipment or give recommendations

regarding product design, rather than for on-going training.

       The results reported in Panel B for the subset of the plants welcoming foreign experts on a

more consistent basis indicate that the benefits may be cumulative: the productivity starts

increasing while the expert is still at the plant (although we can no longer interpret this jump as

instantaneous) but the gain is at its highest after the expert leaves. This pattern appears to be

consistent with the theory of on-the-job training, which requires a longer interaction period and

generates more permanent productivity gains.

       Perhaps the most important challenge to our empirical analysis is that the decision to hire

a foreign expert is non-random, and the factors that enter into this decision are likely to have an

element of personal choice on behalf of the plant’s manager and are not directly observable. The




                                                 21
same factors may also be affecting the productivity of local workers. Plant fixed-effects and

nearest neighbor matching estimators are used to overcome this problem.

       In the former we include plant fixed effects to remove the impact of any time-invariant

characteristics. Here we rely solely on the within-plant variation to identify the effect of foreign

experts on the productivity of various types of workers. The inclusion of the fixed effects in

Table 5 dampens the impact of foreign experts on all three measures of productivity. The impact

remains statistically significant (and surprisingly unchanged in magnitude) only in the

specification for skilled workers. The loss of statistical significance is not surprising given that

the fixed effects along with year dummies absorb most of the variation in the data. Limiting the

sample to those plants that have employed foreign experts for longer than one period, bounces

both the magnitude and the significance of the coefficients up to the levels observed in the OLS

specifications. Both value added per worker and the wages of skilled workers increase by

approximately 11 percent after the visit by foreign experts. The wages of both skilled and

unskilled workers increase by approximately 3-5 percent during the visit by foreign experts,

however this increase is not statistically significant. The increase in the value added per worker

during the visit by foreign experts is 8 percent and is significant at 5 percent level, which is

perfectly consistent with the finding by other authors that wages do not keep pace with labor

productivity gains.

       To assess the validity of our findings, we also employ propensity score matching and

construct a counterfactual for the wages and productivity outcomes that the plant would have had,

had it not hired any foreign experts (see Arnold and Javorcik (2005) for an application of the

propensity score matching to the analysis of the knowledge transfer). We do so by paring up

each plant with foreign experts with a very similar plant employing only domestic workers based

on a number of “pre-treatment” – i.e. “prior to employment of foreign experts” – characteristics.


                                                  22
These characteristics include the plant’s total employment, capital intensity, profitability (sales

per worker), share of imported raw materials, market share, industry, and location. To reduce the

dimensionality problem when considering differences on more than one observable characteristic,

these characteristics are summarized into a single scalar (propensity score) reflecting the

probability of a plant to use foreign experts (the results from the logit estimation are reported in

Table 6). A plant without foreign experts but with a similar propensity score as a plant with

foreign experts will then be used as the missing counterfactual. The success of the propensity

score matching is confirmed in Table 7, where one can see that the matched firms display

considerable homogeneity as opposed to the stark differences we observe in the unmatched

sample.

       In Table 8 we repeat the fixed effects estimation of the effect of foreign experts on the

wages of skilled and unskilled workers and the value added per worker on the matched and the

unmatched samples. This effect, as in previous analyses, is captured by the contemporaneous

dummy “During” and the dummy for the post-treatment period “After.” There is a considerable

difference in the estimation results for the whole sample and the matched sample. The effects

estimated based on the whole sample are almost always larger and more significant than for the

matched sample. This illustrates the potential problem that the estimation on the full sample

suffers from endogeneity bias which leads to an overstatement of the causal effect of foreign

experts on wages and productivity. Taking the estimates in Table 8 at face value, our findings for

the matched sample indicate that foreign experts raise wages of unskilled and skilled workers by

5 and 6 percent respectively in the post-expert period. The impact on the value added per worker

by approximately 8 percent and is present in both contemporaneous and post-expert periods. The

matching method thus confirms our finding that the use of foreign experts exerts positive effect

on the workers’ wages and productivity.


                                                 23
       As noted earlier, our theory model is focused on the timing issue: obtaining skills earlier

in time through the use of foreign experts. This is not easy to test, but we think that we make

some progress using the approach shown in Table 9. The sample is again plants that have before,

during and after periods for use of foreign experts within the sample period. The dependent

variable is the log of post-expert wages or value added minus the log of pre-expert wages or

value added. Two new regressors are used instead of the “during” and “after” dummies. The first

is the “waiting time”, defined as the number of periods the plant waited before hiring an expert

(this is time-invariant and so precludes using plant fixed effects). The second is the pre-expert

level of the (log) of skilled wages, unskilled wages, or value added per worker corresponding the

dependent variable.

       Results in Table 9 indicate significant, negative effects of waiting time on changes in

wages (effects on values added per worker are economically small and statistically insignificant).

This is at least consistent with our theory, which is that workers eventually but slowly learn on

their own. Thus the longer the waiting time before using the foreign experts, the less is the their

contribution to increased wages. Adding the pre-expert level of wages or value as a regressor in

the three right-hand regressions of Table 9 cuts the effect of waiting time in half in the two wage

regression, but it remain statistically significant at the 10% level. Since we cannot observe the

origin/entry date of most firms (sample starts in 1977), the pre-expert level of wages may itself be

a reasonable proxy for experience and learning accumulated up to the beginning of the sample

period (industry and region fixed effects are used). To the extent that this interpretation is valid,

then the negative effects of the pre-expert wage (or value added) level in all three regressions is

again consistent with the model: if the higher initial wage or value added per worker indicates a

higher level of earlier skill accumulation, then a negative coefficient is expected. The fact that




                                                  24
these coefficients are all less than one indicates that the higher initial wage reduces but does not

eliminate the contribution of the foreign experts.

       Our analysis supports the general predictions of the theory that we are able to test with the

available data. The exception is that we do not find a negative effect on the workers’ wages

during the period(s) in which foreign experts are present at the plant. Recall that domestic

workers should be willing to accept temporarily lower wages in exchange for higher ones later,

once the training has taken place. It is the case that in the fixed-effects (Table 5) and matching

(Table 8) regressions, the “during” coefficients on wages are statistically insignificant and half

the size of the “after” coefficients on skilled wages. It is also the case that in these regressions,

the “during” point estimates on wages are about half the size of the “during” coefficient on value

added. We thus feel that the estimates do not stray too far from the theoretical predictions. As

discussed in the theory section, minimum wage requirements, industry-wide wage setting,

imperfect ability to predict future wages as well as trade unions may help explain the lack of

empirical evidence for this theoretical prediction.

       Finally, the results are consistent with the version of the model in Figures 1-2 where there

are no spillovers and where the productivity advantage persists after the experts leave.

Alternatively, the findings are not consistent with perfects spillovers and/or a result that

foreigners are simply “filling in” for scarce domestic workers (Figures 3-4).




                                                  25
6.     Conclusions

This paper provides theoretical micro-foundations for the mechanism of knowledge transfer, a

phenomenon much studied empirically but lacking theoretical underpinnings. It develops a

dynamic model in which knowledge is transmitted through one specific channel – the foreign

experts visiting the local plant and training its workers. The use of foreign experts allows the

accumulation of skills at a lower cost than if they were self-learnt at home and earlier in time than

if the domestic economy had to rediscover the relevant knowledge through “reinventing the

wheel.” Our model has a number of empirical implications for the wages of skilled and unskilled

domestic workers and their productivity, some of which we are able to test with the data from

Colombia. Specifically, we use fixed effects and nearest neighbour matching estimators on a

panel of plant-level data that identifies the use of foreign experts and show that these experts

have substantial, although not always immediate, positive effects on the wages of domestic

workers and on the value added per worker. We are also able to shed some light on the timing

issue and find that the longer the plant postpones the decision to hire foreign experts, the smaller

their contribution to the improved wage and productivity profiles.

       By and large, the empirical results are consistent with the theory. Although the expected

negative “during” effect on wages is positive, it is insignificant and much smaller than the “after”

effect as predicted. Results are consistent with the no-spillovers version of the model, and with

foreigners generating lasting productivity effects rather than just serving as “temporary help”

when domestic skills are poor.
