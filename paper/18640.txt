                                             ABSTRACT

We examine the effects of fast-food restaurant advertising on television on the body composition of
adolescents as measured by percentage body fat (PBF) and to assess the sensitivity of these effects
to using conventional measures of youth obesity based on body-mass index (BMI). We merge measures
of body composition from bioelectrical-impedance analysis (BIA) and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
(DXA) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with individual level data from
the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 and data on local fast-food restaurant advertising
on television from Competitive Media Reporting. Exposure to fast-food restaurant advertising on television
causes statistically significant increases in PBF in adolescents. These results are consistent with those
obtained by using BMI-based measures of obesity. The responsiveness to fast-food advertising is
greater for PBF than for BMI. Males are more responsive to advertising than females regardless of
the measure. A complete advertising ban on fast-food restaurants on television would reduce BMI
by 2 percent and PBF by 3 percent. The elimination of the tax deductibility of food advertising costs
would still leave a considerable number of youth exposed to fast-food advertising on television but
would still result in non-trivial reductions in obesity.

Introduction

       The proportion of youths between ages 12-19 who are obese has increased

substantially in the U.S. from 5.0 % in the mid-1970s to 18.1 percent in late 2000s [1].

Suspected social causes of youth obesity include television advertising of unhealthy,

nutrient-dense food on aimed at youths [2-4]. However, there has been little empirical

evidence confirming such an effect until recently [5]. Accordingly, there has been a call

from the White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity for additional research to

demonstrate the link between advertising and food preferences and consumption by

children and adolescents [6]. It is critical to provide further insights into the determinants

of childhood obesity to help efforts of policy-makers in the design of more effective

prevention policies. In a recent comprehensive study, Chou, Rashad, and Grossman [3]

(CRG hereafter) use individual-level data from the National Longitudinal Survey of

Youth 1997 (NLSY97), and find a positive and statistically significant association

between fast-food restaurant advertising on television and youths’ body mass index

(BMI) and the probability of being obese (age-gender adjusted BMI ranking ≥ 95th

percentile). In another study, Andreyeva, Kelly, and Harris [5] use a sample of 5th

graders to document that soft drink and fast food television advertising is positively

associated with the probability of being overweight (age-gender adjusted BMI ranking ≥

85th percentile) but not with bodyweight. They hypothesize that the weak association

may be due to mismeasurement by BMI-based proxies for youth obesity.

       While BMI is a widely accepted proxy for obesity, its limitation in distinguishing

body fat and lean body mass is well-documented [7-11]. For example, BMI provides

limited information on the degree of obesity in youths older than 10 years of age [12]



                                              3
while the association of BMI with body fatness in children differ substantially by gender,

race, and age [13]. Thus, an increasing number of studies highlight the importance of

using alternative measures of obesity for estimation purposes [8]. Several studies

recommend using body composition or percentage body fat (PBF) for identification of

youth overweight status [14].

       Body composition, however, is considerably more difficult to measure and

therefore has not been used by social scientists until recently. With the advancements in

measurement technologies such as bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and dual

energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), the cost of measuring body composition has been

reduced substantially and these measures are now available in several in large-scale

surveys [15]. Using such data, social scientists have begun to compare the sensitivity of

BMI-based findings to those based on body composition among adults [16, 17]. To this

date, no such sensitivity analysis has been conducted for youths. This is the first study to

analyze the impact of fast-food advertising on body composition among youths. We also

examine the sensitivity of the results obtained in CRG to our results using body

composition measures of youth obesity.

Methods

       To maintain comparability between the results in our paper and those in CRG, we

draw on the same data sources as CRG.

Primary Individual Data

       Individual-level data on youths aged 12 to 18 are obtained from the NLSY97,

which contains a nationally representative sample of the U.S. youths. The initial sample

in 1997 consists of 8,984 respondents aged 12 to 16 years old and contains extensive



                                             4
information about youth labor market behavior and educational attainment. A parent

questionnaire with information on family background and a youth questionnaire on

weekly hours of time spent in watching television for youths aged 12 to 14 were also

administered in Round 1. Following the CRG, we use 1997 values for 1998 and 1999.

The pooled sample size is 14,852 after observations with missing values are deleted and

before advertising and state-level data are merged.

Fast-food restaurant television advertising data

       We also obtain fast-food restaurant television advertising data from Competitive

Media Reporting (CMR), the largest provider of advertising tracking services in the U.S.

The advertising exposure, which is the number of seconds restaurant advertising aired per

week per area, is collected for fast-food restaurant chains in the U.S. from 1996 to 1999.

The exposure data are then converted to the number of hours per week.

       The unit of area for advertising exposure is Designated Market Area (DMA),

which is similar to a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Each DMA is a television

market composed of counties (and occasionally part of counties). The top 75 out of about

210 DMAs are contained in the CMR database. Merging the advertising exposure data

by DMA results in an analysis sample of 7,069 person-years. Using the information on

weekly hours of television viewed in NLSY97, we calculate the weekly hours of fast-

food advertising seen as follows:

       Sijt = (Tijt/168)Ajt K,                                                       (1)

where Tijt is the weekly number of hours that the youth watches television, 168 is the

number of hours in a week, Ajt is the weekly number of hours of fast-food ads aired, and

K is a positive constant. We take natural log to address positive skewness in Sijt and Tijt:



                                              5
       lnSijt = lnTijt - ln168 + lnAjt + lnK,                                       (2)

The natural log transformation mitigates the influence of outliers, while also allowing

each control variable to have a diminishing marginal effect on BMI or obesity. Therefore

we have three key variables: ln(TV-time), ln(Ads-aired), and ln(Ads-seen).

Alternative measures of youth obesity

       Body composition is described by the following identity:

       W ≡ BF + FFM                                                                 (3)

where W is weight in kilograms, BF is body fat, and FFM is fat-free mass. PBF or

percentage body fat is therefore,

                         BF
        PBF = 100 *            .                                                    (4)
                      BF + FFM

       We make use of both BIA and DXA measures of body composition that are

available in the following waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination

Survey: NHANES III (1988 through 1994), NHANES 1999-2000, NHANES 2001-2002,

and NHANES 2003-2004 [18].

       In the BIA method, body composition is estimated by measuring the electrical

resistance of a body to a weak electrical current [19]. The observed electrical resistance,

which is negatively associated with FFM, is converted into FFM by entering it into a

predetermined equation obtained from a multiple regression analysis along with a set of

external measurements such as weight, height, age, and gender [20, 21]. After FFM is

obtained from the prediction equation, BF is computed from the identity in equation (3),

which is then combined with equation (4) to yield the following form:

                      BF         W − FFM
        PBF ≡ 100 *      ≡ 100 *         .                                          (5)
                      W             W



                                                6
       Following previous studies [16, 17], we employ a prediction equation developed

by Chumlea [20] for particular use with NHANES III. We also used a prediction

equation developed by Boileau [22] for children aged 8 through 16. These equations

yield two sets of values for FFM and BF in NHANES.

       A third set of body composition is obtained from the DXA measurement, also

available in the NHANES. In this procedure, a complete body scan is administered in

which two low dose x-rays are absorbed at different rates by bone and soft tissue mass

[19, 23]. The computed amount of BF and FFM are directly reported in NHANES

without the need for prediction equations.

Estimating alternative youth obesity measures

       Because there is only one year of overlap between the NHANES waves and the

CMR fast-food restaurant advertising data (1997-1999), we employ the procedures

developed by Wada and Tekin [17] to obtain PBF measures in NLSY97, using

information derived from NHANES. A similar strategy was also used by a recent study

for examining the effect of body composition on European employment outcome [24].

       In this procedure, we predict FFM and BF values in NLSY97 using regression

coefficients obtained from the NHANES analysis. First, we separately regress FFM and

body fat on weight, weight2, height, height2, age, age2, and weight*height in NHANES.

This estimation is implemented for each of the six gender-race/ethnicity combinations

(white non-Hispanic males, white non-Hispanic females, black non-Hispanic males,

black non-Hispanic females, Hispanic males, and Hispanic females). We use persons of

all ages in NHANES to increase the power in these regressions. The explanatory power

in these regressions is high, with R2 values ranging between 0.80 and 0.90. The



                                             7
coefficients from these regressions and the values of the independent variables in

NLSY97 are then used to impute values for FFM and BF in NLSY97.

        After computing FFM and BF in NLSY97, we use the three sets of BF and FFM

estimates to calculate the corresponding PBFs using equations (4) and (5). Therefore, we

obtain one measure of PBF based on DXA (PBF-D), another based on BIA with

Chumlea’s equation (PBF-C), and a third one based on BIA with Boileau’s equation

(PBF-B).

Conventional measures of youth obesity

        Traditional obesity measures are BMI and an obesity indicator that equals one if

the adolescent is obese (age-gender adjusted BMI ranking ≥ 95th percentile). BMI is

calculated as W/H2, where W is weight in kilograms and H is height in meters.

State-level data

        Following CRG, we include in our models state-level variables that are merged

with the NLSY97 by state and year. These include the number of fast-food restaurants,

the number of full-service restaurants, the price of a meal in each type of restaurant, an

index of price of food at home, the price of cigarettes, and clean indoor air laws. Detailed

descriptions of their sources, definitions, and relevance have been previously discussed

[25].

Estimation strategy

        We use a multiple regression method. Given the large sample size, we fit linear

probability models for binary obesity outcome. The coefficients from linear probability

models are consistent estimates of average probability derivatives, but the standard errors

are biased as a result of heteroskedasticity [26]. Thus, we report standard errors that are



                                              8
robust to any form of heteroskedasticity. We also employ sampling weights and cluster

standard errors on DMA, given that the advertising variables are repeated within DMA.

          Our most comprehensive regression model is:

          Yijt = γ 0 + γ 1 ln S ijt + γ 2 ln Tijt + β1 X ijt + β 2 M ijt + β 3 Z ijt + µ j + ν t + ε ijt .       (6)

In this equation, the dependent variable (Yijt) is the various obesity measures for youth i

in DMA j surveyed in year t. The regressors are the ln of the weekly hours of television

fast-food restaurant advertising seen (ln Sijt); the ln of the weekly hours spent watching

television (ln Tijt); a vector of demographic variables for youths, including age, race, and

gender (Xijt); a vector of variables containing mother’s employment status, household

income, a dummy for missing income, and dummy variables indicating whether the

mother is overweight (BMI ≥ 25) or obese (BMI ≥ 30) (Mijt); a vector of state-specific

variables including the per capita number of fast-food restaurants, the per capita number

of full-service restaurants, the real cigarette price, dichotomous indicators for clean

indoor air laws, the real full-service restaurant price, the real food at home price, and the

real fast-food restaurant price (Zijt); and vectors indicating DMA (µj) and year (νt). The

disturbance term is εijt. An advantage of the specification given by equation (6) is that it

allows the amount of time spent watching television to have an effect on weight

outcomes that is independent of the number of hours of fast-food restaurant advertising

ads seen.

          Using the definition of Sijt in equations (1) and (2), equation (6) can be rewritten

as

Yijt = γ 0 + γ 1 ln K − γ 1 ln 168 + γ 1 ln A jt + (γ 1 + γ 2 ) ln Tijt + β1 X ijt + β 2 M ijt + β 3 Z ijt + µ j + ν t + ε ijt . (7)

Results

       Table 1 displays descriptive statistics for the five obesity outcomes of interest for

all youths and by gender. These five outcomes are BMI, an indicator that equals 1 if a

youth is obese (Obese) according to age-gender adjusted BMI ranking, and the three

measures of PBF described earlier (PBF-D, PBF-C, and PBF-B). The sample sizes for

PBF measures are slightly lower due to restricting the sample to non-Hispanics whites,

non-Hispanics black, and Hispanics. As shown in Table 1, the means for the three PBF

measures are very similar. For males, the mean PBF is between 19 and 20 percent, while

for females, it is between 29 and 31 percent. The PBF estimates based on DXA are

slightly higher than the estimates based on BIA. In turn, PBF-B is slightly higher than

PBF-C.

       To compare our estimates of PBF in NLSY97 with actual measures in NHANES,

we present means and standard deviations of the three PBF variables in Table 2. We

have computed these figures from NHANES 1999-2000, 2001-2002, and 2003-2004.

Except in the case of male PBF-B, the means in Table 2 are larger than those in Table 1,

which is likely due to under-reporting of weight in the NLSY. For males, the range is

between 20 and 24 percent, while for females, it is between 29 and 34 percent. For

comparison purposes, we also show the statistics for BMI and Obese in NHANES 1999-

2000. The under-reporting of weight by females is clearly reflected in the difference

between the percentage of obese females of 14 percent in NHANES and 7 percent in

NLSY97.

       There is a high correlation among our five body composition measures. As

expected, the correlation coefficients among the three measures of PBF are very high



                                             10
within gender ranging from 0.91 to 0.99 for males and from 0.97 to 0.99 for females.

BMI also is highly correlated with the measures of PBF. The correlations fall between

0.89 and 0.96 for males and between 0.91 and 0.92 for females. Given the dichotomous

nature of the Obese indicator, the raw correlations between Obese and each of the other

four variables are smaller. Specifically, they are between 0.67 and 0.76 for males and

between 0.54 and 0.72 for females.

        Table 3 reproduces the regression results obtained by CRG. Regressions in which

BMI or Obese is used as the dependent variable are estimated with a slightly smaller

sample, but yield results that are almost identical to those in CRG.

        Table 4 presents the estimation results from two alternative specifications with the

three measures of PBF. In each of the nine specification (6) regressions in Table 5, we

find a positive and significant relationship between television viewing time and the PBF.

All nine coefficients of advertising ads are positive and five are statistically significant.

The exceptions pertain to the three coefficients for females and the male coefficient for

PBF-DXA, which is consistent with the non-significant advertising coefficients in the

female regressions in Table 3 from CRG.

        In each of the nine specifications in Table 4, we test the hypothesis that

coefficient of the ln(TV-time) is equal to the coefficient of the ln(Ads-aired). Similar to

Table 3, we fail to reject the hypothesis that the two coefficients are the same in every

case. Therefore, we estimate a second model [specification (2)] in which the ln(Ads-

aired) and the ln(TV-time) are replaced with the ln(Ads-seen). This is equivalent to

constraining the coefficient of the ln(TV-time) to equal the coefficient of the ln(Ads-

aired). In this specification all nine coefficients are significant.



                                               11
        Focusing on the gender-specific results for specification (2) in Table 4, one sees

that the coefficients of the ln(Ads-seen) do not vary much, ranging from 0.58 (female

PBF-D) to 0.76 (male PBF-B). The male coefficient is larger than the corresponding

female coefficient except for PBF-C. The last finding aside, these results mirror those in

Table 3.

        One way to gauge the magnitudes of the effects is to compute their elasticities

with respect to the number of ads seen (ln S in the version of equation (6) that omits ln

T). Given the semi-logarithmic form of the equation, the elasticity is γ1/ Y, where Y is the

mean of the dependent variable in the regression and γ1 is the regression coefficient of

lnS. The elasticities are presented in the left panel of Table 5 using the population mean

from NHANES. All the male elasticities exceed the corresponding female elasticities,

and the PBF elasticities exceed the corresponding BMI elasticities. A 10 percent increase

in the number of ads seen increases each outcome by between 0.2 percent and 0.4

percent. Yet as shown below, a small absolute or percentage increase in BMI can have a

substantial impact on the percentage increase in the number of obese youths. It is notable

that an average of the three male PBF elasticities is almost 40 percent larger than the BMI

elasticity. For females, the average PBF elasticity is 25 percent larger than the BMI

elasticity.

        CRG put their results into context by simulating an increase in the number of ads

seen that is equal to its coefficient of variation. On average, youths view approximately

half an hour per week of fast-food advertising ads. Since the coefficient of variation of

this variable is approximately equal to one in each regression, these computations reveal

the impacts of an increase in exposure to this type of advertising of half an hour per


                                             12
week. They only make these computations for the obesity indicator, but we compute

them for all five dependent variables. Following the approach by CRG, we conduct

similar simulations. As shown in the right panel of Table 5, increasing exposure to fast-

food advertising by half an hour per week will increase the probability of being obese by

2.5 percentage points among males. This translates into a 17 percent increase in the

number of obese male youths in a fixed population. The corresponding figures for

females are a 0.6 percentage point increase and a 4 percent increase in the number of

obese adolescent girls in a fixed population. The simulations for the other four

continuous outcomes suggest much smaller effects, especially among males. Focusing on

percentage changes, the corresponding figures range from about 1 percent (female BMI)

to approximately 3 percent (male PBF-B). It should be realized, however, that only the

obesity indicator is discrete. To highlight this difference, suppose that the BMI of each

male and each female in our sample increased by the amount predicted in Table 5, i.e.,

0.38 and 0.25, respectively. Then the probability of being obese would rise by 1.1

percentage points for males and by 0.5 percentage points for females. These effects

translate into a 7 percent increase in the number of obese male youths in a fixed

population and to a 3 percent increase in the number of obese female youths. While these

are smaller than those obtained directly from the regression for the probability of being

obese, they are non-trivial.

Discussion

       Our results indicate that exposure to fast-food restaurant advertising on television

causes statistically significant increases in PBF in youths. We obtain a larger effect by

using PBF rather BMI as youth obesity outcome. Our results indicate that a complete



                                             13
advertising ban would reduce BMI by about 2 percent and would reduce PBF by around

3 percent. Note that very modest changes in body composition can be associated with

substantial reductions in the number of obese youths. The BMI effects translate into a 6

percent reduction in the number of obese youths by the advertising ban. Similar to CRG,

we conclude that exposure to fast-food restaurant advertising on television causes

statistically significant increases in the body mass index of youths and on the probability

that they are obese. The obesity effect is larger in absolute value. A complete ban on

these advertisements would reduce the number of obese youths by 14 percent. Another

policy option alternative to banning such advertising on television could be the

elimination of the tax deductibility of food advertising costs. While such a policy would

still leave a considerable number of youth exposed to fast-food advertising on television,

it may still result in non-trivial reductions in obesity

        Since the PBF effects in Table 5 are larger than the corresponding BMI effects, it

would be useful to employ an obesity indicator defined by PBF as an additional outcome.

We have placed this issue on an agenda for future research because obesity cutoffs based

on PBF are not yet well developed. For example, Boreham, Twisk, and Savage [27]

classify male youths with PBF greater than 20 percent as obese and adolescent girls with

PBF greater than 24 percent as obese. If these cutoffs are applied to our NLSY data,

approximately 50 percent of males and 90 percent of females are classified as obese.

Even if the cutoffs for adults recommended by the National Institute of Diabetes and

Digestive and Kidney Diseases [28] for adults of greater than 25 percent for males and

greater than 30 percent for females are used, approximately 22 percent of males and 60

percent of females are identified as obese. It is valuable to examine the characteristics of



                                               14
individuals classified as obese by one measure but not the other and vice versa. It also is

valuable to obtain PBF cutoffs that result in the same percentage of obese youths as BMI

cutoffs.

       We conclude by re-emphasizing that it would be useful to develop an obesity

indicator defined by the PBF, to use this outcome as an additional dependent variable,

and to examine non-linear effects. These might take the form of greater sensitivity to

advertising by youths just below the BMI obesity cutoff or to the corresponding PBF

cutoff than by other youths. The ideal data for such an investigation would contain both
