                                                ABSTRACT

EU financial safety nets are social contracts that assign uncertain benefits and burdens to taxpayers
in different member countries. To help national officials to assess their taxpayers' exposures to loss
from partner countries, this paper develops a way to estimate how well markets and regulators in 14
of the EU-15 countries have controlled deposit-institution risk-shifting in recent years. Our method
traverses two steps. The first step estimates leverage, return volatility, and safety-net benefits for individual
EU financial institutions. For stockholder-owned banks, input data feature 1993-2004 data on stock-market
capitalization. Parallel accounting values are used to calculate enterprise value (albeit less precisely)
for mutual savings institutions. The second step uses the output from the first step as input into regression
models of safety-net benefits and interprets the results. Parameters of the second-step models express
differences in the magnitude of safety-net subsidies and in the ability of financial markets and regulators
in member countries to restrain the flow of safety-net subsidies to commercial banks and savings institutions.
We conclude by showing that banks from high-subsidy and low-restraint countries have initiated and
received the lion's share of cross-border M&A activity. The efficiency, stabilization, and distributional
effects of allowing banks to and from differently subsidized environments to expand their operations
in partner countries pose policy issues that the EU ought to address.

         EVIDENCE OF DIFFERENCES IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SAFETY-NET
                MANAGEMENT IN EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES


        In individual countries, banking insolvencies trace to difficulties in constraining the

extent and character of risk-taking and risk-shifting by banks. Risk-shifting occurs when

particular bank stakeholders are not adequately compensated for the risks to which they are

exposed.

        EU directives and Basel agreements divide cross-country accountability for preventing

and resolving bank insolvencies in an economically arbitrary way. If a multinational European

bank were to fail, the EU’s 1994 Directive on Deposit-Guarantee Schemes makes host countries

responsible for paying off at least the domestic depositors of any banking offices the failed

organization might have operated in their jurisdiction1.

        Although the host country is charged with supervising banking entities that operate

within its borders, Basel arrangements make home-country officials responsible for supervising

the accounts of the consolidated multinational organization to which a host-country subsidiary

would report. This gives regulators in both countries authority to influence loss exposures and

insolvency resolution at host-country banks. Losses large enough to ruin a host-country

subsidiary might be dumped on it by a wily offshore parent or a slippery host-country subsidiary

might avoid ruin by hiding its losses in assets it manages to transfer to the home country at an

inflated value. Unfair though it might be, cross-country differences in bankruptcy procedures and

in the effectiveness of market and regulatory discipline exerted in different jurisdictions could

force taxpayers of a home or host country to shoulder the bill for negligent acts of safety-net

officials, auditors, or creditors in a partner country (Eisenbeis, 2004 and 2006; Eisenbeis and

Kaufman, 2006).

       This paper develops a way for EU regulators to assess their taxpayers’ exposures to loss

from partner countries. Our method estimates how well, on average, markets and regulators in

individual countries manage to control deposit-institution risk-shifting during a specified time

period. Sections I and II explain that our procedure combines two steps. We first construct time

series for leverage, return volatility, and safety-net benefits at individual EU financial

institutions. For stockholder-owned banks, our calculations use 1993-2004 data on stock-market

capitalization. In generating these data for mutual institutions, we draw on less frequently

reported accounting values to construct (albeit less precisely) these same three time series.

       Section III takes the second step, feeding the first-step estimates as input into regression

models of ex ante safety-net benefits and interpreting the results. We show that parameters of the

second-step models express differences in the magnitude of safety-net subsidies and in the ability

of financial markets and regulators in member countries to restrain the flow of safety-net

subsidies to commercial banks and savings institutions. The final section shows that our

estimates help to predict cross-border merger activity among banks. It argues that it is poor

policy for the EU to allow banks to merge into and out of differently subsidized and differently

controlled environments without explicitly considering the efficiency, stabilization, and

distributional effects that such mergers might unleash.




I. Risk-Shifting Opportunities Provided by the Safety Nets



                                                  3
       It is instructive to conceive of a country’s financial safety net as an evolving and

purposively incomplete contract whose counterparties are major sectors of that country’s

economy. This contract has two dimensions. First, it allocates de facto responsibility for

controlling bank risk-taking and recapitalizing insolvent institutions to specific regulators and

bank stakeholders. Second, to alleviate customer losses in economically and politically arduous

circumstances, it authorizes government officials to assign to taxpayers some of the costs of

resolving bank insolvencies that supervisory pressure and market discipline fail to prevent.

       Financial safety nets expand risk-shifting opportunities by reducing incentives for

depositors and other private counterparties to monitor and police risk taking by banks. The costs

and benefits a country receives from its safety net depend on how much market discipline the net

displaces and how successfully safety-net managers substitute explicit and implicit insurance

premiums and takeover threats for the credit-market discipline they displace.

       All EU safety nets include depositor guarantees. By exerting lobby pressure, a country’s

banking industry can and (we find) do keep these guarantees from being fully priced. The result

is that an increase in a bank’s overall risk exposure can almost always increase the value of the

safety-net benefits it receives. This creates an incentive to search out and to exploit weaknesses

in risk-control arrangements. At the same time, takeover threats exerted by safety-net managers

make it uneconomic to maximize the value of current-period benefits. The result is that bankers

support their risk-taking partly – but only partly – with off-balance sheet risk capital that they

extract strategically via the safety net from taxpayers and less-adventurous banks (Kane, 1995;

Honohan and Klingebiel, 2002).

       Merton (1974) models the equity of a firm as a call option on the firm’s assets whose

exercise price is the book value of creditor claims (B). When B exceeds the value of bank assets,




                                                  4
creditors absorb the difference. Safety-net support allows creditors to put some or all of their

losses to safety-net managers. This reduces the net default risk that markets for equity and debt

must price (Vallilou and Xing, 2004).

        The per-period flow of safety-net benefits that bank stockholders enjoy can be defined as

a “fair” insurance premium (IPP) expressed per euro of a bank’s deposits. Merton (1977, 1978)

shows that the IPP increases both with a bank’s leverage and with the volatility of its returns. In

Merton’s one-period model, leverage is measured as the ratio of the market value (D) of deposits

and other debt to the market value of a bank’s assets (V). Volatility is defined as the standard

deviation of the return on bank assets (σV). Our first-round estimates replace D with its book

value (B) and our second-round models parsimoniously linearize the IPP as:

                                       IPP = γ0 + γ1σV + γ2(B/V) + ε1.2                                (1)

This formulation implies that, other things equal, the value of safety-net benefits increases in

both σV and B/V. By themselves, the positive partial derivatives γ 1 = ∂IPP ∂σ V and

γ 2 = ∂IPP ∂ ( B / V ) in (1) tell us how much incremental value bank stockholders might extract

from the safety net by increasing the associated form of risk-taking.

        The benchmark single-equation model (1) does not explicitly recognize that debt and

deposit-insurance contracts convey covenant-like monitoring and loss-control powers to

creditors and safety-net managers that empower them to restrain risk-shifting directly (Kane,

1995). To analyze the risk-shifting process at individual countries and banks, we estimate a

version of the two-equation model pioneered by Duan, Moreau, and Sealey (1992). To address

whether and how well safety-net covenants constrain bank-risk-shifting incentives, Duan et al.

introduce into the Merton model a structural equation for the debt-to-asset ratio, B/V:

2
  Because the implicit Taylor-series expansion occurs around positive IPP mean values in each country, the zero
lower bound on IPP is not a worrisome source of bias.


                                                         5
                                     B/V = α0 + α1σV + ε2.                                 (2)

Equation (2) is a locus of potential market-equilibrium points that expresses a tradeoff between

the pursuit of current safety-net benefits and the bank’s exposure to takeover by creditors or

insurers. Substituting (2) into (1) produces the following (partially) reduced-form equation:

                                     IPP = β0 + β1σV + ε3,                                 (3)

where ε3=ε1+ γ2ε2. Even though it is convenient to estimate (2) and (3) separately, an underlying

recursive structure links the two equations:

                                                d (B / V )
                                         α1 ≡              ,                               (4)
                                                  dσ V

                                   ∂IPP   ∂IPP
                            β1 ≡        +           α 1 = γ 1 + γ 2α 1 .                   (5)
                                   ∂σ V ∂ ( B / V )

       In portraying volatility as an exogenous variable, the model assumes that σ V represents a

value-maximizing decision made in response to a vector of unobserved bank-specific profit

generators. The underlying intuition is that of a dynamic rational-expectations game: each bank

sets its leverage and asset volatility jointly, with the understanding that creditors and safety-net

managers monitor these values and restrain leverage by raising funding costs and standing ready

to take over the franchise in the event of insolvency. In turn, creditors and regulators expect

banks to react ex ante and ex post to the discipline they provide. Equation (2) expresses the

hypothesis that, in equilibrium, outside monitoring constrains banks to choose points that lie on a

locus of mutually acceptable leverage and volatility pairs.

       Given the external discipline a bank faces, the sign of β1 in equations (3) and (5) indicates

whether a bank’s covenanted contracting environment allows increases in asset volatility to

increase the multiperiod value of its safety-net guarantees. In principle, the total derivative β1

incorporates the value of the opportunity to operate the bank in future periods (Ritchken,


                                                      6
Thomson, and DeGennaro, 1993). If β1 is nonpositive, risk-shifting incentives in a given country

are fully neutralized.

       To constrain risk-taking at all, outside limitations on leverage must be risk-sensitive

enough to overcome the “inside” value of leverage to bank stockholders so as to establish a

negatively sloped locus of acceptable B/V and σV values. However, a negative α1 only implies

that risk-sensitive capital regulation and complementary takeover and market discipline partially

constrain realizable safety-net benefits. As an input into β1 in equation (5), the size of α1 tells us

whether at the margin outside discipline is potent enough to persuade the bank not to increase

return volatility when outside capital requirements increase. To neutralize risk-shifting incentives

at the margin, outside pressure must induce a decline in B/V large enough to offset the current-

period increase in IPP a higher σV would otherwise generate.

       Thus, for market and regulatory pressure consistently to discipline -- and potentially to

neutralize -- incremental risk-shifting incentives, two conditions must be met:

   Capital must increase with volatility:              α1 < 0,

   Guarantee value must not rise with volatility:      β1 ≤ 0.

   Although the values of assets, guarantees, and volatility are imbedded in a bank’s stock price,

none of these variables is directly observable. However, Marcus and Shaked (1984) show that

we can use option-based numerical expressions for the value of deposit insurance to track these

variables synthetically. Because finance theory tends to focus on unobservable values, running

regressions on synthetic data sets is a common practice in finance. This two-step approach tests

substantive hypotheses about asset valuation jointly with the subsidiary hypothesis that the

synthetic observations are reliable estimates of the true variables.




                                                   7
         Every model makes deliberate and hard-to-defend simplifications. In interpreting our

parsimonious regression experiments, we cannot rule out the possibility that omitted variables,

measurement error, and simultaneous-equation bias distort the outcomes in unknown ways.

Murphy and Topel (1985) show that standard errors of substantive parameters are often

underestimated in two-step tests. These considerations suggest that we should interpret t-values

conservatively and subject our results to robustness checks.

         The first step in the Marcus-Shaked procedure is to generate tracking values for V and σV

by numerical methods. These values are then used to estimate IPP as the value of a put option on

bank assets. The procedure begins by solving the call-option formula for equity, E.3 The last step

uses Îto’s lemma to link σV to E, V and σE (the instantaneous standard deviation of equity

returns) by means of equation (6):

                                        σV = σE(E/V)/(∂E/∂V).                                             (6)

         The procedure follows Merton (1977) in portraying deposit insurance as a single-period

European put option on the bank’s assets. Merton treats bank equity as the sum of a dividend-

unprotected European call option and the present value of the dividends distributed before the

option’s expiration date. The bank’s debt is assumed to mature in one year, which is also the

assumed exercise date for the insurer. The model expresses the value of a bank’s equity, E, and

the value of the fair deposit insurance premium, IPP, as:

                            E = V[1-(1- δ)T] + V(1- δ)TN(x1) - BN(x2),                                    (7)

                            IPP = N(-x2) - (1- δ)TN(-x1)V/B.                                              (8)



3
  To establish whether inferences are robust to differences in how forbearance is modeled, it is useful to conduct
regressions using proxies for V, σV, and IPP derived from different models of deposit-insurance option value.
Hovakimian and Kane (2000) provide a detailed discussion of three such models.



                                                          8
In (7) and (8), δ is the fraction of bank assets distributed at each interim dividend date to

stockholders, T is the number of interim dividend payments, N(xi) states the probability that the

variate value x is ≤ xi, given that x is distributed with zero mean and unit variance.4

           Ronn and Verma (1986) adapt Merton's model to account for the likelihood that safety-

net managers would forbear from exercising their right to call the put when their claim is only

slightly in the money. When forbearance occurs, the value of the short position in the put can

turn negative. The RV model scales down the effective exercise price of the put for all banks and

all dates by a factor of ρ = 0.97. The data we employ to estimate equations (2) and (3) set T

equal to one year:

                              E = V[1-(1- δ)T] + V(1- δ)TN(x3) - ρBN(x4),                                  (9)

                                     IPP = N(-x4) - (1- δ)TN(-x3)V/B.                                     (10)

           Although we will experiment with other specifications eventually, for fixed samples, the

policy implications of regression experiments using U.S. data have proven relatively insensitive

to variation in ρ5. Moreover, Pennacchi (1987a and b) shows that, by counterfactually presuming

prompt and complete insolvency resolution, single-period models of IPP tend to understate the

economic value that government guarantees convey to bank stockholders. In exploring

differences in risk-shifting opportunities and authorities’ ability to constrain them, this bias

increases the power of regression tests based on a minimal-forbearance model.


II. Input Data


           Tables 1 through 3 summarize the synthetic datasets on IPP, B/V, and σV over which we

conduct regression experiments. Our goal is to compare the quality of safety-net management not

    x1 = [ln((1-δ)TV/B)+σV2 T/2]/(σV√T), x2 = x1 - σV√T, x3 = [ln((1-δ)TV/ρB)+σV2 T/2]/(σV√T), x4 = x3 - σV√T.
5
    Of course, parameter estimates are sensitive to differences in the years and countries covered in any experiment.


                                                            9
only across countries, but also between commercial banks and savings institutions in each

country.

       Because commercial banks are stockholder-owned, regression inputs can be calculated

from data on bank stock prices recorded on Bankscope. However, savings banks and credit

cooperative banks are mutual institutions. This has three important consequences. First, values

for E, B/V and σV must be calculated entirely from book values. Given that balance-sheet data

are reported less frequently than stock prices, variation in returns is bound to be understated for

mutual institutions. Second, at mutuals, risk-taking incentives are blunted because owners and

managers cannot divide potential gains from risk-shifting by writing easily enforceable side

contracts. Third, mutual institutions do not pay dividends. Assuming that market-determined

interest rates are paid on loans and deposits, we treat the reported value of “distributed profits”

(contributions to social works and social funds) as a rough counterpart. In interpreting statistical

tests, we must recognize that the reliability of coefficient estimates in IPP equations for mutuals

is weakened by these difficulties. The Appendix shows the main sources of information

employed to estimate IPP, B/V, and σV values separately for commercial banks and for savings

and cooperative banks. To provide proxies for market-value data for mutual institutions, we

experiment with two alternatives: the first employs book values for E, B/V, and σV; the second

generates synthetic market-value data by using the model and parameters estimated for

commercial banks. Our procedures are summarized in the Appendix.

       Table 1 shows the size of sample cells for both types of institutions in each of the EU-15

countries. For all but four countries (Austria, Sweden, Italy, and Germany) the number of

observations for commercial banks exceeds that for mutual institutions. For several countries,

data on mutual institutions are scant and may not be fully representative of overall industry



                                                 10
experience. Gaps in data availability persuade us to delete Greece from the study and limitations

on sample size lower the power of statistical tests for comparisons involving a few other

countries.

       Table 2 presents estimates of the mean values found for our three input variables at

commercial banks in each country. B/V ranges from a low of 83 percent in Spain to a high of 94

percent in Luxembourg. The mean volatility of returns varies from a low of 1.30 percent in Italy

to a high of 3.22 percent in the United Kingdom. Most importantly, the mean value of safety-net

benefits vary from 13 basis points per Euro in Luxembourg to 28 basis points in Denmark.

       For mutual institutions, Table 3 reports safety-net premiums and return volatility in two

ways. Model I applies the RV procedure directly to the accounting values these firms report.

Model II instead runs the accounting data for mutuals through the equations used to generate IPP

and σV for each country’s commercial banks. In most cases, the second procedure greatly lowers

the values of safety-net benefits and volatility at mutual firms. One might interpret this as

evidence that, on average in most EU countries, more outside discipline is exerted on

commercial banks than on savings institutions.



III. Regression Results

       However high or low the mean value of safety-net benefits might be in a given country,

the policy problem is to control risk-shifting at the margin. In effect, managers of risky banks

engage regulators and creditors in an endless dynamic game. As creditors and regulators develop

ways to counter a bank’s ability to burden them, bankers devise new strategies for concealing or

understating their exposure to loss. The dialectical nature of this game makes it advisable to

estimate equation (2) and (3) in first-difference form.




                                                 11
Individual-Country Estimates. Using a fixed-effects specification for individual institutions

chartered in each country, Tables 4 and 5 estimate leverage and fair-premium equations for

commercial banks and savings institutions separately.

       For commercial banks, α1 is significantly negative at better than one percent, except in

Austria, Netherlands, Sweden, and Italy. In the ten other countries, capital discipline

significantly restrains risk. However, β1 still proves positive for all countries, ranging from 0.001

in Austria and in France to 0.045 in Sweden. At one-percent significance, only for Austria,

Finland and France can we reject the hypothesis that safety-net subsidies exist. Incremental

safety-net control is weakest in Sweden, Ireland, Netherlands, and Denmark.

       With the exception of Sweden, the values of α1 and β1 found for mutual institutions in

Table 5 using Model I do not differ much from those reported for banks in Table 4. When Model

II is used to adjust accounting data, α1 typically becomes more negative, but β1 usually becomes

more positive. However, when we use accounting data to fit the model to commercial banks,

results do not differ significantly from those reported in Table 4. This suggests that, by itself,

disciplining accounting capital might prove a more reliable way to control risk-shifting at

commercial banks than at savings institutions.

       Still, judging by our baseline Model I estimates, it appears that capital discipline

importantly influences risk-taking at savings institutions. Except in Netherlands and Italy, α1

proves significantly negative at one percent, but at that level of significance, the hypothesis of

incremental safety-net subsidies (i.e., positive β1) is rejected only for Finland and France. The

good news is that the magnitude of estimated safety-net benefits at savings institutions is

relatively small, exceeding 7 basis points only for Denmark, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Sweden,

and Italy.



                                                  12
Partitioning Countries by IPP and β1 Values. Our policy focus is how the costs of resolving

financial-institution distress might seep unrecognized across borders. Figure 1 divides the 14

counties into three classes based on observable clusters in the mean value of their IPP for banks.

Countries whose IPP is 15 basis points or less are coded as “low.” Countries whose IPP are 20

basis points or higher are coded as “high” IPP. The other five countries (Austria, Finland,

Ireland, Netherlands, and Sweden) are coded as “medium.”

        The policy issue is whether adverse economic shocks could force taxpayers and

regulators in low-β1 countries to pay for weaknesses in market and regulatory oversight exerted

on institutions by high-β1 countries. To explore this issue, in Figure 2 we use the β1 estimates

reported in Tables 4 and 5 to partition the commercial-bank and savings-bank samples into three

clusters: β1 ≤ .05; .05 < β1 < .012; β1 ≥ .012.

        Both for banks and for supervisory officials, incentives for risk-shifting intensify as an

institution slides into financial distress (Marcus, 1984; Kane, 1989). To protect taxpayers in

home and host countries, markets and officials in high-β1 countries must have the authority to

subject troubled banks to significantly stronger disciplines. To investigate this question, we

experiment with two dummy variables. What we call the “low-capital dummy” equals 1 for

institutions that fall in the less capitalized (i.e., more levered) half of the aggregate sample in the

preceding period and equals zero otherwise. As a robustness check, we employ an alternative

“high-premium dummy” that equals one for institutions whose fair premium exceeded the

median value recorded in the previous period.

        In Tables 6 and 7, each dummy is interacted with ΔσV. In the columns reporting on these

experiments, the total effect of ΔσV on the leverage ratio and fair premium is the sum of the two

coefficients shown.



                                                  13
       Very different pictures emerge for banks and for savings institutions. In the IPP equations

for banks in the higher-β1 subsamples, the value of access to safety-net subsidies falls for

distressed banks and the decline is significant in three of the four cells. On the other hand, in the

IPP equations for savings institutions, discipline strengthens for troubled institutions (though

only at 5 percent significance) in low-β1 countries, but falls sharply in high-β1 jurisdictions. This

is true even though leverage restrictions tighten significantly when distress emerges.

       These results support the hypothesis that, in EU countries, it has been difficult for

commercial banks and easy for savings institutions to expand their access to safety-net subsidies

when they fall into distress. Still, because few savings institutions are large enough to command

too-big-to-fail benefits or to engage in substantial cross-border activity, their risk-shifting

capacity seems unlikely to create important loss exposures for regulators and taxpayers in partner

countries. The greater concern should attach to large commercial banks operating in home or

host countries whose safety-net management is not yet up to speed.

Evidence of Learning by Doing. Table 8 reports on the age of individual-country deposit-

insurance schemes. Hovakimian, Kane, and Laeven (2003) find that in the early years of

operating a deposit-insurance system, officials are apt to do a poor job of replacing the depositor

discipline they displace. Tables 9 and 10 investigate this issue for our EU-14, partitioned by the

effectiveness of safety-net management.

       Both for commercial banks and for savings institutions, the tables indicate that countries

whose safety-net management is highly effective established tight control from the outset. The

statistical significance of the system’s age in the other two subsamples indicates that safety-net

managers in other countries did tend to improve their control as their systems aged.




                                                  14
IV. Robustness Issues

       Potentially observable sources of variation might explain at least some cross-country

differences. This section investigates four possibilities.

1. Effects from Differences in Character of Deposit-Insurance Coverage and Management.

Tables 11 and 12 depict several ways that deposit-insurance schemes in the EU-15 differ in

structure. Although one might suppose that differences in the design features imbedded in

different deposit-insurance schemes could explain the bulk of cross-country differences in loss

control, the evidence suggests that differences in regulatory culture and environment are more

important. For example, narrow coverage does not translate directly into either low β1 or low

IPP. Denmark, Finland, and Sweden cover the fewest categories of deposit, but our regressions

classify none of them as a low-IPP country and only one of them (Finland) as a low-β1 country.

Also, slope coefficients differ negligibly and insignificantly between countries whose schemes

do and do not cover deposits that are denominated in foreign currencies or held by very large

companies.

       Table 13 does indicate (and covariance tests confirm) that schemes that are chartered

either as private or public organizations control risk with similar effectiveness, and better than

schemes in which private and public officials share control. The same table finds that schemes

that separately guarantee the deposits of commercial banks and savings institutions are negligibly

more effective than joint-liability arrangements.

2. Effects From Differences in Country Size. One might also expect safety-net subsidies to vary

with the tax capacity of individual countries. We study this issue indirectly by asking whether

risk-shifting behavior varies with aggregate income. Table 14 partitions sample countries into

three classes: those with GDP below 100 million euros, those with GDP between 100 and 350




                                                  15
million euros; and those with GDP over 350 million euros. GDP data cover 2004 and come from

Eurostat. Covariance tests find no differences in capital discipline by country size. The lowest

p-value is 0.17 for differences in slopes between the medium and lowest GDP size classes.

However, safety-net subsidies are higher in the smallest countries and the differences prove

significant for all pairs by covariance tests. The p-values range between 0.01 and 0.03 and

indicate that undesirable distributional effects are more intense in smaller countries. This may be

because their governments lack the capacity either to finance or to execute preventive

supervision as effectively.

3. Effects from Government Ownership. The risk-shifting process passes losses directly to

taxpayers in state-owned institutions. This leads us to investigate whether incentives at publicly-

owned banks might differ from those at private institutions. Banks are defined as publicly-owned

if a public (national, regional or local) authority holds at least 50 percent of its capital. The

differences are shown in Table 15. Safety-net subsidies do prove significantly lower for public

banks, but only at the 2-percent level. However, the data reject the hypothesis that capital

discipline varies between privately-owned and publicly-owned banks (the p-value for the

covariance test is 0.22).

4. Effects from Special Governmental Support of Major Banks. Since differences across EU

countries in risk-shifting incentives are more likely to affect multinational banks, we compare

risk-shifting behavior at country-champion banks with that for other sample banks. Country-

champion banks are defined as those whose total assets fall in the first size decile of EU banks.

These banks are listed in the Appendix. Table 16 shows that country-champion banks do extract

higher incremental safety-net benefits. The p-value of the relevant covariance test is 0.01. At




                                                  16
the same time, α1 estimates show that country-champion banks receive stronger capital discipline

on average and this difference proves statistically significant at 2 percent.




V. Policy implications for EU Merger Policies

       Contestability theories of market structure stress the importance of entry and exit costs.

Incentives exist for national governments to protect domestic institutions from entry by foreign

competitors and to resist the exit of important domestic enterprises by bailing them out when

they become insolvent. The strength and predictability of these incentives let bank stakeholders

estimate fair insurance premiums for commercial banks and savings institutions in each country.

In countries like the Netherlands where three large institutions dominate banking markets and

foreign competition was until recently discouraged, too-big-to-fail benefits can be substantial.

       Although the mean value of the safety-net benefits reported in Tables 2 and 3 range only

between 13 and 32 basis points, these estimates are biased downward by using a model that

assumes counterfactually that safety-net enhancements expire after only one year. Although our

findings are subject to simultaneous-equations bias from treating changes in volatility as

exogenous, our estimates of the rate at which benefits increase with increments in volatility (β1)

avoid early-expiration bias. The magnitude of this coefficient ranges from 10 to 450 basis points

for commercial banks and from 40 to 760 basis points for savings institutions.

       Some high-β1 countries (e.g., Sweden) have suffered sectoral crises, but several (e.g.,

Netherlands) have not. In any case, it is particularly dangerous for the EU either to permit banks

such as Nordea to move their headquarters from low-β1 to high-β1 locales or to allow banks from




                                                 17
high-IPP and high-β1 countries to exploit the single-license framework to expand their footings

in low-β1 countries.

       Consistent with the hypothesis of cross-country risk-shifting, table 17 indicates that

capital and IPP discipline is less effective at offshore subsidiary banks than at parent institutions

and that multinational organizations experience significantly less aggregate restraint from both

home and host regulators than purely domestic banks do. Table 18 shows that, vis-à-vis

estimated safety-net benefits, acquisition activity appears to move both uphill and downhill.

Banks from high-IPP and high-β1 countries have both initiated and received the lion’s share of

cross-border merger and acquisition activity. From a global perspective, entry of banks from or

into high-premium or low-control home countries can generate undesirable efficiency,

distributional, and stabilization effects. Sooner or later, EU authorities will have to confront the

coordination challenges that these effects raise.

          Four focal variables appear in our analysis:

- B, total debt: computed as the difference between the book values of total assets and common

equity.

- E, the market value of a bank’s equity: computed as the end-of-period stock-market

capitalization.

- σE, standard deviation of the return on equity: computed as the standard deviation of: (1)

deleveraged quarterly holding-period returns on stock for commercial banks and (2) reported

quarterly return on equity reported by mutual institutions.

- δ, fraction of bank assets distributed yearly as dividends to stockholders.

          These variables are taken directly from the Bankscope database, provided by Bureau Van

Dijk.

          Since a market value for equity cannot be observed for (non-quoted) savings &

cooperative banks, we experiment for these institutions with two different models of IPP, B/V

and σV values.

   -      Model I: This is our baseline model. It employs market or market-like values wherever

          possible. Since savings and cooperative banks do not pay dividends, we represent

          “distributed profits” as a “social dividend” that is intended to capture community claims

          that are exerted on these institutions. The “social dividend” consists primarily of

          contributions to social works and social funds.




                                                   21
-   Model II: Accounting values for IPP and σV are understated because book values that are

    reported annually cannot capture intrayear variation in B/V and σV. Model II estimates

    IPP, B/V, and σV by means of equations fitted to data for commercial banks. The

    procedure has two steps. The first step estimates equations for commercial banks in each

    country. In the second step, the accounting data for a country’s savings & cooperative

    banks are fed as input data through the numerical equations that generated IPP and σV for

    that country’s commercial banks. The following example employs real data to illustrate

    how V and σV are obtained from model II using a randomly chosen savings bank i from

    Germany that we will call SBi:

           Step 1: Fitted model for the average commercial bank in Germany in 2000:

           σV = σE(E/V)/(∂E/∂V) = (0.091)(0.243)/(1,474) = 0.015

           E = V[1-(1- δ)T] + V(1- δ)TN(x3) - ρBN(x4) = V [1-(1- 0.23)1] + V(1- 0.23)1N(x3)

           - 0.97(18523)N(x4);

           E=1636;

           V = 6732 ;



           Step 2: Fitted model for SBi in 2000:

           The σE, (∂E/∂V), δ, Τ and ρ parameters and the probabilities for normal densities

           estimated for commercial banks are used to compute “market” values of σV and V

           for savings bank SBi:

           σV = σE(E/V)/(∂E/∂V) = (0.091)(0.198)/(1,474) = 0.012

           E = V[1-(1- δ)T] + V(1- δ)TN(x3) - ρBN(x4) = V[1-(1- 0.023)1] + V(1-

           0.023)1N(x3) - 0.97(15268)N(x4); V = 5327
