 WHY DOES THE PAPER-BILL SPREAD PREDICT REAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY?

                            ABSTRACT
     Evidence based on the past three decades of U.S. experience
shows that the difference between the interest rates on
commercial paper and Treasury bills has consistently borne a
systematic relationship to subsequent fluctuations of
nonfinancial economic activity. This interest rate spread
typically widens in advance of recessions, and narrows again
before recoveries. The relationship remains valid even after
allowance for other financial variables that previous researchers
have often advanced as potential business cycle predictors.
     This paper provides support for each of three different
explanations for this predictive power of the paperâ€”bill spread.
First, changing perceptions of default risk exert a clearly
recognizable influence on the spread. This influence is all the
more discernable after allowance for effects associated with the
changing volume of paper issuance when investors view commercial
paper and Treasury bills as imperfect portfolio substitutes -- a
key assumption for which the evidence introduced here provides
support. Second, again under conditions of imperfect
substitutability, a widening paper-bill spread is also a symptom
of the contraction in bank lending due to tighter monetary
policy. Third, there is also evidence of a further role for
independent changes in the behavior of borrowers in the
commercial paper market due to their changing cash requirements
over the course of the business cycle.

        W1IX QQ I1 PAPER-BILL       SPREAD   PREDICT KE   ECONOMIC ACTIVITY?



                  Benjamin M. Friedman and Kenneth N. Kuttner*




    People have always sought reliable ways to predict the future, and economic

fluctuations are no exception. Public policymakers, charged with the

responsibility to maintain full but not over-full employment of the economy's

productive resources, want to know when to take actions that will either

stimulate or retard economic activity. Business executives who plan to build

new factories or modernize old ones, or who consider the introduction of new

products, want to know when the markets for what their companies make will be

strong. Both individual and institutional investors, allocating their

portfolios across major asset categories like equities and fixed-income

securities, and in some cases picking specific corporations' stocks, want to

know whether recession or economic expansion will prevail over the relevant

investment horizon.

     A series of recent papers --    Stock and Watson (1989a), Friedman and Kuttner

(1989), Bernanke (1990), Kashyap et.al (1991) -- has shown that, for the past

three decades or so, the difference between the respective interest rates on

commercial paper and Treasury bills has borne a systematic relationship to

subsequent fluctuations of nonfinancial economic activity in the United States.

As such relationships go. this one has been fairly robust. The paper-bill

spread easily outperforms any single interest rate, either nominal or real, as
                                             -2-




  well as any of the monetary aggregates,
                                             as a predictor of real economic
  activity. The spread bears a statistically
                                                   significant relationship not just to
  future movements of aggregate
                                  output and spending, but to almost all of the
  familiar components of real activity
                                          as well. Finally, in contrast to the
  monetary aggregates (the subject of an earlier literature
                                                                 along these lines,
  which ended in spectacular disappointment),
                                                   there is no ambiguity about whether
  the paper-bill spread is related to the
                                             real or price side of nominal income
  fluctuations. (On the latest evidence,
                                             money is related to neither.) The
 spread is a predictor of real economic
                                            activity, not prices, and of nominal
 magnitudes only to the extent that they reflect real ones.

      Why is all this so? And is there
                                           any ground for confidence that the
 relationships that have connected the paper-bill
                                                       spread to subsequent business
 fluctuations in the past will continue
                                           to prevail for at least some time into
 the future? These questions motivate
                                          the analysis presented in this paper.
      Section I briefly reviews and expands the evidence from previous work

 documenting the relationships between the paper-bill spread and real economic

 activity in the United States. Section II details
                                                        some of the practical
differences between commercial
                                  paper and Treasury bills that plausibly accounr
for the spread between the
                             respective interest rates on these two instruments.
An important product of this part of the analysis is a decomposition of the

observed spread into a component that
                                         covaries directly with the general level
of interest rates; a
                      component directly representing the variation over time in
the perceived risk of default
                               on commercial paper; and a component
                                                                    capturing
other influences that
                       vary over time in a way that may or may not be related to
the business cycle. Section III uses a simple model of the behavior of

borrowers and len4ers in the short-term
                                          credit markets to develop three distinct
(albeit not mutually exclusive)
                                  hypotheses to account for the relationship
                                          -3-




between the paper-bill spread and fluctuations in business activity. Section IV

applies a variety of statistical tests to provide evidence bearing on the

validity of any or all of these three hypotheses. Section V brings together the

principal conclusions developed throughout the paper.

         To anticipate, the evidence presented in this paper suggests, at the least,

a two-fold explanation for the predictive power of the paper-bill spread with

respect to real economic activity, based on both default risk and monetary

policy. First, changing perceptions of default risk, as business prospects

alternatively strengthen and ebb, exert a clearly recognizeable influence on the

spread and also account for part of the spread's relationship to subsequent

movements of real output. Second, in a world in which investors view commercial

paper as an imperfect substitute for Treasury bills -    -a   key assumption, for

which the relationships estimated in Section IV provide some supporting evidence

-   -a   widening paper-bill spread is also a symptom of the contraction in bank

lending due to tighter monetary policy. Finally, independent changes in the

behavior of borrowers in the commercial paper market, due to their changing cash

requirements over the course of the business cycle, also influence the

paper-bill spread in ways that connect it to subsequent economic fluctuations.

 I. Th Basic Relationshin

      The upper panel of Figure 1 shows monthly-average values of the respective

 interest rates on 6-month prime-rated commercial paper and 180-day U.S.       Treasury
 bills, for 1959.90.1   Both series display the basic features characteristic of

 practically all U.S. interest rates during this period: a generally rising

 overall trend from the 1950s until the early 1980s, increasing volatility

 beginning in the early l970s, a downward trend and reduced volatility in the mid

 to late l980s, and the familiar cyclicality throughout.      (The shaded areas in

 the figure represent recessions as designed by the National Bureau of Economics

 Research.) The commercial paper rate has, almost always, exceeded the Treasury

bill rate.2 While the covariation of the two series is hardly perfect, the

dominant visual impression offered by these data is that the two interest rates

tend to move roughly together over time.

     The covariation of the two rates is not perfect, however, and the focus of

this paper is on the movement over time of the difference between them. The

lower panel of Figure 1 (with magnified scale compared to that of the       upper
panel) plots the monthly-average difference between the 6-month commercial paper

rate and the 180-day Treasury bill rate for the same period. Over the entire

32-year sample, the mean spread was .51% per annum (that is, 57 basis points).

with standard deviation .49%. In contrast to the upper panel, here there is

little evidence of persistent time trends. But like the two interest rates

themselves, the spread between them does display a distinct cyclicality. As

Table 1 shows, the spread is typically wider not just during but also

immediately prior to recessions (although the 1990 experience --     in   which the

spread widened much longer in advance of the recession, only then to narrow

again before the recession began --   is   an obvious counter-example).

    Table 2, updated from Friedman and Kuttner (1989), shows that the widening

of the paper-bill spread in anticipation of downturns in real economic activity

represents information beyond that already contained in the aerial correlation

of real activity itself, or in fluctuations of either price inflation or federal

government expenditures. The table also shows that other familiar financial

variables, like interest rates or growth of the monetary aggregates, either do

not contain such incremental information at all or do so to a lesser extent.

The upper panel of the table presents F-statistics for the null hypothesis that

all coefficients       are zero in regressions of the form




            â€” a +             +E            +E           +u                (1)




where X and P are the natural logarithms of real gross national product and the

corresponding price deflator, respectively; Z is, first, the difference between

the 6-month prime commercial paper rate and the 180-day Treasury bill rate and

then, in sequence, a series of other familiar financial variables as indicated

in the table; u is a disturbance term; and a,           and    are all coefficients

to be estimated. The lower panel presents analogous F-statistics based on

equations that are identical to (1) except that they also include, as an

additional set of regressors, a distributed lag on the (log) change in

"mid-expansion" federal expenditures. The table presents results separately for

the full 1960:II-1990:lv sample and for two sub-samples: 1960:11-1979:111 (that

is, until the Federal Reserve System's adoption of new monetary policy

procedures in October 1979) and l97O:III-l99O:IV (that is, since the elimination

of Regulation Q interest ceilings on large certificates of deposit in June

1970)

        Among the se'en financial variables considered, the paper-bill spread is
                                            -6-




one of only two - -   the   other being the long-short spread -   - that   contain

incremental information about subsequent movements of real output that is

significant at the .01 level in the full 1960-90 sample and in both sub-samples

separately, and regardless of whether the fiscal variable is included or not.

Indeed, none of the other five financial variables considered meets this

criterion even at the .10 significance level.

     Table 3 presents an analogous set of results based on monthly data. Here

industrial production takes the place of real gross national product, the

producer price index takes the place of the CNP deflator, each distributed lag

is of length 6, and the results shown correspond only to the upper panel of

Table 2 --   that   is, without the fiscal variable.4 Here the paper-bill spread is

alone among the seven variables tested in containing incremental information

about subsequent movements of industrial production that is significant at the

.01 level in the full 1960-90 sample as well as in both sub-samples separately.

The growth rate of the M2 money stock, the change in the commercial paper rate

and the long-short spread satisfy this criterion at the .05 level. None of the

other financial variables does so even at the .10 level.

     Table 4 presents results for an alternative form of test, suggested by

Stock and Watson (l989b), again based on monthly data. The Stock-Watson

regression includes 12 lags each of the respective log changes in industrial

production and the producer price index, 12 lags of the change in the commercial

paper rate (so that the list of variables corresponding to Z now excludes the

paper rate change and the bill rate change). 6 lags on the designated financial

variable, and a linear time trend. Here the paper-bill spread is again the only

financial variable tested that contains incremental information about subsequent

movements in industrial production that is significant at the .01 level

regardless of sample. None of the others -        - including   the long-short spread .   -

does so even at the .10 level.

     Finally, Table 5 presents both F-statistics and variance decompositions

based on a series of vector autoregression systems including, in each case, the

respective log changes in real output and the corresponding price deflator, the

paper-bill spread and, one at a time in succession, each of the other financial

variables considered in Tables 2 and 3 above. The estimation is based on

quarterly data, with variables and lag specification corresponding to that

underlying the upper panel of Table 2. For each system, the table presents the

F-statistics for the distributed lags on the paper-bill spread and the other

financial variable in the equation for real output, and then the respective

share of the variance of real output accounted for by the paper-bill spread and

by the other financial variable (together with the corresponding 95% confidence

intervals), measured at both four- and eight-quarter horizons. For purposes of

these variance decompositions, the real output variable is ordered first, the

price variable second, the other financial variable third, and the spread last.

     When the measure of output used is real gross national product (the upper

panel), the F-statistics presented in Table S indicate that the paper-bill

spread contains incremental information about subsequent movements in real

output that is significant at the .01 level in the presence of any of the

additional financial variables except HZ and the long-short spread, in which

case the relevant information is significant at the .05 level and the .10 level,

respectively.   Among the other financial variables considered, only the

long-short spread and the bill rate change are significant here at the .10 level

or better in the presence of the paper-bill spread.

     When the output measure is real domestic absorption (the middle panel),

however, the paper-bill spread contains information that is significant at the

.01 level in the presence of y of the other financial variables. Among the

others, here only the paper rate change and the bill rate change (separately)

contain significant incremental information in the presence of the paper-bill

spread. Similarly, when the output measure is real investment in plant and

equipment, the paper-bill spread again contains information that is significant

at the .01 level in the presence of ny of the other financial variables. Here

the bill rate change is the only other variable to contain significant

incremental information in the presence of the paper-bill spread.5

     The variance decomposition results presented in Table 5 largely support

these findings from significance tests based on the output equation alone. In

most of the vector autoregression systems estimated, the paper-bill spread

accounts for a percentage of the variance of the relevant real output measure,

either four or eight quarters ahead, that is both economically important

(typically between 10% and 20%) and statistically significant (at the .05

level). Further, in most cases the paper-bill spread dominates whatever is the

other financial variable in the system despite the orderirit of .thf paper-bill

spread           the underlyins orthotonaliration. Table 6 highlights the

relevance of this ordering by presenting alternative variance decomposition

results for those three financial variables which, for at least some output

measures, account for a greater share of output in the decompositions shown in

Table 5. In these alternative results, in which the paper-bill spread is

ordered third and the other financial variable fourth, the dominance of the

paper-bill spread is pervasive.

     In sum,   both   single-equation significance tests and multiple-equation

variance decompositions based on the last three decades of U.S. experience

consistently point to a statistically significant relationship between movements

of the paper-bill .spread and subsequent fluctuations in real economic activity,

even in the presence of other financial variables that previous researchers have

 II. Accountine for the Soread

        Commercial paper represents the unsecured, discounted short-term (up to 270

 days) liability of either nonfinancial business corporations or financial

 intermediaries. As of yearend 1989, the volume of such claims outstanding it

 the   United States totaled $579 billion, of which approximately 18% was the

liability of U.S. nonfinancial businesses, 8% of U.S. bank holding companies,

52% of U.S. nonbank financial intermediaries, and 11% of foreign obligors.

Roughly one-third of the $579 billion had been originally issued directly by the

obligors (in practically all cases financial institutions) and the remaining

two-thirds through commercial paper dealers acting in the obligors' behalf.

Although commercial paper in some form or other has existed in the United States

for over a century, the commercial paper market in its current form is largely a

post World War II phenomenon, and the market's growth in recent decades has been

rapid. As recently as 1960, for example, the total volume outstanding was just

$6.5 billion (13% issued by U.S. nonfinancial businesses, 57% by U.S. nonbank

financial intermediaries, and 18% by foreign obligors).6

       Treasury bills represent the short-term (up to one year) discount

obligations of the U.S. Treasury, backed by the full faith and credit of the

United States Government. The Treasury first issued discounted instruments

resembling today's Treasury bills in 1929. Since then the volume outstanding

has fluctuated with the level of the government's debt and also with the varying

maturity patterns used to finance that debt. Given the enormous volume of debt

of all maturities used to finance the U.S. military effort in World War II, the

Treasury bill market has been large and well developed throughout the post-war

period: The volume of Treasury bills outstanding in 1946 was $17 billion. At

yearend 1990 it was $482 billion.

       Three factors appear most important in accounting for l'ne typically greater
                                            -11-




observed interest rate on commercial paper than on Treasury bills. First,

federal statute precludes states or municipalities from taxing income earned as

interest on any U.S. Treasury obligations, bills included, except for those

states that employ the franchise tax on business income or impose an excise tax

on bank income. By contrast, interest earned on privately issued obligations.

like coercial paper, is typically taxable at the state or municipal level. As

of 1990, 43 states (plus the District of Columbia) had individual income taxes,

with rates applicable to interest income varying up to a high of 14% in

Connecticut. Similarly, 28 states (plus the District of Columbia) had corporate

income taxes.7 In addition, some municipalities have income taxes applicable to

interest income. In 1990 New York City taxed income earned by residents at a

maximum rate of 395%8

     To the extent that an investor choosing between commercial paper and

Treasury bills is a taxable entity domiciled in a state and/or municipality with

an income tax, therefore, some positive interest rate spread between paper and

bills is necessary to render the two instruments' respective returns identical

on an after-tax basis â€¢-      that   is, to achieve




     (1-v) r â€”      r                                                     (2)




where r and rE are the nominal interest rates paid on commercial paper and

Treasury bills, respectively, and c is the effective state/municipal tax rate.

Moreover, the required spread for this purpose varies directly with the level of

the tax-exempt rate, according to



        -
            r   â€”
                    (fâ€”) rB
                                         -12-




 Given values of 0.57% for the spread and 6.48% for the bill rate, on average for

 the 1959-90 sapple period spanned in Figure 1, the implied effective tax rate

 would be 8.1% (that is, .081) If differential taxability were the sole factor

 accounting for a nonzero average spread over time.   (A 9.7% tax rate would be

 required to explain in full the average spread between commercial paper and

Treasury bills at three months maturity.)

     A second factor clearly differentiating Treasury bills from commercial

paper is that payment on the paper is subject to potential default by private

obligors. Moreover, in the event of bankruptcy, the unsecured status of

commercial paper typically places it low on the scale in the application of the

conventional "me-first" rules. Given any nonzero probability of default, even a

risk-neutral investor would require a positive paper-bill spread to want to hold

commercial paper instead of Treasury bills. The expected after-tax returns on

the two assets are identical when



     (1 -   w#)(l-r) r -   â€” r5                                           (4)




where r is now the uromised interest rate on the commercial paper; w is the

probability that a default on the paper will occur within the time horizon that

is relevant for this investment;      is the fraction, 0 s S 1, of the stated

principal amount that the investor will lose in the event of default; and r is

again the state/municipal tax rate.

     If investors are risk-averse, however, mere equality of expected returns is

insufficient to make an investor willing to hold a risky rather than a risk-free

asset, and so the required spread is correspondingly greater. To take a simple

example, suppose that an investor's portfolio consists entirely of Treasury

bills and commercial paper, and that the investor's choice between them is
                                             -13-




governed by maximization of expected utility of nominal end-of-period wealth,

where the "period" is identical to the stated maturity of the bills and the

paper (so that the bills are genuinely riskiess), and utility is characterized

by constant relative risk aversion. Then the relationship between the two

(promised) interest rates that leaves the investor just indifferent between the

two   assets   at the margin is



       [1 -      - 2apw(1-i)2)(l-i')   r - ops(l-s)#2(l-r)2 r
                                   -   i[l   -
                                                 a(l-w)]   â€”
                                                               r          (5)




where a is the fraction of the investor's portfolio invested in commercial paper

and p is the coefficient of relative risk aversion.

       In contrast to the experience of the inter-war period, which included 171

separate default episodes, few issuers have defaulted on their outstanding

conercia1 paper since World War â€¢9 By far the most significant post-war

default was Penn Central's failure to meet payment on $82 million of paper due

in June 1970. Following the Penn Central default, the major credit rating

agencies introduced new systems of rating commercial paper, not only

distinguishing prime-rated from non-prime paper but also designating three

separate categories of prime-rated paper (P-i, P-2 and P-3 by Moody's; A-i, A-2

and A-3 by Standard and Poor's). Since the introduction of these ratings, only

five rated issuers have experienced defaults, and three of these had lost their

prime ratings before their respective defaults occurred.1Â°

       Some authors have pointed to the Scant experience of actual defaults to

argue that default risk must play a small if not negligible role in accounting

for the observed positive spread between the promised interest rate on

commercial paper and the Treasury bill rate.11 To be sure, this argument is
                                            -14-




plausible if the question at hand is whether default risk alone can explain the

spread. Like the two instruments' differing tax status, however, the relevant

issue is the potential role played by default risk in conjunction with other

factors.

     Gauging the relevant default rate w and loss rate        to employ in an

expression like (5) is problematic for several reasons. One is just the

distinction between event frequencies observed within any (finite) sample and

the corresponding subjective probabilities as assessed by rational agents -.         in
other words, the familiar "Peso problem."12 A second is that there is no

guarantee that the relevant agents whose subjective probabilities have mattered

for the relative pricing of commercial paper and Treasury bills were in fact

"rational" in the usual technical sense. Yet a third is that many of these

agents - -   those   acting in a fiduciary capacity, for example - - may have been

responding to incentives not encompassed within the usual risk-return utility

calculus. (The embarrassment in the event of a client's holding defaulted paper

may matter, in addition to the pecuniary loss to the client's accounts.)

Finally, many investors in commercial paper either cannot or do not diversify

their holdings sufficiently to render their own potential loss rates equivalent

to those of the commercial paper universe outstanding. Such investors therefore

plausibly perceive a potential default as a more catastrophic event than what

the aggregate data suggest.

     Figure 2 plots combinations of default probability w (for values up to a

maximum of .1) and state tax rate r (for values up to .09) that satisfy the

relationship in (5) for the average values of r and r5 observed over 1959-90,

given loss rate       â€” .0064, portfolio proportion a â€”   37 (the most recent actual

paper/(paper +    bill)   ratio as measured in the Federal Reserve's Flow of Funds

accounts), and two separate values of the coefficient of relative risk aversion

 p: 0 (that is, risk neutrality) and 20. A loss rate of .0064 corresponds to the

 worst recorded experience for the commercial paper market in any given year

 since World Var 1, when 0.64% of the outstanding paper was lost in defaults in

 1931. Parameter e therefore represents the probability that investors associate

with a given year's replicating the 1931 default experience.

         As the discussion of equations (2) and (3) above indicates, a state tax

rate of .081 would be sufficient to account fully for the observed mean

paper-bill spread in the absence of any possibility at all of default. A

non-zero probability of default makes the observed mean spread consistent with a

lower tax rate. For example, if investors believe there is a one-in-twenty

chance of default on 0.64% of their commercial paper holdings (that is, w â€”

 .05),   this default probability together with a state tax rate of approximately

.06 would be sufficient to account for the entire observed mean spread. As the

figure makes clear, these results are not very sensitive to the assumed risk

aversion.

     Finally, a third factor potentially also underlying the positive average

paper-bill spread is the greater liquidity of Treasury bills compared to

commercial paper)3 The market for U.S. Treasury bills has traditionally been

the most liquid of any asset market in the United States (in recent decades, in

the entire world) in terms of an investor's ability to buy or sell large amounts

of securities with minimum transactions costs, minimum impact of the investor's

own action on the market price, maximum availability of agents willing to act in

the investor's behalf, and maximum availability of either financing for margined

long pQsittons or securities to borrow against short positions. Despite

substantial advances in the last decade or two, the commercial paper market has

never met this standard. Firms issuing commercial paper, or dealers acting in

their behalf, are usually willing to take back paper presented by investors
                                       -16-




before the stated maturity date, but they bear no legal obligation to do so.

Finding third-party buyers is also problematic.

     Various legal restrictions also contribute to making Treasury bills a more

liquid ssset than commercial paper for the specific categories of investors to

which they apply. Commercial banks and other depository institutions, for

example, can use Treasury bills as collateral when they borrow from the Federal

Reserve discount window. Commercial paper is not eligible collateral for this

purpose. Similarly, under current federal tax law, state governments

undertaking advance refunding of outstanding obligations must invest the

proceeds in Treasury securities to avoid sacrificing the exemption of the

interest that they pay from taxability at the federal level. Here too,

commercial paper does not qualify.

     Differential liquidity therefore presumably accounts for at least some part

of the positive paper-bill spread on average over time. In analytical terms, a

liquidity value of bills over paper would simply take the form of a constant

subtracted from the left-hand-side of (5), which in turn would shift both of the

curves in Figure 2. In addition, differential liquidity could also account for

either cyclical variation of the paper-bill spread (for example, if investors

value liquidity more highly when a recession increases the uncertainty

surrounding their own cash flows) or a time trend in the spread (presumably

negative, to reflect the gradually increasing efficiency of the commercial paper

market during the past few decades).

     In the end, what is most interesting about the paper-bill spread is neither

the mean spread over time nor the presence or absence of a time trend, but the

way in which variation of the spread through time corresponds, with some lead

period, to fluctuations in real economic activity. There is little reason to

think that state or municipal income tax rates vary systematically with the
                                          -17-




business cycle. By contrast, there is some ground to suspect that the value

investors place on the greater liquidity of bills over paper does so. Further,

as Figure 3 shows, both the frequency of business failures and the volume of

defaulted business liabilities (scaled by gross national product) vary inversely

with the pace of real economic activity)4 As a result, it is also plausible to

suppose that rational investors increase their subjective assessment of default

rate w (and perhaps also reduce their assessment of recovery rate )      if   they

have independent information indicating that a business recession is imminent.

And   if   they do, then arbitrage behavior like that underlying the relationship in

(5) would, in turn, deliver time variation in the paper-bill spread that would

anticipate business fluctuations.

      In addition, given that such features as the favorable tax treatment of

bills, the default risk on paper and the superior liqudity of bills render these

two   instruments   imperfect portfolio substitutes, fluctuations in their relative

market supplies will also lead to fluctuations in the spread along the lines

illustrated in (5). As the discussion in Section III below explains, some of

these supply movements, and hence some of the resulting fluctuations in the

spread, are plausibly related to the business cycle. Others, however, may

merely reflect institutional technicalities of the Treasury bill market.

Short-term fluctuations in the Treasury's cash flow alternatively swell the

supply of bills or increase the demand (by forcing banks to present eligible

collateral against enlarged tax and loan account balances). These fluctuations

occur in part on a seasonal basis, but also in part irregularly. Fluctuations

in the volume of advance debt refundings by state and local governments, as

sometimes occur in anticipation of changes in tax legislation, also affect the

demand for Treasury bills (because of legal restrictions on these borrowers'

options for temporarily re-investing the proceeds of advance refundings). So do

fluctuations in the Federal Reserve's open market operations (because most open

market purchases and sales take place in Treasury securities). So do most

exchange market interventions by foreign central banks (because most central

banks, though nowadays not all, hold a disproportionately large share of their

dollar portfolios in Treasury bills compared to the portfolio of the typical

private market participant). So do the "window dressing" activities of banks

and other private investors that choose to sacrifice a few days' interest

differential in order to show atypically large Treasury bill holdings on their

year- or even quarter-end financial statements. The effect of each of these

institutional distortions is presumably to introduce "noise" in the paper-bill

spread, in the sense of movement unlikely to correspond to what matters in

financial markets for nonfinancial economic activity.

     Table 7 presents estimation results for a series of regressions intended to

capture some of the main elements in the discussion above of the determinants of

the paper-bill spread. The coefficient values in the first row of the table,

based on monthly data spanning 1974:1-1990:12, show that the paper-bill spread

is positively (and strongly) related to the level of the bill rate, as the tax

argument and the default-risk argument presented above both suggest.15 The

results in the second row show that the spread is also positively (and strongly)

related to the perceived commercial paper default risk, measured here by the

spread between the respective interest rates on P2- and P1-rated paper. The

results in the third row show that both findings hold up, to at least a

marginally significant degree, when the regression includes the two variables

together. Finally, the results in the fourth row show that, even in the

presence of these two variables, there is again no statistically significant

evidence of a time trend in the spread.      (A negative time trend, for example,

might represent a declining liquidity value of bills over paper as the

commercial paper market has developed over time.)

    The lower panel of of Table 7 shows the results of an attempt to replicate,

for the longer sample spanning 1959:1-1990:12, the four regressions shown just

above. Because published commercial paper ratings were not introduced until

after the Penn Central default, however -   - hence the 1974 starting date of the

sample used for the regressions in the upper panel -   - here   the spread between

the respective interest rates on Baa- and Ma-rated corporate bonds is used as a

proxy for perceived commercial paper default risk. Risk of default over the

coming six months need not be the same as risk of default over the life of a 20-

or 30. year bond, however, and so the default-risk aspect of the attempt to

extend these results backward to the longer sample does not deliver significant

results.16 (Indeed, in equations combining the bill rate level and the bond

quality spread, the point estimates for the spread variable's coefficient are,

nonsensically, negative). By contrast, the strongly positive relationship

between the paper-bill spread and the level of the bill rate corresponds well to

the result found in the shorter sample. So does the absence of any evidence of

a time trend.

     Figure 4, based on the regression in the third row of the upper panel of

Table 7, shows a decomposition of the monthly variation of the paper-bill spread

during 1974-90 into three components: a part attributed to variation in the

bill rate; a part attributed to perceived default risk, as measured by the P2-Pi

spread; and the regression residual (augnented by the constant term). Table 8

presents suimsary statistics for these three components, including their

respective simple correlations with changes in real output, as well as

F-statistics for the significance of distributed lags on these components in

equations for real output analogous to (1) above.

change in real output one month ahead is significant at the .01 level. The

distributed lag on each component in equations for real output analogous to

those reported in Table 3 is significant at the .05 level or better.

    Hence factors like state and municipal taxation, which plausibly account

for a major part of the averase spread over time but do not themselves plausibly

fluctuate in a systematic way over the business cycle, may still play a role in

the spread's predictive content by virtue of the way in which their effect on

the spread interacts with the level of the bill rate. Perceived default risk

(as measured by the P2-Pi spread) more plausibly fluctuates with prospects for

business activity. and it is also apparently part of the story)7 Finally, the

significance of the residual component may represent a role for either variation

in the liquidity value of bills over paper, or variation in perceived default

risk not captured by the P2-Fl spread, or both.

III. Borrowers     Lenders jj the Short-Term Credit Markets

    The analysis in Section II suggests a role for both time-varying default

risk and a time-varying liquidity premium as explanations for the predictive

power of the paper-bill spread with respect to real output. Based as it is

entirely on the observed spread and on inferred components of the spread, that

analysis has little to say about how variations over time in either default risk

or the liquidity value of bills over paper arise, or why these variations are

related to fluctuations in real output. Given the nature of recorded

bankruptcies, it is straightforward to see why perceived default risk might

covary with the business cycle. Why   the liquidity value of bills over paper
might do so bears further investigation. In both cases, however, developing

hypotheses about financial behavior that facilitate bringing to bear data on

debt quantities as well as interest rates is likely to be helpful as a way of

distinguishing empirically among competing explanations for the predictive

properties of the spread.

     Three such hypotheses are especially interesting in this context.

     Chanees j1] FerceDtions .f Default E.LS. First, a widening of the

paper-bill spread in advance of business downturns may reflect anticipations, on

the part of investors, that a downturn is likely to occur and hence that default

by private borrowers with cyclically sensitive cash flows has become more

likely. To the extent that these anticipations tend on average to be correct,

fluctuations in the spread will predict fluctuations in the growth of real

output. Further, if investors' anticipations in this regard embody information

from disparate sources, or information that is otherwise difficult to quantify

or to summarize in a compact way, the paper-bill spread will have predictive

content that is significant even in the presence of other standard predictors of

output fluctuations like those included in the regressions presented in
                                       -22-




Section I.

     Figure 5 shows schematically the implications, for the bank loan market

(left) and the commercial paper market (right), of an increase in the default

risk that lenders in the short-term credit markets associate with private

obligations, on the assumption that the interest rate on (default-free) Treasury

bills remains unchanged. As is consistent with the effect of an increase in

in equation (4) above, the upward-sloping curves representing lenders' portfolio

demands (alternatively, their supply of credit) in both markets shift inward.18

As a result, the new equilibrium in each market exhibits a smaller quantity of

credit extended, and a higher interest rate (relative to default-free bills)

than before the increase in perceived default risk. Hence the implied

covariation between the observed spread to bills and the relevant credit

quantity is negative in each market.

     In principle, therefore, the loan-bill spread and the paper-bill spread

might equally predict fluctuations in real output. No one has forcefully argued

this case empirically for the loan spread, however.19 One reason is probably

that bank loans have many implicit (that is, non-interest) price elements, so

that changes in observed loan interest rates are not a good measure of changes

in the cost of loans over short time horizons. Another likely reason is that

bank lending often involves long-term customer relationships in which what may

appear to be short-term departures from market-clearing price   behavior may be

perfectly rational. On both counts, it is not surprising that the paper-bill

spread is superior as a short-run predictor of fluctuations in real output. (As

Table 1 shows, the widening of the paper-bill spread before recessions is a

matter of at most six months).

of Kashyap at al. (1991), points to monetary policy. Figure 6 illustrates the

basic mechanics at work here, again focusing on the respective markets for bank

loans and commercial paper. A tightening of monetary policy (smaller growth of

bank reserves) causes banks' demand for loans to shift inward. As in Figure 5,

the result is a higher loan rate and a smaller loan quantity. Here, however,

nonbank investors' demand for commercial paper has not changed. As would-be

borrowers who do not receive bank loans seek credit elsewhere, supply in the

paper market shifts outward!0 Hence the quantity of paper issued rises, as

does the commercial paper interest rate.

    What is missing in the argument thus far is a reason why this increase in

the paper rate would also represent an increase in the paper-bill spread.

Tighter monetary policy presumably raises the bill rate too. If the predictive

content of the paper-bill spread arises because changes in the spread reflect

changes in monetary policy, which in turn affects output for any or all of the

standard reasons, tighter monetary policy must raise the paper rate not just

absolutely but also relative to the bill rate.

    One answer to this question, following the analysis in Section II, is that

both the tax component of the spread (for given state/municipal tax rates) and

the default risk component (for given default probability and expected recovery

rate) depend directly on the level of the bill rate. To the extent that tight

monetary policy raises the bill rate, therefore, it also widens the paper-bill

spread. This line of argument is satisfactory as far as it goes. but ultimately

insufficient. As the correlations and F-statistics presented in Table 8 show,

the predictive content of the paper-bill spread is not simply a matter of the

spread's proportional covariation with the bill rate.

    An alternative (albeit not mutally exclusive) explanation offered by

ZernaÃ±ke and by Kashyap et al. emphasizes, in part, heterogeneity among

borrowers. If the obligations of borrowers who shift from the bank loan market

to the commercial paper market when monetary policy tightens are systematically

less attractive to commercial paper investors than the obligations of borrowers

whose paper is already outstanding -    - either   because these new borrowers are

lass creditworthy, or because they deal in smaller volume so that their paper is

less liquid --   then   the resulting rise in default risk or loss of liquidity for

the representative issuers paper will lead the market-average commercial paper

rate to rise relative to the rate on Treasury bills (or any other instrument the

risk and liquidity of which remain unchanged).

     Yet a third potential explanation (again not mutually exclusive with the

other two) reflects the behavior of investors allocating their portfolios among

different assets, as captured in equation (5). Even apart from changing

objective characteristics like default risk or liquidity, the mere fact that

investors regard commercial paper and Treasury bills as imperfect substitutes

implies that some widening of the paper-bill spread is necessary. when tight

monetary policy forces borrowers out of the banks and into the open market, to

induce investors to increase the share of their assets that consist of

commercial paper.

     Changes j Borrowers Qh Flows.          Finally, it is also possible that the

behavior that shifts in such a way as to increase the paper-bill spread when

real economic activity turns downward is not that of lenders but of borrowers.

As Table 1 shows, the spread is especially wide not only just before recessions

but during recessions as well. Influences like tight monetary policy, by

contrast, might well be expected to change direction during the course        of a

recession, leading the spread to decrease.21 (The analogous point does not

apply to hypotheses based on time-varying default risk since, as is clear from

 Figure 3, bankruptcy and default rates typically remain high for at       least a year
                                      -25-




after a recession ends.)

     One major influence on borrowers' behavior that could plausibly account for

movements of the paper-bill spread in this context is the cyclical variation of

firms' cash flows. As revenue growth ebbs and both inventory accumulation and

operating costs continue to rise, in the final stages of a business expansion,

firms' credit requirements increase. Figure 7 shows such an increase as an

outward shift in the supply of both bank loans and commercial paper. As in the

case of the default risk hypothesis, shown in Figure 5, the underlying mechanics

are the same in both markets, at least in principle. The cash flows hypothesis,

however, implies a positive correlation between changes in the paper rate and

changes in the   paper   quantity.

     As in the case of the monetary policy hypothesis, here too some further

arugment is necessary to render the implied absolute increase in the paper rate

an increase also relative to the bill rate. Once again, either the

borrower-heterogeneity argument or the imperfect-substitutes argument, or both,

will suffice.

IV.        Evidence n Comoeting Hypotheses

      The results presented in Tables 7 and 8 indicate that such factors as

taxes, default risk and liquidity, which plausibly explain much of the positive

averase paper-bill spread, also play some role in accounting for the movement of

the spread over time (Table 7) as well as the spread's predictive power with

respect to fluctuations of real output (Table 8>. In terms of the more

structural analysis of Section III, an increase in perceived default risk

represents a straightforward influence on the behavior of lenders. A widening

of the paper-bill spread due to increasing importance of differential taxation,

as the general level of interest rates rises, likewise represents an influence

on lenders' behavior; but the reason why interest rates rose in the first

instance may reflect tighter monetary policy or still other influences on either

borrowers' or lenders' behavior. The same is true of arguments based on

liquidity. A shift in the composition of the "market portfolio" toward a

greater weight on commercial paper may well cause the spread between the

respective returns to paper and other assets (including bills) to widen, but the

question once again is why the outstanding volume in the paper market grew so

rapidly in the first place. Answering questions like these on the basis of

information about interest rates alone is clearly impossible.

      Figures 8 and 9 present the basic data corresponding to the ouantities at

issue in the discussion of competing hypotheses in Section III. The top panel

of Figure 8 shows that the 4-quarter growth rate in the outstanding volume of

bank loans (commercial and industrial loans) typically peaks in advance of the

onset of recessions --   very   slightly in advance in most episodes, though much

more so in 1957. The table's bottom panel plots analogous 4-quarter growth

rates for the total volume of non-bank-related domestic commercial paper

outstanding, as well as for the components of this total representing the

     Given the tendency of the paper-bill spread to widen in advance of

recessions, and to remain wide during recessions, these

                                               monetary policy hypothesis or the cash

growth of commercial paper volume and in the paper-bill spread, as either of

 spread is positively correlated with the contemporaneous real    growth rates of
 commercial paper volume and bank loan volume, but the correlation
                                                                      with paper
 volume growth is far greater. Under the cash flows hypothesis both correlations

 would be positive, while under the monetary policy hypothesis the

 spread-to-paper-growth correlation would be positive and the

 spread-to-loan-growth correlation would be negative. By contrast, under the

default risk hypothesis both correlations would be negative.

     Two further elements of this price-quantity interaction
                                                                 give still further
weight to the cash flows hypothesis in preference to the
                                                            monetary policy
hypothesis. First, as the third row of Table 9 shows, the
                                                              paper-bill spread is

also strongly correlated with contemporaneous growth of the cash deficit that

nonfinancial corporations need to finance.24 Second, the role of the finance

companies presents a particular puzzle for the monetary policy    hypothesis.
Tighter monetary policy would, in the first instance, restrict the lending of

banks but not finance companies. Would-be borrowers not accommodated by banks

would then turn to finance companies, so that these institutions'
                                                                     lending (and
hence their borrowing to fund that lending) would rise along with that of

nonfinancial issuers of commercial paper. As Figures 8 and 9 show, however,

growth of finance paper fluctuates more in step with growth of bank loans than

with growth of paper issued by nonfinancial corporations.

     Especially when they relate prices and quantities, simple correlations can

often be misleading. Table 10 therefore presents the results of estimating

several variations of a regression relating the paper-bill spread to

contemporaneous and lagged growth in the total volume of non-bank-related

domestic commercial paper outstanding (including issues of both nonfinancial

firms and finance Companies) and to a direct measure of perceived default risk.

  is related positively both to lagged
                                          paper volume growth (expressed relative to
 the total amount of paper and bills
                                         outstanding) and to perceived default risk
 as measured by the P2-Fl differential, and
                                                  negatively to the relative quantity
 of Treasury bills outstanding, and that the time
                                                       trend is not only negative (as
 usual) but statistically significant along with the other three variables. The

 relationship of the paper-bill spread to paper volume growth and the bill

 quantity provides evidence supporting the assumption that
                                                                investors regard
 commercial paper and Treasury bills as imperfect
                                                       portfolio substitutes, which is
 an important element in either the monetary policy
                                                         hypothesis or the cash flows

 hypothesis. The relationship of the spread to the P2-Pl differential, even in

 the presence of growth in paper volume, provides evidence in favor of the

 default risk hypothesis. The significance here of the negative time trend - -

 indicating   a declining spread on average over time, as the commercial
                                                                              paper
 market has become more fully developed -   - presumably reflects the advantage of
using a relationship that makes at least some allowance for         supply effects on
 the relative yields of commercial paper and Treasury bills (in contrast to, for

example, the insignificant time trends shown in Table 7).

     Allowing for the simultaneity of supply and demand renders this evidence           in
favor of imperfect substitutability and the role of perceived default risk even

more persuasive. Row (2) of Table 10 reports two-stage least-squares estimates

of the same regression, using as instruments the log change in the real monetary

base, current and lagged once; the log change in real nonborrowed reserves

(augumented to include "extended credit"), current and lagged once; and the

financing deficit of nonfinancial corporations (as a share of the amount of

paper and bills outstanding), current and lagged once --      all   variables plausibly
related to either monetary policy or borrowers' financing needs25 TSLS

estimation based on these variables as instruments for the change in the volume
                                       -30-




 of commercial paper outstanding increases the coefficients on paper volume

 growth and on the pure defeult risk variable.26 The regression reported in row

 (3) shows that comparable results also follow from measuring the respective

 interest rates on commercial paper and Treasury bills at three- rather   than
                        27
 six-months maturity.

     The regression reported in row (4), again using six-month rates, further

 conf ins these findings and indicates once more the importance of
                                                                     simultaneity
 in this context, If the correct dependent variable for studying investors'

willingness to buy commercial paper versus Treasury bills is the paper-bill

spread, then adding the bill rate to both sides of the equation (so that the

dependent variable is simply the paper rate) should result in a coefficient of

unity on the bill rate as an independent variable and unchanged coefficients

elsewhere. Comparison of rows (4) and (2) shows that, the bill rate indeed has

a coefficient of approximately unity and that in other respects the new

regression corresponds quite closely to its earlier equivalent.28 Once again,

the conclusions to be drawn are that investors regard commercial paper and

Treasury bills as imperfect substitutes in a way that matters for the paper-bill

spread, that the spread is related to fluctuations in paper volume growth that

correspond to variables plausibly reflecting changes in either monetary policy

or business financing needs, and that there is a further, independent role for

changes in perceived default risk.

     The results shown in rows (5), (6) and (7) indicate that using the Baa-Aaa

bond rate differential in place of the P2-Pl paper rate differential   (which,

following the discussion above, permits lengthening the sample) preserves the

overall flavor of the evidence. The coefficient on the quality variable is much

smaller (albeit still statistically significant), as is consistent with the bond

differential's measuring much more inaccurately the default probabilities that
                                           -31-




 are relevant to commercial paper investors, but in other respects the results

 for the longer sample are highly similar to those shown above.

      Finally, the question remains whether the information about
                                                                      real output
 contained in the paper-bill spread cannot be just as easily (or almost as

 easily) represented with more standard variables,
                                                       including variables

 corresponding conceptually to the several hypotheses developed in this
                                                                             paper.
 On the evidence, the answer is no. The results
                                                     sununarjzed in Table 11, and in
 Figures 10 and 11, show that even after allowing for such variables as money

 growth and perceived default risk and the general level of interest
                                                                         rates, there
 is still a further element of the paper-bill
                                                  spread that contains predictive

 content with respect to fluctuations in real output that is both statistically

 significant and economically important.

     The first column of Table 11 shows F-statistics for the
                                                                  real output

                                                                  respective log
changes in industrial production, the producer price index and     Ml; the change in
the bill rate; the Baa-Aaa differential; and the paper-bill spread. The

estimation uses monthly data spanning 1960:1-1990:12, with     lag length 6. Even
in the presence of these five other variables, representing so many of the

hypotheses considered in this paper, the distributed lag on the     paper-bill rate
is still significant at the .01 level. The table's second column shows

F-statistics for an analogous system with the P2-Fl differential in place of the

Baa-Aaa differential, and sample 1974:7-1990:12. Here the paper-bill spread is

again significant at the .01 level.

     Moreover, this "residual" explanatory power of the paper-bill spread is not

just statistically significant but quantitatively important. Figures 10 and 11

show the respective Sets of impulse response functions indicating the effects on

real output (estimated responses, bounded by 95% confidence intervals) due to

V.      Summary   21   Conclusions

       The empirical evidence assembled in this paper supports several specific

conclusions about the relationship between the paper-bill spread and real

economic activity in the United States. To begin, regression-based evidence for

the last three decades of U.S. experience --      including   two sub-periods

delineated by key structural changes in financial institutions -       - consistently
points to a statistically significant relationship between movements of the

paper-bill spread and subsequent fluctuations in real output, even in the

presence of other financial variables that previous researchers have often

advanced as potential business cycle predictors. This evidence includes not

only significant explanatory power of the spread in equations for real output

movements but also significant ability of the spread to account for the variance

of real output at forecast horizons relevant in a business cycle context.

       Next, readily identifiable features of commercial paper and Treasury bills

-   - including   the favorable tax treatment of bills at the state and municipal

level, the default risk on paper, and the superior liquidity of bills - -

distinguish   these two instruments in such a way that rational investors would

not plausibly treat them as perfect substitutes. These factors can reasonably

account for the averaze spread observed over time between the two instruments'

respective interest rates. The central focus of this paper, however, is not the

mean paper-bill spread but the spread's variation over time, and in particular

the predictive power of that variation with respect to real output. In this

context an important finding of this paper is that a decomposition of the spread

into components reflecting the interest rate level, a time-varying measure of

default risk and a residual delivers three components each of which bears a

significant relati.onship to subsequent movements in real output.

       Finally, evidence based on a more structural approach exploiting the
                                      -34-




presumed imperfect portfolio substitutability of commercial paper and Treasury

bills provides support for each of three hypotheses about why movements of the

spread anticipate movements in real output. First, changing perceptions of

default risk exert a clearly recognizeable influence on the spread, an influence

that is all the more discernable after allowance for supply effects associated

with imperfect substitutability. In this respect, the spread serves as a useful

"indicator" variable, compactly summarizing information available to investors

from a variety of disparate sources; but the underlying relationships play no

directly causal role in affecting economic activity. Second, given imperfect

substitutability, a widening paper-bill spread is also a symptom of the

contraction in bank lending due to tighter monetary policy. In this respect,

the spread does in part reflect s causal influence on economic activity. Third,

there is also some evidence of s further role for independent changes in the

behavior of borrowers in the commercial paper market due to their changing cash

requirements over the course of the business cycle, but for the most part this

third channel remains a potential object of further research.

     These findings are subject to numerous caveats, of course, and for the most

part there is no need to reiterate them here. The one reservation that does

perhaps deserve explicit attention in conclusion is that the abilty to sort out

these three competing hypotheses (or, for that matter, still others) with

time-series dats relies crucially on the presence of multiple independent shocks

generating movements in economic activity. For example, if changes in monetary

policy were the only factor determining whether the economy were to be in a boom

or a recession, then the effect associated above with changing perceptions of

default probabilities and the effect associated with changing business cash

flows would both merely be subsidiary reflections of monetary policy. In this

respect, investigation of the relationship between the paper-bill spread and
                                      -35-




real economic activity is little different from much of empirical

macroeconomics. Given the rich data potentially available on commercial
                                                                          paper
transactions by individual borrowers and lenders, however, in this case a useful

supplement to research based on the aggregate time series would be the parallel

exploitation of micro-level data.

1. Here, as well as elsewhere throughout this paper, the interest rates shown

    are discounts calculated on a 360-day basis. Data are from the Federal

    Reserve Board's ILlS release.



2. The only exceptions in this 384-month series are 1975:7-9, 1976:3, 1976:5

   and 1977:1-3. Prior to November 1979, the "6-month" paper rate recorded by

    the Federal Reserve Board actually corresponded to paper with maturities of

    120l79 days. The few anomalous negative values of the paper-bill spread

   may therefore reflect a steep, upward-sloping term structure for commercial

   paper in specific months during over that period. See the Federal Reserve

   Bulletin, December 1979, page A-27, footnote 2.



3. Data for gross national product, the deflator, midexpansion federal

   spending, and the monetary aggregates are seasonally adjusted. Data for

   interest rates and the paper-hill spread are not.
  4. There is no readily available monthly series corresponding to mid-expansion

      federal government expenditures.



  5. Uizman (1990), in related work, has shown that results like those presented

      in Table S carry over to systems simultaneously containing many more

      variables.



 6. Data are from the Federal Reserve System's flow-of-funds accounts. Useful

      descriptive accounts of the development and functioning of the commercial

      paper market include Selden (1963), Baxter (1966), Hurley (1977, 1982), and

      Stigum (1990).



 7. In addition, 17 states had a franchise tax on business income, and 18

      states levied an excise tax on bank income. See Commerce Clearing House,

      State ] Handbook   (1990).




 8. Cook and Lawler (1983) provided a highly useful discussion of the role of

      taxes in accounting for the paper-bill spread.



 9. See Selden (1963) for an account of the inter-war experience.



10. See Moody's Investors Service (1989) for a detailed history of experience

      under the rating system.



11.   See, for example, Bernanke (1990).



12. See, for example, Krasker (1980).
13. The classic discussion of liquidity in this context is that of Kessell

       (1965). An aspect of Kessel's treatment that is especially relevant to

      some of the results presented below is his argument that the premium placed

      on liquidity would (like the tax effect and the default risk effect

      discussed above) vary directly with the level of interest rates.



14. See Friedman (1986, 1990) for discussions of the increase in the failure

      rate and the default rate as a result of increased financial fragility in

      the 1980s.




15. Although augmented Dickey-Fuller tests for stationarity of the paper-bill

      spread reject the nonstationarity null at the .01 level, the fact that

      analogous tests for the interest rate level do not reject at the .10 level

      warrants care in interpreting the standard errors on the interest rate in

      these regressions, which may have non-standard asymptotic distributions.

      Indeed, the observation that the spread is 1(0) while the interest rate is

      1(1) is inconsistent with any hypothesis that the spread merely captures

      the effect of the interest rate level (via, for example, differential

      taxation) -




16.   An additional symptom of the weak link between the paper-bill spread and

      the Baa-Aaa bond spread is that while the paper-bill spread is I(0)the bond

      quality differential appears to be 1(1) over the 1959-90 sample.

      (Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests are unable to reject the null hypothesis of

      nonstationarity of the bond quality differential even at the .10 level,

      while analogous tests for the paper-bill spread over the shorter 1974-90

      sample do reject the null at the .05 level.) In other words, the bond
     quality differential appears to contain an integrated component that is not

     shared by the paper-bill spread.



17. As the analysis above indicates, default risk may also explain why the

     level of the bill rate would influence the spread. (The relationship in

     (4), for example, implies that the spread is proportional to the bill rate,

     with coefficient determined in part by the default probability.)



18. Here and below, the curve representing banks' demand for loans (supply of

     credit) is drawn with positive but finite slope. Making the curve vertical
     --   that   is, assuming that banks in the aggregate have no flexiblity to

     expand credit for a given quantity of reserves supported by the central

     bank --     would not materially change the analysis.



19. In regressions analogous to those summarized in Table 3, for example, the

     loan-bill spread is significant at the .05 level in the second sub-sample

     but not in the first, and not for the full sample. In the context

     represented by Table 5, the loan-bill spread is not significant, even at

     the .10 level, in regressions also including the paper-bill spread,

     (Kashyap at al. have advanced an argument for what amounts to the

     loan-to-paper guantity ratio.)



20. An alternative way to express the same relationship is to note that demand

     in the paper market depends on the loan rate.



21. As Figure 1 Shows, the spread does in fact tend to decrease before the

     recession ends.
22. Data are from the flow-of-funds accounts.



23. Kashyap et aT. (1991) examined sluillar plots, but based on the dates

     identified by Romer and Romer (1989) with changes in monetary policy,

     rather than on actual business cycle peaks. Kashyap et al. also did not

     incorporate finance company paper in their analysis.



24. The deficit is the difference between internally generated funds (gross of

    depreciation) and investment outlays. Data are from the flow-of-funds

    accounts.




25. The P2-Fl spread and the lagged bill share are also included as

     instruments, because they are treated as exogenous in the regression.



26. These results are robust to such changes in the instrument list as dropping

    the financing deficit, or including instruments constructed from interest

    rates.




27. The increase in the estimated coefficient on the quality differential in

    this regression is reassuring, in that the P2-Fl differential is actually

    measured for 1-month maturities.



28. 8ecause the commercial paper rate and the Treasury bill rate are each 1(1),

    the limiting distribution of the coefficient on the bill rate in line (4)

     is non-normal, and so its t-statistlc overstates the precision of the

    parameter estimate. The coefficients on the remaining stationary

    regressors will have normal limiting distributions, however.
