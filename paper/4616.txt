       Recent models in economic geography suggest that there may be very large numbers of
equilibrium spatial structures. Simulations suggest, however. that the sUuctures that emerge are
surprisingly orderly, and often seem approximately to follow simple rules about the spacing of
urban sites. This paper offers an explanation in terms of the process by which a spatial economy
diverges away from an even distribution of activity across the landscape. It shows that a small
divergence of activity away from spatial uniformity. even if it is highly irregular, can be regarded
as the sum of a number of simple periodic fluctuations at different spatial "wavelengths"; these
fluctuations grow at different rates. There is a particular "prefened wavelength" that grows
fastes provided thaL the initial distribution of activity across space is flat enough, this prefened
wavelength eventually dominates the spatial pattern and becomes the typical distance between
cities. The approach sug g e sts that surprisingly simple principles of self-organization may lie
beneath the surface of models that appear at first to yield hopelessly complex possibilities.

       Over the   last few years there has been a substantial revival
of interest in regional and urban economics. Much of this revival

is due to the rediscovered usefulness of regions and metropolitan

areas as empirical laboratories, whose evolution Can shed light on

such questions as the nature of the macroeconomic adjustment
process or the character of external economies. There has also,

however,     been a resurgence          of theoretical work on spatial
economics, thanks in large part to the application of modeling

techniques      previously     developed     in industrial      organization,

international trade, and growth theory.

      In several recent papers (Krugman 1991, 1992, 1993a, 1993b) I
have explored one particular approach to spatial modeling that,
while admittedly capturing only some of the reasons why spatial
structure emerges in real economies, has the virtue of being
particularly easy to work with. In this approach, an economy with
two or more locations is assumed to consist of two sectors: a
constant—returns, geographically immobile sector ("agriculture"),
and     an     increasing—returns,         monopolistically      competitive,
geographically mobile sector            ("manufacturing") .   When   one adds
transportation costs in the manufacturing sector, and also adds
some simple dynamics, models of this type exhibit spontaneous
spatial      self—organization: even if all locations are identical in
resources and technology, manufacturing firms have an incentive to

concentrate production close to the markets and supplies that other

manufacturing     firms      provide,   thus producing a °centripetal"
tendency toward agglomeration. Working against this ceritripetal

tendency,     however,    is the "centrifugal" pull of the immobile
                                        2


agricultural sector.
        In a two—location model, the tension between centripetal and

centrifugal forces can be treated analytically; one can derive a

criterion,    depending in an economically meaningful way on the
parameters,      which determines           whether or not manufacturing
concentrates in one location. Beyond this case, however, it becomes

very difficult to derive analytical results. Simulations show that

there   may be equilibria with multiple manufacturing concentrations:
they also indicate that as the number of locations grows, there
typically start to be a very large number of equilibria.
        Mid yet there seems to be some underlying order under this

complexity.     When one starts from a random distribution of
manufacturing on a linear, landscape, for example, one typically
finds that a roughly regular spacing of manufacturing
concentrations    emerges. Furthermore, the distance between these
concentrations is relatively insensitive to the starting position,
and appears to depend in a sensible way on the model's parameters.

It is easy to offer some          intuition   about why this should happen:

one may       argue,   following Arthur (L990), that successful
manufacturing    concentrations   tend to cast an VIagg1oaration    shadow"

over    nearby rivals, leading to a roughly equal spacing. Yet we
would like a more specific explanation. Mid one would like a model

of the model —— something that helps us to understand what our
computer is telling us.
        In this paper I offer a somewhat novel approach that helps
explain the behavior of these particular models, and that may turn
                                  3


out to have application in a variety of spatial models. Instead of

focussing on the long—run equilibrium that the economy eventually
attains, this approach focusses on the process of divergence away

from the unstable equilibrium in which manufacturing is evenly
distributed across space.
     In what sense is an even distribution of manufacturing
unstable?     Suppose that the actual distribution is slightly
perturbed away from perfect flatness. Such a perturbation, even if

it is highly irregular, can be thought of as a Fourier series (in
space, of course, rather than time) —— the sum of a number of

periodic     fluctuations, with different wavelengths. And some of
these periodic fluctuations will tend to be self—reinforcing,
growing over time. In particular, we can show that there is one
wavelength that is the most unstable in the sense that a
fluctuation at that wavelength tends to grow more rapidly than
fluctuations at any other wavelength. Given enough time, this
spatial wavelength Will dominate the         divergence from even
distribution —— and the peaks and valleys of the divergence will

dictate the locations of the eventual agglomerations. Thus the
spacing of manufacturing concentrations will be approximately equal
to the preferred wavelenath of the dynamic process of divergence,
a preferred wavelength that is determined by the parameters of the

model.      In particular, the preferred wavelength is    inversely

proportionalto transportation costs and positively related both to

the degree of scale economies and to the share of manufacturing in

the economy.

    The paper begins with a review of the general approach to
spatial dynamics used here, and describes the suggestive results of

some simulation exercises. It then turns to a specific model of a

linear economy, and shows how the evolution of this model near an

even distribution of manufacturing can be viewed in terms of the
growth rates of fluctuations of different frequencies. Finally, the

paper shows why the economy has a preferred wavelength, and how

this wavelength depends on the parameters.


1. A basic siatial modI


     Consider an economy in which there are a number of locations,

indexed by j   1...J. Let DJk be the distance between any pair of
locations j and k.

     In this economy there are two factors of production: immobile
"farmers" and mobile "workers". It will be convenient to choose
units so that there are a total of ],— farmers and u workers. Also,

in this paper I will restrict attention to economies in which

spatialstructure is completely endogenous, so the farmers will be
assumed to be equally divided among the locations.
     Everyone in this economy shares the same tastes, which may be
represented by a two—level structure. At the upper level, there are

Cobb—Douglas   preferences   between     agricultural   goods   and a
manufacturing aggregate:

                             U   c:c-r                            (j,
     At the lower level, manufacturing is a CES composite of a
                                      5

large number of symmetric differentiated products:


                                                                    (2)



where 1         1/(1-p) is the elasticity of substitution.

      Each factor is specific to the production of one sector.
Farmers produce agricultural output with constant returns to scale.

Workers produce manufactured goods. There are economies of scale in

this production, specific both to the firm and to the particular
variety produced; these are represented as a linear cost function,

                                 Lff1a+Q,                           (3)

     We also         introduce   transport   costs.   For the sake of
tractability, there are assumed to be zero transport costs for
agricultural goods. Transport costs on manufactured goods are of
Samuelson's "iceberg" form. If one unit of a manufactured good is

shipped from location j to location k, only exp(—YDJk) units arrive,

with ).   the    transportation cost per unit distance.
      It is a familiar proposition that if we take the spatial
distribution of workers as given, a model of the form just
described yields a monopolistically competitive equilibrium in
which all profits are competed away. This equilibrium includes an

equilibrium level of the real wage at each location: differences in
these real wage rates are what drive the economy's dynamics.
      Workers are assumed to move gradually toward locations that

offer them above—average real wages. Let              be the fraction of
workers currently in location . Then the average real wage rate

can be defined as a weighted average of real wage rates at each
                                       6


location,


                                                                            (4)




and the assumed dynamics take the form'



                             -     =                                       5)
    The dynamic behavior of this model ôan             be thought of as a
sequence of general—equilibrium                problems.    For     any   given
distribution of manufacturing across locations, the economy reaches

an equilibrium that determines the real wage at each location. This

vector of real wages then determines, via                  (4)    and (5), the
distribution of workers a short time later, and the calculation can

be repeated until the model economy converges on some long—run

equilibrium geographical pattern.
        In Krugnian (1992) I show that the equilibrium       of this   model at

any point in time can usefully be described as the simultaneous

solution of four sets of equations. First, the income of any
location is the sum of the earnings of its immobile farmers and the

workers who are currently located there:

                               =           +


where       is the wage rate measured in terms of the agricultural


        'In all of my models to date, I have ignored two important
aspects of real—world spatial economics —— forward—looking behavior
by agents who try to anticipate future spatial patterns, and large
agents, such as shopping mall developers, who try to influence
these patterns. The excuse for these omissions is, of course,
tractability.
                                             7

good.

        Second, the true price index of manufactures at any given
location     depends on            the   distribution of   manufacturing,

transportation costs, and wage rates:

                               [E Akwkesi                             (7)

        Third, the equilibrium wage rate at any location depends on
incomes, true price indices, and transportation costs to all other

locations:

                               =
                                   k vT:'e"°°a]"°                     (8)

        Finally, the real wage rate at location j depends on the
nominal   wage        terms of agricultural goods and the local true
                 rate in

price index of manufactured goods:
                                         =
                                             wT7                      (9)

    These equations are fairly simple, and are very easy to solve
numerically —— one simply starts with guesses at the wage and true

price vectors,       and iterates over (6)          (I), and (8) until
convergence. Analytical results, however, in anything larger than
a two-region model, are another matter. Thus to date explorations

of multi—location settings have relied on numerical examples. In
the next section I briefly describe one set of examples, as a
motivation for the subsequent discussion.

2. Evidence from numerical exarn1es.



       In an effort to understand the formation of systems of cities,

I carried out a series of simulations on a particular version of

the model described in part 1; these results are reported both in

Krugman (1992) and Krugman 1993a.        In these simulations the economy
was assumed to consist of 12 locations symmetrically placed around

a circle, like a clock face. (The number 12 was chosen because it

is a relatively small number with a large number of divisors). Each

run    began     with a random allocation of manufacturing across
locations,       and the model was then allowed to evolve until
convergence.

      For the most interesting range of parameters, the result of
these experiments was that 'the model economy organized itself into

a spatial structure with all manufacturing in 2 or 3 locations,
more or less symmetrically located around the circle. Figure 1
illustrates the results of a typical run, with the first set of
bars representing the initial shares of manufacturing, the second
set the final shares. In this case all manufacturing ended up in
locations 6 and 11, almost but not quite opposite each other on the
circle. For the parameters used for this run, about 60 percent of
the runs led to two cities 5       apart, almost all other runs to two
cities    6    apart,   and a few runs to three symmetrically placed
cities.
      At one level these examples demonstrate the complexity of the
possible outcomes, even in such a relatively small model. After
                                 9


all, there are 12 ways to locate concentrations 5 apart on a 12—

location circle, 6 ways to locate them 6 apart, and 4 ways to
locate 3 concentrations 4 apart. Thus even this example seems to
have 12+6+4=22 stable locational equilibria.

      And yet in some sense the model's results are not as
arbitrary as one might suppose. For these parameters, one always
gets 2 or on rare occasions 3 concentrations, never more or less.

And the concentrations are always at least roughly evenly spaced.
This suggests that there is a sort of natural distance between
manufacturing concentrations that the model is "trying" to produce,

within the limits of what the initial conditions allow.
     It would certainly be desirable to understand vhy the model

has a tendency to produce some particular spacing between
concentrations. Not only would it help us understand this model,
but it would raise hopes that economic geography will yield more
definite results than we might otherwise fear.         Models with
agglomeration economies typically have many equilibria, and one
therefore worries whether all that theory will tell us is that lots

of things could happen —— a result that would make the theory
untestable as well as useless. But the numerical examples suggest
that there may be a tendency to some kind of approximate
regularity, which will be a testable and useful prediction even if

we do not know precisely which equilibrium will emerge.
     But isn't this a lot to be resting on a small Set Of numerical

examples? Indeed it is, and we might want to try a much broader set

of examples before being sure of our generalizations, or,
                                            'U

alternatively,         we might look again at the theory and see whether
there    is     an    analytical   basis    for the     observed      near—regularities.

What we will do now is see that there is such a basis. Indeed,
linear spatial models along the lines we have been discussing                         (and

probably many other          spatial models      as well)      will   always     tend to

produce a regular spacing of agglomerations if the                               initial

distribution is sufficiently smooth.



3. Fluctuations and aaalomeration: some intuition


        Before proceeding to the formal analysis, it will be useful to

try to get some intuition about the story we are about to tell.

        Imagine,     then,   a "long,      narrow"   spatial    economy,    sufficiently

long that we may treat its length as infinite (that is, ignore edge
effects) and sufficiently narrow that we may treat it as one-
dimensional.   And imagine that initially manufacturing is
distributed almost evenly along this line —— almost, but not quite.
        We    first ask the following question: how does an increase in

the amount of manufacturing at one location, say z, affect the real

wage of workers at another location x?

        This is not an easy question to answer rigorously, because of
the     general      equilibrium   effects: a geographical redistribution of

manufacturing will in general change wage rates                    at all      locations.

But we can think loosely in terms of partial effects. At given wage

rates, an increase in the concentration of manufacturing at z will

have three effects on workers at x. First, it will enlarge their
                                  II

market, since they Can sell to z        second, it will improve the

supply of goods, since workers at X will buy goods from z; but
finally, it will increase the competition that workers at x face in

other markets.

     Do the positive effects (which we can think of as backward and

forward linkages, respectively) prevail over the negative? The
answer depends on how far Z is from x. Roughly, we can think of the
typical market in which Z competes with x as being halfway between
the two locations. If z and x are very close, then the market that

z provides is essentially as close to, and therefore as important
to x as the market in which z competes with x. In this case the
linkages outweigh the competitive effect. But if Z is very far
away, it is also much further away than the typical market in which

x and z compete. Both the linkages and the competitive effect will
be weak, but the linkages will be weaker (since the relevant
distance is twice as large) .    As    a result, a thickening of the

distribution at a distant Z is likely to reduce real wages at X.
     We can think, then, of some critical distance that defines the

range of positive     agglomeration     economies. An   increase   in

manufacturing at any point raises the real wages of workers within
that range, while depressing the real wages of workers beyond it.

     Now let us take the crucial step. Let us suppose for a moment
that the divergence of manufacturing from a completely flat
distribution is not erratic, but instead takes the form of a
periodic function —— indeed,   let it be a sine curve. And let us ask

what is likely to happen to this divergence over time.
                                   12

     Suppose that we look at a peak of this divergence. Will this

peak be marked by real wages that are above average, roughly
average, or below average? The answer depends on the distribution

of manufacturing     around this        peak.   High concentrations   of

manufacturing    near the peak,     within the range of positive
agglomeration economies, raise the peak's real wage: below—average
concentrations within that range lower it. Outside the range of

positive agglomeration, things are reversed: low manufacturing
concentrations raise the peak's real wage, high concentrations
reduce it.

     What this implies is that the real wage at the peak will
depend on the freauencv (or wavelength) of the distribution.
Suppose that the wavelength is very small relative to the range of

positive agglomeration, as in Figure 2. Then within that range
there will be about as many troughs as peaks, roughly cancelling
each other out: the real wage at the central peak will be just

about average.

     On the other hand,     suppose that the wavelength of the
distribution of manufacturing is very long compared with the range
of positive agglomeration, as in Figure 3. Then much of the "high
ground" surrounding our peak will lie on the wrong side of the
range of agglomeration, exerting a negative effect on the real wage

there. The real wage at the peak may well actually be below
average.

     The real wage at the peak is most likely to be high when the

wavelength of the manufacturing distribution is approximately equal
                                 13

to the range of agglomeration, as in Figure 4. In this case all of

the nearby deviations from flat manufacturing distribution work to

reinforce the high real wage at the peak: the high ground lies
inside the range of positive agglomeration, the low ground outside

(where it also therefore makes a positive contribution).

     Now let us consider what will happen to the the jp1jtude of

these fluctuations over time. In the case illustrated in Figure 2,

where the wavelength of the fluctuation is very short compared with

the range of agglomeration, peaks and troughs in the manufacturing
distribution will offer real wages that are little different from
the average. Thus there will be no particular tendency for the
fluctuations to change over time.

      In the case illustrated in Figure 3, where the wavelength of
the distribution    is very long compared with the range of
agglomeration,   peaks will tend to have below—average real wages,

troughs above—average. In this case, then, peaks and troughs will
tend to shrink over time: the fluctuations will die out.

      In the central case, however, peaks will offer clearly above-

average real wages, troughs below—average;     thus workers will
migrate away from troughs and toward peaks,        amplifying the
fluctuation over time.

     All of this reasoning depends, of course, on the assumption
that manufacturing is distributed across space in a regular sine
wave. What relevance can it have to a situation in which the
distribution of manufacturing is not so regular? The answer is that

irreaul r adistribution of n aufacturina Can he decoppsed into
                                       14

a Sum Of sine waves of different recniencies and amplitudes. And of

these regular fluctuations, those with very long wavelengths will
die out over time, those with very short wavelengths will grow only

slowly, while those with more or less the right wavelength will

grow     rapidly. In        particular,     there     is     some    wavelength
 (corresponding to the range of positive agglomeration) that will

grow most rapidly. Call this the "preferred wavelength". Over time,

the divergence of maflUfcturing from a flat distribution will tend
to bcom dominated        by a   fluctuation at th Prcferred_wavelenqth.
       This   process   cannot, of course, go on forever. For one thing,

we will see in the next section that the reasoning here is only
strictly valid as long as we are able to represent the economy by

a linear approxiniation around a flat distribution of manufacturing.

As the fluctuations grow, this linear approxiniation will break
down. Above all, at some point there will be no manufacturing left

in some locations; at that point the smooth curves of the
fluctuations will start gathering themselves into the spikes of

Figure 1.      But if the initial position of the economy is a
sufficiently flat distribution of manufacturing, the process of

divergence      Will     firmly    establish   peak        concentrations of
manufacturing      at intervals      roughly equal t o         the   preferred

wavelength,      and these peak concentrations will then gather
themselves into cities.

       A final point: notice that in this model, instability is the

source of self—organization. The economy organizes itself into a
spatial structure of cities and rural areas precisely because a
                                  15

flat, unorganized spatial structure is unstable; the intervals at

which cities   are located are determined by the particular
wavelength of fluctuation for which the flat structure is most
unstable.

     This is about as far as we can go in an intuitive discussion.

Let us now turn to a formal treatment.



4. Dynamics near a flat spatial structure



     For the formal analysis, we will consider a version of the
basic model presented in part 1 in which farmers are distributed
evenly along a line of infinite extent. Workers will also, at any
point in time, be distributed along that line; we let A(x) be the
density of workers at position X, normalized SO that with a flat

distribution k=i everywhere.

     For this economy, equations (6)—(9) may be rewritten in the
following form (the constant terms are added so that when the

     These are a fairly nasty—looking set of nonlinear equations.
Suppose, however, that we restrict our attention to situations in

which A(x)      is   close to 1,               that is, where the distribution of

manufacturingis fairly flat. Then we can take linear
approximations to the equations. Let a prima on a variable
represent   deviation from 1: then the approximate linearized model
takes the form



                                 Y'(X) =         isA'(x)+sw'(x)                           (14)




      T'(x) =
                        t (a—i)            z)    e ' fc't) IM_tIjztf   z) e (o-L) Ix-rIdz] (15)

                                                              (a—1)f T'(z)



                                           :    w'(x)   —   pT'(x)                        (17)


     These equations do not, at first sight, appear any more
tnctable than the nonlinear version. But now let us, following the

suggestion of part 3, assume for a moment that the distribution of

manufacturing follows a simple periodic distribution, say
                                  17


                               = âcos(4x)                            (18)




     Now   let us simply guess that if the divergence of A(x) from

1 follows this simple periodic form, the divergences of all of the
other variables from 1 will be.constant multiples of A(x). (This
conclusion is actually obvious from the spatial symmetry and the

linearity). That is, we guess that there is a solution of the form



                           Y'(x) =    aA'(x)                         (3.9)




                          T'(x)       a7A'(x)                        (20)




                          w'(x) z     a)/(x)                         (21)




                                  =   aA'(x)                         (22)

    If this is a valid solution, then we have managed to reduce a

general equilibrium problem that          is,   strictly speaking,     the

solution of an infinite number of nonlinear equations to the
solution of four linear equations.

     Let us, then, substitute (L8) into (19)—(22). When we do so,

we will see repeatedly a term of the form
                                           18

                               r (a—i)

                                         L_c ($z) et(3t4dz                  (23)

      With   a little grinding, it is possible to show that
                              K(z)   H($,r,a)cos($z)                        (24)
where


                                                (o—11'
                                                                            (25)

        H represents a sort of           discount factor —— the     ratio of the
impact of a fluctuation to what would happen if there was a uniform
increase in the same variable that raised the level at x by the
same amount. Thus in the equation for the true price index we know
that an equal increase in all wage rates would raise the price
index at x by an amount equal            to   the increase in the wage rate at
x;   a fluctuation will raise the price index by H          times   the increase

at x,     with the ratio H depending on the frequency of the
fluctuation.     It is immediately obvious that for for very high

frequencies,     H approaches zero, while for low frequencies it
approaches 1.

        We can now write our equations as
                                                 19


                                                                                             (26)

and

                                                 SW   - isa                                  (29)

      These equations can be solved to yield the crucial result that


                                                                                             (30)


      Why is this the crucial result? Because the linearized version

of the dynamic equation          (5)        is


                    dA'(x)   =                   = a(yA'(x)               gA'(x)             (31)

where g is the rate of growth of a fluctuation at that frequency.
      Now we note that a perturbation of the                               spatial distribution of

manufacturing around A=1 can be represented as the sum of a number
of    sine waves   of different wavelengths:


                        X'(x)           A'1(x)   t A'2(x) +     .     .    .                 (32)

And the growth of the perturbation may be written

                     ______      = g11 (x) + g21', (x) +                                     (33)


so that we can think of each periodic fluctuation as growing at its
                                             20

own characteristic rate. The fluctuation that will grow fastest is

the one with the largest (positive) response of the real wage rate

to manufacturing concentration: and given sufficient time that
fluctuation will dominate the spatial pattern.

     So all we have to do to determine the preferred wavelength is

find the maximum       of   (30). It is straightforward to determine three

results. First,

                      a,    0 when H =      0, that is ,     when   4—      (34)

    That   is,       as our intuitive discussion in part 3 suggested,
fluctuations at very high frequencies = very short wavelengths will
not tend to grow.

     Second,


                      a, < o when H=1, provided that                        (35)



     The condition here is a familiar one, appearing also in
Krugman    (1991).    It says, in effect, that economies of scale are not

so large that workers would prefer all to be concentrated in the
same place no matter how high transportation costs are. Given this
condition, we find that very low frequency fluctuations, those with
very long wavelengths, tend to die out.

     Finally, at H=O we find
                                      21.


                                  = __.k_ +
                             dH      a-i      a
                                                  >   0                    (36


     Taken together, these observations imply that the relationship

between the growth rate of a fluctuation and H has the shape
indicated in Figure 5. Growth is slow at very short wavelengths,
negative at high wavelengths, and most rapid at some intermediate

wavelength.

    The preferred wavelength, the wavelength of most rapid
divergence, is a function of the three parameters ,               , and     The

transport cost r enters the solution in only one place,                   in the
definition of H in (25). It is thus obvious that the preferred

frequency is strictly proportional to                     r, and thus that the
preferred wavelength is inversely proportional. This is obvious
with hindsight, since the wavelength and the transportation cost
can both be changed in the same proportion by redefining the unit

of distance, with no real change in the model.

     It is more painful to derive the impact of changes in the
elasticity of substitution and the share of manufacturing. It is,

however,   straightforward   to calculate the preferred frequency
numerically for given JA and a. This is shown in Table 1; we see

that higher elasticities          of substitution,           which imply lower
equilibrium economies of scale, tend to reduce the preferred
wavelength, while a higher manufacturing share tends to increase

the preferred wavelength.

5. Conclusions and im1icatjons


       Interesting models of the emergence of structure in a spatial

economy generally involve a tug of war between centripetal forces
that tend to produce agglomerations and centrifugal forces that

tend to pull them apart.                    Such models typically have many
equilibria.        Yet both observation of the world and experiments with
numerical models suggest that there is a surprising amount of order

in the actual outcomes. Wbat is the source of this orderliness?

       In this paper            I have suggested that the origins of order may
lie    in the dynamics of divergence away from an unstructured,
roughly flat spatial distribution of economic activity. In this
model, and probably in a number of others as well, it is possible
to think of the divergence from that unstable 11flat" equilibrium as

the sum of a number of spatially periodic fluctuations, which grow

at    different      rates. Out of       instability    emerges     order,   because the

fluctuations vith the fastest growth rates tend over time to
dominate the scene. If the initial distribution of activity is
sufficiently close to flat, the eventual distribution will be

closely determined by a single preferred wavelength, which is
preferred precisely because            it   is the most unstable.
       There are two obvious extensions to the present analysis. The

first is to two dimensions. Here one would be looking for a shape

as    well    as     a   size     of fluctuations.     It   seems    intuitively   obvious

that starting from a smooth distribution across a large plain, the
economy will tend to arrange itself into a hexagonal pattern, but
                                               23

I have not yet been able to show                    this.
       The second extension is to multiple industries,                          with different

transport costs           and/or economies of scale. A hypothesis is that a

Christaller—type hierarchy will emerge, with the                              distributions   of

the activities determined by sums of fluctuations at different
frequencies —— and            with each frequency an integer multiple of the
previous one. Again, I have not yet been able to confirm this
appealing notion.
       still, even the results of the simple model in this paper are

exciting, both for what they say about the real world and what they

say about           modeling.       They suggest            that     surprisingly        simple

principles of organization may lurk,                  at least as approximate rules,

beneath what appear to be hopelessly complex spatial systems. And
they suggest that the theory of spatial economies, which has
increasingly        come to rely on numerical                 methods,       may still    yield

some   secrets       to     paper—and—pencil    analysis       as    well.
