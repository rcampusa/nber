                                              ABSTRACT


          This paper develops county-level estimates of HMO market share for all
                                                                                        counties in the
  United States and uses them to examine
                                             the relationship between HMt) market share and the fee
  for a normal office visit with
                                    an established patient charged by 2,845 fee-for-service (FFS)
  physicians. Two-stage least squares estimates indicate that increases of 10
                                                                               percentage points in
 HMO market share are associated with decreases of approximately ii
                                                                            percent in the normal
 office visit fee. However, further
                                    examination indicates that the incomes of the physicians in the
 sample are not lower in areas with higher HMO market share. In
                                                                addition, the quantity of
 services provided, measured by the number of hours worked and the
                                                                           number of patients seen per
 week, is not higher in these areas. While it is possible that physicians induce
                                                                                    demand to change
 the volume or mix of services
                                 provided to patients in ways that do not affect the number of hours
 worked or patients seen, another hypothesis Consistent with these findings is
                                                                                  that FFS physicians
respond to competition from liMOs by
                                          adopting multi-part pricing strategies in which the price
for an office visit is reduced but prices for other services are raised.

    1. Introduction

            An important form of competition in health
                                                             care markets may take place between
   Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and physicians who operate on
                                                                                        a fee-for-service
   (FFS) basis. If HMOs compete with FFS
                                                   physicians for patients, or if HMOs are able to
   provide medical care more cost-effectively, FFS
                                                          physicians in markets where HMOs have
   significant market share may have to lower their fees or alter their practice styles
                                                                                              to compete.
   A number of studies have examined the effects of
                                                           HMOs on expenditures in the FFS sector.
  Some find that HMOs reduce FFS
                                         expenditures for ambulatory and hospital care
  expenditures, while others suggest that HMOs have not reduced, and may actually have

  increased, costs.2 However, since all of these
                                                      studies examine expenditures, which reflect
  both price and quantity, they are unable to separately determine the
                                                                              responses of price and
  quantity. There have been no studies looking
                                                     directly at the relationship between HMOs and
 physician fees or the quantity or services
                                                provided. A clear understanding of health care
 markets requires that these potentially separate responses to HMO competition be examined.

 This paper examines the effects of HMO market share on the fees charged by FFS
                                                                                              physicians
 and on the quantity of services they provide.

         To do this, a good measure of HMO
                                                   activity is needed. However, despite increases in
the prevalence of HMOs and interest
                                          in their ability to provide cost effective medical care,
estimates of HMO enrollment and market
                                               share have not been available for areas smaller than

    See e.g. Baker (1994), Robinson (1991),
                                            Noether (1988), survey by Frank and Welch (1985), and
Goldberg and Greenberg (1979).

  states and selected Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). The next section of this paper

  (section 2) describes the development of new county-level estunates of HMO enrollment and

  marker share. These estimates were constructed using published data that indicates, for the

  year 1990, the total enrollment for each HMO in the United States as well as the counties in its

  service area. The enrollees of each HMO were distributed to counties in the HMO's service

 area based on the county populations and distance from the HMO headquarters. Thenew

 estimates compare favorably to reliable estimates available for a limited number of MSAs.

        Section 3 begins the examination of the effect of HMO market shareon FFS physician

 prices by discussing the theoretical relationship between HMOs and FFS physician fees in the

 context of a simple linear spatial location model. In this model, as in standard competitive and

 monopolisticany competitive models, the entry of HMOs into a market will cause FFS

physicians to lower their prices. Thus, testing the relationship between HMOs and fees will

provide information about the extent of competition in health care markets.

        Section 4 presents the empirical work. The new estimates of HMO market share are

used along with data on the fee for a normal office visit with an established patient from a

1991 survey of young physicians. Several results are of interest. First, the initial examination

of the relationship between HMO market share and fees reveals an positive correlation--high

HMO market shares are associated with expensive office visits. This is probably the result of

HMOs choosing to locate in areas where physicians use high fees. To account for this

possibility and for omitted variables that may cause market share to be endogenous, two-stage

least squares (2SLS) was applied. Firm size and type (white collar vs. blue collar) serve as

instruments for market share. The 2SLS results are in line with the predictions of the theory,

                                               2
showing that increases in HMO market share are associated with significant decreases in

physician fees.

       Among the independent variables included in the fee regressions are the number of

generalist and specialist physicians per capita. These variables were used since earlier

literature (e.g. Cromwell and Mitchell, 1986) indicated that increases in the number of

physicians per capita are associated with increases in fees. However, the results presented

here suggest that the number of physicians per capita does not have a significant effect on fees.

       After examining fees I turn to incomes and the quantity of services provided. Here,

2SLS estimates reveal no relationship between HMO market share and physician incomes, the

number of patients seen per week, the number of hours worked per year, and the number of

surgical procedures performed. The fact that incomes did not change while fees fell would at

first suggest that physicians induced demand to make up for the reduction in fees. However,

the lack of a response in the other quantity variables suggests that this did not happen to a

significant degree. An alternate interpretation is that physicians adjusted different fees in

different ways, perhaps engaging in some sort of multi-part pricing scheme. For example,

they may have lowered the office visit fee but raised fees other services in response to

competition.

  2. County Level Estimates of LIMO Enrollment and Market Share

           To enable the subsequent empirical analysis, county-level3 estimates of HMO market

  share had to be developed. Conceptually, this took place in three steps. First, the total

  enrollment of each 1-IMO in the country and its service area, specified by county, were

  obtained. Second, the enrollment of each HMO was distributed among the counties in its

  service area. Finally, the total number of enrollees in each county was computed by summing

  county enrollments over all of the HMOs serving the county. Using the total number of HMO

 enrollees in each county, HMO market share was computed simply as the ratio of enrollees to

 total population.



 2.1. Enrollment and Service Area Data

         The primary source of information on HMO enrollments and service areas is the

 National Directory of HMOs, published annually by the Group Health Association of America

 (GHAA). Each year the GHAA conducts a mail survey, with telephone follow up, of all

 known HMOs in the country and, among other things, asks their total enrollment and their

service area. The results of the survey are published in the National Directory of HMOs

(Hereinafter the Directory). To construct estimates of 1990 county market share, I used the




    3Counties were selected as the unit of analysis since they represent areas small enough to capture
market dynamics while retaining data availability. Counties are defined here using the Area Resource File
(ARF) definitions. Although these are largely consistent with the standard FIPS definitions, they differ in
a couple of ways. See ARF user documentation for details (Office of Health Professions Analysis and
Research, 1993).

   1991 Directory, which lists enrollment and service area for each of the 567 HMOs in the

   mainland U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii as of December 31, 1990.

           In the Directory, enrollment is defined as all individuals who have been enrolled in
                                                                                                            the
  HMO as subscribers or as eligible dependents of subscribers and for whom the HMO has

  accepted the responsibility for the provision of basic health services. HMOs were asked to

  include enrollment by individuals and through
                                                         employer groups, Medicare, Medicaid, and the
  Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Any enrollment in Preferred Provider

  Organizations is excluded (GHAA, 1991). All but one of the HMOs in the directory indicated

  their enrollment. In the one missing case, data from the 1992 Directory was used. In all,

 there were about 36.4 million HMO enrollees in 1990.

         For each HMO, the Directo,y also lists a service area. Most HMOs (459 of 567)

 indicated the counties that they served.5 However, the remaining 108 HMOs (19 percent),

 representing 20 percent of nationwide HMO enrollment, did not provide a clear definition of

 their market area in terms of counties. For these HMOs, the market area was determined by

 one of three methods. First, some ambiguous service area definitions did provide sufficient

 information to construct the service area in terms of counties. For example, an HMO that

indicated serving 'ten counties in metro Chicago" would have been assigned the ten counties

that make up the Chicago Consolidated MSA (CMSA).




   4The directory covers 569 HMOs, which includes 2 HMOs in Guam.

     51n one case, 3 liMOs operating in separate states but from the same headquarters indicated separate
enrollment figures for each HMO but only one comprehensive market area. In this case, the market area
list was separated and the operations in each state were treated independently.

                                                     S
           However, most of the ambiguous area definitions required further follow-up. In these

  cases, the next method used was consultation of the 1992 or 1993 Directories. Over time, the

  service area definitions included have become more precise. Many HMOs for whom the

  service area definition was ambiguous in 1991 provided specific county information tbr the

  more recent years. Where available, this information was used, with preference given to the

  1992 rather than the 1993 Directory.

          Since service areas change over time, use of the more recent information could distort

  the market areas. However, this is unlikely to cause significant bias in the estimates since, in

 most cases, there is considerable agreement between the definitions provided for different

 years. For example, in the 1991 directory, some HMOs indicated serving an area consisting

 of some number of counties in a state (e.g. '11 counties in southeastern Indiana. ) In

 subsequent directories, most of these HMOs indicated their service area in a list of counties of

 approximately the right length.6 Other HMOs indicated only city names in the 1991 directory,

 but provided a list of counties encompassing the same cities in a later directory.7

         After applying the first two methods, all but five of the 108 original ambiguous cases

 had been resolved. The remaining five HMOs were telephoned and a list of counties obtained.




    6There was, of course, some variation. For example, an HMO that indicated serving "54 counties" in
1991 listed only 48 counties in subsequent directories. An HMO that indicated "31 counties" in 1991
listed 33 later. Since it is unclear whether the earlier or later definition is more accurate, the precise
definitions available in the later directories were used.

   71n the few cases where there was clear disagreement between the areas indicated in the 1991 National
Directory and the county list provided in later directories, the county list was altered to conform to the
1991 information.

                                                     6
   2.2. Distributing enrollment over service areas

          The next step was to allocate each county in the service area of an HMO a portion of

  the I-IMO enrollment that, in the case of the basic estimates, varies with the population of the

  county and, in the case of later estimates, incorporates the distance
                                                                          of the county from the
  HMO headquarters.



  2.2.1. MethsjA

         Estimates that depend only on county population (method A) were Constructed first.

 For each HMO, method A gives to each county in the service area a number of enrollees

 proportional to that county's share of the total population in the service area. Specifically,

 consider HMO i, which has E1 enrollees and serves N1 counties. For each countyj in the

 service area, method A assigns enrollment,
                                              a, according to


                       a11   = (1'E Pk)EI

 where P is the population in countyj. Once the enrollment of each HMO has been distributed

among the counties in its service area, the total enrollment for
                                                                   each county, A, is computed as

                             4, E a.1 .                                                       (2)


Using the set of county enrollment estimates,
                                                A, market share estimates S are computed by
taring the proportion of the population enrolled in HMOs:    S = A,/P.      The set of enrollment
and market share estimates based on method A will be referred to as Series A.



                                                7
 2.2.2. Methods B and C

        While series A is probably a good first estimate of market share, it may be possible to

 improve the estimates by incorporating more information. One useful addition may be

 distance from HMO headquarters. If HMO enrollment is concentrated near the headquarters

or if HMOs are likely to locate their headquarters in areas where their enrollment is

concentrated, allocating more enrollment to counties closer to the headquarters will yield a

better estimate.

        Methods B and C use this strategy, apportioning enrollment using weights that are the

product of a distance component and the county share of the service area population.

Specifically the weight for countyj in the service area of HMO i, w, is defined by:


                            =
                       w1             Pt),

where d is the distance component of the weight.

       The distance components vary with distance from the HMO headquarters. They are

obtained from a function that declines linearly from 1 to 0.5 as distance from headquarters

increases from 0 up to a set limit, 1, and then becomes flat at 0.5 for all distances higher than

1. Thus, d, is computed as:

                   d,, =max((21âÃ´)/21,Q.5)                                                   (4)




                                                8
   where 8 is the distance from the centroid of county j to the centroid of the county
                                                                                               containing
   the headquarters of HMO i, calculated using the distance formu1a. Use of this function is

   admittedly ad hoc. It was chosen after experimenting with several
                                                                              different specificatjo
   including non-linear functions and cut-off levels other than 0.5, and observing that use of other

  plausible functional forms made little difference in the outcomes.

          Methods B and C both use distance
                                                   components based on equation (4), but differ in the
  limit 1. The limit for method B is
                                         approximately 100 miles9--that is, method B distance

  components decrease from 1 to 0.5 as distance goes from 0 to 100 miles from the headquarters

  and are 0.5 for all counties more than 100 miles from
                                                               the headquarters. The limit for method
 C is about 50 miles. Thus, method C concentrates enrollment near the HMO headquarters to
                                                                                                            a
 greater degree than method B.

         After scaling the weights so that they sum to one for each HMO, enrollment estimates

 for each county in the service area of each HMO, b1 and c,,,, were
                                                                            computed by multiplying
 the appropriate weight by the total enrollment in the HMO, E1. County level enrollment

 estimates, B and C, as well as market share estimates S' and S, are computed as described




    Latitude and longitude population centroids for each county in the U.S. was obtained from the 1990
census county-level summary files.

    9For convenience, distances are discussed in miles. The calculations, however, are done in degrees of
latitude and longitude. For conversion, it is useful to assume that 1 degree is approximately equal to 50
mile, although conversion cannot be done exactly since longitude measurements are complicated by the
curvature of the earth. The further north a measurement is made, the fewer miles are associated with a
degree of longitude. The distortion introduced between the southern and northern U.S. is not large
enough to introduce significant bias into the estimates. Alaska is not a problem since it is treated as a
single unit and since there were no HMOs there in 1990.

                                                    9
 above for method A. The set of enrollment and market share estimates obtained from methods

 B and C will be referred to as series B and series C.

         Series B market share estimates are presented graphically in Figure 1. As expected,

 areas with the strongest concentrations of HMOs include: San Francisco, California; Portland,

 Oregon; Denver and Colorado Springs, Colorado; Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota;

 Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Rochester, New York. Other areas where HMOs have large

 market shares include: Los Angeles, California; Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona; Albuquerque,

 New Mexico; and Boston, Massachusetts. There are large areas in the midwest and south that

had very little HMO activity.

        Series B and C are highly similar to series A, although there is some evidence that the

later methods consolidated enrollees into metropolitan areas in which many HMOs are

headquartered. Table 1 presents the correlations between the series A, B, and C estimates of

enrollment (top panel) and market share (bottom panel). The series exhibit a high degree of

internal consistency. For the enrollment estimates, in every case the correlation coefficients

are above 0.99. For market shares, the results of the different methods are also highly

correlated, with coefficients of about 0.98 and higher.



2.3. Validity of the new estimates

       Since the county service areas on which the series are based are quite accurate, it is

likely that the series themselvesare also quite accurate. Indeed, the nationwide pattern seen

in Figure 1 is consistent with the expected patterns of HMO activity. However, it is also

likely that some errors are present in the estimates. In particular, it is possible that too many

                                                I0
   enrollees were allocated to counties adjacent to
                                                      metropolitan areas. Since many HMOs tend to
  serve metropolitan populations, counties which are partly metropolitan may be included in the

  service area of an HMO but may not, in actuality, be fully served. Since the apportjomnent

  algorithms use the entire population of the
                                                county when distributing enrollees, such counties
  may receive excess enrollees. For example, in Colorado, Teller and Crowley counties have

  the highest estimated HMO market shares in the state. These counties are adjacent to, but not

  included in, the Colorado Springs and Pueblo MSAs.

         Since there have been no previous studies of county-level patterns in HMO enrollment,

 it is difficult to find existing data with which to validate the new measures. One exercise is

 possible at the MSA level. The GHAA has constructed estimates of enrollment and market

 share at the MSA level for the 27 largest MSAs in 1989 and the 54 largest MSAs in 1991 (see

 Palsbo, 1990; and Bergsten and Palsbo, 1993, respectively). Since my estimates are for 1990,

 it may be helpful to compare the two sets of GHAA estimates to MSA estimates constructed

 by aggregating my data.'Â°

        Results of this exercise are presented in Table 2. The top panel shows mean

enrollments and market shares. The two columns present means for the 27 MSAs and 54

MSAs for which the GHAA produced 1989 and 1991
                                               estimates, respectively. My enrollment
estimates are higher than the 1989 GHAA enrollment estimates and lower than the 1991



     Â°Using my data, I constructed enrollments and market shares for MSAs that matched those used by
the GHAA as closely as possible. However, MSAs in New England are not always defined by counties.
To construct estimates for these MSAs, I attempted to group counties to match the exact definitions.
However, the geographic areas covered by the standard New England MSAS and my New England MSAs
are not exactly the same. All estimates presented were reestimated without the New England MSAs and
no significant differences were found.

                                                 11
  enrollment estimates, which is to be expected since HMO enrollment was growing over this

  time period. For 1991 the difference in mean market share is consistent with the difference in

 mean enrollments. Curiously, in the 1989 samples the mean market shares obtained from my

 data are lower than the mean GHAA market share. This may be due to differences in the

 population estimates used. The population estimates used in my calculations are from the 1990

 Census, while the GHAA used 1989 population estimates based on projections from the 1980

 Census and Current Population Surveys.

         The bottom panel of Table 2 shows the correlation between the GHAA estimates for

 1989 (column 1) and 1991 (column 2) and the series A, B, and C enrollment and market share

 estimates. The enrollment estimates are very highly correlated--the correlation coefficients are

 above 0.99 in every case. The market share estimates are also highly correlated, with

coefficients of about 0.97 for the 1989 sample and 0.94 for the 1991 sample."



3. Theory of HMOs and FFS physician fees

        Before proceeding to an empirical examination of HMO market share and physician

fees, this section considers theoretical frameworks within which physician prices may be

examined. The question under consideration is the effect that the entry of HMOs into a

marke, or their expansion within a market where they already exist, will haveon the fees

charged by FFS physicians.



    "In addition, I computed correlation coefficients weighting by the total population of the MSA. In all
cases, these coefficients were higher than those reported in Table 2. The correlation for the enrollment
estimates based on series B was 0.995 for the 1989 sample and 0.997 for the 1991 sample. For market
share estimates based on series B, the coefficients were 0.978 for 1989 and 0.967 for 1991.

                                                     12
          The entry or expansion of HMOs in a market may be modelled in two ways. First,

 HMOs may be treated as new entrants into a market, bringing new physicians and resources

 into a market. Alternatively, they may be viewed as reorganizing existing physicians and

 resources already in place within the market. The implications of HMO entry under the

 former view can be addressed in the context of existing theories of physicianpricing, which

 often examine the effect of the physician entry on prices. However, since the latter view may

 be more plausible for many health care markets, and since the existing models ofphysician

 pricing do not readily allow for heterogeneous consumers or products, I will also model

 physician prices using a spatial location model. Variation in the cost functions of providers

 will be incorporated into this model.

        The traditional models of physician pricing have, for the most part, been developed in

the context of the debate over supply-induced demand and are based on standard market

frameworks.'2 Perhaps the simplest case is that of a competitive market in which expansions

in the supply of health care, perhaps occasioned by the entrance of an HMO from outside the

market, will prompt prices to fall as the supply curve shifts out. However, if physicians have

at least some market power, monopolistic competition may be a preferable framework.'3 In

this case, the market demand is divided among the physicians in the market, but each


    2See, for example, Phelps (1992), chapter 7, or Feldstein (1988), chapter 9, for a more complete
discussion.

    '3The markets in which physicians operate may be viewed as falling on a continuum running between
competitive and monopolistic. Thus, the two models presented here may be viewed as opposite extremes.
One way to implement such a continuum is by incorporating patient search. If there is no patient search
then the model is monopolistic or monopolistically competitive. As more patients search, the model
approaches the competitive outcome. See, for example, Pauly and Satterthwaite (1981) or Schwartz and
Wilde (1982).

                                                    13
 physician still faces a downward sloping demand curve. If there are excess profits being

 earned in the market, then profitable entry by new providers is possible. The entrance of a

 new provider will reduce the demand available to each provider, shifting their demand curves

 in and causing prices to fall.

         The implications of these models are less clear if physicians can induce demand for

 their services.    If they are able, they may do so in response to changes in supply and demand

 conditions. This may upset the conclusions derived under the assumption that there is no

 demand inducement. For example, under the target income hypothesis'5 a supply increase that

 leaves physicians below their target level will be met with an induced outward shift in the

demand curve. This will, at least, result in a smaller reduction in prices than would have

occurred without demand inducement and, depending on how much demand physicians can

and wish to induce, could shift the demand curve far enough to causeprices to rise. '

        Although the models discussed above are useful for describing the effects of additional

physicians, they do not incorporate aspects of the marketplace that are important when

working with HMOs. Three things are particularly noteworthy. First, the standard models

often assume that both the consumers and the product are homogeneous.'1 However, it is

    '4Whether physicians are able and willing to induce demand for their services is thesubject of
considerable debate. See, for example, Reijthardt (1985) or Feldman and Sloan (1988) for discussions of
this issue. Cromwell and Mitchell (1986) and McCarthy (1985) are examples ofopposmg empirical
evidence.

     'The target income hypothesis posits that physiciansattempt to meet a target income. If their income
falls below the target level, they will undertake action, possibly including demand inducement, to bring
their income backup to the target. It was originally posited in Evans (1974); See Feldstein (1988) pages
189-192 for a nice review.

   '6For further discussion of the ambiguity surrounding price results whensupply induced demand is
possible, see Feldman and Sloan (1988).


                                                    14
  likely that HMOs and FFS physicians produce health care in somewhat different ways and that

  consumers vary in (heir preferences for medical care--some consumers may be more favorably

 disposed toward receiving care in a FFS setting than others. Second, the standard models

 assume that all providers face the same cost of providing health care services. However, if

 HMOs can provide health care services more cost-effectively than FFS physicians, as is often

 suggested, this assumption will not hold. Third, the standard models assume that entry takes

 place in the form of providers new to the market. However, much of the recent growth in

 HMOs has come from the formation of networks by providers already established within their

 markets. In other markets, existing HMOs are working to expand their operations by

 recruiting local physicians to join them or by purchasing their practices.

         Use of a simple linear spatial location model of the type originally introduced by

 Hotelling (1929) is one way to incorporate these aspects of the market. This model assumes

that the consumers of health care in a market are uniformly distributed on the unit interval.

The interval represents a continuum of styles of health care provision and the location of

consunlers on the interval reflects the degree to which they prefer FFS care, which will be

a,sumed to be at 0, or HMO care, assumed to be at l.' FFS providers and HMOs produce a




     'In some cases, models have been extended to allow for variation in quality among providers. See.
for example. Feldman and Sloan (1988).

   '8See TiroIc (1988), chapters 2 and 7. for a discussion of this model.

   The assumption tha FFS and UMO styles of care lie at the extremes of the interval simplifies the
model. It is possible to derive many of the results shown here under the more general assumption that
FFS and HMO care lie at arbitrary points within the interval.

                                                     15
single good, 'health care," but differ in the way in which they produce it. FFS physicians and

HMOs have constant marginal cost: c1 and          Ch,   respectively.

         The consumers have unit demands for health care--they either consume 0 or I unit.

They face costs of consumption that increase linearly with the distance from the type of health

care consumed; that is, a person lying at pointx, xâ¬[O,1], would face costs tr if FFS care is

consumed and r(1-x) if HMO care is consumed, where (>0.20 Consumers have reservation

price r, which is assumed to be sufficiently high that the entire market is covered.

        I examine this model in two stages. I begin with a market in which only FFS care is

available and consider the effects of making HMO care available, holding the marginal cost of

providing FFS care and HMO care equal. Next, I consider variation in marginal costs.

        Assume a single profit-maximizing FFS provider located at 0 on the continuum. This

provider will face a demand curve that depends on the FFS price, P1. Specifically, all

consumers on the interval [0,], will demand health care from the provider, where

                           i=(râP1)It.                                                                 (5)



The profit-maximizing price will be:


                          P1(112)(c+r)                                                                 (6)



where c is the marginal cost for the FFS provider, which is assumed for now to be equal to the

marginal cost for the HMO.



    Â°ln the standard version of this model, these costs are the transportation costs incurred by the consumers
in travel to and from the point of purchase.

                                                        16
         Now, if an 1-IMO enters the market, and locates at the other end of the continuum, it

 will compete for consumers with the FFS provider. Since both providers have the same

 marginal cost, it is easily shown (see Tirole, 1990, page 280) that the Nash equilibrium price

 charged by each will be equal and will be

 given by:


                                                                                           (7)


where   h denotes the price charged by the HMOs and the stars distinguish the prices charged
when both providers operate from the price charged when only FFS physicians operate.

Comparing equations (6) and (7) shows that the FFS price falls after HMO entry (P < Pf) if c

+ 2r < r. This is equivalent to the condition that the entire market is covered by the FFS

producer operating alone. That is, if HMOs and FFS providers compete for patients in the

market, the entry of HMOs will force FFS providers to lower their price.

        To extend this model, I now allow different marginal costs to face HMOs and FFS

providers. It can then be shown (see Appendix A) that the FFS and HMO prices, Pf and Ph,

aie given by:


                   Pf=t+(213)Cf+(113)Ch                                                   (8)




and


                                                                                          (9)




                                              17
Equations (8) and (9) yield two important results. First, reductions in the cost of providing

HMO care will reduce the FFS price. As the HMO cost falls, it becomes profitable for the

HMO to attract additional consumers away from the FFS provider, which increases the level

of competition. The second implication of equations (8) and (9) is that, if the HMO's

marginal cost is less than the FFS providers, the HMO price will be lower than the FFS price.

This is observed, to at least some extent, in the actual market.

       Taken as a whole, this model shows that entry by an HMO into a FFS dominated

market and a reduction in the cost of providing HMO care will result in a reduction in the FFS

price. In addition, the second stage considered alone has a useful interpretation. Consider a

model in which the definition of the continuum is broadened so that it represents, for example,

the progression from high-technology, non-primary-care intensive medicine to more

conservative, preventive-care-oriented medicine. Suppose that half of the producers in this

market operate at one end and half at the other end. In this context, the model suggests that if

the providers at one end band together to form an HMO, and in doing so are able to reduce

their marginal cost, they will force the physicians at the other end to reduce their prices. In

this way, the result that the FFS price falls when HMOs are created does not depend on the

assumption that new HMOs enter from outside the market.

       So far, this model has only dealt with the implications of HMO entry or formation.

However, it may also be possible to expand this model to include the effects of the expansion

of existing HMOs through non-price competition. One way in which this could be viewed is

as a shift in the distribution of consumers on the continuum. If HMOs are able to make



                                                18
 consumers more favorably disposed toward the type of care they offer, they will force further

 price reductions by the FFS providers who will have to compete ever harder for patients.

        The result that FFS prices will fall in response to the formation of HMOs becomes

 more complicated if FFS providers are able to induce demand. However, under some

circumstances this result will continue to hold. In particular, as long as consumers are able to

observe FFS and HMO prices and face relatively low costs of switching providers (so that

neither provider has strong market power over their consumers) providers will only be able to

raise prices at the expense of lost demand. Although they may be able to prescribe excess

services or otherwise induce demand, price changes will be difficult. However, if providers

do have market power over their consumers, then price increases may again become possible.

       This model is meant to be instructive rather than comprehensive and there are some

components of the health care system that are missing and should be noted. First, the

implications of health insurance are not considered. Not only may traditional indemnity

insurance distort the incentives facing patients, but the fact that HMOs offer a form of

insurance which is often more generous than traditional policies but imposes additional

constraints may also complicate analysis. Second, this model assumes that all patients have

t1 ability to choose between a FFS provider and an HMO. However, for employees this

choice is likely to be constrained by the health insurance options offered by their employers.

Thus, the incentives of employers as well as the premiums charged for insurance may be

important. Finally, this model assumes that providers produce only a single good. However,

taken as a whole, physicians provide thousands of goods and each may be independently

priced. It is quite possible that some fees would respond differently to competition than

                                              19
others. For example, if some fees are focal for consumers when selecting a provider,

physicians may reduce these fees but raise others in response to competition.



4. An Empirical Examination of HMOs and Physician Fees

4.1. 1a1a
        To empirically examine the relationship between HMOs and FFS physician prices, I

combined the county level estimates of HMO market share described in section 2 with data on

the fees and other characteristics of young physicians obtained from the 1991 Survey of Young

Physicians. This survey was designed to represent all allopathic physicians (and osteopathic

physicians completing allopathic residencies) who were under age 45 and had between 2 and

10 years of practice experience in 1991 ;21 it contains data for 6,053 physicians and had a

response rate of 70 percent. Since the survey was based on a complex sampling design,

weights are used to adjust for the sampling strategies used and correct estimates to reflect the

AMA Physician Masterfile distribution of young physicians by sex, age, country of medical

education (U.S. or other), and AMA membership.22

        Additional characteristics of the county in which each physician reported having his or

her main practice23 was obtained from two other sources and added to the file. Data on the



   See Cantor et a!., 1993 for further information on this survey.

   2A11 results presented were also estimated without the weights. In no case did this qua!itatively
change any of the findings.

   Physician could list multiple practices on the survey. The analysis presented here focuses on the
practice designated by the physician as the main practice. In this sample, 419 (14.7 percent) of the
physicians reported having more than one practice.

                                                    20
 number of physicians and hospital beds, county economic conditions, and demographic

 characteristics were obtained from the 1993 Area Resource File, which compiles data from a

 variety of sources including the American Medical Association, the American Hospital

Association, and the Bureau of the Census. The mean number of employees per firm was

obtained from the 1990 County Business Patterns file.

        To identify a base sample of FFS physicians for analysis, I initially selected the 3,928

physicians who answered 'yes" when asked "In [your main] practice do you provide at least

some medical care for which patients pay on a fee-for-service basis" and who indicated

elsewhere that they were not employed by an HMO in their main practice. Physicians

practicing FFS medicine who also have contracts with Independent Practice Association (IPA)

type HMOs were included in the sample.

        From this group, radiologists, anesthesiologists, and pathologists were excluded since

physicians in these specialties were not asked to report their fees on the survey. Psychiatrists

were also excluded, as were physicians for whom fees or other necessary information was

unavailable. This left a sample of 2,845 physicians (47 percent of the original 6,053) for

analysis. Physicians in the sample represent all 50 states and Washington DC, and 821

counties.



4.2. Results

       Characteristics of the sample are described in Table 3. The top portion of the table

shows mean fees and hourly incomes. The survey asked physicians "In [your maini practice,

what is your current usual fee for an office visit with an established patient including an

                                               21
examination and/or treatment for the same or new illness?" This is a standard question,

identical to the question asked yearly by the AMA on the annual Socioeconomic Monitoring

System surveys, which most physicians should understand and be able to answer. In my

sample, the mean fee was $46.25. It is important to note that this fee pertains to only one of

the many services that physicians provide. As discussed below, fees for different procedures

may vary in different ways. Unfortunately, data that would allow me to examine this issue

directly are not available.

        Contrary to expectation, an initial examination suggests that physician fees are

positively correlated with market share. The mean fee for physicians in counties without

HMOs is $35.34, while the mean fee for physicians in counties in which HMO market share is

25 percent or more was $53.09. A simple regression of the log of physician fees on HMO

market share and a constant confirms this finding. The estimated equation is:


                                           logf= 3.563 + 0.097 S                         R2=0.05 (10)
                                                  (0.015)     (0.008)

where logf denotes the natural logarithm of physician fees24 and S denotes HMO market share

(divided by 10). Standard errors of the coefficients are in parenthesis.

        The bivariate analysis presented above suffers from at least two important difficulties.

First, there are many omitted variables that may be correlated with both physician fees and

HMO market share. For example, urban areas are more likely to have HMOs and may also

have higher costs of living, which may prompt higher fees. A number of other factors


   24The logarithm of fees is used based on visual inspection and Box-Cox analysis. See the discussion of
equation (12).

                                                   22
including the preferences of physicians, patients, and insurers as well as the health status of

the population could also play a role.

         A second difficulty is the fact that HMO market share and fees are likely to be

simultaneously determined. Forward-looking HMOs may consider current and expected future

expenditures when deciding whether to enter or expand operations in a market. HMOs that

can provide highly cost-effective care will achieve better outcomes in markets where FFS

physician services are overpriced and may thus be more likely to enter or expand in these

markets. Alternatively, demand for HMOs by purchasers of health coverage may be higher in

areas with high expenditures since use of HMOs may be viewed as an effective cost

containment measure. These hypotheses are supported by studies which report that managed

care market share is positively related to overall health care costs and utilization.25

         To incorporate additional independent variables into the analysis and attempt account

for these difficulties, I adopt a two-stage least squares (2SLS) approach in which equations of

the following form are estimated:

includes a set of 50 state dummies. N denotes the excluded instruments. e and are assumed

to be well-behaved error terms.

        A number of independent variables are used (see Table 3). In addition to HMO market

share, several variables controlling for the characteristics of each physician and the area in

which he or she practices are included. Included physician characteristics include specialty,

practice setting, sex, board certification, location of medical school (U.S. or foreign), and age.

A dummy variable indicating whether a physician has a contract with an IPA is also included.

This variable is intended to capture the effects of the IPA on the remainder of the physicians

practice.27 Finally, the number of patients seen per hour is also included as a measure of

quality and patient satisfaction. Since, as discussed below, patients per hour may be related to

HMO market share, models were reestimated without this variable and the results did not

differ significantly from those reported.




   The Box-Cox transform of y, (yA - 1)I A, indicates a log specification as A goes to 0 and a linear
specification as A goes to I. Maximum likelihood estimates of x are 0.151 without state dummies included
and 0.152 with them.

    27This effect could go either way. On the one hand, FFS physicians with IPA contracts might carry
over pricing practices from the IPA portion of their practice to the FFS portion to facilitate uniform office
practices. On the other hand, if the IPA can obtain price concessions from physicians, they may price
discriminate against their FFS patients to make up the lost revenue.

                                                      24
         Economic, demographic, and health system variables describe the area in which each

physician practices. A dummy indicating whether the county is in an MSA is also used.

Included economic characteristics are the unemployment rate and per capita income.

Demographic characteristics include two variables indicating the percent of the population that

has completed high school and college, and three variables indicating the percent of the

population that is female, non-white, and over age 65. Hospital capacity is included in the

equations using the number of hospital beds per 1000 population.

         Since other physicians are likely to provide an important source of competition, I

include the number of generalists and specialists per 1000 popu1ation. Since generalist

physicians may be substitutes for other generalist physicians while specialists may be

complements, and vice versa, the number of generalists and specialists per 1000 population is

interacted with dummy variables indicating whether the physician is a generalist or a

specialist.

        In equation (11), the average number of employees per firm and the percent of the

work force that is white collar are the excluded instruments for HMO market share, S. These

are appropriate instruments if they are correlated with S and uncorrelated with e. Since I

expect that larger firms and white collar finns are more likely to offer their employees a

variety of health insurance options, which may include HMOs, areas with more of these types

of firms will provide a better environment for HMOs.




    2Generalists physicians are those in general/family practice, general internal medicine, and pediatrics.
All other physicians are considered specialists.

                                                     25
        Results from estimation of the first stage (equation 11) are presented in Table 4. The

regression presented in the first colunm does not include the state dummies; the regression

presented in the second column does. In both cases, the excluded instruments (employees per

firm and percent of workers white collar) have the expected sign and are highly statistically

significant. Following the suggestion of Bound, Jaeger, and Baker (1993), I performed an F

test for the hypothesis that the coefficients on the instruments are jointly 0. The hypothesis

was rejected in both specifications (F[2,2808] =123.02 in column 1 and F[2,2758] =78.94 in

column 2).

        Results from estimation of the second stage are presented in Table 5â¢29 Columns 1 and

2 contain OLS and 2SLS results from a specification that omits the state dummy variables,

respectively. In the OLS model, the coefficient on HMO market share is positive, although

not significantly different from zero. This represents a significant decline from the bivariate

results reported earlier in equation (10). Closer examination of the independent variables

indicates that those responsible for the majority of the decline are the health system variables

(generalists and specialists per capita, hospital beds per capita), economic characteristics

(unemployment rate and per capita income) and the MSA dummy. Use of only these

independent variables reduces the coefficient on market share from 0.097 to 0.031.

        In the 2SLS results (column 2), the coefficient on market share is -0.108 and

significant (t=3,471). This suggests that the bias induced by the simultaneous determination



   290LS standard errors are presented. However, to account for possible heteroskedasticity, I computed
both White (1980) standard errors and a set of standard errors based on a generalization of White's
method that allowed for intercorrelation between physicians in the same state. In neither case did this
cause a qualitative change in the results.

                                                   26
of HMO market share and FFS physician fees causes OLS results to understate the fee-

reducing effect of HMOs. This result indicates that increases of 10 percentage points in HMO

market share are associated with decreases of 10.8 percent in FFS physician fees.

       The coefficients measuring the effect of the number of physicians are not significantly

different from zero. Although some studies (e.g. Cromwell and Mitchell, 1986) have found

that fees increase with the number of physicians, and the OLS results indicate that fees are

positively associated with the number of specialists per capita, the 2SLS results provide no

evidence of a relationship between the number of physicians and fees. This result, which is

consistent with the results of other studies that use physician level data (e.g. Rossiter and

Wilensky, 1983), may indicate that physicians are not able to raise their fees in response to the

entry of other physicians. Although it does not deal with the ability of physicians to induce

their patients to use more services, this finding contradicts a portion of the supply-induced

demand hypothesis.

       The use of both the mean number of employees per firm and the percent of workers

who are white collar as instruments for market share provides an overidentifying restriction

that can be tested. The test used here examines the hypothesis that both instruments used

independently would produce the same estimate of the effect of managed care and is

constructed by multiplying the sample size by the R2 from a regression of the 2SLS errors on

the exogenous variables and excluded instruments (see Newey, 1985). The x2[l] test statistics




                                                27
are presented at the bottom of Table 5. The overidentifying restrictions are not rejected at the

0.01 level.30

       The difference between the OLS and 2SLS results suggests that endogeneity bias is

present in the OLS estimates. More formally, a Hausman (1978) test, formulated by

estimating equation (7) with both the predicted values of market share from the first stage and

the actual values, rejects the hypothesis that the difference in market share is uncorrelated with

the error term (t=4.204).

       It is not clear that state dummies should be included in the equations. For example, if

HMO market shares are high in all of the counties of a state, the dummy for that state will

absorb any effect of HMO market share on fees. However, since there is also the possibility

that the specifications presented in columns 1 and 2 of Table 5 omit important effects that

might be picked up by state dummies, they are included in the specifications presented in

columns 3 and 4. Column 3 presents OLS results and column 4 presents 2SLS results. With

the additional variables, the OLS estimate falls slightly and remains insignificant. The 2SLS

estimate falls somewhat ( =-0.077), but the standard error almost doubles and the t-statistic

falls to 1.361.

        Because HMOs employ mostly generalist physicians and tend to provide a large amount

of primary care, they may affect the fees of generalists and specialists differently. Changes in

both demand for health care and supply of physician services may play a role. On the demand



    30Analysis using the instruments separately indicates the average number of employees per firm does
most of the work. The estimate of the effect of HMO market share obtained using just this instrument is
similar to that reported while the estimate obtained using only the percent of workers who are white collar
is much smaller and statistically insignificant.

                                                     28
side, if HMOs attract those patients who are most interested in obtaining regular primary

care,3' generalist physicians who would have provided this care may feel pressure. Specialists,

on the other hand, might not be pressured since HMOs are not as likely to attract patients

seeking specialty care. The supply relationship may work in the opposite direction. Since

HMOs tend to hire more generalists than specialists, and often hire them out of the FFS

sector, markets with many HMOs may have fewer FFS generalists practicing in them than

specialists. This may allow FFS generalists to charge higher fees.

        To examine this question more closely, I estimated equations (11) and (12) using 2SLS

separately for generalists and specialists.32 The coefficients obtained for HMO market share

and the number of generalists and specialists per capita are presented in Table 6. Coefficients

obtained on other variables were similar to those reported in Table 5. The first column

excludes the state dummies and the second column includes them. For both generalists and

specialists, the effect of HMO market share is negative and significant when the state dummies

are excluded (13=-O.108, t=2.775 for generalists, 13=-O.083 t=l.779 for specialists). As in

Table 5, however, once the state dummies are added the coefficient is no longer statistically

significant. In addition, as in Table 5, the coefficients for the number of generalists and

specialists per capita provide no evidence that fees are related to the number of physicians in

the market.




   31There is evidence that HMOs attract a patient mix that is healthy relative to the overall population.
See e.g. Luft and Miller (1988) or Wilensky and Rossiter (1986).

   32As before, generalist physicians are those in general/family practice, general internal medicine, and
pediatrics. All others are specialists.

                                                      29
        One interpretation of the fact that the coefficient on market share in the equation for

generalists is somewhat larger than the coefficient in the equation for specialists is that the

effects of HMOs on demand are felt more by generalists than specialists, and that the influence

of demand factors over physician prices is stronger than the effects of HMOs on the relative

supply of generalist and specialist physicians. However, the fact the difference between the

coefficients is not large33 suggests that interpretations should be made with caution.



4.3. Physician Incomes

        Although one might expect that physician incomes should fall if the fee for a standard

office visit falls, this need not happen if physicians are able to do one or more of the following

things. First, physicians may be able to respond to a reduction in the fee for a standard office

visit by increasing the quantity of services provided. This is the standard contention of the

supply-induced demand hypothesis. A related possibility is that physicians can alter their case-

mix, perhaps through demand inducement, toward services with larger markups. Finally, it

may be possible to raise the fees for other services enough to compensate for the reduction in

the office visit fee.

        To examine these questions empirically, I estimated models identical to those used

above (equations 11 and 12) using the log of physicians hourly incomes as the dependent

variable.M Hourly income estimates were derived from data on yearly income, weeks of



   33The difference is statistically significant. An F test for the equality of the two coefficients rejects the
hypothesis (F[ 1.2788] =7.609).

   34Models using weekly and yearly income yielded highly similar results.

                                                       30
work, and number of hours worked per week for each physician. On the survey, most

physicians reported their 1990 yearly income after expenses but before taxes.35 To compute

hourly income, yearly income was divided by the product of the number of weeks worked in

1990 and the number of hours worked per week. The number of weeks worked during 1990

was reported by each physician. The number of hours worked per week is proxied by the

number of hours worked in the last complete week of practice prior to the survey. In my

sample, mean hourly earnings are $54.35.

        Selected coefficients from 2SLS estimation of the models are presented in Table 7. As

above, the model presented in the first column excludes the state dummies and the model in

the second column includes them. In neither case is the coefficient on HMO market share

significantly different from zero--changes in HMO market share are not associated with

changes in physician incomes.



4.4 Quantity of Services Provided

        Perhaps physicians are working more in response to the reduction in fees. To see

whether this is the case, I looked at the number of patients each physician reported seeing in

the most recent full week of practice and the number of hours worked in the previous year.

Regression results are presented in Table 8. There is no evidence that physicians increase the

number of patients they see in response to competition from HMOs (columns 1 and 2). If


    35Specifically, the survey asked for 'all income from fees, salaries, retainers, bonuses, and other forms
of compensation' after expenses but before taxes. Contributions to pension, profit-sharing, or other
deferred compensation plans are excluded. For 99 of the physicians yearly income had to be imputed
from two other questions, one asking what each physician thought an appropriate income for someone like
himself or herself might be and a second asking the relationship between the actual and appropriate figure.

                                                      31
anything, the estimates indicate that they see fewer patients. Results from regressions where

annuai hours worked is the dependent variable (columns 3 and 4) also failed to show a

significant relationship, although the estimated coefficients were positive. The final two

columns of Table 8 examine the number of patients seen per hour. A log specification is used

since the distribution of the number of patients per hour is highly skewed. The estimated

coefficients are negative but not significantly different from zero.

       As an additional test, I examined the number of surgeries that general and family

practitioners, general internists, surgeons, obstetricians, and gynecologists, performed or

assisted with in the previous week of practice.36 The results are presented in Table 9.

Although the coefficients on HMO market share are positive, they are insignificant and

provide little evidence of a quantity response.

       Taken together, these estimates provide no evidence that physicians take on more

patients, work more hours or see more patients per hour in response to competition from

HMOs. The findings for the number of surgeries performed provides limited evidence that

they do not perform extra services. A common response of health economists to the

phenomena of falling fees and stable incomes would have been to suggest inducement of

demand by physicians. However, these findings imply that the maintenance of physician

incomes in the face of a decline in the basic office visit fee has not occurred because

physicians have suggested extra office visits to patients or performed extra procedures for

them in the office (to the extent that this would have increased their hours of work). It is




   Only physicians in these specialties were asked to report the number of surgeries on the survey.

                                                   32
possible that physicians have altered the service mix they provide to patients toward services

with higher mark-ups. However, the extent to which this is possible without changing hours

worked is probably limited.

       Another explanation is that physicians are able to adjust prices for different services in

different ways--engaging in two-part (or multi-part) pricing. For example, they may raise the

margin on X-rays while lowering office visit fees. This may be an effective response to

competition if those selecting physicians are able to look at fees for only a few of the many

services that physicians provide. Alternatively, physicians may adjust fees to target patients

for whom they are competing with HMOs. If these patients are more interested in office visits

than other services then this strategy may be optimal. Since some literature has shown that

HMOs attract relatively healthy patients, an optimal response to competition may be to reduce

the prices for services of interest to these patients--office visits, common procedures, and

preventive care--while raising the prices of interest to other patients who, because they are not

tempted to join HMOs, have less elastic demand.37



4.5 Physician Density and Ouantity of Services

       Tables 7, 8, and 9 also present coefficients for the number of physicians per capita.

Overall, they do not indicate that the number of physicians per capita affects physician

incomes or the quantity of services provided. This contrasts with earlier supply-induced




    37See Hoerger (1989) for an example of a model of two-part pricing examining the prices for new and
established patient office visits.

                                                   33
demand literature that suggests that physicians would increase quantity in response to an

increase in the number of physicians in their market.



5. Conclusion

       Examination of the relationship between HMO market share and physician incomes

shows that increases in market share are associated with decreases in fees. Although simple

OLS estimates of the effect of HMO market share were positive--increases in market share are

associated with increases in fees--2SLS estimates indicate that increases in HMO market share

o1 ten percentage points are associated with decreases of 10.8 percent in FFS physician fees.

The explanation for the disparity between the OLS and 2SLS results may be the presence of

simultaneity bias. If HMOs are more likely to locate in areas where fees are higher, then the

positive association observed in the OLS regressions may be the result of this bias.

       However, examination of the relationship between HMO market share and physician

incomes did not reveal a significant association. Furthermore, the number of patients seen, the

number of hours worked, and the number of surgeries performed were not significantly related

to HMO market share. There are at least two explanations for the ability of physicians to

maintain their incomes while at least one fee is falling. First, they may be adjusting different

fees in different ways. If the fee for an office visit falls, but fees for other services can be

increased to make up for the change, incomes may not fall. Second, physicians may be able to

alter the mix of services provided to patients toward services with higher margins and, thus

maintain incomes. The fact that data necessary for a direct exploration of these hypotheses are

unavailable provides a useful direction for future efforts.


                                                 34
       Overall, while the findings from the fee analysis suggest that competition from HMOs

is able to affect the fee for at least one service, the rest of the findings suggest that physicians

retain a non-negligible amount of market power. Further evidence of this comes from the

failure to find a significant relationship between physician density and fees, incomes, or

quantity of services provided. If there were a significant degree of competition in health care

markets, one would expect variation in the number of competitors to prompt changes in at

least some of these variables.

                      Appendix A: Derivation of Equations (8) and (9)

       This derivation follows that shown in Tirole 1990, page 279-280, and differs in the use

of linear transportation costs and the assumption of separate marginal cost functions.

       The unit interval, with FFS and HMO providers at opposite ends, will be split between

FFS providers and HMOs at point x, given by the solution to:

                     P1+txP,+t(l âx)                                                     (Al)



Thus demand curves as a function of the two prices are given by

                                                                                         (A2)
                      Df=(PhâPf+t)I2t


and


                     D=(PfâPh+t)I2t.                                                     (A3)




Each maximizes profits, given by:

                                                                                         (A4)
                        ll1(P1âc1)D1


and

                                                                                         (AS)




The two first order conditions imply that:

                                                                                         (A6)
                     P,.=(1/2)(P+t+c1)


and
                    P=(lI2)(Pf+t+ch).                               (A7)




These may be solved jointly to yield the Nash equilibrium prices:


                                                                    (A8)
                   pf=t+(213)cf+(lI3)c

                  ph=tÃ·(213)ch    Ã·(1/3)c1.
