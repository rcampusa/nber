         A Structural Equation Model   for Tax Compliance   and Auditing




                                  ABSTRACT




          In this paper, we estieate a three equation sodel for taxpayers'
reported incoce and tax liability and for the probability of an audit. Our
work differs froe previous studies in that our dependent variables in the
coepliance equations are taxpayer reports rather than a variable related to
auditor estisates of noncoepliance and in that we esticate a structural
equation for audits.

         We find that audits stimulate coepliance although the effect Is not
large and is not statistically significant for all groups.   Audits are sore
effective at inducing accurate reporting of subtractions fro. incose than of
incose. Reduced—fore results suggest that IRS activities other than audits
have significant cospliance effects.

        Results for the sociodecographic variables are Interesting and help to
explain sose seesingly incongruous findings in the literature.  We find
cospliance to be higher, if anything, in areas with less educated and older
taxpayers, a large proportion of households headed by fesales. and a costly
native born population.

 1.   Introduction




            The study of tax compliance promises important scientific and policy

 insights.    Form a scientific point of view, the reporting of tax   liabilities
provides an arena in which we can observe the compliance behavior of most of

the adult population..Thls contrasts markedly with economists' study of most

criminal behavior (e.g.. murder, property offenses) where a small, and possible

aberrant, portion of the population is at risk.     At this time of large    budget
deficits, understanding    compliance behavior also offers the possibility of

'painlessly reducing the deficit.

         The potential richness of the tax arena has not escaped the research

community and studies of tax compliance behavior have burgeoned during the

1980s.   However, progress to date has been somewhat disappointing.     Researchers

report seemingly contradictory results and research on tax compliance has not

advanced beyond research on the deterrence of general criminal offenses.       We
believe that it is time to step back, assess current research findings, and try

other approaches.     A critical approach to tax compliance research seems

particularly valuable at this time because of the extensive research that is

underway on this topic.

         in this paper, we provide an analysis of a 1969 data set that combines

Information from the IRS's Statistics of Income (SOl) program, the Census.

internal IRS documents and a special data set compiled by the IRS In the mid

1970s.   This last data set has been used by a number of researchers in recent

empirical    studies of tax compliance.

         in carrying out the analysis, it Is important to take into account a

number of Issues that are central to compliance research.    First, consider the

dependent    variable used in previous empirical studies, namely an estimate of
                                                                                        2

the audit process.

         Tosummarize our results briefly, we find that taxpayers significantly

         The results that audits affect compliance are rather comforting and

support other findings.      However, both our results and the results of previous

studies vary considerably across taxpayer groups and are not always

significant.     Previous studies using different models all report that, in

general, audits deter tax noncompliance     but rind significant deterrent   effects

of audits for different taxpayer groups. To us this is disturbing and suggests

that economists understanding      of the effects of audits on compliance is not

very firm.     In the conclusions we suggest reasons why this might be the case.

      Comparison of our structural and reduced form results suggests that IRS

enforcement actions other than audits have significant effects on compliance.

To date research, including our own, has focused on the effect of audits and

largely ignored other IRS actions.      It appears that enhancing our understanding

of the effect of tax administration on compliance will require economists to

broaden their perspectives.

        The results for sociodemographic variables are also of interest in that

they help to explain seemingly incongruous results in the literature and to

provide important guidance for future research.      We find in general that

compliance is higher in areas with less educated and older populations and in

which a large percent of the population is native born or in female—headed

households.     The estimated coefficients on these variables in ours and others'

work depend critically though on the dependent variable used and the vector of

explanatory variables included in the model.      Consistent implications emerge.

however, when the coefficients on these variables are interpreted carefully on

the basis of the model specified.

        The paper is organized as follows.      In the next section. we present our

conceptual    framework.   The two sections that follow describe the data and our

2.   Conceptual    Framework

         Our model of tax compliance and enforcement is a simultaneous equation

model with equations for taxpayers'      reports and for the probability of an

audit.   Specifically,    to reflect the reporting behavior of taxpayers we include
                                                                       total tax
equations    for reported adjusted gross income (AGI) and the reported

liability.     We use separate equations for reported AGI and tax liability rather

than a single reporting equation because of the differences in the magnitude

and possible causes of income underreporting and the overstatement of
                                                                             The
subtractions      (i.e. ,adjustments, exemptions, deductions and credits).

                                                                factors
results for the reported AGI equation allow us to determine the

                                                           for the reported AIM
affecting income reporting while comparison of the results

and tax liability equations allows us to infer the factors associated with the

overstatement     of subtractions.2

         To specify the equations for reported AGI and total tax liability, we

                                                                    on the

theoretical models of tax compliance also imply that taxpayers'       reports of

         We chose audits as the measure of enforcement policy since this is the

 enforcement action that has been of most interest in the literature on tax

 compliance and since the IRS believes that audits are its most effective

 Instrument for stimulating accurate taxpayer reports (Controller General of the

United States. 1976, p.1).    To specify the audit equation, we read the

available documents regarding the way in which the Internal Revenue Service

 (IRS) selects returns for audit4 and discussed   the selection process with IRS

personnel at the national and district level.           The IRS selects the

largest proportion of returns for audit using carefully developed computerized

formulas, known as 'èhe DIP formulas.    The parameters of the DIP formulas are

estimated using data from the IRS's Tax Compliance Measurement Program (TCMP).

Under this program, the IRS every three or four years selects
                                                              approximately

50.000 returns to be examined by its best auditors.     Taxpayers are asked to

substantiate every line item on their return, and auditors record both what the

taxpayer filed and what they believe to be the correct report.     These data are

used to estimate equations that relate the extent of underpayment to the

characteristics   of the filed return.   In subsequent years, the IRS uses the

parameters estimates   from these equations to score each return filed In regard

to its audit potential. The returns with the highest scores are targeted for

audit.   The actual number of returns audited through the DIP program depends on

the reporting behavior of taxpayers, the type and number of audit personnel

available, and the amount of audit resources    Involved In special audit

programs.5 To reflect this audit selection process, we model the probability

of an audit as determined by taxpayers     reports which are endogenous to the

model, by taxpayer oöaracteristlcs   that the IRS both observes and may legally

use for audit selection, and by the level of IRS resources.
3.   The Data

         We obtain our data on reported AG! and total tax liability and on the

number of returns filed from the Statistics of Income (SO!) files and our

information on audits from the IRS's ProJect 778 data base.       Our measures of

                                                                          and

aggregated   to the IRS District Office level since this is the administrative

The definitions    of the audit classes are given in Table 1.         There are no good

estimates of income for the two high income groups from the Census or other

sources.8     These high income returns account for less than one percent of the

returns filed in 1969.     Results for   a   specification   that omits the income

variable for these two audit classes are available on request.




4.   The Empirical Model

        Our model Is a three equation model for reported AGI (AGI"), reported

total tax liability    (7").   and the log odds of an audit    (A).   We discuss our

specification    for the two reporting equations first and then turn our attention

to the specification    of the audit equation.

        We see reported AGI and report total tax liability as determined by the

log odds of an audit (our measure of enforcement actions which is

endogenous),9   the degree to which noncompliance can be detected (D) in an audit

(our measure of the penalties), the level of income (I), a vector of variables

that reflect important aspects of the tax code regarding filing requirements.

income exclusions and subtractions from income (TC), and a vector of

sociodemographicvariables that control for differences in tastes and

preferences   (Sr).   Formally, our two equations for taxpayer reports are

                                                                                      8

where the e's are random error terms and the a's and b's are the paraeters to

be estimated.

            Our measure of the log odds of an audit is based on the audit coverage

in the geographical     area.    We do not measure penalties directly but rather seek

to measure them indirectly through our measures of detectability.        The vast

majority of audits result in some change, generally an increase, in tax

liability.1°      However, the taxpayer generally receives no formal penalty    but

rather is assessed the taxes due plus interest for the period of nonpayment.1

Thus, for 'ost taxpayers it is what the auditor uncovers that is the important

factor in determining the costs of noncompliance.12

            We seek to control for the degree of detectability in two ways.    First.

we estimate separate equations for reported AGI and tax liability.        As the IRS

readily acknowledges (e.g., US Department of the Treasury, 1983), it is far

more able to unoover overstatements of subtractions from income than

understatements     of income.    Thus, we would expect audits to have a stronger

effect on reported tax liability where overstatements of subtractions as well

as underreportingof income are reflected than on reported ACt.         Second, we

include two variables related to information reporting to the IRS and other

types of record keeping.         In 1969, the major paper trails used by the IRS were

the W—2 forms.13      To reflect the relative availability W—2s we include the

percent of employment in manufacturing and in the service industries,         Income

from manufacturing firms is generally covered by W—2 reporting and any

underreportingof income is likely to be detected by an audit.          In contrast,

income earned in the service industries is more likely to be in a form (e.g.,
                                                                                   9

cash, comsissions) less subject to detection.     Even the proprietor audit

classes in areas where such employment    is in manufacturingwill be likely to

have "paper trails" for receipts because of the extensive record keeping

activities of large manufacturing enterprises and because a significant portion

of the income for individuals In the proprietor audit classes is from wages and

salary.

           Our measure of income is obtained from the Census and varies according

to the income category included in the audit class.     We chose Census Income as

our measure of "true' income rather than an estimate of income from TGMP audit

results because TCMP auditors fail to uncover a substantial fraction of

unreported income.14     We have not explicitly introduced a measure of the

marginal    tax rate as an explanatory variable because for our data set the tax

rate has no variation that is independent of income.15     The coefficient on our

Income variable should therefore be interpreted as measuring the effect of

changes in income on compliance when the tax rates change with income in

accordance with the tax code.

           To reflect relevant features of the tax code, we include variables for

the percent of the populationover 65. average family size, the percent of the

population owning their own home, and the percent unemployed.     These variables

control for legitimate nonfilings by very low income Individuals (i.e.. in

1969, generally those with incomes below $600), the special allowances for

senior citizens, the exemptions for dependents, the tax deductability of

mortgage interest and property taxes, and the exclusion of unemployment

benefits from income.     Some of these variables may also be related to tastes

and preference regarding tax compliance.     For instance, there has been some

speculation    that in areas with high unemployment there might be more resentment
of the government and less willingness to pay the eandated taxes.       The two

variables measuring employment     structure (the percent of the population

employed in manufacturingand in services) may serve to control for the most

important adjustment to income, the adjustment for employee business expenses,

as well as detectability.

         The theoretical work on tax compliance provides relatively little

direction   in selecting the variables that should be included to reflect tastes

and preferences.      The limited empirical work on tax compliance and the survey

research do      however, provide some valuable guidance.   See Witte and Woodbury

(1983b), Kinsey (l984a). and Jackson and Hilliron     (1986) for surveys.     The

variables that are consistently related to tax compliance      behavior Include sex,

race, education,    age, and place of birth.   We include measures of each in our

model.

         Our specification    of the taxpayer compliance equations differs from

the literature     in that our dependent variables are reported AGI and tax

liability rather than measures derived from tax auditor estimates of

noncompliance.     We believe that using variables related to the taxpayers'

reports offer several important advantages for estimating the compliance model

and interpreting the results.      In addition, the use of reported AGI and tax

liability as the equations     for the taxpayers' behavior is implied by much of

the theoretical     literature on tax compliance and recommended by the National

Academy of Sciences' Panel on Research on Taxpayer Compliance (Scholz, Roth

and Witte, 1988).

         With reported AOl and total tax liability as the dependent variables in

the equations    for taxpayers' behavior it is reasonable to assume a normal

distribution for the error terms in the equations and to use standard
                                                                                  11


techniques for estimating the equations.      Further, the error term can be

interpreted as arisingjrom true stochasticness      in taxpayers   behavior or from

omitted variables     related to that behavior (e.g.. knowledge of the tax    code).

When the dependent variable is affected by tax auditors' estimate of unreported

income, these assumptions and interpretations are not valid,       in this case, the

error term reflects any elements of the auditors' and taxpayers' behaviors that

are not captured by the model.     Further, the error term has some unusual

features that make it difficult to handle statistically, particularly in a

simultaneous equation setting.     First, the error term is not continuously

distributedts..tncetaxpayers' reports and auditors' findings often coincide.

For example, with unreported    income as the dependent variable there may be an

atom at zero.    Second, the density of the error term may be distributed

asymmetricallyabout the atom since underreports of taxable income are far more

common than over reports.     While there has recently been some very good

progress on methods to handle these difficulties (Schmidt. 1986). the issue is

not resolved.

        The advantages_of using reported income as a dependent variable.

rather than a variable such as unreported    income which is determined in part by

tax auditors' findings, are, perhaps, even more important for the

interpretation   of the estimated coefficients.   With reported Income as the

dependent variable,    the effects of explanatory variables can arise either from

taxpayers' reporting behavior or from specific provisions of the tax code.

With a dependent variable that is Influenced by tax auditors' findings, the

effects of explanatory variables might also reflect the auditors' behavior.

Sorting out,even the separate effects of the tax code and compliance behavior

may not be easy, but at least the tax code is known and thus one should be able
                                                                                      12

to make some reasonable interpretation      c-f   the coefficients for the reported

income equations.      By way of contrast, very little is known about tax auditors'

behavior other than that they miss a substantial amount of underreporting and

that they are far better at catching overstatements        of deductions and

exemptions    than at uncovering underreports of income (U.S, Department of the

Treasury.    1983).   This lack of information compounds considerably the task of

interpreting   he coefficients     in an equation for unreported income (or for

percentage of noncompliance>      and is one of the primary reasons that we use

taxpayer reports as the dependent variables in the compliance equations.

         The third equation in our mode? is the equation for the log odds of an

audit,   We see the log odds of an audit as determined by reported ACt and
                                                                            of

probability of an audit is between zero and one for all values of the

explanatory variables,       Second, the specification    nests the random audit


strategy,    assumed in much theoretical work, as a special case.16        A random

audit stratei would be implied if only measures of IRS resources were

significantly related to the log odds of an audit.

         The variables that are available from the filed tax return and that the

IRS may potentially       use for audit selection are the measures of employment

structure,    the unemp1onnt rate, the percent of the population over 65,
                                                                                     13

average family size and the percent of the population who own their own homes.

Our Measure of IRS resources is the number of returns per full-time-equivalent

district employees

            Although all federal tax returns in any audit class are scored by the

same DIP formula for audit potential, the chances of a tax return being

audited, ceteris paribus, differ considerably across IRS districts.           The reason

for the differences In rules across districts        Is related to resource

availability.      Based   q the DIP scores,   the IRS develops a master plan annually

for the number of return examinations to be conducted by audit class in each

district.      However, the IRS has not been able to locate its staff in a fashion

to carry out its plan.        In some regions it has been able to examine

substantially     fewer returns than indicated by the optimal base plan whereas In

other regions more audits were conducted.        Since much of the reason for the

differences     in the probability that tax returns are selected for audit,

ceteris paribus, is related to resource constraints, we use a measure of IRS

audit resources to control for differences in the audit rules across taxpayers.

        Note that It is the variation In the completion of the optimal plan

across districts that is the important In this respect rather than just the

difference in      resources across regions.    A difference in resources relative to

the number of returns is not by itself necessarily evidence that the audit

selection rule varies across taxpayers.        it the IRS targets its resources

towards areas that are believed to be particularly noncompllant,       then higher

than average resources might just reflect higher concentration of noncompliant

taxpayers.     There is considerable evidence in government reports (GAO, 1976 and

WIlt, 1986) that the IRS has not been able to distribute       Its resources among

districts    in away to achieve best its revenue and compliance goals given its
                                                                                   14


budget.     In addition.   Long (1985) concludes that the "introduction of TCMP

compliance data did not bring about any dramatic restructuring in audit

coverage——evenwhen It disclosed regions or return classes with much lower

compliance levels which were receiving less audit attention than more compliant

groups (p. 29),"

          We achieve identification of our model by use of exclusion restrictions

which are justified on the basis of institutional, legal and informational

constraints.     Specifically, we identify the two reporting equations by

                                                                   The level of IRS
excluding our measure of IRS resources from these equations.

resources   affects reporting behavior only indirectly through its effect on the

likelihood that a taxpayer is audited.       Identification of the audit equation is

obtained by the exclusion of economic and socio—demographic variables that are

not available to the IRS on the tax     return   or information documents (e.g.,

whether or not an individual was foreign born) or, if available, cannot legally

be used to select returns for audit (e.g. sex).

          We estimate the model by two stage least squares.     We use a single

equation method rather than a systems method of estimation (e.g., three        stage

least squares) because we believe that some of our equations (e.g., the

                                                                           the
equation for reported AG!) are more completely specified than others (e.g.

audit equation) and we are concerned about spreading any omitted variable bias

across equations.    (See Intriligator (1978) for a discussion.)




5.   EmpIrical Results for the Structural Model

          Tables 2 thru 4 contain the results of the two—stage least squares

estimation for the reported AG! and tax liability and for the log odds of an

audit equations respectively.       Note first that the model explains a significant
                                                                                     15


proportion of the variation in reported AGI and tax liability and in the log

odds of an audit for each of the five audit classes.       As we had anticipated, we

Model reporting behavior sore successfully than auditing behavior.       For

reported AOl, the R2s range froa .14 for low incoce wage and salary workers

with iteMized deductions to .79 for low incoae proprietors while for tax

liability tha range of the R2s is froM .13 for Middle incoie wage and salary

workers to .79 for low Incoce proprietors.     Our Model explains between 6 (for

low incoee wage and salary workers with iteelzed deductions) and 31 percent

(for low incoMe proprietors) of the variation in the log odds of an audit.

           As Might be expected, the coefficients on income are by far the most

significant of the estimated coefficients in both the reported AOl and tax

liability equations.     The coefficients on income in the reported AGI equations

range from .27 for low Income taxpayers taking standard deductions to .97 for
middle income wage and salary workers.     Taxpayers in all audit classes reported

significantly less than an additional dollar of AOl for each extra dollar of

income.

           There are legal exclusions of certain types of income from taxation and

legal adjustments to income that account for some differences between income

and reported AGI.     Further, in 1969, some individuals   (i.e. ,those with total

income below $600 unless they had net earnings from self employment above $400)

In the low income groups (I.e., AGis below $10,000) were not required to file.

However,    recall that we include variables to control for the major income

exclusions (the percent over 65 to control for the exclusion of Social Security

benefits and the unemployment rate to control for the exclusion of unemployment

compensation),    adjustments (the two employment structure variables to control

for employee business expenses, the largest adjustment to Income In 1969). and
                                                                                     16

some of the major causes of extremely low income (the unemployment rate and the

percent of the population over 65).       We do not control for some exclusions

(e.g., income on municipal bonds), adjustments         (e.g., contributions   to

retirement plans by the self employed),      and causes of incomes below the filing

level (e.g., dependent    teenagers).   However, it seems unlikely that such

exclusions, adjustments (total adjustments were less than .1 percent of AGI in

1969) and legitimate nonfilings could explain the low rate at which income

shows up in reported AG!.

        The coefficients on income in the tax liability equations provide an

estimate of the marginal tax rate on total income (income before exclusions and

adjustments   by the tax code).   The marginal tax rates implied by these

coefficients do not seem unreasonable.      For the low income groups the estimated

marginal rate is between 7 and 10 percent.       As expected, middle income groups

had higher marginal rates (22 percent for middle income proprietors and 27

percent for middle income wage and salary workers).

        For all audit classes,     we find that increasing the odds of an audit

increases reported AG! and tax liability.       However, for reported AG! the effect

is significant for only two groups and for reported tax liability it is

significant   for three groups.   The magnitudes of the effects of audits on tax

compliance are modest with the elasticities for reported tax liability with

respect to the audit variable being between .19 and        .31   when significant.

These elasticities imply that a one percent increase in audit coverage would

lead to approximately    a $1.4 billion increase in tax revenue in current dollars

for the five audit classes considered.      This is an increase in 1969 tax revenue

from these groups of approximately      .69 percent.
                                                                                    17

        High audit rates appear to be more effective in eliciting accurate

reporting of subtractions from income than accurate reporting of Income.          The

elasticity of reported AOl with respect to the audit variable is smaller than

the elasticity for reported tax liability for all five audit classes and the

dIfference inelasticities is more pronounced for the middle than the low income

audit classes.     These findings support IRS's belief that its auditors are

better able to find overreported subtractions than underreported income.          The

findings are also consistent with survey findings (Westat. 1980) that

relatively more of the noncompliance for blue—collar communities is from

underreported income whereas for white-collar communities relativelymore of

the noncompliance    is from overstated subtractions    from income.

        Recall that we have no direct measure of penalties, but rather estimate

separate equations for reported ACt and tax liability and include two         measures

of detectability (the percent of employment    in manufacturing and in services)

as admittedlycrude proxies for penalties.      Our results provide some limited

support for greater detectability    being associated with compliance.

Specifically,    the finding that reported tax liability is more responsive to

audit rates than is reported AOl supports the hypothesis that the effectiveness

of high audit rates in eliciting honest reporting on the tax return is related

to the detectability of noncompliance. It appears that much of the effect of

audits operates through subtractions from Income which must be substantiated by

the taxpayer rather than through Income reporting.

        Also, we find higher level of employment       in manufacturing   (where most

Income may be reported to the IRS by the employer) to be associated with higher

levels of reported tax liabilities for all audit classes and higher levels of

employment in services18 (where a substantial portion of all income may not be
                                                                                   18

covered by W—2 or other reports) generally     to be associated with lower levels

of reported tax liability.      The results are significant, however, for only two

of the low income groups.

            Results for sociodemographic variables are interesting and help to

explain some seemingly incongruous findings that appear in the literature.        As

in other studies that include measures of both income and education, we find

that, if anything, taxpayers in areas with a more educated population report

lower AGI and pay less in taxes.      In their summary of the factors related to

tax compliance, Jackson and    Ki1lton   (1986) suggest that the more educated may

be less compliant because they better understand the opportunities for evasion

and are more willing to play the audit lottery than are the less educated.

        Studies that omit income from the specification    (e.g., Dubin and

Wilde, 1988) find that the educated are, if anything, more compliant with the

tax laws.     Indeed, if we omit income from our specification, the coefficients

on the education variable becomes positive.     Income and education are,

however, highly correlated.     With income omitted from the specification, the

educationvariable serves partially as an income proxy and the estimated

coefficient on education must be interpreted accordingly.

        The percent of the population that Is nonwhite is not significantly

related to income reporting behavior for any of the groups we consider although

reported tax liability is signiticantly lower for nonwhites than for whites in

two of the low income audit classes.     The findings for race in other studies

are mixed.     The results obtained depend to some extent on the dependent

variable used and on whether or    n   income is included as an explanatory

variable.     When income is excluded from the specification and an estimate of

the compliance rate that is indirectly related to auditors' findings is used as
                                                                                   19

the dependent variable (Witte and Woodbury,     1985, Dubin and Wilde. 1988), the

coefficient on the variable for the percent of the population       that is nonwhite

is significant for most audit classes and when significant generally, but not

always, indicates    that whites are more compliant than other racial groups.      In

contrast,    our results which control for income and use measures of taxpayers'

reports as dependent variables    shi   no evidence that whites are slgniicantly

more accurate in their income reports and only weak evidence that whites are

significantlymore accurate in their reports of subtractions from income.

Clearly,    economists' understanding of the relationship   between race and

compliance is not very strong.     This mirrors the results for this variable in

the general crime literature.     See Schmidt and Witte   (1984).   Wilson and

Herrnstein (1985) or Blumstein. et al. (1986) for a discussion.

           The results for the percent foreign born and the percent of households

female headed generally support previous work.     Except for low—income wage and

salary workers, we find, as do previous studies, that areas with a relatively

large percent of families headed by females and a relativelysmall percent of

the population foreign born tend to report higher AGI and tax liability.         The

better compliance for areas with a larger percentage of families headed by

women appears to result predominantly     from higher income reports.

           The variables related to the taxpayers' ages are the percentage of the

population older than 65 and the ,verage age of the population between 18 and

65.   The coefficients   on these variables may reflect any age or cohort effects

related to compliance.     In addition, the variable for the percentage of the

population over 65 is used to control for the exclusion of Social Security

benefits from taxable income and the extra exemption allowed Individuals over

65.   The coefficients on this variable will be related to both age and tax code
                                                                                  20

effects and would be negative if being over 65 affected reporting only through

the special provisions of the tax code for older taxpayers.

        As in other studies usingjnformatlon related to 1969 returns

(Clotfelter, 1983, Witte and Woodbury, 1985. and Dubin and Wilde, 1988). our

results provide some, but not overwhelming, support for the comion perception

that older taxpayers are more compliant than younger ones (see Jackson and

Milliron,    1986).   For two audit classes (low and Riddle income proprietors) we

find a significant and positive relationship between reported tax liability and

average age.     For middle income proprietors we also find significantly higher

reported income and tax liability in areas with a relatively high percent of

the population over 65.      For low income proprietors the relationship is

reversed.    We believe that the finding for the low income audit class is a

result of the regressive structure of the tax code benefits afforded

individuals over 65.      At low income levels the tax code effects outweigh anr
                                                                         income
additional    compliance behavior of older individuals whereas at higher

levels the compliance effect is predominant.

        The remaining three variables were included to control for exclusions,
                                                                              When

equation reflectingthe exemptions for children and the deductions for mortgage

        The findings for the unemployment variable do not seem to reflect the

exclusions of unemployment compensationfrom income reporting.       Indeed, the

coefficients on the unemployment rate are generally positive in the reported

AOl equation and significantlypositive for two of the low income       groups.       It
                                                                                     21


may be that Income reporting increases with the unemployment rate because of

Increased filings associated with attempts to secure tax refunds.

           The coefficients on the unemployment rate are consistently negative In

the tax liability equation, but are only significant for low Income

proprietors.     Our results suggest that unemployment has only a very weak

association with compliance and any tendency for areas with high rates of

unemployment    to have lower levels of compliance stems from overstatements of

subtractions not understatements    of income.    Thus. It does not appear that the

effect of unemployment can be explained by operation in the underground

economy.     The effects may be due to antigovernment attitudes or to a simple

attempt to overcome financial stress by obtaining a bigger tax refund.

However,    the effects are not strong.

           Studies that use an estimated compliance rate based on auditor findings

as the dependent variable for compliance equations (Witte and Woodbury, 1985

and Dubin and Wilde. 1988) generally find increased unemployment to be

associated with decreased compliance.     We suspect that these results may

reflect In large part the auditors' ability to detect overstated deductions.

           As noted earlier, our results for the audit equation although

significant are not very strong.     See Table   4.   We find the probability of an

audit to be significantly associated with information available on taxpayers'

returns for all audit classes.     That Is, we find no support for the IRS

pursuing a random audit strategy.ior any audit class.        or   four of the five

audit classes we consider, auditing is significantly       associated with the


endogenous taxpayers' reports (i.e., by reported AGI and total tax liability).

For the remaining audit class (siddle income wage and salary workers) the

probability of audit is not signicantly affected by the endogenous taxpayer
                                                                                  22

reports but is significantly      affected by variables that are related to

information available on taxpayers' returns.19      Specifically   for middle income

wage and salary workers we find that the probability of audit is higher in

areas where a larger percentage p1 individuals is employed in services and

other nonanufacturing jobs and where there is a higher percentage        of the

population over 65.    We suspect that these variables are proxying specific

aspects of taxpayers' reports that we do not observe although they might be

mirroring IRS targeting of specific professions or income sources.



6. Reduced   Form Results

        Economic studies of taxpayer compliance have focused on audits as the

enforcement activity of the IRS.       This is perhaps as natural choice given the

theoretical and empirical models for participation      in other illegal activities

and the IRS's emphasis on the importance of audits.      As reported in the

previous section, however, both our work and the previous literature find

relatively weak deterrent effects from audits.      Admittedly,    this empirical work

is based on aggregate data and given the relatively low audit coverage this is

a potential problem.     In addition, the emphasis on audits may be misplaced.

The IRS undertakes many other enorcement and service activities such as

matching the income claims on the return against 1099 and W-2 documents.

checking math errors, providing information and education programs, pursuing

delinquent accounts, instituting detailed investigations and recommending

civil and criminal cases against tax evaders.      The reduced form estimates for

reported AOl and tax liability reveal that these other activities may also have

significant compliance      effects.
                                                                                     23

          While estimates of the sjuctural equations suggest that compliance

 behavior varies markedly across taxpayer groups and that audits have limited

 deterrence effects, the reduced from equations reveal a consistent pattern of

 compliance behavior and show significant effects of IRS activities.       Consider

 the reduced form results for reported tax liability reported in Table 5.          These

results Indicate that Increases In IRS work load (returns per full—time

—equivalent employee)     consistently and significantly   decrease reported tax

liability.20 This result when coupled with our much weaker structural

findings regarding the effects of audits suggests that IRS activities other

than audits may have significant impacts on compliance.

          The reduced form results for the sociodemographic    and tax code related

variables also are also far more significant and consistent      than in the

structural model.21      This suggests that the variabilityof the structural

results across taxpayer classes may be due at least in part to the fact that

IRS activities other than audits affect compliance and perhaps that academic

researchers   have not been very s!pcessful in modeling the audit process.



7.   Conclusions

          At this point it seems worthwhile to step back and consider what we can

conclude regarding compliance behavior not only from the work reported here but

also from other work that has used data related to 1969 tax returns       (e.g..

Clotfelter,   1983. Witte and Woodbury,   1985, Oubln and Wilde, 1988).   There are

two important   reasons for giving thought to what has been learned In the course

of this work.      First, there are now a number of studies that use data related

to 1969 returns and there is some controversy surrounding      the reported results.

Second,   the 1969 data sets contain information that is only available through
                                                                                      24

the IRS and the recent work represents the first time that personnel outside

the IRS have been allowed to analyze such data and publish results.         It is

important that we learn as much as possible from the 1969 results because the

IRS is now making more recent data available and a number of researchers are

developing proposals based on the new data sets.

        All authors who consider the issue (Witte and Woodbury,       1985, Dubin and

Wilde, 1988 and the results reported here) conclude that for most audit classes

audits have positive effects on compliance but that the magnitudes       of the

effects are small.     Further, different models suggest that audits deter

noncompliance   for different groups.    Wltte and Woodbury find deterrent effects

(mainly lagged effects) for all audit classes except the low       incoe   class that

takes standard deductions.    Dubin and Wilde find a deterrent effect for four of

the seven audit classes and a significant deterrent effect for low income wage

and salary workers who take standard and who take itemized deductions.         (For

high income wage and salary workers they find that a higher probability of

being audited is associated with less compliance.)      We find a deterrent effect

of audits for the five low and middle income audit classes that we consider and

a significant effect for low income returns with standard deductions and for

low and middle income proprietors.      Obviously the results depend critically on

model specification.    This is quite worrisome and suggests that economists'

understandingof the effects of audits on tai compliance is not very thorough.

        For some audit classes, part of the problem may be that there Is very

little noncompliance   to explain.   None of the empirical studies have found a

deterrent effect of audits for middle income wage and salary workers who were

the most compliant audit class in 1969.      Interestingly,   the audit class for

which our model provides the best the description of compliance behavior is
                                                                                     25

also the least compliant audit class, namely low income proprietors.

           Given the attention that has been focused on how audit coverage

affects tax compliance, it is rather disappointing      that empirical researchers

have not made more progress.       We believe that the major reasons for the state

of affairs relate to the nature of the data utilized and the secrecy

surrounding the IRS's audit selection formulas.       All studies that have

considered the effect of audits on compliance have used data that Is aggregated

to at least the three digit zip code level.       The use of such data to estimate

the audit selection rule is potentially a severe problem.       With audit coverage

in the range of one to five percent, the audit selection system Is primarily an

"outliers' system.       To be more specific, the IRS's DIP formulas are primarily

selecting    returns for audit that are outliers In terms of reporting behavior.

The averaging implicit in aggregate data washes out most information on

outliers and, hence, may only very poorly reflect the audit selection rule.

           In order to maintain the integrity of its audit selection system, the

IRS must release data in a form that precludes academic researchers motivated

by intellectual curiosity or private greed from estimating an audit selection

rule that closely duplicates the IRS's formulas.       This means that researchers

may have great difficultyestimating meaningful structural equations with

audits.     Indeed, one can question the ethics of doing so.    Yet, as noted

earlier,    different   types of audit rules have quite different Implications for

the specification of compliance equations.      This is obviously a major issue

that the IRS and compliance researchers need to consider very carefully.

           An additional reason why empirical studies may not have found

consistently significant deterrent effects is that the economic research thus

far has concentrated on the effects of only one IRS enforcement activity,
                                                                                 26

namely audits.     Other enforcement and service activities of the IRS (e.g.,

taxpayer services and document matching for W—2 and 1099 forms) may also have

significant compliance effects.     Part of the reason why the reduced form model

shows a more consistent deterrent effect than do the structural models for

audits may be related to how other IRS activities affect compliance.      Very

little is known about the effects of IRS enforcement efforts other than audits

or about the effects of service activities.     Some work has been done though on

how programs directed at return preparers might affect reporting behavior

(Scholz, Roth, and Witte, 1988).

        While results from the 1969 data sets allow no definitive conclusions

                                                                 valuable and
regarding the effects of audits on compliance, they provide very

quite consistent    guidance regarding the type of sociodemographic variables    to

include to control for"tastes and preferences".     This is quite important since

theory provides little direction in this area.     Specifically, the results from

the study of the 1969 data base indicate that the age, sex, and race of the

taxpayer,   the taxpayer's education, and taxpayer's country of birth affect

compliance.    The results of work with the 1969 data base also suggest that it

is important to consider the specifics of the tax code when constructingand

interpreting the coefficients on sociodemographic variables.     Variables such as

the age of the taxpayer may be related both to attitudes towards compliance and

to the special allowances    in the tax code for older individuals.

        Careful comparison of existing work also indicates that when

interpreting   the coefficients of compliance models it is important to consider

the model specification very carefully.     The results one obtains appear to be

quite sensitive    to the dependent variable utilized and the vector of

explanatory variables included.     All previous research that has used 1969 data
                                                                                    27

bases has estimated a single compliance    equation with a dependent variable

which is either directly (Clotfelter. 1983) or indirectly (Witte          and Woodbury,

1985, and Dubin and Wilde. 1988) linked    to   auditors'   findings.22   The results

of this research needs to be interpreted with care because coefficients reflect

auditors' as well as taxpayers' behavior.       For example, our results suggest

that previous findings (Witte and Woodbury, 1985; Dubin and Wilde, 1988) that

increased    unemployment is generally associated with decreased      compliance may

be due to tax auditors' abilities to uncover overstated deductions.

        In addition, the seemingly mixed evidence regarding the relationship

between education and compliance results from differences is the explanatory

factors included in the models and is quite understandable when one considers

the specificationsof the models.      If income is included in the model, then we

find that the more educated are less compliant.       If.   however, the specification

of the compliance equation does not include a measure of income, then the

educated may appear to be more compliant    (e.g.. Dubln and Wilde, 1988).

Without an income variable in the model, however, the education variable

reflects the change in compliance associated jointly with an increase in

education    and the average change in income that accompanies the increased

education.

        1Xlepper and Nagin (1987) use the 1982 TCMP data to examine how factors
related to individual line items on the return affect compliance.

        2Adjustments have, of course, been subtracted from income to obtain
AGI.  Thus, when considering results for our AOL equation some subtractions
will be included. However, adjustments to income in 1969 were very small (less
than $700 thousand or less than .1 percent of reported AOl) and, thus, our
results should not be affected much by adjustments.  Reported AGI reflects
mainly the income reporting decision. Our data contain no measures of income
before adjustments.

        3See Witte and Woodbury (1983b), Kinsey (1984b), Tauchen and Witte
(1986), and Scholz, Roth and Witte (1988) for surveys.

          4See, for exampl&, Controller General of the United States (1976),
Weddick   (1983), or wilt (1986).

        5See Tauchen and Witte (1986b) for additional details regarding the
audit selection process.

        6We obtained some Census information from the Project 778 files and
other variables directly from the Census tapes.

          7See Witte and Woodbury (1983a, 1985) or Dubin and Wilde (1988) for
additional   description of the Project 778 data.

        8For example, Census data contains only open—ended   income categories
for high income individuals.

        9Note that if the taxpayer report affects the probability of audit that
it is the parameters on these variables not the simple probability of audit
that will affect taxpayer compliance. We consider the approach taken in this
paper a first approximation to properly modeling of compliance behavior when
the taxpayer's reports affect the probability of an audit. See Tauchen and
Witte (1986a and 1986b) for a discussion of a way to model compliance when the
audit rule depends on taxpayer behavior.

       101n 1969, seventy percent of all returns audited resulted in auditors'
findings that adjustments were necessary. See Commissioner of Internal Revenue
(1970).

          For example, in 1969 when two and a half million returns were
audited, only 25,110 were received by the appelate division and 2,293 were
received for full—scale criminal investigation.
         12
           Civil penalties are a set rate on the amount of taxes the auditor
estimates to have been underpaid. Thus, detectability is central to tax
penalties when civil penalties are imposed as well. Only criminal penalties
are not directly related to the auditors' estimates of the amount of
underpayment.   There were only 526 criminal convictions for tax fraud in 1969.
                                                                             29

Criminal tax cases generally relate to such IRS special programs as the
organized crime and drug enforcement programs or to notorious cases of evasion
such as the recent case against the Reverend Moon.

        13There was information reporting on dividend and interest income in
1969, but the IRS had not perfected its matching programs and, hence, did not
make very effective use of this type of paper trail information.

        14me IRS estimates that auditors are able to uncover only $1 In every
$3 that Is reported on 1099 documents (US Department of the Treasury, 1983).
Until 1979 the TCMP auditors were not provided with 1099 forms.

         15We developed a marginal tax rate variable that reflected differences
in state tax codes and differences in subtractions related to differences in
costs of living and other factors. Perhaps because of the aggregate nature of
our data, the marginal tax variable was essentially an income proxy.

        16See Reinganua and Wilde (1985) or Tauchen and Wltte (1986a).

        170ur count of the number of IRS full—time—equivalent employees
excludes those at the regional service centers since they do not conduct audits
and the district employees who handle alcohol, tobacco and firearms
enforcement.

         18gemember that these employment structure variables are also included
to control for legal subtractions from income. We would expect individuals in
the service industries to have higher levels of employee business expenses and
contributions to self employment pension plans, These adjustments would lead
to negative coefficients on the percent employed in services in the reported
AGI equation.   However, the effect should not be very large since total
adjustments were only .1 percent of AGI in 1969.

         19The reduced form results for the reported AGI equation are also
available upon request. As for the structural equations, the reduced form
results show that the IRS activities have a greater effect upon reported
subtractions than on reported income.

        20A5 in the structural model, we believe that the significant and
negative coefficients on the variables of the percent of the population over 85
for the low income classes result from the nature of the Income exclusions and
exemptions allowance given to older taxpayers. At low income levels, these tax
code effects swamp the compliance effects associated with age.

        21The dependent variable used by Witte and Woodbury (1985a) and Dubin
and Wilde (1988) particularly troublesome. The measure of compliance is
created from the DIF scores. Results using this dependent will reflect the DIF
formulas as well as taxpayer and auditor behavior.
