ABSTRACT
1     Introduction

    Despite a near-continuous decline over the past 20 years, the teen birth rate in the United

States continues to be 6 to 12 times that of other developed countries (Kearney and Levine 2012).

Two types of economic arguments support the view that the high rate of teenage childbearing

in the United States is a problem that should be a focus of public policy. The first is based on

the idea that teenagers are often not well-positioned to take care of children and, as a result,

they disproportionately impose costs on family, friends, communities, and public assistance

programs when they have children. Unless teenagers fully internalize such costs when they make

decisions, we would expect them to have children “too often” from a social welfare perspective.

The second type of argument focuses on the costs that teenagers’ choices impose on themselves.

While such arguments carry little weight where standard economic models of behavior can

be applied, extremely high rates of unintended pregnancies among sexually active teens—more

than twice the rate of older women (Finer 2010)—suggest that homo economicus does not apply

to teens making choices about sexual activities. It also suggests that policies aimed at reducing

unintended pregnancies have the potential to improve teenagers’ welfare while reducing the

negative externalities associated with teenage childbearing.

    There is a long history of policies and initiatives in the United States that are geared towards

reducing unintended pregnancies, particularly among teens. These approaches typically involve

attempts: (i) to delay or reduce the frequency of sexual intercourse and/or (ii) to increase

the use of contraceptives or promote the use of more-e↵ective contraceptives. That said, the

results of such policies have often been disappointing. Less than half of published studies that

use experimental or quasi-experimental approaches to evaluate comprehensive sex education

programs report significant e↵ects on the initiation of sex, frequency of sex, or contraceptive use

(Kirby 2008).1 A randomized control trial of the Parent’s Speak Up National Campaign, which

promotes parent-child communication about waiting to have sex, finds no e↵ect on adolescent’s

beliefs that “waiting to have sex is the best way to prevent health risks like pregnancy or

HIV/STDs” (Palen et al., 2011). Moreover, the wave of state policies expanding confidential

access to birth control pills during the 1960s and 1970s had little e↵ect on teen pregnancies
    1
      Kirby’s (2008) review considers 48 studies of comprehensive programs. It also considers nine abstinence
programs, four of which have experimental designs. While some of the non-experimental studies reviewed found
significant e↵ects on the initiation of sex and frequency of sex, the experimental studies did not. Moreover, none
of the studies found significant e↵ects on contraceptive use. More recently, Carr and Packham (2014) show that
state-level abstinence-based sex education mandates have no e↵ect on birth rates or abortion rates.

(Guldi 2008; Bailey 2009; Meyers 2012). That said, family planning programs appear to o↵er

significant promise where these other policies do not. Bailey (2012) shows that the establishment

of federal family planning programs in the 1960s and 1970s reduced teen birth rates 2.3% 6–10

years down the road. Kearney and Levine (2009) provide more recent evidence on the e↵ects of

family planning services in their study of state Medicaid policy changes that expanded access to

higher-income women during the 1990s and 2000s—they find that these policy changes reduced

teen childbearing by over 4% and argue that this e↵ect was accomplished by increased use of

contraceptives.2

    The research described above indicates that family planning services do play a critical role

in averting unintended pregnancies and births among teenagers. Yet, as over three-quarters of

teen births are unintended at conception (Mosher et al., 2012), it would seem that there may be

some scope for such services to play a larger role. And as a significant share of unplanned births

are to women who used contraception during the month prior to conception—40% in 2001 (Finer

and Henshaw, 2006)—many have argued that leveraging recent technological advances could be

key. In particular, long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), which include both implants

and intrauterine devices (IUDs), are extremely e↵ective at preventing pregnancy. Whereas

incorrect and/or inconsistent use leads to failure rates between 6 and 9% for birth control pills,

injectables, patches, and rings (and 18% for condoms), LARC methods have failure rates of less

than 1% because they do not require anything of the user for at least 3 years after the initial

procedure.3 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ (ACOG) Committee

on Adolescent Health Care and the American Academy of Pediatrics have both stated that

LARC methods should be “first-line recommendations” for all adolescents (in 2012 and 2014,

respectively), and LARCs were the focus of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s

April 2015 report, “Preventing Teen Pregnancy.” That said, only 5 percent of American teens

using contraceptives are using a LARC method.4 This low rate of use appears to be due in large

part to a lack of awareness, misperceptions about safety, and costs—70 percent of adolescent

participants in the Contraceptive CHOICE Project in St. Louis aged 14-20 chose a LARC

method when these barriers were removed (Mestad et al. 2011). Nonetheless, a fundamental

policy question remains unanswered: how much can expanding access to LARCs reduce teen

birth rates?

    To answer this question, we consider the first large-scale policy intervention to promote

and improve access to LARCs in the United States. In particular, we examine the Colorado

Family Planning Initiative, a $23 million program funded by an anonymous donor that began

in 2009 with the primary goal of helping low-income women gain access to LARCs through

Title X clinics.5 The state of Colorado has pointed to the subsequent 40% reduction in its teen

birth rate (“three-quarters of which was accounted for by young women served by [agencies

implementing the program]”) as evidence of the program’s success.6 However, the fact that

teen birth rates fell significantly all across the United States over the same time period suggests

that other factors probably contributed to the decline observed in Colorado. The goal of this

paper is to separate out the e↵ects of the policy initiative from the e↵ects of these other factors

in order to better understand the way in which a major investment in LARCs can a↵ect teen

outcomes. We do so using a di↵erence-in-di↵erences approach, comparing the changes in teen

birth rates in Colorado counties with Title X clinics to the changes observed in other US counties

with Title X clinics.

    The results of our analysis indicate that the success of the Colorado Family Planning Ini-

tiative may have been overstated by time-series comparisons; however it has led to significant

reductions in teen birth rates. In particular, our estimates indicate that it reduced teen birth

rates in a↵ected counties by approximately 5% in the four years following its implementation,

driven by e↵ects of approximately 7% in its second through fourth years. Our estimates further

suggest that these e↵ects were concentrated among Colorado’s counties with the highest rates

of poverty.

    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section we discuss LARCs in

the context of the contraceptive options that are presently available to teenagers in the United

States and then provide further details on the Colorado Family Planning Initiative. We then

describe our empirical approach and the results of our analysis before providing some concluding

thoughts.

       These initial funds will run out at the end of June 2015. Colorado’s legislature voted against a $5 million
bill to continue the program in April 2015. While initially anonymous, it has since been revealed that the donor
was Warren Bu↵ett’s Susan Thompson Bu↵ett Foundation.

2     Background

2.1    Long-Acting Reversible Contaceptives (LARCs)

    LARCs include intrauterine devices (IUDs) and sub-dermal implants. IUDs are flexible, T-

shaped devices that must be inserted and removed by a doctor. The most popular IUDs include

the copper IUD, Paragard, and the plastic IUD, Mirena, which can protect against pregnancy

for 12 and 5 years, respectively. The primary mechanism of action of both types of IUD is

preventing fertilization by inhibiting sperm motility. Sub-dermal implants, such as Implanon

and Nexplanon, consist of a matchstick-sized rod that contains etonogestrel. The rod is inserted

into the inside of the non-dominant upper arm and can remain in place for up to 3 years.

    As shown in Table 1, which provides information on the various contraceptive options that

are currently available, implants and IUDs are as e↵ective at preventing pregnancy as steril-

ization. During the first year of typical use, fewer than 1 in 1,000 women using an IUD or

implant become pregnant. This is true with respect to “perfect use” and “typical use” of these

methods because they require nothing of the user after an initial doctor’s visit for insertion

and thus eliminate the potential for user-compliance error. In contrast, oral contraceptives and

condoms are not foolproof and have typical-use e↵ectiveness rates of only 91% and 82% among

all women, respectively, and 80% and 82% among teenagers under the age of 18 (Dineman et

al., 1995; Grady et al., 1986). Moreover, because LARCs are not visible, they could be an at-

tractive option for teens with disapproving parents or partners. Furthermore, although LARCs

have high upfront costs, since they can remain in place for up to 12 years, they can be cheaper

than other contraceptives in the long run.

    Despite the ease of use and benefits of LARCs, merely 5% of the 3.2 million teenage women

using contraceptives in the United States chose to use an implant or IUD in 2013, and only 8.5%

of all US women using contraceptives choose a LARC (Guttmacher, 2014; NSFG 2011-2013).

This figure stands in stark contrast to other countries where, for example, 41% of women use a

LARC in China and rates vary between 6% and 27% in Europe.7 There are several potential

explanations for the low rate of LARC use among US teens. First, teens may be unaware that

LARCs are a viable option. Second, there may be misconceptions about safety and protecting

against sexually transmitted diseases (Bharadwaj et al., 2012). Third, insertion is uncomfortable
   7
     See Finer et al. (2012) for more details. Rates available for European countries are as follows: Austria, 15%;
Baltics: 14%; Czech Republic, 10%; Denmark, 18%; France, 17%; Germany, 10%; Spain, 6%; Sweden, 21%; and
UK, 11%.



                                                        5
and sometimes painful, and LARCs may cause side e↵ects such as menstrual pain and bleeding,

spotting, headaches, nausea, and mood changes, although these side e↵ects are similar to those

associated with other hormonal birth control methods.8 Fourth, teens may be discouraged by

the high upfront costs of the devices. Out-of-pocket costs for implants and IUDs are upwards of

$400, and even insured teens may pay up to a $160 copayment to receive a LARC (Trussell et

al., 2009; Planned Parenthood). In support of the importance of this consideration, Mestad et

al. (2011) find that 70% of adolescents who are aware of the benefits of LARCs choose a LARC

when it is o↵ered at no cost. Finally, there are supply-side barriers to LARC access. Doctors

and nurses must be trained on proper LARC insertion/removal and side e↵ects counseling.

Moreover, health clinics that provide free and low-cost contraceptives generally cannot a↵ord

to o↵er LARCs to all clients—many Title X clinics do not o↵er LARCs at all, and those that

do must o↵er them to clients selectively.9 As discussed in greater detail below, The Colorado

Family Planning Initiative sought to improve access to LARCs by addressing several of these

issues.


2.2       The Colorado Family Planning Initiative

    In this section we highlight the most important features of the Colorado Family Planning

Initiative as they relate to our analysis. Our description of the policy’s implementation draws

heavily from conversations with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment

and the detailed discussion provided in Ricketts et al. (2014).

    In January 2009 the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (DPHE) im-

plemented the Colorado Family Planning Initiative (CFPI) with the intent to reduce unintended

pregnancy via increased access to long-acting reversible contraception. The Colorado DPHE

received $23 million in provisional funding from an anonymous donor to provide free LARC

methods to low-income women in Title X clinics. All of Colorado’s 28 agencies accepted fund-

ing, which was to be distributed to Title X clinics in 37 counties through June 2015. Money was

allocated proportionally to agencies based on their number of clients and the predicted number

of LARC insertions in the following year.
    8
      More serious and rare side e↵ects can occur for patients with IUDs and include pelvic inflammatory disease,
uterus perforation, and ectopic pregnancies. Risk of pelvic inflammatory disease occurs in 1 in 100 cases, and
is no greater with an IUD than the risk to the general population. Uterus perforation occurs in less than 1 in
1000 cases. Ectopic pregnancy is the most serious and rare possible side e↵ect of an IUD. In rare events in which
a women becomes pregnant while using an IUD, the risk of having an ectopic pregnancy ranges from 6–50%
(Grimes, 2007).
    9
      Just 39% of all Title X clinics in 2010 o↵ered implants, and only 63% provided IUDs (FPAR, 2013).



                                                       6
    The CFPI provided support for 3 main objectives: supplying free IUDs and contraceptive

implants to low-income women, equipping sta↵ and providers with more knowledge about LARC

insertion, promotion, and counseling, and providing technical assistance for billing, coding,

and clinic management. Additionally, CFPI o↵ered general assistance to Title X agencies to

increase the utilization of LARCs and supported the provision of NuvaRing, tubal ligations and

vasectomies. We note, however, that the use of NuvaRing remained fairly constant at roughly

5% among teen clients after the CFPI was implemented and that tubal ligations and vasectomies

are extremely rare among teens.10

    Title X clinics receive federal and state funds to provide free or low-cost counseling, sexually

transmitted disease screening, and contraceptives. At Colorado Title X clinics anyone at or

below 100% of the poverty level pays nothing, and no client is denied services because of an

inability to pay. Patients who earn between 101%-250% of the poverty level pay a discounted

rate and clients earning above 250% of the poverty level pay the full cost of the visit. Agencies

must accept verbal communication of income and no verification is necessary.

    In Colorado, 90% of Title X clients fall into the “very low income” bracket, meaning that

nearly all clients pay nothing for contraceptives and doctor visits. The high upfront costs of

LARC devices paired with the sliding fee schedule meant that historically many clinics could

not a↵ord to provide implants and IUDs. At clinics that supplied LARCs prior to the CFPI,

devices were inserted only for women that were subjectively considered the most “at risk” for

an unintended pregnancy. The CFPI funding was critical for all Title X clinics to be able to

stock and provide these highly e↵ective contraceptives to clients. In 2009, 20 out of 28 agencies

o↵ered IUDs for the first time and 16 agencies o↵ered the implant for the first time. At the

end of the first year of the initiative, all agencies o↵ered IUDs and all but one agency o↵ered

implants.

    Figure 1 shows how the primary method of contraception used by female teenagers (ages

15-19) visiting Colorado Title X clinics has evolved over time. In 2008, the year before the

initiative began, LARCs had a lower usage rate than condoms, injections, rings, and birth

control pills at less than 3%. By 2014, LARC take-up among teens had risen to nearly 25%,

surpassing all methods except oral contraceptives. In broad terms, Colorado teens substituted

away from methods with relatively low typical-use success rates towards highly e↵ective devices
    10
       Nuvaring is a vaginal ring inserted once a month and left in place for three weeks. Like birth control pills,
it prevents pregnancy by releasing estrogen and progestin.




                                                         7
over time. We also note that these statistics may understate the degree to which LARC use has

increased in Colorado because the statistics for each year are based on clinic visitors, and the

long-acting quality of LARCs may reduce the likelihood of a return visit to a clinic. Regardless,

as depicted in Figure 2, the increase among teens visiting Colorado clinics stands apart from

what has happened across the United States as a whole. In particular, despite starting at the

same low rate in 2008, LARC usage among teens visiting Title X clinics across the US only

grew to approximately 6% by 2013 versus 21% for Colorado.

    Further demonstrating what an outlier Colorado has become in promoting the use of LARCs

among teens visiting Title X clinics, Figure 3 presents a state-by-state comparison of teen LARC

usage by Title X clients in 2013. It shows that only 6 states have LARC usage above 11%,

and Colorado has the highest usage rate at over 21%. As a whole, these statistics support the

notion that Colorado clinics were successful at introducing teens to highly e↵ective contraceptive

methods after the implementation of the CFPI.

    Figure 4 shows the number of teen females visiting a Title X clinic in Colorado over time

along with the number of teen clients whose primary method of contraception was a LARC.

These are of interest because a spike in the number of clients after the program was implemented

could suggest that CFPI was e↵ective in attracting new clients to Title X clinics. Alternatively,

a decline in clients could imply that the number of clients receiving LARCs has not risen by

as much as we would expect based on the earlier figures. That said, Figure 4 does not show a

spike in the number of clients but, rather, shows an increase and a subsequent decrease in the

number of clients, which is consistent with the fact that the teen population increased and then

decreased over the same period (Panel A). Moreover, the figure also shows that the number of

teens visiting Title X clinics in Colorado using LARCs increased over this period in a significant

manner (Panel B).



3    Empirical Approach

    In this section we provide details on the data used in our analysis and on our strategy for

estimating the causal e↵ects of the Colorado Family Planning Initiative.




                                                8
3.1     Data

    Our analysis focuses on teens between the ages of 15 and 19 living in counties with Title X

clinics. The locations of Title X clinics in Colorado—all of which participated in the Colorado

Family Planning Initiative—were obtained from the Colorado Department of Public Health and

Environment’s Directory of Family Planning Services. Counties with Title X clinics outside of

Colorado were identified by geocoding the addresses of such clinics listed in the US Department

of Health and Human Service’s 340B Database. According to the National Family Planning

and Reproductive Health Association, over 90% of Title X clinics participate in the 340B Drug

Pricing Program and thus would be reflected in the database (NFPRHA 2013).11 The resulting

set of counties that are used in our analysis are depicted Figure 5. In total, 72% of counties

are included in the analysis, which account for 93% of the population of female teenagers in the

United States.

    In order to estimate the e↵ect of the initiative on teen births, we use restricted-use natality

files (provided by the National Center for Health Statistics) from 2002–2013.12 These data

consist of a record of every birth taking place in the United States over this time period and

include information on the mother’s age and the county of the birth, which are critical to

our analysis, in addition to other details on the mother, the father, and the child. We assign

births to the year of conception based on the mother’s last menstrual period where available

and otherwise assume a gestation period of nine months. As such, we have incomplete data

on births conceived in 2013 and thus restrict our analysis from 2002–2012 after making use of

the 2013 natality file to construct our measure of teen births conceived in 2012. We use these

data in conjunction with population counts from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance,

Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) in order to consider teen birth rates in our

analysis.13

    Because our empirical strategy (described in the next section) controls for county-specific

and year-specific characteristics with fixed e↵ects, we only consider time-varying county char-

acteristics as control variables. These include demographics (fraction of 15–19 females of each

age, black, and Hispanic) constructed from the population data described above and the unem-
   11
      For Colorado, one of 37 counties would have been excluded from the analysis if we solely used data from the
340B Database.
   12
      The choice of the initial year used for the analysis is motivated by the fact that Broomfield County, Colorado,
split o↵ from Adams, Boulder, Je↵erson, and Weld counties in November of 2001.
   13
      SEER population estimates are based on an algorithm that incorporates information from the Census, Vital
statistics, IRS migration files, and the Social Security database. Note that we omit from the analysis one county
that has a Title X clinic and zero teen females in a year.

    Summary statistics for the variables used in the analysis are shown in Table 2. Means for the

sample of Colorado counties and comparison counties are separately reported pre-2009 (before

the enactment of the Colorado Family Planning Initiative) and post-2009. Teen birth rates

prior to 2009 across treatment and comparison counties average 40 and 48, respectively, and

teen birth rates for both groups decline after 2009. In the analysis below we intend to shed

light on the degree to which the reduction observed in the Colorado counties was caused by the

Colorado Family Planning Initiative.


3.2    Identification Strategy

    As we alluded to above, we estimate the e↵ects of the Colorado Family Planning Initiative

with a di↵erence-in-di↵erences approach that uses counties with Title X clinics outside of Col-

orado to form the comparison group for Colorado counties with clinics receiving funding (i.e.,

those with Title X clinics). The identifying assumption underlying this approach is that the

proportional changes in birth rates in the comparison counties provide a good counterfactual

for the proportional changes that would have been observed in the Colorado counties in the

absence of the initiative. We discuss the validity of this identifying assumption in greater detail

below.14

    Given the discrete nature of the births and because we sometimes have county-year cells

with zero teen births, our preferred approach uses a Poisson model.15 In particular, our main

results are based on estimating Poisson models of the following form:

                                                               4
                                                               X
           E[T BRct |CF P Ic,t    k , ↵c , ↵t , Xct ] = exp(         ✓k CF P Ic,t   k   + ↵c + ↵t + Xct )         (1)
                                                               k=1


where T BRct is the teen birth rate for county c in year t, CF P Ic,t                     k   is an indicator variable

that takes a value of one for Colorado counties k years after the CFPI began and zero otherwise,

↵c are county fixed e↵ects to control for any systematic di↵erences across counties, ↵t are year
  14
      We have also considered using a broader comparison group comprised of all US counties and a narrower
comparison group comprised of counties in states bordering Colorado. Neither appear to track the Colorado
counties as closely as our chosen comparison group prior to the intervention, suggesting that they are would
provide a less reliable counterfactual. We have also considered using Colorado counties without a Title X clinic
as the comparison group but, because these counties tend to be sparsely populated, such an approach yields
estimates that are too imprecise to be meaningful.
   15
      Like linear models, the Poisson model is not subject to the incidental parameters problem associated with
fixed e↵ects because they can be eliminated from the model. We relax the assumption of equality between the
conditional mean and variance by calculating sandwiched standard errors.



                                                       10
fixed e↵ects to control for shocks to teen birth rates that are common to all counties in a year,

and Xct can include time-varying county control variables (including state-specific trends). As

Poisson models are more typically thought of as considering counts and not rates, we note

that this model can alternatively be expressed as one that estimates the natural log of the

expected count of births while controlling for the population of teen females and constraining

its coefficient to be equal to one. We also estimate weighted least squares analogues to Equation

1 (adding one to the count of births for all county-year cells) and all analyses allow errors to be

correlated within counties over time when constructing standard-error estimates.

    There are two reasons why it is important for the model to allow the estimated e↵ects to

vary across years with a set of indicator variables as opposed to attempting to estimate the

average e↵ect across years with a single indicator variable. First, the nature of contraceptive

choice, sexual activity, and childbearing all would suggest that any e↵ect would be appear some

time after the program’s implementation even when we assign births to their year of conception.

In particular, the share of sexually active teens using LARCs is expected to increase over time

as they visit clinics and, more generally, become more aware of this option, which is evident

in figures 1 and 2. Moreover, teen sexual encounters are often irregular and sexual encounters

only lead to pregnancy with some probability.

    The second reason this approach is important is because we estimate models that include

state-specific linear trends to address concerns that di↵erences in the pre-existing trends be-

tween counties with Title X clinics in Colorado and counties with Title X clinics in other states

might bias estimates derived from Equation 1.16 As explained in Wolfers (2006), estimates of

such trends will be biased—as will the estimates of other parameters—when a model does not

fully account for time-varying treatment e↵ects. In plain terms, a time-varying treatment e↵ect

implies an e↵ect on trends, which in turn implies that including trends that are identified in part

by the post-treatment data would be “overcontrolling” (i.e., controlling for an endogenous vari-

able), which can lead to significant bias. This source of bias is not an issue if the post-treatment

observations do not contribute to the estimates of the trends, which can be accomplished by

allowing the estimated e↵ects to vary over time in a fully non-parametric fashion. In our case,

this entails allowing the e↵ect to vary across years. Nonetheless, we note that the estimated

e↵ects for each year are sometimes imprecise and, as a result, we may prefer to focus on their
   16
      We additionally estimate models including county-specific linear trends when considering weighted least
squares.

4.1      Main Results

    Before presenting model-based estimates, we first present a graphical analysis that corre-

sponds to our di↵erence-in-di↵erences identification strategy. In particular, Panel A of Figure 6

plots the simple average of teen birth rates across Colorado counties with Title X clinics, which

received funding from the CFPI, against the average teen birth rate across other US counties

with Title X clinics. Panel B is similar but weights counties by their teen female population.

Of particular note to the validity of our empirical approach, average birth rate for the Colorado

counties appears to track that of other US counties fairly well prior to the CFPI, supporting

the notion that the changes for the latter can provide a good counterfactual for the former.

That said, the teen birth rate trend for the Colorado counties is somewhat more negative than

that of the non-Colorado counties—particularly when considering the weighted average—which

suggests that it may be important to control for state trends in some specifications. Figure 6

also suggests that the teen birth rate across Colorado counties diverges from that of other US

counties following the CFPI, providing some initial evidence that the initiative had its intended

e↵ect of reducing teen birth rates. In the discussion of results below, we consider the statistical

significance of this apparent e↵ect and its magnitude under alternative modeling approaches.

    Table 3 presents estimates of the e↵ect of the initiative on teen birth rates based on the

Poisson model described by Equation 1. The estimated e↵ects from the baseline model (only

controlling for county and year fixed e↵ects) are shown in Column 1 while Column 2 shows

the estimated e↵ects from a model that additionally controls for economic and demographic

factors. Specifically, these controls include the county unemployment rate and the fraction of

teens of each age and race/ethnicity. These estimates indicate that the initiative reduced teen

birth rates by 4–6% in its first year and that the e↵ect grew to 16–17% by its third and fourth

years.

    The estimates shown in columns 3 and 4 address the possibility that the estimates from the

baseline model may be biased if Colorado counties with Title X clinics and other US counties

with Title X clinics di↵er in their pre-existing birth rate trends, which could be the case if, for

example, there are social factors a↵ecting birth rates di↵erentially across states and counties


                                                12
over time. In particular, the estimates in columns 3 and 4 are based on a model that addition-

ally includes state-specific linear trends, with and without economic and demographic control

variables, respectively. The estimates in these two columns are smaller than those in columns 1

and 2, reflecting that the birth rate trend for the Colorado counties was somewhat more nega-

tive than the trend for non-Colorado counties. Nonetheless, the estimates continue to indicate

that the initiative reduced teen birth rates after its first year—by 4% in its second year, 9% in

its third year, and 7% in its fourth year.

    That said, because the estimated e↵ects and their levels of statistical significance vary across

years, we suggest that they be interpreted with caution. Towards this end, Table 3 also reports

averages of the estimated e↵ects across years and p-values associated with tests that these aver-

ages are zero. For the richest specification (Column 4), the estimates imply that the initiative

reduced teen birth rates by 5% across four years (p-value = 0.039), or 7% across its second

through fourth years (p-value=0.019).

    As the CFPI was intended to help low-income women gain access to LARCs, one would

reasonably expect the e↵ects to be greatest in counties with a relatively large share of low-

income individuals. We investigate this by separately considering the e↵ects for counties with

poverty rates above the median of Colorado counties with Title X clinics and those with poverty

rates below this median.17 While this approach balances the number of Colorado counties

contributing to each estimate, we note that Colorado is a relatively low-poverty state and, thus,

that the median being used here (12.2%) is higher than the median across non-Colorado counties

with Title X clinics (15.6%).

    The results of this analysis are shown in Table 4, which presents estimates based on models

with state-specific linear trends—demonstrated to be important above—both with and without

economic and demographic controls. These estimates indicate that the initiative reduced teen

birth rates by 6–8% over four years in Colorado’s counties with poverty rates above its median

and, as before, that these e↵ects are concentrated in the second through fourth years of the

program. The estimated e↵ects for Colorado’s counties with lower poverty rates point in the

same direction, suggesting that the initiative reduced birth rates, but they are roughly half

as large as the estimates for higher poverty counties and are not statistically significant at

conventional levels.
  17
     We use each county’s poverty rate averaged across 2002–2012 so that this approach maintains a balanced
panel.

4.2    Results from Alternative Models

    In this section, we discuss the results from several alternative models, all of which continue

to control for county fixed e↵ects, year fixed e↵ects, economic and demographic controls, and

state-specific linear trends. We first focus on investigating the sensitivity of our main results

to the inclusion of leads and then consider least squares estimates as an alternative to Poisson-

based estimates.

    In Table 5 we show the results from Poisson models that additionally include indicator

variables for Colorado counties prior to the beginning of the initiative. We do so in order to

verify that the teen birth rate in the Colorado counties did not deviate from expected levels

relative to the teen birth rate in other US counties prior to the initiative, which would otherwise

cast doubt on the notion that they provide a good comparison group for our purposes. Indeed,

the coefficient estimates on the lead terms are routinely close to zero and are never statistically

significant whether focusing on all counties (Panel A), counties with poverty rates above the

Colorado median (Panel B), or counties with poverty rates below the Colorado median (Panel

C). Moreover, these results show that the estimated e↵ects of the initiative are robust to the

inclusion of these lead terms (though less precise), providing additional support for the validity

of the research design.

    We now turn to estimates of the e↵ect of the initiative using weighted least squares (WLS)

where each cell is weighted by the teen female population it represents. We note that this

approach requires an ad hoc solution to address the fact that the natural log of the teen birth

rate is undefined for county-year cells with zero teen births and that we address this issue by

adding one to the birth count in all cells.18 We also estimate specifications of the WLS model

that include county-specific linear trends in order to control for unobserved heterogeneity in a

more flexible manner.

    These WLS estimates are shown in Table 6. Specifically, the results in the odd columns are

based on the model that includes state-specific linear time trends and the results in the even

columns are based on the model that includes county-specific linear time trends. Columns 1

and 2 show results based on all counties while columns 3 and 4 show results based on counties

with poverty rates below the Colorado median and columns 5 and 6 show results based on
  18
     While it is usually useful to also present OLS estimates for comparison with WLS estimates, as described in
detail in Solon, Haider, and Wooldridge (2015), we believe that OLS is unreliable in our context because of the
weight it gives to small counties for which the outcome variable is disproportionally a↵ected any ad hoc solution
to addressing cells with zero births.

counties with poverty rates above the Colorado median. We take two main things away from

these results. First, the magnitude and precision of the estimates are una↵ected by the inclusion

of county-specific linear trends, which supports the validity our preferred approach that uses a

Poisson model and controls for state-specific linear trends but not county-specific linear trends.

Second, though the estimates are sometimes smaller in magnitude, they provide evidence in

support of the main results. In particular, they indicate that the initiative reduced birth rates

by 6% across its second through fourth years (compared to Poisson-based estimates of 7%).

And they indicate that the e↵ects are concentrated in counties with relatively high poverty

rates where the estimated e↵ects are 9–10% across the initiative’s second through fourth years

(virtually identical to the Poisson-based estimates). They also echo the earlier estimates which

suggested that there may have been smaller e↵ects in counties with lower poverty rates but, as

before, these estimates are not close to being statistically significant at conventional levels.



5        Conclusion

     This paper provides some groundwork for understanding how improving access to LARCs

can a↵ect birth rates of one of the highest at-risk groups for unintended pregnancy—teenagers—

by analyzing the first large-scale policy intervention to promote and improve access to LARCs in

the United States. Our estimates indicate that Colorado’s $23 million initiative, which began in

2009, significantly reduced teen birth rates. The magnitude of the estimated e↵ects imply that

the program prevented over 900 teen births that would have been conceived through 2012.19

While this amounts to approximately $25,000 per teen birth, it is important to keep in mind

that the $23 million investment was to fund the program from the beginning of 2009 through

June 2015 and that our analysis only spans through 2012 due to data availability. Moreover, the

initiative was intended to promote access to LARCs among low-income women in general and

not just teenagers. As such, in order to provide a more complete understanding of the e↵ects of

the program it will be important for future work to revisit its e↵ects once more data becomes

available and to consider the e↵ects on older women. It will also be important to consider the

e↵ects of expanding access to LARCs on sexual activity and reproductive health more generally.

In addition, we note that our results suggest that future work considering the e↵ects expanded
    19
     This number is based on the estimated e↵ect of 5% across 2009–2012, an average of 156,000 teen females
living in Colorado counties with Title X clinics over these years, and a birth rate of 30 per 1,000 teen females
during these years.




                                                      15
access to LARCs may provide useful insights into the e↵ects of unintended pregnancies (or the

prevention thereof) on long-run outcomes, such as educational attainment, earnings, and the

use of social assistance programs.

Notes: Estimates are based on annual data from 2002–2012 for 2,256 counties in Panel A, 1649 counties In Panel B, and
607 counties in Panel C. Births are assigned to the year of conception based on the mother’s reported last menstrual period.
The control for economic conditions is the county unemployment rate and demographic control variables include percent
of teens who are black, percent of teens who are Hispanic, the fraction of teens by age and race. Robust standard errors
clustered at the county level are shown in parentheses.
*, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the ten, five, and one percent levels, respectively.

Notes: Weighted least squares estimates—with cells weighted by the population of female teens—are based on annual data
from 2002–2012. The estimates in columns 1 and 2 are based on 2,256 counties, the estimates in columns 3 and 4 are
