                                         ABSTRACT

The analyses below compare the career histories and personal characteristics of the executives in

the top ranks of the world’s largest and most stable business operations, the Fortune 100, between

1980 and 2001. To our knowledge, there have been no prior studies of contemporary changes in the

experience or attributes of executives beyond CEOs. In 2001, these executives were younger, more

likely to be women, and less likely to have been Ivy League educated. Most important, they got to

the executive suite about four years faster than in 1980 and did so by holding fewer jobs on the way

to the top. (In particular, women in 2001 got to their executive jobs faster than their male

counterparts --there were no women executives in the Fortune 100 in 1980). Executives in 2001 also

spent about five years less in their current organization and were more likely to be hired from the

outside than in 1980. Interestingly, the most stable firms – the 26 that were in the Fortune 100 in

both periods – had just as much lifetime employment among executives in 2001 as in 1980, although

changes in other aspects of careers were similar. Overall, the path to the executive suite and the

attributes of the individuals who get there appear to have changed even in the largest and most stable

business operations.

Introduction:
Multinational corporations are among the most important economic actors in the world.
The largest of them have more economic assets than all but the biggest countries. They
are engines of cultural and economic change that can alter the economic fates of entire
nations. The people who control them, in turn, have arguably as much power and
influence as all but the highest-ranking government officials. Understanding who the y
are is therefore relevant to understanding the corporations and how they operate.


In addition to knowing the attributes of the people who run large corporations, it is also
important to understand the path that took them to these powerful positions. These paths
say a great deal about access to positions of influence, about social mobility generally,
and specifically about career development practices.


Research on these questions has a long history, especially in the U.S. where notions of
social mobility are central to national culture and values. Popular biographies of the
“robber baron” generation and its leading figures like John D. Rockefeller and Andrew
Carnegie reinforced the notion that individuals became business leaders through hard
work or, in the case of manufacturing leaders like Henry Ford and Thomas Edison,
inventive genius, typically overcoming hardships in the process. Arguably the first study
to examine this meritocratic thesis was Pitirim Sorokin’s 1924 study of millionaires in the
U.S.2 He compared an older generation of millionaires to the then current generation and
found that while about half of the former had come from middle or upper class
backgrounds, three quarters of the latter had done so. This suggested to him that society

was becoming less meritocratic and that it had become more difficult to work one’s way
up economic and class levels.


Carl S. Joslyn and Frank W. Taussig aimed their study of social mobility precisely at
business executives. 3 They studied the backgrounds of 7,371 executives drawn from the
ranks of corporate directors in the 1920s. While they found that the vast majority of
these executives had fathers who were also businessmen, and that this percentage actually
had grown over time, they also found that 11 percent had fathers who were laborers.
They focused on this finding and concluded that individuals with merit could work their
way to the top of the business community. Differences in the probability of advancement
by social class, the y argued, were the result of differences in merit and ability – the upper
class had more able people.


A number of studies followed the Joslyn and Taussig investigations in examining more
closely the origins of the business leadership in the U.S. William Miller looked into the
backgrounds of 190 of the most elite executives -- Presidents and Chairmen of Boards of
Directors of the largest companies in the most important industries – at the beginning of
the industrial age, from 1900-1910. 4 What was interesting about this group, and in
contrast to business leaders from earlier generations, is that most were professional
managers, not the founders or entrepreneurs who had started the businesses. Miller
concluded that half had come from upper class backgrounds and only 5 percent from
working or lower-class families. Frances Gregory and Irene Neu looked back even
further in time at the backgrounds of business leaders just before the beginnings of the
modern corporation in the 1880s. They found that most of the business leaders before the
turn of the last century had inherited money, which allowed them to invest in and then
become leaders of companies. 5 The meritocracy argument was no longer looking
credible.


A generation later, the notion of a corporate career with entry- level jobs and promotion
from within was more fully in place. Lloyd Warner and James Abbeglan attempted to

replicate and extend the Joslyn and Taussig study. They looked at the background and
careers of 8300 corporate executives in 1953 and found far fewer founders or
entrepreneurs in the ranks and relatively fewer members of the rich or idle class than had
the Joslyn and Taussig study. There was also a sharp decline compared to earlier studies
in the percentage of executives who had inherited their positions or who were in the same
firm as their fathers. What Warner and Abbeglan saw instead was something that looked,
at least relative to earlier periods, like an increase in more meritocratic arrangements. In
an era when about half of men did not even finish high school, they found that roughly
half of the executives of large companies they surveyed were college graduates (three
quarters had attended college), and 20 percent had gone on to graduate school. By far the
most common route to the top was to begin either in sales or as a clerk in the company
(34 percent of future executives). The next most common path began in production work
(14 percent). The most striking statistics, however, concerned the stability of their career
in the same company. The executives they surveyed averaged 54 years in age, they had
been in their current executive job seven years, and had spent 24 years in their current
firm, roughly half their life. Almost 50 percent had only worked at their current firm, and
26 percent had been an executive at only one other firm. 6


At roughly the same time, Mabel Newcomer undertook a systematic assessment of
changes in executive careers over time that focused on their experiences inside their
corporations. 7 She looked at the background and experience of the very top executives –
Presidents and Board Chairmen – for the largest companies in 1900, 1925, and 1950,
around 400 individuals in each period. This sample was more elite in terms of the
importance of their positions in the organization and the importance of their organizations
than earlier studies. Newcomer’s results reinforced the conclusion that top executives
were increasingly professional managers (as opposed to entrepreneurs or financiers) who
were promoted to the top from within the company where they began their career. The
extent to which these leaders held positions in companies where their father or close
relatives worked declined from 26 percent in 1900 to 16 percent in 1925 and then to 11
percent in 1950. In 1925, 30 percent had begun their careers as entrepreneurs. By 1950,

that figure was down to 10 percent. More important for the study here, half of these
leaders were hired from outside their corporations in 1900, but by 1950, only 20 percent
were outside hires. That number was substantially higher than the 50 percent estimate
that Warner and Abbeglen had found for all executives, suggesting that this more elite
population was more likely to have been developed from within than was a more typical
executive. In 1950, 47 percent of Newcomer’s sample retired in office, as opposed to
only 11 percent in 1900. Of those who retired in office, 40 percent had been with their
firm more than 40 years in 1950, in contrast to 21 percent in 1925 and only 5 percent in
1900.




In part as a result of the Newcomer study, ideas about what constituted a business career
changed. The dominant notion now was that a business career was an organizational
career, that is, it operated inside a corporation. William H. Whyte, an editor at Fortune
magazine, became arguably the best-known commentator on the rise of the new
organizational career with his famous book, The Organization Man. He cites a study by
the Booze-Allen consulting firm which asked what was seen at the time as a novel question:
why would executives ever leave their corporation? Its study of 422 executives who had left
their first employer found that they did so only if their corporation could not deliver on its
implicit promise of upward mobility. 8 A series of studies throughout the 1960s and 1970s
went on to map out the intricate details of how careers played out in practice, such as
Rosabeth Kanter’s famous account of in-breeding at the pseudonymous “Indisco”
corporation. 9 There were some hints through the 1970s that perhaps things were changing
for executive careers. 10 But for the most part, the question of whether executive careers
had changed in any fundamental way would not be questioned for more than a decade.

    A smaller survey of corporate Presidents from the American Management Association in the late 1970s
found that 38 percent had been outside hires, as opposed to only 20 percent in the Newcomer study
conducted a generation before. The authors concluded that “One can argue that there is a trend toward
selecting the professional manager from the outside as opposed to encouraging the internal succession route
to the top.”Gene F. Brady, Robert M. Fulmer, and Donald L. Helmich. Planning Executive Succession:

A New Era in the 1980s? A number of studies have argued that the early 1980s
represented a watershed moment for the U.S. economy and for corporations in particular.
The worst recession since the Great Depression in 1981 unleashed a massive wave of
corporate restructuring. The rise of deregulation and global competition, especially in
manufacturing and most prominently from Japan, greatly increased the pressure to
improve performance while the growing power of institutional investors and the
shareholder value move ment increased the demands to improve financial performance.
Together these forces were seen as continuing the wave of corporate restructuring, and
terms like “downsizing” and “reengineering” as well as record levels of mergers and
acquisitions became a continuous part of the business landscape. 11


In the 1990s, the issue of career paths once again became a topic of interest because of
concerns that downsizing was disrupting traditional patterns of advancement.
Specific ally, the apparent willingness to lay off white collar workers and managers broke
the old notions of lifetime job security. Growing problems with employee retention in
the 1990s suggested that employees were no longer interested in secure, lifetime careers,
and the anecdotal sense was that outside hiring for executives was becoming more
popular as a means of restructuring leadership, and organizations, more quickly. The
conceptual notion that careers should be thought of as spanning more than one
organization – “The Boundaryless Career” – became popular in organizational
psychology. 12 But empirical research on this question was virtually nonexistent. A flurry
of articles debated the issue of whether employee tenure was falling across the workforce
as a whole, 13 and there was some evidence that white collar and managerial job tenure
was declining faster than for the overall workforce. [Cite Kletzer, Farber, me .] Whether
internal labor markets and associated career paths were eroding was also a topic for

debate 14 . Especially for the executive ranks, however, there was little hard evidence one
way or the other on these issues.


The Present Study:
The issue motivating this study is the nature of executive careers and how they may have
changed in recent decades. Among the specific questions to consider is whether
individuals with different attributes are getting to the top now, replicating a question from
earlier studies. The more contemporary question is whether the path through which
executives have gotten to the top has changed. There are many different ways to
examine these questions, and they begin with the choice as to which sample of executives
to examine. The definition of executive jobs is not completely straightforward. For
example, how far down the organizational chart does one go before “executives” become
“managers”? How should one address the fact that organizational charts are not
consistent across companies and the titles used for executive positions differ? And how
should one compare equivalent job titles across companies of very different sizes – is a
Vice President of a small company an executive?


Earlier studies addressed these questions in two different ways. One was to sample
individuals, not jobs, by relying on published directories of executives or biographies of
leading business figures such as “Who’s Who.” The alternative approach was to base the
sample on specific job titles in existing corporations, the approach we use because it
makes it more likely that we are comparing individuals holding equivalent executives
positions over time: We know that they come from equivalent corporations, and we can
assess the job titles to ensure that the individuals we examine truly hold the appropriate
executive positions.


We collected information on the top executives from the Fortune 100 companies – the
100 largest companies in the world in terms of revenue – in 1980 and in 2001. We focus
on these 100 corporations precisely because they are the largest and most stable
corporations with the scale to manage internal employee development and career
programs. This sampling frame stacks the deck against finding change given that these

Vol. 42 No1. Fall 1999.

are the companies most likely to be able to persist in the traditional, organizational career
model. As a practical matter, limiting the study to 100 corporations also made the data
collection exercise more manageable. The year 1980 was chosen as being just before the
watershed recession of 1981 and providing a means of seeing whether the period since
then does indeed represent a breaking point in careers for executives. The year 2001 was
the one with the most recent, reliable data available when we began work on the project
in 2003.


We defined “top executives” as those business leaders with fundamental influence of
corporate-wide operations in these organizations, the people who truly direct the strategic
decisions of the companies. They include the very top positions - President, Chief
Executive Officer (CEO), and Chairman\Chairperson and Vice-Chair of the Board of
Directors. Often the same individual will hold more than one of these titles. Board
Chairs and Vice-Chairs do not have to be executives of that corporation, and we only
included those in our study who were. Next we included Chief Operating Officer,
Executive Vice Presidents (EVPs) and Senior VP’s. The executives in these jobs
typically head functional or operating areas of the corporation, and they sometimes have
more than one area under their responsibility (e.g., EVP for “administration,” which may
encompass human resources and facilities operation). Senior vice presidents (SVPs), the
next level down, hold similar positions in organizations that do not use the EVP title. In
companies that do have EVPs, the SVP job directs a single area or function. We also
included Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Technology Officer/Chief Information
Officer and other heads of specialty areas. Vice-Presidents and Group Presidents, who
typically head a division of the corporation, were the next level, and where operating
divisions are very large, Group Vice-Presidents may also have responsibility for
important strategic decisions.


Organizational charts differ widely across companies. As described below, some do not
use the EVP title, the use and position of “CIO/CTO” varies, others combine titles, etc.
The top group of executives across two similar companies may therefore have different
job titles. Because of this, it could be misleading to base the selection of top executives
strictly on a fixed set of job titles. Instead, our sampling decision was to examine the top
10 executives in each company in 1980 and 2001. In practice, this approach meant

                                              8
working down the organizational chart from the top job until we got to the 10th individual
in the hierarchy. Our sampling decision, therefore, did not attempt to compare executive
titles but instead relied on what we see as a simpler and more robust, nonparametric
approach of examining the top10 executives in each corporation.


The information we collected on each executive examines demographical attributes,
educational background, and career histories. Demographical attributes included the year
when the executive was born and the executive’s gender. Educational background
included the type of degrees that the executives earned (Bache lor’s, Master’s, Ph.D or
equivalent, as well as the field of the degree), the name of the educational institutions
from which the executives received their degree, and the year when they received it. We
examined each degree separately. For each degree granting educational institution, we
collected additional information on whether the institution is an Ivy League school,
whether it is a college or a university, and whether it is a public or private institution.
The Ivy League and public institution variables measure aspects of social elitism. Career
history-related information included data on executives’ entry- level jobs and on each
subsequent job up to the ir current executive position -- typically six to 12 different jobs.
For each job, we collected information regarding the year when the executive started that
position, the job title, and the name of the company where it was located. In some cases,
the name of the division or the function where the executive had the job was also
collected to help determine whether a “new” job was a lateral transfer or a promotion.


For the sample of 1980 Fortune 100 executives, we collected data from two printed
sources: the Dun & Bradstreet reference book of corporate managements (1980 volume,
Publisher: Dun & Bradstreet, Bethlehem, PA) and the Standard & Poor’s register of
corporations, directors and executives: United States and Canada (1980-1981 volume,
Publisher: Standard and Poor, New York). Both list the names of the top executives with
their title, and typically their educational background along with a brief biography. In
both directories, the most commonly listed titles include: the Chairman and the President,
the Vice-Chairmen (about 3 in number), the Executive VPs (about 4), the Senior VPs
(between 7 and 10), and the VPs (between 10 and 39). The two directories were not
always consistent in their information, however. The most common area of disagreement
concerned the number of senior vice presidents and executive vice presidents in a

                                             9
corporation. 15 For the sake of consistency, we used the Dun & Bradstreet directory and
resorted to the Standard & Poor’s directory only if information on the career history of
executives was missing from the Dun & Bradstreet directory.                       Data on entry- level
positions was especially likely to be missing, and we pursued a variety of print sources to
fill in the missing information, an issue we return to below.


The set of Fortune 100 executives for 2001 comes from two online and three printed
sources. The Hoover’s Online electronic database served as the main source of data for
2001 Fortune 100 executives. For each corporation, Hoover’s Online lists the holders of
the top executive positions (Chairperson, CEO, Vice-Chairmen, SVPs, EVPs, VPs and
board members) with their biographical information in text format. Unfortunately, this
source omits a great deal of career history information.                   We used the Lexis-Nexis
database to supplement missing biographical data on the executives. We also consulted
printed directories to fill in the gaps in career paths, including the Dun & Bradstreet
reference book of corporate managements (2001 volume, Publisher: Dun & Bradstreet,
Bethlehem, PA), the Standard & Poor’s register of corporations, directors and
executives: United States and Canada (2001 volume, Publisher: Standard and Poor, New
York) and Who’s Who in finance and industry (2002 volume, Publisher: Marquis group,
Chicago). As with the 1980 data, information on entry- level positions was the most likely
to be missing, especially so for executives who switched companies.


In practice, it was sometimes impossible to identify enough information on some
executives to include them in the data base. Skipping over these executives to take the
others further down the organizational chart would create a complicated bias because
corporations with more missing data would end up with more lower- level executives.
Comparisons across establishments would therefore be to different levels in the
organization. Our decision was to not sample further when not enough information was
available to include an executive, which meant that there were cases with fewer than 10
executives in the same corporation. Similarly, there were also many cases where the 10th
executive was one of several who held the same title in the orga nizational chart. For
example, the 10th executive may have been one of three who held the SVP title. Rather

  In the case of General Motors, for example, the Dun & Bradstreet directory lists four EVPs, while the
Standard & Poor’s directory lists three.

than making an arbitrary distinction as to which of these should be the 10th executive, we
included all of them.


The database that we constructed contains data on 1962 executives -- 802 executives
affiliated with Fortune 100 companies in 1980 and 1160 affiliated with Fortune 100
companies in 2001. The number is more than the expected 1000 in 2001 because of the
inclusion of multiple position ho lders as noted above. It is less than the expected 1,000
for the 1980 sample because of much greater incidence of incomplete information. We
consider the issue of an unbalanced sample below. Within the overall sample, it was still
the case that data on at least one variable was missing for about one-third of the
executives. The issue of missing data is potentially important, and we also examine it at
some length below.


Company Descriptions and Organizational Charts:
In addition to Fortune Magazine, which is the source for identifying the Fortune 100 in
1980 and 2001 16 , we collected information on the companies per se from Hoover’s
Online databases (for company age and 2001 financial data) and from the Compustat
database (for 1980 financial data). The information included the year when the company
was founded, the industry that the company belongs to, its total assets, total sales and net
income in 1980 and 2001, and its position in the Fortune 100 rankings.


Despite the fact that the Fortune 100 represents what one would think of as among the
most stable corporations in the world, there is considerable turnover in that list over time.
Only 26 of that select group from 1980 made it into the Fortune 100 in 2001. They are:
        Boeing                                                Caterpillar Tractor

Table 1 illustrates how the distribution of the Fortune 100 changed by industry over this
period. The changes by industry group are often dramatic -- the decline of the
manufacturing sectors (from 17.1 percent to 1.1 percent of the total) and the rise of
financial services (from zero to 16.9 percent) are especially striking. The change in the
composition of the Fortune 100 raises important issues concerning the source of any
changes in executive-related attributes and experience that are examined below.

The Fortune 100 companies differ across the two periods in other ways as well. As
Table 1A indicates, the companies in 2001 are significantly older, despite the apparent
turmoil in the economy since 1980. They are also significantly bigger in financial terms.
Total sales, for example, were more than four times greater. The differences in financial
size cannot be accounted for by inflation over this period, which totaled only 115 percent.
The average number of employees is also greater, albeit only by about 34 percent.
Overall, then, the Fortune 100 companies are substantially bigger in 2001 than in 1980.
(The final column in Table 1A indicates the significance level of any differences between
the 1980 and 2001 cohorts based on difference of means tests.) Other things equal, then,
one might assume that the executives in the 2001 sample held more important positions
because their organizations were so much larger than equivalent executives from the
1980 sample : An SVP from the 2001 sample may have greater responsibilities than an
EVP from the 1980 sample. Offsetting this conclusion is that fact noted above that there
are more missing observations in the 1980 sample. The missing observations were more
likely to be for lower- level executives than more senior ones as information was more
likely to be missing for lower- level executives. The 1980 executives, therefore, may on
balance represent slightly more senior positions within the ir companies than do the 2001
executives. But because the 2001 executives hold positions in more substantial
organizations, the two biases therefore work in opposite directions and may cancel out.

job position changed in the two periods. The biggest changes are the sharp declines in
the use of EVP titles and the stand-alone President title as well as big increases in the use
of the Group President title s and the emergence of the Chief Operating Office title. More
details of job titles are provided in the Appendix – Tables A-C offer details on the
distribution of executives by title, Tables D-G provide details on how that distribution
differs by industry in 1980 and 2001. Among the findings there is greater use of multiple
job titles in 2001 – 36.2 percent had these titles versus only 11.7 percent of all executives
in 1980 (see Table C).

Note: The number 2 or 3 following a title
indicates that the incumbent held that title
in addition to 2 or 3 others.

Another way to look at the distribution of titles that is arguably more revealing of
changes over time is to rank them based on their typical position in an organizational
chart. Not all companies have exactly the same hierarchy of titles (see Appendix for
representative corporate charts), but there is little debate that the three general tiers of

                                               14
executive titles reported in Table B of the Appendix do form a hierarchical relationship.
Interestingly, the percentage of individuals holding positions in the top third of executive
titles declined (1980: 27.6% vs. 2001: 22.6%) as it did for those in the middle tier (1980:
65.1% vs. 2001: 59.9%). But the distribution in the lower third expanded considerably
(1980:7% vs. 2001:18.5%), consistent with the notion of flatter hierarchies.


Changes in the Attributes and Experiences of Top Executives:
In the analyses below, we turn to attributes of the individuals who hold top executive
positions as well as aspects of their career experiences and how they have changed from
1980 to 2001. We examined the following variables:


Job Title and Promotions: In order to examine the career paths of these executives, we
identified the hierarchy of positions that a typical executive held over the course of their
career and organized those jobs into 13 different categories: 1. Non- managerial jobs; 2.
Assistant manager; 3. Manager; 4. General manager; 5. Assistant director; 6. Director; 7.
Assistant vice president; 8. Vice president; 9. Senior vice president; 10. Chief functional
officers (CFO, CTO); 11. COO; 12. Executive vice president; 13. President, Chairman,
CEO. In cases when an executive had two or three titles (e.g. President and CEO,
President and COO), the code for the higher-ranking title was used.


We look at the course of their careers (“Number of Positions”) as measured by the
number of positions they went through before becoming a top executive. We use the
numerical coding above to generate a simple calculation -- an absolute value difference
score -- of the size of an executive’s promotion (or in some cases demotion). A move
from Assistant Director (5) to Vice president (8), for example, receives a score of 3. This
is a nonparametric measure, and as such it may not accurately or even consistently reflect
the true increase in position across different points in a career (e.g., is the above move,
with a score of 3, truly equivalent to a move from Chief Functional Officer (10) to CEO
(13), which also gets a score of 3). There is no obviously preferable approach,
however. 17 We take the average of these promotions to generate an “Average Promotion
Size” measure. Calculating the size of a promotion compounds issues of measurement

17
  For example, one could generate scales for jobs based on responsibility, on skill requirements, on
compensation. Generating these hierarchies is the task of job evaluation systems in personnel psychology,
and there are limitless variations as to how it is done.
                                                   15
error because the estimate is the difference between two measures/titles, each of which
may be estimated with some error. It might therefore be reasonable to interpret this
measure with some caution.


Years of Education: The biographical data on executives, unlike standard survey data,
only reports degrees completed and not years of education received. For comparison
purposes, we follow conventions used elsewhere and translate these degrees into the
typical years of education associated with them -- a high school degree corresponded to
12 years of education, a Bachelor’s to 16, a Master’s to 18 and a PhD to 20.


Nature of Educational Institution: For each degree, we calculate whether the institution
from which the degree was earned was an elite, Ivy League school or a public institution.
(The omitted group is private, non-Ivy League institutions.)                    Ivy League educations,
especially at the undergraduate level, have historically been associated with elite social
backgrounds. 18


Tenure: We calculate two measures of tenure for these executives. The first is the
amount of time spent in their current organization – “Organizational Tenure.” The second
is based on tenure in each job they held during their career as measured by the year when
an executive started each new job subtracted from the year in which they started their
previous job. The “Average Job Tenure” represents the number of years that it took the
executive to get to their current position divided by the number of jobs that the executive
has held.


Lifetime Employees: We also report the percentage of executives who began their careers
at their current company and are still there at the point of data collection.


Time to Top: The “Time to top” measure represents for the number of years that it took
the executive to reach his or her top position beginning with the year when the executive




18
  There are only eight Ivy League schools – Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Penn,
Princeton, and Yale. Clearly there are other schools that historically have drawn from the socially elite as
well, but calculating exactly where that line of demarcation fell was even more arbitrary than the Ivy
League classification.
                                                     16
started his or her first job. 19 Time to the top differs from organizational tenure in that it
reflects an entire career, including time spent working in other organizations.



Analyzing what is “different” about these variables in 1980 versus 2001 is not completely

straight- forward as there are many aspects of statistical distributions that can be

compared across two periods. The most obvious and arguably most relevant here is

whether the mean values of the variables differ across the two periods, an assessment that

can be generated by simple difference of means tests. Mean values can be distorted by

outliers, however, and for that reason it is also useful to examine whether the median

values for these variables are different in the two periods. We use a median test, a special

case of Pearson’s chi-square test, to examine whether the median values from the two

periods are identical. Finally, we use         Kruskal-Wallis Test for K

Independent Samples

the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test to examine more broadly whether the distributions

of responses from the two periods are independent. This test combines observations from

the two periods, assigns them ranks,



and then calculates       , the average of the ranks of the observations in the ith sample. The



test statistic is then



and the null hypothesis that the distributions are the same is rejected if                             .




19
  Where dates for entry-level positions were missing, we estimated their years of work experience by
subtracting their years of education from their age.
                                                   17
In virtually all cases, the median and Kruscal-Wallis test results are similar to the

difference of mean tests and are therefore only reported where there are differences. The

Appendix reports the complete results for the analyses used most often, those for the full

sample.


We begin the analyses by comparing the demographic and human capital attributes of the

Fortune 100 executives in 1980 and 2001.

The results in Table 3 above suggest some striking differences between the characteristics
of executives in 1980 and 2001. (Significance levels for difference of means tests
between the two periods are reported in column three.) First, there are more women in
these executive positions in 2001 – not a difficult achieve ment given that the number was
zero in 1980. Eleven percent of the incumbents in these positions in 2001 are women
                                         18
who differ from their male counterparts in important ways (examined below). A more
surprising change is that the average top executive is considerably younger in 2001 –
more than four years younger than in 1980. 20              It is not immediately obvious why this
should be the case. Economic growth that might have pulled younger executives into the
top ranks, e.g., was not noticeably stronger during the career of the 2001 executives (from
roughly 1970 to 2000) than during the career of the 1980 executives (1950 to 1980). 21 We
return to this issue below.


Average years of education for top executives are significantly higher in 2001, roughly in
line with higher levels of education for the population as a whole over this period.
(Median years of education are not significantly different, however.) The more important
changes concern the type of institutions that these executives attended. In 1980, a full 14
percent of top executives in the Fortune 100 companies attended one of eight Ivy League
institutions for their undergraduate education. Only 32 percent attended public or state-
sponsored schools. Michael Useem and Jerome Karabel examined the educational
background of 3105 Fortune 500 executives in 1977 and found some roughly similar
results -- 11 percent had only a first degree from one of 10 elite, private institutions;
about 22 percent had a second, professional degree (MBA or Law degree) from one of
these institutions. They found that holding a bachelors degree from an elite institution
increased the odds on becoming CEO by 42 percent. 22 In 2001, in contrast, only 10
percent of the equivalent executives received undergraduate degrees from Ivy League
schools, and forty-eight percent attended public institutions. Another aspect of these
findings is that the percentage of executives who attended private, non-Ivy League
institutions (i.e., non-public and non-Ivy) therefore fell sharply across the two periods,
from 54 percent in 1980 to 42 percent in 2001.


20
   Given an average age in 1980 of 56, the 1980 executives would have been 22 – a typical graduation age -
- in 1946. But many of these executives would have had their education interrupted by service in World
War II, so it is quite likely that many attended college after the War, graduating closer to 1950. The 2001
executives with an average age of 52 would have graduated roughly in 1972. Some of these, but a much
smaller percentage than for the earlier cohort, would have served in the military during the Vietnam War.
Differences in the incidence of military experience may account for some of the age difference in the two
cohorts.
21
   Early retirement programs associated with downsizing and corporate restructuring might have created
more opportunities for younger executives, given that they tend to target older employees. But the jobs
examined here are the very top positions that are not the group typically targeted by early retirement
programs.

This change in educational background may reflect a difference in the characteristics of
the entry- level hires in each period: Although the pool of four- year college graduates
from which these corporations typically hired did not in fact shift toward public
institutions over this period, 23 on average, hiring practices may have shifted toward
public university graduates. The change in educational background may also reflect a
change in the attributes of those who were promoted after being hired: On average, Ivy
League graduates may have had a much higher rate of promotion in the earlier period. It
is impossible to tease out the answer from these data, 24 but it is reasonable to conclude
that the erosion in the importance of an elite alma mater and the shift toward public
institutions more generally was the result of changes in corporate practices and not
demographics.


Does the above finding indicate that corporations became less elitist and more open to
students from all levels of society in this period? The results for second degrees suggest
an even greater change. There is something of an increase in the proportion of second
degrees among these executives by 2001, and the decline in the percentage that came
from Ivy League institutions was much greater than for first degrees. (Most of these
degrees are MBA or law degrees, and there are only five Ivy League law schools and six
MBA programs. 25 )        A more accurate story about changing access to these top executive
jobs, therefore, might be as follows: In 1980, an Ivy League undergraduate education
played a central role as a gatekeeper to a Fortune 100 executive career.                          By 2001,
graduates from public institutions had greater access to executive positions, especially
those with advanced degrees. A simple explanation for the change, possibly a cynical
one as well concerning the role of elitism, is just that the Ivy League represented a
smaller share of the population of graduates over time, especially in the exploding area of
professional degrees where the scale of Ivy League programs was particularly small.


23
   In the 1950s, when the 1980 executives would have been hired, four-year graduates from public
institutions were equal to 34 percent of the graduates from private institutions. That figure rose only to 35
percent by 1970, when the 2001 executives would have been hired. See Table 243 “Degree Granting
Institutions by Control and Type of Institution,” Digest of Educational Statistics, National Center for
Educational Statistics: Washington, D.C. 2002.
24
   There are other possible explanations as well. The preferences of the students may have changed,, e.g.,
interest in corporate jobs disproportionately eroding in Ivy League institutions during the latter period.
25
   Princeton and Brown have neither a law school nor a business school. Dartmouth has a business school
but no law school.

Table 4 presents descriptive results for changes in career experiences over the two
periods. These measures could be especially sensitive to the missing data issues noted
earlier. To illustrate, because missing data was more common for entry level jobs, an
analysis that ignored these missing jobs could make it appear that executives made it to
the top more quickly. The missing information is also more likely to occur for those
executives who have moved across companies. Individuals that began careers elsewhere,
therefore, might appear to have advanced more quickly because information on their first
jobs was omitted. These issues matter for the 1980-2001 comparisons because missing
data was more common for the 1980 sample. We address these issues first by restricting
the analysis only to those executives for whom we have complete data.                One
complication with this approach is that it excludes disproportionately more executives
who switched companies. A second approach, therefore, is to use the full sample and
impute estimates for the missing data, typically the first job, by using the convention in
labor economics of estimating when first jobs began by subtracting years of education
from current age (the assumption is that careers began when one left school).

The results in Table 4 are revealing. There was a large and significant decline over this
period in the percentage of top executives who spent their entire career at the same
company – 12 percentage points in the sample with complete career data, falling
somewhat to eight points in the full sample. If, as noted earlier, more data is missing for
executives who switched companies, then eliminating observations with incomplete data
would tend to disproportionately eliminate executives who switched firms and account
for a higher estimate in the restricted sample.    Average tenure for these executives in
their current company, a related statistic, dropped between 1980 and 2001 by almost a
full five years. The average levels were higher in both 1980 and in 2001 for the restricted
sample, again presumably because missing data excluded more executives who switched
companies and therefore had lower tenure. But the size of the drop in tenure between the
two periods was nearly identical in the full sample to that in the restricted sample.
Differences in median tenure are even sharper, dropping by seven and a half years (see
Appendix).


The other important development in Table 4 concerns the nature of the path to the
executive suite. Average time to the top is less in 2001 than in 1980, a result that is
consistent with the younger age reported for executives in 2001. (The gap is smaller but
still significant for the restricted sample, and the levels are also lower for both periods.)
The reductions in time to the top do not necessarily lead to reductions in organizational
                                             22
tenure, however. Organizational tenure is considerably less than time to the top in both
periods as these executives apparently spent several years working in organizations other
than their current employer. It is clearly possible for individuals to get to executive jobs
sooner by spending less time working for these earlier employers while not reducing time
with their current employer, but in fact the opposite appears to be happening. The
declines in organizational tenure appear to be larger than the declines in time to the top.


The average amount of time the se executives spent in each position was not that different
in 2001 than it was in 1980 -- a little over four years -- although it was significantly
smaller in 2001 for the full sample. 26 (Significance levels were higher for both the
median and Kruskal Wallis tests.) The explanation for the more rapid promotion path of
executives in 2001 is that they held fewer jobs on their climb up the corporate ladder.
There were fewer stops along the way. And, as the data above indicate, the average size
of a promotion was therefore bigger. (Significance levels for the alternative tests were
lower here.) These results are consistent with the perception that corporate hierarchies are
flatter now such that the difference in responsibilities between positions at each level is
greater. 27 Moving at the same speed up a ladder with fewer steps means one gets to the
top faster.


An obvious question is whether executives get ahead faster by switching companies.
Does loyalty and stability in the form of a lifetime career in the same company slow
down advancement? Interestingly, the evidence for 1980, when the “Organization Man”
model of internal promotion appeared to still be firmly in place, suggests that the answer
was yes. Results from analyses available on request suggest that those executives who
changed companies in the 1980 cohort got to the top about a year quicker than did those
who remained with their first company, a statistically significant difference. Despite
spending significantly more time on average in each job they held, executives who
changed companies held fewer positions on their climb to the top and got there faster as
compared to those who were lifetime employees. The results for 2001, however, do not
find significant differences in time to the top for those who changed companies. Perhaps

26
   For observations where information on jobs was missing, the estimates were calculated only for those
jobs were information was available. An analysis of the number of jobs these executives had along the way
to the top could only be calculated reliably where information on entry-level jobs was available.
27
   See, e.g., Raghuram Rajan and Julie Wulf (2003), “The Flattening Firm: Evidence from Panel Data on
the Changing Nature of Corporate Hierarchies”, NBER working paper No. w9633. April, 2003.
                                                  23
the greater frequency of switching corporations in the more recent period has reduced the
relative advantage associated with doing so.


Finally, we compare the amount of time spent in each job that executives report in their
path to the top in 1980 and 2001. Executives vary in the number of jobs they held and, as
one would imagine, there are considerable differences in the titles of jobs that each
executive held. This makes it next to impossible to draw comparisons by job title. We
can, however, compare the amount of time executives in 1980 spent in their first job –
whatever its title – with the amount of time executives in 2001 spent in their first job, and
so on over the course of their careers. The differences in Chart 1 below are statistically
significant only for jobs 1-4 and job 12, but these results suggest that the 2001 pool of
executives spent slightly more time in their initial jobs, then sharply less time in their
fourth position (the modal title of which was “general manager”) before moving on. 28

The overall results presented above for 1980 seem reasonably consistent with those

  Again, it is important to remember that these results are not comparing identical jobs, only jobs based on
the order in which the executives held the,. The results are especially difficult to interpret for the higher
numbered jobs: Job #12, e.g., is always the current or “top” job for those who reported having held 12
jobs, but those executives who held fewer jobs in total would report that their current or top position was,
say, job # 9.

percent noted earlier for the proportion of executives who were lifetime employees ithe
1950s included lower- level executives from smaller companies, but it is only slightly less
than the figure here. The average age of the executives in 1980 – 56 – is quite close to
the Warner and Abbeglen estimate of 54 – again, the Fortune 100 executives were on
average more senior in level, and that may explain the small difference. More important,
average organizational tenure is very similar in their study (24 years) and in 1980 (23.69
in the restricted sample).      These results suggest that career patterns may have been
reasonably similar from the 1950s through 1980, suggesting that the post-1980 period
may well represent an important breaking point in corporate careers. A contemporary
study by Murphy and Zabonjnik of CEO turnover over this period found a similar
pattern. They found that the proportion of CEOs having been at the ir firm less than one
year grew only slightly from 15 percent in 1970 to 17 percent in 1980 but then rose
sharply to 25 percent by the 1990s. 29


Explanations for the Differences:
A first step in attempting to explain the above differences between the 1980 and 2001 top
executive cohorts is to ask to what extent they truly result from changes in corporate
employment practices over time or, alternatively, from spurious sources such as changes
in the type of companies that make up the Fortune 100. As noted earlier, we know from
Table 1 that the Fortune 100 in 2001 was made up of very different kinds of corporations
than in 1980. Perhaps the overall changes noted above simply result from the fact that
service industries have different practices than the manufacturing industries and were
much more prominent in the sample in 2001 than in 1980. In the language of
demographics, to what extent are the changes in outcomes that we observe truly the result
of “period effects” – something about the modern period that caused all executives in
large firms to have different attributes and experiences? Or was the change the result of
“cohort effects” – the type of firms in the Fortune 100 changed in 2001, and that change
drove the results described above.


We can begin to examine this question by restricting the analysis to the 26 companies
that were in the Fortune 100 in both 1980 and 2001. Any changes in the attributes and

experience of top executives in this restricted sample by definition result from changes in
practices within those companies over time. We can then compare those results to the
ones reported above for the entire sample (all Fortune 100 companies in 1980 vs. 2001).
The extent to which they are substantially similar suggests that the overall results
reported above are driven by period effects; the extent to which they are substantially
different suggests that the overall results are driven by cohort effects.

The considerably smaller sample size with these analyses no doubt contributes to the fact
that not all of the differences between the two periods are statistically significant, but the
results are broadly similar to those reported for the entire sample above. In particular, the
differences are in the same direction except for the striking result that the percentage of
executives who began their careers in the same company is marginally higher in 2001,
albeit not significantly so. Despite the fact that these companies did not appear to have
changed their practices with respect to outside hiring of executives, other aspects of their
career experience have changed, including getting to the top faster by holding fewer jobs.
These results confirm that executives even in the same companies had quite different
experiences over the 1980-2001 period. They lend support to the notion that cohort
effects – different kinds of firms populating the Fortune 100 – alone cannot be
responsible for the overall differences in attributes and experiences of Fortune 100
executives from 1980 to 2001.           But they do suggest that the increase in outside hiring of
executives in the overall sample could be attributed to a change in the corporations
making up the Fortune 100. 30


A related question is whether the change in practices described above -- more outside
hiring, shorter organizational tenure, faster promotions, younger executives, less elite
college hiring – represent new approaches to corporate operations that are more likely to
be characteristics of newer firms. 31 The Fortune 100 is clearly older on average in 2001
than it was in 1980, but it might be that the newer firms within the sample are driving the
overall results. If so, the results may represent a variation on the cohort effect theme:
Firms that started in the later part of the 20th Century will look and act differently than
those that started in the 19th century. And if new firms continue to take over, overall
corporate practices will shift in their direction. A finding that younger firms have
distinctive practices may also represent what demographers refer to as “age effects”:



30
   We also compared the attributes and experiences of executives in the 74 companies in 1980 that fell out
of the Fortune 100 in 2001 to the 74 that took their place. These results, available on request, effectively
replicate the results of the full sample.
31
   All Fortune 100 firms are big, but there is a small correlation between age and size in terms of sales --
.139. Younger firms may therefore be somewhat smaller. Whether the variation in size is relevant across
these huge firms is a question for speculation.
                                                     27
Young firms have different practices because such firms are young, and their practices
will change as they grow older.


The analyses below compare the attributes and experience of top executives in younger
firms to those in older firms. The young firm/old firm distinction is a general argument
that presumably is not specific to either 1980 or 2001, so the analyses examine the
differences between young and old firms for the pooled sample of Fortune 100 executives
in both periods. Few Fortune 100 firms in either period are truly young, and pooling the
two periods also has the advantage of producing a large enough sample to generate useful
variance. Determining where to divide the firms between “young” and “old” is not
straight- forward. Because so few Fortune 100 companies are truly new, setting the age
for “young” too low will lead to a sample that is too small to be useful. 32 We also want at
least some of the companies in the “young” group to have been around long enough so
that it is not a logical impossibility for their executives to have grown up in the
organization. Indeed, an interesting hypothesis is whether executives who begin their
careers with a start- up firm that makes it to the Fortune 100 may be more likely to remain
with that firm because of the opportunities it offers. Stock options, more significant in
smaller, fast- growing firms for example, may also hold such executives longer.


Table 6 reports a comparison of the attributes and experiences of Fortune 100 executives
who are in corporations that are less than 30 years old with those in corporations older
than 30 years. Younger firms have younger executives, perhaps not surprising, but no
more women than the older corporations. Aside from more public and fewer Ivy grads at
younger firms, the education differences are not significant. In terms of career
differences, the start- up hypothesis above has little support. Executives in younger firms
were far less likely to have begun their careers there, and their organizational tenure is
about half that for executives in older firms. Executives from younger companies get to
the top much faster apparently by having fewer steps in their promotion ladder. Although
they spend about the same amount of time in each job they hold as do executives in older
firms, they hold fewer jobs before being promoted into the executive ranks, which



32
  Fourteen of the 200 firms in this analysis are younger than 30 years, although some of them existed as
other entities before mergers and other transformations put them in the top 100. The youngest firm in the
Fortune 100 in 2001 was Cisco Systems at 17 years.
                                                    28
implies bigger promotions. This pattern is consistent with being in organizations that
have less hierarchy and fewer levels, as many believe is the case for younger firms.

Other analyses, available on request, compare the attributes and experiences of
executives across three corporate age categories; Fortune 100 firms younger than 20
years; firms from 20 to 70 years; and companies older than 70 years. There are few
differences in the human capital attributes between the executives in the young and mid-
aged companies, but there are important differences in career patterns : The younger
companies have significantly fewer executives who started at the current firm, they have
less tenure in the organization, and they move to the top more quickly. There are few
differences in career patterns between executives in the mid-age and older firms but
important differences in human capital: The mid-age firms have more women executives
and older executives who have less schooling. These results reinforce the notion that the
age of companies has an important influence on executive experiences and that it is the
youngest firms – presumably the fastest-growing as well -- that have the most externally-
oriented career experience.


Finally, we consider the fundamental manufacturing/service industry distinction. We
know that the service sector is different in many ways from manufacturing. Observers
sometimes see manufacturing firms as more bureaucratic and hierarchical, in part because
they have more functionally oriented departments. And we also know that there was a
significant shift in the Fortune 100 companies away from manufacturing and toward
service companies in the period 1980 to 2001. We compare the differences between the
attributes and experiences of executives in the service and manufacturing sectors in both
1980 and 2001. The results, available on request, indicate that, other than more public
university graduates in manufacturing, there are no significant differences in either the
attributes or career experiences between manufacturing and service executives in 1980.
In 2001, in contrast, there are many differences: Executives in the service sector are
younger, more likely to be women and to be Ivy League graduates. Most important, they
are much less likely to have started their career at the same company (41 percent for
services vs. 54 percent in manufacturing), and they spent four and a half fewer years in
their current organization. They also got to the top about two and a half years sooner
than their peers in manufacturing. The manufacturing/service distinction apparently was
irrelevant in understanding differences in executive experience in 1980 but has become
highly relevant in 2001.

Summary


While there has been considerable debate about whether internalized labor market
practices have eroded in recent years, aside from evidence about CEO turnover, there has
been relatively little inquiry into this question at the management level and essentially
none for executive- level positions. The analysis above focuses on the la rgest and
arguably most stable corporations in the world, organizations that one might reasonably
see as having the biggest investments in the traditional “Organization Man” model of
internally oriented careers. The results suggest important differences in the attributes and
experiences of top executives over the past 20 years. While the 1980 results seem
reasonably consistent with studies of executives from the 1950s, a generation earlier, the
results from 2001 are different in a number of ways. This lends support to the general
notion that the period since 1980 represents an important transition point for the economy
and employment in particular. Compared to 1980, executives in equivalent executive
positions are younger, more likely to be women, and more likely to be from public
institutions. Because it is difficult to attribute these developments to changes in the
underlying populations in the two periods, it seems much more reasonable to see them as
being related to changes in the way in which these large corporations operate. More
important, the nature of executive career paths has changed. Outside hiring is much more
common among top executive in 2001 than in 1980, tenure in one’s company is
significantly lower, and, perhaps most important, these executives got to the top faster by
holding fewer jobs. It is as if the ladder to the top held fewer rungs in 2001, consistent
with the evidence presented earlier of flatter organizational charts.


Overall, there may be something of a “is the glass half full or half empty” issue in
interpreting these results. Despite all the discussions about corporate job- hopping and an
open labor market for executives, one might say that almost half of these top executives
in 2001 were still in the company where they held their first job, and the average
executive had been there 15 years. There is clearly some stability in the careers of top
executives in 2001. On the other hand, these are the largest companies in the world with
the biggest internal labor markets and the strongest policies oriented around promotion
from within. If more than half their top executives now come from the outside, roughly



                                             31
half their careers have been spent elsewhere, 33 and both the percentage of lifetime careers
and average tenure are falling significantly, them something is clearly different about
how executive careers operate now. The “Organization Man” model has clearly eroded.


What explains these differences is less obvious, however. The 26 corporations that were
in the Fortune 100 in 1980 and 2001 also exhibited many of the changes in executive
attributes and experiences over this period. The fact that most of the attributes and
experiences of executives were different in the same firms over these two periods
suggests that the changes are likely to be systematic and widespread and not simply the
result of changes in the type of companies that made up the Fortune 100. The extent of
lifetime careers was no different among these firms in the two periods, however,
suggesting that the decline in lifetime careers that we see in the overall samples must be
due to the change in the composition of firms in the Fortune 100 between 1980 and 2001.


What characteristics of the sample of firms are driving this change and possibly
influencing others as well are not obvious, however. We know that younger firms get
executives to the top more quickly, presumably because of faster growth, and the way
they do so is by holding fewer jobs along the way than do executives in older firms.
Younger firms also do more outside hiring. But age differences do not explain the
overall difference in outcomes between 1980 and 2001. The shift from manufacturing to
the service sector would seem to be a promising place to look for an explanation of the
changes in executive experience between 1980 and 2001. But there are no differences in
the attributes and experiences of executives in manufacturing vs. service firms until 2001.
The nature of being an executive in manufacturing as compared to an executive in service
firms seems to have changed over this period.


Because there were no women in the sample in 1980, it is only possible to examine
gender issues within the 2001 sample. The manufacturing/service dis tinction is the only
significant predictor of gender differences from the above analyses, with women being
significantly more represented in the service sector. In additional analyses available on
request, we explored how the experiences of executive women in 2001 were different


33
 With an average age of 52, most of these executives have been working approximately 30 years.
Average tenure of about 15 years means roughly 15 years working elsewhere.

from their male counterparts. They were significantly younger (47 years vs. 52 for men),
less likely to have been a lifetime employee (32 percent vs. 47 percent), they spent less
time on average in each of their jobs (3.4 years vs. 4.0), and got to the executive ranks
much quicker (21 vs. 25 years) than did their male counterparts. The corporations in
which they are employed are not significantly different than average in terms of age or
size. Nor can this result be attributed to differences in the level of jobs held by women
executives. 34


The basic question asked at the beginning of this study, whether the attributes and career
experiences of Fortune 100 executives are different in 2001 than in 1980, seems to have
been answered with a clear “yes.” The most important concern in substantiating this
conclusion is the extent to which the executives examined in 1980 are truly similar to
those in 2001. The potential biases with the samples – more lower- level executives in
2001 but more important jobs associated with much larger corporations – seem to offset
each other. And analyses with and without missing data suggest reasonably similar
conclusions.


Efforts to generalize these results to other contexts are more complicated. The Fortune
100 corporations are clearly significant in their own right given their enormous size and
influence, and any differences in the nature of executive positions in them over time are
therefore relevant as well. In many ways, the choice of this sample – the largest, most
stable firms – seems to stack the deck in favor of not finding changes in attributes or
experiences. Organizational inertia and resistance to change should be expected to
reduce the incidence of differences, especially in the sub-sample of the same firms across

34
   When executives are grouped into five broad job titles, the same pattern of results applies with the
exception of CFO/CTO positions:

the two periods. If we see cha nges in these firms, then, there are good reasons for
thinking that changes may be even more likely in other corporations, which are smaller,
younger, and were less invested originally in the “Organizational Man” approach to
management.


Understanding why these changes have occurred is a considerably more complicated
question than simply assessing whether they have occurred. Doing so carefully would
require separate analyses for each issue – e.g., what factors drive changes in lifetime
employment, changes in educational patterns, etc. – with separate models and hypotheses
in each case. Answers to that question await further research.

in three sectors: manufacturing, services and agriculture (for the 1980 sample) in the two time periods. The tables show the percentage
distribution of each executive title in a given industry. Sector differences seem relatively modest, arguably greater in 2001 – the more
extensive use of EVPs in services and the greater use of Group Presidents in manufacturing are especially noticeable.
