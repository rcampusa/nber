                                            ABSTRACT

Scientists, Technology professionals, Engineers, and Mathematicians (STEM workers) are fundamental
inputs in scientific innovation and technological adoption, the main drivers of productivity growth
in the U.S. In this paper we identify the effect of STEM worker growth on the wages and employment
of college and non-college educated native workers in 219 U.S. cities from 1990 to 2010. In order
to identify a supply-driven and heterogeneous increase in STEM workers across U.S. cities, we use
the distribution of foreign-born STEM workers in 1980 and exploit the introduction and variation of
the H-1B visa program granting entry to foreign-born college educated (mainly STEM) workers. We
find that H-1B-driven increases in STEM workers in a city were associated with significant increases
in wages paid to college educated natives. Wage increases for non-college educated natives are smaller
but still significant. We do not find significant effects on employment. We also find that STEM workers
increased housing rents for college graduates, which eroded part of their wage gains. Together, these
results imply a significant effect of foreign STEM on total factor productivity growth in the average
US city between 1990 and 2010.

1       Introduction
Scientists, Technology professionals, Engineers, and Mathematicians (STEM workers) are
the main inputs in the creation and adoption of scientific and technological innovation. The
important role of STEM innovations in generating economic productivity and growth has
been recognized at least since Robert Solow’s (1957) seminal work. More recent growth
economists, including Zvi Griliches (1992) and Charles I. Jones (1995), have used measures
of Scientists and Engineers to identify the main Research & Development (R&D) contribution
to idea-production. Advances in STEM, therefore, appear to be important determinants of
sustained productivity growth.
    Two additional considerations related to ideas and productivity have attracted the at-
tention of economists recently. First, technological innovation during the past 30 years has
not increased the productivity of all workers equally. The development of new technologies —
especially Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) — significantly increased the
productivity and wages of college educated workers. They had a much smaller eﬀect on the
demand for non-college educated workers, which has remained rather stagnant.1
    Second, while technological and scientific knowledge is footloose and spreads across re-
gions and countries, STEM workers are less mobile. Tacit knowledge and face to face inter-
actions still make a diﬀerence in the speed at which new ideas are locally adopted. Several
studies (e.g. Moretti (2004a, 2004b), Iranzo and Peri (2009)) have shown the importance
of concentrations of college educated workers in spurring local productivity. Other studies
have shown the tendency of innovation- and idea- intensive industries to agglomerate (Ellison
and Glaeser (1999)) and for ideas to remain local and generate virtuous cycles of innovation
(Jaﬀe et al. (1993), Saxenian (2002)).2
    This paper sits at the intersection of these strands of the literature. We quantify the
long-run eﬀect of increases in STEM workers in U.S. cities on the employment and wages
of STEM, college educated, and non-college educated native workers. The challenge of
the exercise is to identify variation in the growth of STEM workers across U.S. cities that
is supply-driven and hence exogenous to other factors aﬀecting wages, employment, and
productivity changes. We do this by exploiting the introduction of the H-1B visa in 1990
and the diﬀerential eﬀect that these visas had in bringing foreign STEM workers to 219
U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs)3 from 1990 to 2010. We then combine a simple
production model with our estimated wage and employment eﬀects to infer the eﬀects of
STEM growth on changes in total factor productivity (TFP) and skill-biased productivity
(SBP) in U.S. cities.
    While the variation in STEM workers and foreign STEM workers across U.S. metropolitan
areas is likely endogenous to local productivity and employment growth, our identification
uses inflows of H-1B visa immigrants to capture more exogenous variation in STEM workers

(2006) among others.

     Recent books by Edward Glaeser (2011) and Enrico Moretti (2012) identify a city’s ability to innovate
and to continuously reinvent itself as the main engine of its growth.
   3
     The oﬃcial unit of analysis is the metropolitan statistical area. Throughout the text we use the terms
“city” and “metropolitan area” interchangeably.



                                                    2
across cities over time. The H-1B visa, introduced with the Immigration and Nationality
Act of 1990, allowed college educated specialty professional workers (mostly STEM workers)
to enter the country. The policy was national in scope but had diﬀerentiated local eﬀects.
Foreign STEM workers were unevenly distributed across U.S. cities before the inception of
the H-1B visa program. Because of migrant preferences and the availability of information
spread by ethnic networks, subsequent inflows of H-1B workers have been more concentrated
in areas with large pre-existing foreign STEM presence.
    Using the 1980 Census we measure foreign STEM workers as a share of employment
in each MSA. This share exhibits very large variation across metropolitan areas. Next,
we predict the number of new foreign STEM workers that would end up in each city by
allocating the H-1B visas to 14 foreign nationality groups in proportion to the city’s 1980
presence of foreign STEM workers of each nationality. This H-1B-driven imputation of future
foreign STEM is a good predictor of the actual increase of both foreign STEM and overall
STEM workers in a city over subsequent decades. We use this prediction as an instrument
for the actual growth of foreign STEM workers in order to obtain causal estimates of the
impact of STEM workers growth on wages and employment of native college and non-college
educated workers. This identification strategy is rooted in methods used by Altonji and
Card (1991) and Card (2001) to identify the wage eﬀect of immigrants. It is also closely
related to Kerr and Lincoln’s (2010) examination of the impact of foreign scientists on U.S.
patent applications.
    The 1980 distribution of foreign STEM and the overall inflow of H-1B workers over the
period 1990-2010 may be correlated with unobservable city-specific shocks that aﬀect em-
ployment and wage growth. Thus, we subject our instrumental variable strategy to tests
and falsification checks to reduce potential exclusion restriction violations. We check that
the initial (1980) distribution of other types of foreign-born workers (e.g. less educated and
manual workers), the initial industry-structure of the metropolitan area, and the subsequent
inflow of non-STEM immigrants do not predict growth in foreign STEM workers. We also
check that the trends of native outcomes prior to the inception of the H-1B program (1970-
1980) were not correlated with the H-1B-driven growth in STEM workers over the 1990-2010
period. Finally, we use a panel of 219 metropolitan areas over 1990-2010, and always adopt
a very demanding specification that includes both city and period fixed eﬀects. Our identifi-
cation relies on changes in growth rates of H-1B-driven STEM workers within metropolitan
areas over time.
    Our preferred specifications reveal that a rise in the growth of foreign STEM by one
percentage point of total employment increases growth in the wages of native college educated
workers by a statistically significant 7-8 percentage points. The same change had a smaller
but usually statistically significant eﬀect on the wages of native non-college educated workers
equal to 3-4 percentage points. No statistically significant eﬀects were found for the growth of
native employment. We also find that an increase in foreign STEM growth had a significantly
positive impact on growth in housing costs for college educated workers. The increased cost
in non-tradable services (housing) absorbed about half of the increase in the purchasing
power of college educated wages.
    Finally, we use a simple model of city-level production and the estimated wage and
employment eﬀects to calculate the eﬀect of STEM on total factor productivity (TFP) and
skill-biased productivity (SBP). We find that STEM workers have positive eﬀects on both

                                               3
TFP and SBP. Aggregating at the national level, inflows of foreign STEM workers may
explain between 30 and 50% of the aggregate productivity growth and 4 to 8% of the skill-
bias growth that took place in the U.S. between 1990 and 2010.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly presents the empirical
specification that we estimate. Section 3 describes the data on STEM workers and H-1B
visas, and how we construct the H-1B-driven growth of foreign STEM-workers. In section 4
we test and discuss the power and validity of the constructed H-1B-driven growth variable
as an instrument. Section 5 presents the basic empirical estimates of the eﬀect of an increase
in STEM workers on wages and employment of native U.S. workers, and also checks the
robustness of the estimates, and examines the impact on house rents. In Section 6 we
introduce a simple model and combine it with our estimated parameters to calculate the
impact of STEM on TFP and SBP across U.S. metropolitan areas. Section 7 concludes.


2       Empirical Framework
Our empirical analysis uses variation in foreign-born STEM workers across U.S. cities ()
and time-periods () to estimate their impact on wages, employment, and house rents for
native workers. We discuss identification and its challenges in Section 4, and we describe
how we use the estimated coeﬃcients to back-out productivity eﬀects in Section 6. The basic
specifications we estimate in Section (5) take the form,

                                       ∆  
                           =  +  +                   + 3 
                                                                              +                  (1)
                                                    
                    
    The variable           is the period-change in outcome  for the sub-group of natives
with skill  (where  includes STEM workers, college educated workers, and non-college
educated workers), standardized by the initial year outcome level. The outcomes of interest
are average weekly wages, employment, and housing rents (measured as average rent per
room) for each group. The term  captures period fixed eﬀects, while  captures city fixed
                                 
                      ∆ 
eﬀects. The variable         
                                         is the change of foreign STEM over a period, standardized
by the initial total employment in the city ( ). The term        includes other city-
specific controls, and  is a zero-mean idiosyncratic random error. Given this design, we
emphasize that identification relies on variation in the growth of foreign STEM workers
within cities over time-periods.
    We focus our analysis on the period 1990-2010 and choose to partition these two decades
into three specific time-periods: 1990-2000, 2000-2005, and 2005-2010. This enables us to
take advantage of large variation in national H-1B policy that occurred during the 2000-2005
period relative to the other two. Additionally, as a robustness check, one can abstract from
the Great Recession period by removing 2005-2010 from the analysis.4
    The coeﬃcient  , captures the elasticity of outcome for worker group  to an exoge-
nous increase in STEM workers. Interpreting these coeﬃcient estimates as causal requires

   Though not reported, estimates are robust to removing the Great Recession period. Similarly, they
remain robust when constructing variables over 1990-2000, and 2000-2010. These are available upon request.

determinants of city-level wage and employment changes. Before turning attention to this
challenge, we introduce our data and measures of STEM workers (section 3) and describe
the construction of the H-1B-driven Foreign STEM variable and its power as an instrument
(section 4).


3       Data: STEM Workers in U.S. Cities
We develop two separate methods of defining STEM occupations. Each method also uses
both a more inclusive and a more stringent STEM identification criterion, resulting in four
possible STEM definitions. The first method is based on skills that workers use in their
occupations. We use the O*NET database (Bureau of Labor Statistics), which associates to
each occupation the importance of several dozen skills required to perform the job. We se-
lect four O*NET skills that involve STEM use — namely, “Mathematics in Problem Solving,”
“Science in Problem Solving,” “Technology Design,” and “Programming.” We then compute
the average score of each occupation across the four skills and rank the 331 occupations5
consistently identified in the Census 1980-2010 according to the average STEM skill value
defined above. We classify STEM occupations as those employing the top 4% (strict defini-
tion) or 8% (broad definition) of workers in that ranking in the year 2010. O*NET 4% (or
8%) STEM workers are the individuals with these occupations.
    Our second method for identifying STEM occupations is based on the skills workers
possess before employment — namely, the college majors found among workers within oc-
cupations. The U.S. State Department recognizes a list of college majors as STEM for the
purpose of granting foreign students extended time to work under the Optional Practical
Training (OPT) program.6 We rank occupations based on the percentage, in the 2010 ACS,
of individuals with a college degree in a STEM major. We then classify STEM occupations
as those employing the top 4% (strict) or 8% (broad) of workers following that ranking in
the year 2010. Major-based 4% (or 8%) STEM workers are the individuals within those
occupations. Both the O*NET and Major-based strict definitions include mainly Census
occupations with “scientist” or “engineer” in the title. The Major-based STEM occupations
largely coincide with the O*NET STEM occupations.7

3.1     Policy changes to the H-1B Visa Program
The main goal of this paper is to identify the eﬀect of STEM workers on the wages and
employment of college educated and non-college educated workers across U.S. cities in the
long-run. The ideal experiment would consist of randomly adding diﬀerent numbers of STEM
workers across U.S. cities and then observing the evolution of native wages and employment.
As we cannot run such an experiment, we use shifts in national H-1B visa policy, introduced
    5
     We make small refinements to the Census Occupational Classification in order to ensure complete time-
consistency in the availability of occupations over the 1980-2010 period. A detailed description of both of
our STEM definitions, as well as the refinement of occupations is available in the Online Appendix.
   6
     There is no direct cross-walk between majors/fields listed under the OPT STEM classification and
majors/fields as classified under the 2010 ACS. Thus our list is consistent with, but not exactly identical to,
the OPT STEM degree fields.

in 1990, as an exogenous source of variation in the inflow of foreign STEM workers across
U.S. cities.
    The H-1B visa, introduced in 1990, provides temporary permits8 for college educated
foreign “specialty” workers. Since 1990 the H-1B visa has been a crucial channel of admission
for many college educated foreign-born workers, largely employed in STEM occupations.9
Our analysis exploits large policy-induced fluctuations in the size of the H-1B program over
the 1990-2010 period.
    Figure 1 shows the maximum number of H-1B visas authorized per year (cap) and the
actual number of H-1B visas issued for each year between 1990 and 2010. Set initially at
65,000 H-1B visas annually, the cap rose to 115,000 for fiscal years 1999 and 2000, and then
to 195,000 per year for 2001, 2002, and 2003. It reverted back to the original 65,000 per year
beginning in 2004. Though the limit oﬃcially remains at 65,000, the first 20,000 H-1B visas
issued annually to individuals who have obtained a master’s (or higher education) degree in
the U.S. became exempt from H-1B limits beginning in 2005, eﬀectively raising the cap to
85,000.10
    Not only has the size of the H-1B program varied greatly since its inception, but the ensu-
ing inflow of foreign STEM workers has been heterogeneously distributed across U.S. cities as
well. Certainly part of these cross-city diﬀerences were due to varying economic conditions,
industrial structures and labor demand that likely influenced native wage and employment
growth. Importantly, however, a portion of this variation was also due to persistent immi-
grant preferences to locate in cities with historical communities of past immigration. The
1980 distribution of STEM workers by nationality proxies for these persistent historical set-
tlements.
    Our analysis needs to capture only the heterogeneity in foreign STEM created by this
diﬀerential initial presence (in 1980) of foreign enclaves by nationality, that are exogenous
to other determinants of future wage and employment growth of natives in cities. To do this
we construct an H-1B driven instrument which retains only the portion of growth in foreign
STEM that was due to national policy fluctuations and removes city-specific factors that
may have attracted both foreign STEM and native workers alike. Additionally, we use fixed
eﬀects to control for city-specific pre-determined characteristics, such as the industrial and
economic structure. We also construct variables that control for future city-shocks. In the
following two sections we define the variables in detail, show the importance of H-1B visa
entries in determining the net growth of foreign STEM workers, and test the validity of the
identifying assumptions, crucial for our approach.
   8
     H-1B have a the duration of three years, renewable up to 6, and they give the possibility of applying for
permanent residence.
   9
     Lowell (2000) notes that 70% of H-1B visas have been awarded to people employed as Computer Analysts,
Programmers, Electrical Engineers, University Professors, Accountants, Other Engineers, and Architects.
Similarly, Citizenship and Immigration Services (2009) reports that for all years between 2004 and 2011,
more than 85% of new H-1B visa holders work in Computer, Health Science, Accounting, Architecture,
Engineering, and Mathematics related occupations.

and Sparber (2013).

3.2       The H-1B-Driven Increase in STEM
Our data on occupations, employment, wages, age, and education of individuals comes from
the IPUMS 5% Census files for 1980, 1990, and 2000, the 1% American Community Survey
(ACS) sample for 2005, and the 2008-2010 3% merged ACS sample for 2010.11 We only use
data on 219 metropolitan areas that can be consistently identified over the period 1980-2010.
These span the range of U.S. metropolitan sizes, including all the largest cities in the U.S.
(Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Dallas-Forth Worth, Philadelphia and Houston are the six
largest) down to MSAs with close to 200,000 people (Danville, VA, Decatur, IL, Sharon, PA,
Waterbury, CT, Muncie, IN and Alexandria, PA are the six smallest). Data on aggregate
H-1B flows by nationality and year is publicly available from the Department of State (2011).
    We construct a variable which we call the “H-1B-driven increase in STEM workers” in
each of 219 U.S. metropolitan areas between 1990 and 2010. This variable captures supply-
driven variation in the growth of foreign STEM workers, and we use it as an instrumental
variable to estimate variants of equation (1). To create this instrument, we first impute the

   13
      We choose 1980 as the base year in the imputation of foreign STEM for three reasons. First, it is the
earliest Census that allows the identification of 219 metropolitan areas. Second, it occurs well before the
creation of the H-1B visa and hence does not reflect the distribution of foreign STEM workers aﬀected by
the policy. Third, it pre-dates most of the ICT revolution so that the distribution of STEM workers was
hardly aﬀected by the geographic location of the computer and software industries.

    Our identification strategy is closely related to the one used by Altonji and Card (1991)
and Card (2001), who exploit the initial distribution of foreign workers across U.S. cities. Our
approach diﬀers from theirs in that our strategy is based on the initial distribution of foreign
STEM workers across cities rather than all immigrants. In this regard, our methodology is
more similar to Kerr and Lincoln’s (2010) examination of foreign scientists and engineers
and the impact of H-1B flows on innovation. Our approach diﬀers from theirs by using the
foreign STEM presence in a city in 1980 (rather than in 1990), and by further distinguishing
immigrant presence by nationality (rather than the aggregate foreign STEM presence). We
also use a more demanding panel approach that measures variables in growth rates (first
diﬀerences) while including both city and time-period eﬀects.
    Our modeling choices aim to reduce the risk of correlation between the instrument and
unobserved determinants of wage and employment growth. To further bolster its validity,
we subject our instruments to a series of robustness checks. The possibility that the initial
(1980) distribution of foreign STEM is correlated with other shocks may introduce omitted
variable bias. The risk that aggregate inflows of H-1B workers may have been driven by a few
specific cities raises endogeneity concerns. The presence of measurement error, more likely in
cities with small populations, could result in attenuation bias for our estimates. We discuss
and address each of these concerns in Section 4. In the next section we describe summary
statistics that illustrate the significant foreign-born presence among STEM workers in the
U.S. and the numbers of the H-1B program.

3.3     Summary Statistics for Foreign STEM in U.S. Cities
A cursory look at the data shows that foreign-born individuals are particularly over-represented
among STEM occupations and that they have contributed substantially to the aggregate
growth of STEM jobs in the U.S.16 Table 1 shows the foreign-born share of five diﬀerent
employment groups for years 1980, 1990, 2000, 2005, and 2010. From left to right we show
the percentage of foreign-born in total employment (column (1)), among college educated
workers (column (2)), among college educated workers in MSAs (column (3)), among STEM
  15
    To avoid endogenous changes in total employment at the city level we also impute city employment by
augmenting employment by nativity and skill level in 1980 by the corresponding growth factor in national
total employment. Hence, d =               
                                    1980 ∗ ( 1980 ), where  = native college educated workers, native
non-college educated workers, foreign college educated workers, and foreign non-college educated workers.

    In the summary statistics and in the empirical analysis we mainly use the O*NET 4% STEM definition,
unless we note otherwise.

occupations in MSAs (column (4)), and among college educated STEM workers in MSAs (col-
umn (5)). While foreign-born individuals represented about 16% of total U.S. employment
in 2010, they counted for almost 30% of college educated STEM workers in the metropolitan
sample that we analyze. Also, this percentage has more than doubled since 1980.
    Table 2 shows that college educated STEM workers have increased from 2.1% of total
employment in 1980 to 3.7% in 2010. The share of college educated foreign STEM workers
has grown from 0.3% to 1.1%. Of the 0.81 points increase in college educated STEM as a
percentage of employment, between 1990 and 2010, 0.65 percentage points (four fifths of the
total) was due to foreigners.
    Table 3 shows absolute numbers (in thousands) suggesting that the H-1B program was
large enough to drive all or most of the increase in foreign STEM workers. Column (1) reports
the net total increase in college educated STEM workers in the U.S. over three decades, and
column (2) displays the increase in college educated foreign STEM workers. While before
1990 only one fifth of the net increase in STEM workers was driven by foreigners, in the 1990s
and 2000s between half and 90% of the net STEM growth came from foreigners. Column
(3) of Table 3 shows the cumulative number of H-1B visas issued during the corresponding
decade.
    It is clear that in the 1990s H-1B visas were enough to cover the whole growth in college
educated foreign STEM workers in the U.S., even accounting for some returnees. Even more
remarkably, H-1B issuances were three to four times as large as the net increase in college
educated STEM between 2000-2005 and 2005-2010. This implies that many foreign STEM
workers, including H-1B recipients, must have left the U.S.17 Overall, the figures presented
emphasize the importance of foreigners for STEM jobs in the U.S. The overall size of the
H-1B program was large enough to contribute substantially to the foreign STEM job growth
between 1990 and 2010.


4      Identification: Power and Validity of the Instruments
Our identification strategy relies on the H-1B supply-driven instrument whose validity is
based on the assumption that the employment share of foreign STEM workers in 1980 varied
across cities due to factors related to the persistent agglomeration of foreign communities
in some localities. These historical diﬀerences — after controlling for an array of other city
characteristics and other shocks — aﬀected the change in the supply of foreign STEM workers
but were not correlated with omitted shocks that aﬀected the growth of native wages and
employment in those cities.
    We provide empirical tests of our instrument’s validity in this section to address several
challenges to our identification strategy raised by the presence of unobservable shocks poten-
tially correlated with our instrument that aﬀect native outcomes. The framework to discuss
these issues is the first stage regression of the explanatory variable of our analysis on our
instrument:
  17
     Depew, Norlander, and Sorensen (2013) provide a detailed analysis of quit and return rates for temporary
skilled employees of six large Indian ICT firms. Twenty-nine percent of their sample returned to India during
the course of the survey period (2003-2011).

    The coeﬃcient  measures the impact of H-1B-driven STEM inflows (our instrument)
on the U.S. Census-measured increase in foreign STEM workers (the explanatory variable in
regression equation (1)). This coeﬃcient and its power are the main objects of interest in
the first stage regressions. The term  captures period fixed eﬀects, and  represents 219
MSA fixed eﬀects. We include the years  = 1990, 2000, 2005, and 2010 so that the changes
refer to the periods 1990-2000, 2000-2005, and 2005-2010.  is a zero-mean random error
uncorrelated with the explanatory variable.
    We tackle several threats to the identification assumptions and begin by showing that
the presence of foreign STEM workers in metropolitan areas as of 1980 did not always mirror
the presence of native STEM workers. Table 4 shows the estimated coeﬃcient () and the
partial F-statistic from the first stage regressions (equation 4). The coeﬃcients reported in
the first and the second row are the  and the F-statistics of the instrument when using the
O*NET 4% definition of STEM for both the endogenous variable and the instrument. Those
in the third and fourth row are the corresponding statistics when using the Major-based 4%
definition of STEM. The diﬀerent columns represent diﬀerent specifications.
    Column (1) includes period eﬀects, state eﬀects, and the 1980 employment share of
native STEM. Under this specification the imputed H-1B-driven growth of STEM has a
highly significant impact on foreign STEM growth. This implies that even controlling for
the initial native STEM share the foreign STEM share (used to construct the H-1B imputed
STEM growth) has significant explanatory power.18

4.1     Basic Specifications and Checks
In column (2) of Table 4 we introduce MSA fixed eﬀects to control for all other initial city-
specific conditions, so that our identification relies only on deviations in MSA growth rates
from MSA specific trends. We include these in all subsequent specifications. The top two
rows of column (2) show the results obtained using the O*NET 4% definition of STEM for
the endogenous variable and for the instrument. The following two rows use the Major-
based 4% definition for the endogenous variable and for the instrument. Column (3) uses
the broader 8% definition of STEM both for the endogenous variable and for the instrument,
with the O*NET definition used in the top two rows and the Major-based definition used in
the bottom two rows. The power of the instrument in these specifications is stronger (and
close to or above 10) than in column (1), emphasizing that our H-1B-based instrument is
good at capturing changes in the inflow of STEM workers within cities over time. Moreover,
  18
     One reason for the power of foreign STEM after controlling for native STEM is that cities with large
native STEM shares in 1980 were associated with traditional sectors that attracted Scientists and Engineers
in the 1970s but did not predict the presence of information technology and computer sector that dominated
R&D in the 1990s and 2000s. For instance Richland-Kennewick-Pasco, WA was the site of an important
nuclear and military production facility in the 1970s; Melbourne-Titusville-Cocoa-Palm Bay, FL had an
important aerospace center; Rochester, NY had a very developed oﬃce machine industry (Xerox, Kodak).
They were all top native STEM but not high foreign STEM cities.



                                                    10
while some small diﬀerences exist we find that the two definitions of STEM produce similar
results.
    Columns (4) and (5) of Table 4 address two important concerns. The first is that the
correlation between the instrument and the actual change in foreign STEM could be driven
by the large high-tech boom in a few large MSAs, rather than by the exogenous initial dis-
tribution of immigrants. If large metropolitan areas drove most of the country’s R&D and
produced a large increase in demand for foreign H-1B visas and STEM workers, the instru-
ment and the endogenous variable for those large R&D intensive cities could be spuriously
correlated.
    Alternatively, the presence of a few particular industries (e.g., ICT sector) might have
attracted particular types of immigrants whose growth simply proxies for the success of
those industries. The current population of foreign STEM workers from India is strongly
associated with information technology as most of them are employed in computer, software,
and electrical engineering occupations. Moreover, Indians have always accounted for at least
40% of H-1B visas.
    Column (4) excludes the five metro areas with the largest number of STEM workers in
1980.19 Column (5) excludes Indian STEM workers from the calculations of both the actual
change and the instrument. The coeﬃcients are still highly significant (although somewhat
reduced in column (4) for O*NET STEM), emphasizing that the correlation between H-1B-
driven STEM growth and a city’s actual foreign STEM growth is not driven by top STEM
cities or by a specific nationality group.
    An alternative way to check that the predictive power of our instrument is not driven by
individual nationality groups, whose specific location preferences may be aﬀected by some
industries, is to remove the nationality dimension from the instrument. We construct an
instrument similar to the one used by Kerr and Lincoln (2010), by aggregating H-1B visas
across nationalities and only exploiting variation in the aggregate number of visas over time,
interacted with the initial overall presence of foreign STEM workers. We interact aggregate
H-1B visa growth with the 1980 foreign STEM share distribution across cities. First stage
results using this instrument are shown in column (6). The estimates remain similar and
F-statistics confirm that the instrument maintains its power.
    In column (7) we account for another potential weakness of our instrument. The use of 1
to 5% population samples may introduce measurement error in our variables. Aydemir and
Borjas (2011) show how measurement error may produce attenuation bias when estimating
the causal eﬀect of immigrants on native outcomes. Because of small sample size, it is likely
that these cities may actually have small foreign STEM communities that are not captured
in Census sampling. In order to see how this measurement error may aﬀect the power of
our instrument column (7) shows the first stage estimates when eliminating all metropolitan
areas with fewer than 400,000 people. This cut-oﬀ eliminates all cities from our sample that
have a measured zero foreign STEM (or imputed foreign STEM) employment share.
    Although we only retain 118 of the 219 cities, the coeﬃcient estimates remain significant
and stable, while the instrument is still reasonably powerful—F-statistics are around 9 for the
Major-based STEM definition and well above 10 for the O*NET STEM definition. While we
  19
   These are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Jose, San Francisco. Together they account for 24% of
STEM workers in our sample.

will discuss the potential impact of measurement error on attenuation bias when presenting
the second stage estimates (In Table 6), it is reassuring to notice that the exclusion of
the cities where measurement error may be larger does not aﬀect much the power of the
instrument and the first-stage estimate of the coeﬃcient.

4.2     Confounding Shocks
Two types of shocks at the MSA level might be correlated with the inflow of STEM workers
(and possibly with the instrument) and aﬀect native wages and employment, thereby creating
omitted variable bias. The first is a change in the skill distribution of workers related to
the inflow of other (non-STEM) immigrants.20 The second is an industry-driven change in
productivity that would aﬀect native employment and wages. Including those shocks directly
as controls would introduce endogeneity in regression (1). Instead, we include their predicted
values, formed by interacting the 1980 immigrant and industry distribution with national
immigrant and industry shocks, respectively.
    As STEM immigrants usually possess a college degree, we introduce a control for the
imputed number of non-college educated immigrants (   \  ) based on the distribu-
                                                                 

    In column (8) of Table 4 we add the imputed growth of non-college educated immigrants
to the basic first stage regression (column (2)). Cities with large communities of less educated
immigrants may also have large communities of highly educated immigrants, although usually
from diﬀerent nationalities. Controlling for these flows will also be important to account for
complementarity between college and non-college educated workers and their possible eﬀect
on wages in the second stage regressions. The results from column (8) show that the imputed
H-1B driven instrument maintains its power when controlling for the imputed number of
non-college educated immigrants.
    To control for the second type of shock — those driven by a city’s industrial structure
— we construct four variables that predict the growth of wages and employment of college
and non-college educated workers in a city based upon its 1980 industrial composition. We
use a three-digit industry classification from the census, which, after small refinements for
time-consistency, provides a very detailed break-down of the productive structure of cities
into the 212 industries/sectors that comprise them.21
  20
     A change in the skill distribution of natives can also confound the estimates, although it is likely less
correlated with 1980 the presence of immigrants. In Table 6, row (i) we include a control for the imputed

    These two variables measure the average wage and employment growth at the sector
level weighted by the share of employment in each sector in the city in 1980. They proxy
for the sector-driven changes in demand (wage and employment) in city  based on a very
detailed level breakdown of its 1980 industrial composition. These imputed variables are
also commonly known as Bartik instruments (from Bartik (1991)).
    Column (9) augments the specification shown in column (8) by also adding the employ-
ment and the wage Bartik instruments for college educated. The results show that including
the Bartik instruments still leaves the H-1B imputed STEM growth instrument with sig-
nificant, albeit somewhat reduced, explanatory power, especially when using the O*NET
definition.

4.3     Falsification and Extensions
Our instrument is predicated on two assumptions. First, the H-1B visa policy significantly
and exogenously (from the perspective of each metropolitan area) aﬀected the inflow of
foreign STEM workers in the U.S. over the period 1990-2010. Second, the initial distribution
of foreign STEM was crucial in determining the subsequent inflow of H-1B immigrants and
was not correlated with other city-level shocks that aﬀected native wages and employment.
Columns (1)-(4) of Table 5 present some tests of these assumptions.
    The aggregate inflow of H-1B workers in the U.S. could simply be a proxy for strong ag-
gregate labor demand growth. This strong demand growth, possibly originating in particular
cities or attracting particular nationality of immigrants, may produce a positive correlation
between the instrument and the explanatory variable, in spite of the presence of city and
period eﬀects. If this was the case, then one could substitute the non-H1-B immigrant flow
(or the non-college educated immigrant flow) for the H-1B flow when constructing the instru-
mental variable and still produce a significant positive first stage correlation. Columns (1)
and (2) show that this is not the case by testing the power of such a "falsified" instrument.
and Motels,” and “Legal Services” are considered individual sectors. See the online appendix for details on
the refinements for time-consistent industries.



                                                    13
No significant relation is generated between the instrument and the explanatory variable
(growth of foreign O*NET 4% STEM workers) when we impute the foreign STEM growth
by interacting the 1980 distribution of foreign STEM with subsequent non-college immigrant
flows (column (1)) or when we augment them with aggregate immigrant flows net of H-1B
flows (column (2)), instead of H-1B flows. Hence the aggregate variation of H-1B visas over
time is crucial to predict subsequent STEM variation across cities. This is reassuring as
aggregate H-1B flows have been driven by policy changes more than by aggregate immigrant
inflows.
    Column (3) similarly shows that if we substitute the initial presence of foreign workers in
manual-intensive jobs (rather than in STEM) across metropolitan areas in the construction
of the instrument we do not obtain a significant correlation with the actual STEM growth.
Less skilled immigration, therefore, while possibly correlated with STEM immigration, did
not drive the explanatory power of the instrument.22
    Column (4) of Table 5 considers a direct test of the exclusion restriction for the instru-
ments. We show the correlation between the instrument — calculated for the 1990-2000
decade — and the pre-existing growth in native college wages in the period 1970-1980 (and
below its F-statistics as check of the coeﬃcient significance). The top two rows show such
a test when using the O*NET 4% definition of STEM to build the instrument. The two
following rows show the coeﬃcient and F-statistic when using the Major-based 4% definition
of STEM. This is a direct test that the instrument is uncorrelated with pre-existing trends
in the native outcomes. Of all the outcomes we consider, native college wages are the most
significantly aﬀected by increased STEM during the 1990s and 2000s (as we will see in Sec-
tion 5). It is reassuring, therefore, to see that there is no correlation at all between the H-1B
imputed STEM growth after 1980 and the pre-1980 native wage growth.23
    As a final check in this section, we want to show that H-1B policy has aﬀected the total
number of STEM workers in the U.S. by attracting more foreign-born workers. That is,
metropolitan areas with large foreign STEM inflows have not experienced a substitution of
foreign STEM for native STEM, but rather an increase in the overall STEM labor force due
to immigration. If this is true, we can consider the H-1B policy as an exogenous shock to
assess the impact of STEM workers on native wages, employment, and productivity.
    We examine this claim in columns (5) and (6) of Table 5 by regressing total (native
plus foreign) STEM worker growth on the H-1B-predicted inflow of foreign STEM (the
instrument). The estimated coeﬃcient is even larger than in the basic specification, implying,
as we will see below, a positive response of native STEM to foreign inflows. In column (5) we
use the stricter 4% STEM definition (based on O*NET in the top rows and on College Major
in the two lower rows) for both the endogenous and instrumental variable. In column (6) we
use the broader 8% definition of STEM for both endogenous and instrumental variable. The
power of the instrument is relatively strong in most cases (except when using the O*NET
8% definition of STEM24 ).
    Overall the specifications and falsifications shown in this section demonstrate that our
  22
     The details of the construction of these "falsified" instruments are in the Online Appendix.
  23
     We also checked the correlation with non-college wages before 1980 and we similarly found no significant
coeﬃcient.
  24
     For this reason we will in general prefer and use the O*NET 4% definition in the regressions of the next
section.

H-1B imputed instrument has significant power in predicting foreign STEM and total STEM
growth, that its variation is not driven by top cities or by one ethnic group, and that its
power survives the inclusion of city eﬀects, industry controls, and low-skilled immigrants
controls. The instrument’s predictive power is crucially driven by the H-1B program and by
initial distribution of STEM immigrants across cities.

on the sample selection process.

(a), the baseline specification, shows the results when the O*NET 4% definition of STEM
workers is used both for the explanatory variable and the instrument. In row (b) we instead
use the Major-based 4% definition of STEM workers and in row (c) we use the broader
O*NET 8% definition. Row (d) omits the top five metropolitan areas in terms of STEM
employment, from specifications otherwise identical to those in row (a). Row (e) adds to the
baseline specification the growth of imputed non-college educated immigrants, as defined
in (5), as a control. Row (f) excludes MSAs with populations below 400,000. Row (g)
excludes Indian STEM workers from the explanatory variable and instrument. Row (h)
uses the instrument constructed using aggregate H-1B flows and the initial foreign STEM
distribution, thus removing the nationality dimension. In row (i) we control for growth in
native college educated employment by including a shift-share instrument for the growth of
native college educated, constructed by interacting the number of native college educated
in each city in 1980 with the national growth of native college educated in the population.
Finally, row (j) shows the OLS estimates of the basic specification.
    We first comment on the main results, which are relatively consistent across specifications,
and then discuss some interesting features revealed by the robustness checks. First, there
is a positive, large, and significant eﬀect of foreign STEM workers on wages paid to college
educated native workers. The estimated eﬀect is significantly diﬀerent from zero at the
5% significance level in all specifications, and is significant at the 1% level in most. The
point estimates from the 2SLS specifications are mostly between 5.6 and 9.3 with some
larger values. This implies an increase in college educated wage growth between 5.6 and 9.3
percentage points in response to an increase in foreign STEM growth by 1 percentage point
of initial employment.26
    Second, the estimates of the eﬀects on native STEM wages are comparable to, but less
precisely estimated than, the eﬀects on native college educated workers. While we can never
rule out the hypothesis that the estimated eﬀect on native STEM wages is equal to the
point-estimate of the eﬀects on college educated wages27 , the first eﬀect is only occasionally
diﬀerent from zero at the 5% significance level. As there are fewer STEM natives (about 4%
of employment in our sample) than college educated natives (about 25% of employment),
measurement error in the average wage of the first group makes the precision of the estimates
much smaller.
    The third consistent result of Table 6 is that H-1B STEM workers had a positive and
usually significant eﬀect on wages paid to non-college educated native workers. The eﬀects,
however, are smaller than those for college educated natives. The point estimates are mostly
between 2.4 and 4.3 and less significant than those for college educated native wages. This
result implies that the productivity eﬀect of STEM workers is positive, but skill-biased:
foreign STEM workers are closer substitutes for college educated natives than for non-college
educated natives, yet they generate a larger increase in the wages paid to college educated
natives than to non-college educated ones.
  26
     Let us emphasize that 1 percentage point of employment is a very large increase for STEM workers,
comparable to the increase over the whole period 1990-2010 as shown in Table 2.
  27
     For instance, a formal test that the estimated coeﬃcient on STEM wages in row (a) is equal to 8.03
(the point estimate for the eﬀect on college educated) has a p-value of 0.76. At no level of confidence can
we reject the hypothesis that they are equal. Similarly for the other specifications, we can never reject the
hypothesis of equality at the 10% confidence level.


                                                     16
    Fourth, the inflow of STEM workers did not significantly aﬀect the employment of any
group of workers. The point estimates are mainly positive for native STEM and college
educated workers, and mainly negative for non-college educated natives. However, they are
usually not significant, even at the 10% level28 . The weak employment response, especially
among college educated workers, who generally tend to be mobile across cities, suggests the
potential existence of additional adjustment mechanisms for college educated workers at the
metropolitan area level. We explore the possibility of changes in the price of non-tradables
(in the form of house rents) as a response to the increase in productivity and wages of college
educated workers in Section 5.4.

5.2       Robustness Checks
We now comment on some interesting and reassuring results emerging from the robustness
checks performed in Table 6. To mitigate endogeneity concerns discussed earlier, row (d)
omits the top five STEM-dependent cities and row (g) removes Indian workers. The esti-
mated eﬀects of STEM on native wages remain stable and even increase in some cases, albeit
at the cost of larger standard errors. On one hand, this suggests that the inclusion of fixed
eﬀects, the instrumental variable strategy, and the additional controls (Bartik variables) in
the baseline model largely address the endogeneity bias. On the other hand, the increase
in standard errors indicates that the omitted cities, when included in regressions, aﬀord
precision in the estimates due to larger variation in the data.
    The introduction of imputed low-skilled immigrants as a control in row (e) also results
in an interesting and reasonable small change in the coeﬃcient estimates when compared to
row (a). We obtain a somewhat smaller estimate of the eﬀect of STEM on college educated
wages (down to 7.00 from 8.03) and a somewhat larger coeﬃcient on non-college educated
wages (up to 4.94 from 3.78). This is consistent with the idea that the inflow of less-educated
immigrants, as predicted by the MSA composition in 1980, was partially correlated with for-
eign STEM (although not too strongly) and that less-educated labor inflows complemented
college educated natives while substituting for non-college educated ones. Controlling ex-
plicitly for such imputed inflows helps to better isolate the eﬀect of STEM, which ends up
being more balanced in terms of productivity eﬀects on college and non-college educated
natives.
    Similarly, a high initial share of foreign STEM might simply proxy for high education
levels in a city. If cities with high initial share of college educated natives also experienced
high wage and employment growth during periods of large inflows of foreign STEM, this
would result in spurious correlation. Hence the inclusion in row (i) of a shift-share predictor
of native college-educated growth helps address this issue. The estimated impact of STEM
on wage of college educated remains quantitatively similar and is still statistically very
significant.
    When omitting small cities (row (f)) to examine issues related to measurement error, the
point estimates do not change much (relative to row (e)), but the standard errors decrease.
Hence, the measurement error that may be present does not seem to importantly aﬀect the
explanatory variable or the instrument by inducing bias, but the reduction of measurement
 28
      Only the employment eﬀect on native STEM in specification (d) is significantly positive.


                                                     17
error, by focusing only on large MSAs, leads to more precise estimates.
    Finally, it is worth commenting on the diﬀerence between the OLS estimates (row j) and
the corresponding 2SLS (row (e)). Interestingly, while the estimated employment eﬀects
have an upward bias in OLS relative to 2SLS, the wage eﬀects have a downward bias. This
may be due to the correlation between unobserved shocks and the inflow of foreign STEM
over the considered period. It is likely, in fact, that the inflow of foreign STEM is positively
correlated with employment growth and with a city’s openness to new workers. Hence, the
cities endogenously attracting foreign STEM workers could be those with fast inflows of
workers in general, which may moderate wage growth. Thus, the correlation between STEM
growth and omitted determinants of employment can be positive and the correlation with
openness that induces wage growth moderation can drive a negative correlation with wages.
This pattern of correlation would result in the observed biases.
    Before extending the findings, we provide a sense of the magnitude of the estimated
eﬀect. The growth in foreign STEM, measured as a percentage of total initial employment,
was only about 0.65% of total employment during the period 1990-2010. Applying the 7.00,
2SLS estimates of row (e) to the national growth in foreign STEM implies that the foreign-
driven net growth in STEM increased real wages of college educated natives by around
4.55 percentage points (=7.00 x 0.65) between 1990 and 2010. As a reference, Census data
suggests that the cumulative growth of college educated wages in this period equaled around
13 percentage points. Thus, one third of that growth can be attributed to the increased
presence of foreign STEM workers. We return to these implications in Section 6 when we
analyze the implied productivity and skill-bias eﬀects of STEM.

5.3     Extensions
As shown in columns (5) and (6) of Table 5, the increase in foreign STEM across cities
was an important driver of the increase in overall (native plus immigrant) STEM labor.
Table 7 generalizes the second-stage results of Table 6 by using the same specifications as
those from the first four rows of Table 6, and replacing the explanatory variable with total
STEM growth, instead of foreign STEM growth.29 The estimated eﬀects confirm that STEM
workers positively aﬀect wages of college educated natives, and to a smaller extent, wages
of the non-college educated as well. STEM workers had a positive and significant eﬀect on
wages of college educated natives that equaled around 4 percentage points for each increase in
STEM by one percentage point of employment. The eﬀects on wages of non-college natives,
on the other hand, is around 2.4.30 There is no evidence that either group experiences
employment eﬀects.
    The basic result is robust to using the Major-based definition of STEM (row b), using
the broad (8%) definition of STEM (row c), and omitting top STEM cities (row d). Also,
  29
     We do not assess native STEM employment outcomes, as employment is subsumed in the explanatory
variable itself.
  30
     The point estimate of the eﬀect on wages when considering foreign STEM only as explanatory variable
(Table 6) is somewhat larger. It is possible that those estimates include a positive eﬀect through the
attraction of native STEM (as revealed by Table 6) who, in turn, spur the productivity of college educated
workers. Hence an increase in foreign STEM by 1% of employment may imply an increase in total STEM
by 1.5%, thereby generating a larger wage eﬀect (by about 50%).


                                                   18
the OLS estimates confirm a positive bias (relative to the 2SLS results) for the eﬀects on
employment, and a negative one for the eﬀects on wages. Overall our estimates confirm that
the demand for native college educated workers received a significant positive boost from
STEM workers and the demand for native non-college educated labor was also positively,
but less strongly, aﬀected.
    A lot of heterogeneity exists among non-college educated workers. Table 8 explores
whether the wage and employment eﬀects of STEM workers are diﬀerentiated at diﬀerent
parts of the educational distribution within non-college educated. In particular, we assess
whether eﬀects are diﬀerent among natives without a high school diploma (H.S. dropouts)
and with a high school diploma (H.S. graduates). The table presents foreign STEM eﬀects for
wages (columns (1) and (2)) and employment (columns (3) and (4)). Rows (a)-(d) present
several specifications of the 2SLS regression mirroring those in the corresponding rows of
Tables 6 and 7. The main feature of each specification is described by the row headings.
Row (e) reports the OLS coeﬃcients.
    By distinguishing high school graduates from high school dropouts, we can check whether
these two groups are diﬀerentiated in their complementarity with college educated labor.
This decomposition tests whether STEM workers produced the type of change in labor
demand that is commonly called “skill biased” or if their eﬀect appears to be indicative of
a “polarization of the labor market.” Skill-biased eﬀects (see Acemoglu (1998, 2002)) would
imply that productivity growth has been complementary to schooling, hence workers with
lower schooling are less positively aﬀected by innovation spurred by STEM workers. College
educated workers would be most positively aﬀected, followed by high school graduates, and
lastly by high school dropouts. Polarization, instead, implies higher relative labor demand
growth at the high and low ends of the educational spectrum at the expense of intermediate-
level jobs (e.g. Autor (2010), Autor et al. (2006)). This outcome can be understood in
terms of technological progress that may have substituted for intermediate types of skills
(e.g., routine cognitive skills) but complemented low end (manual) and high end (analytical)
skills.
    The estimates of Table 8 show that STEM eﬀects were significant only for high school
graduates while dropouts experienced mostly insignificant consequences (typically with smaller
point estimates). Neither group had significant employment eﬀects. The basic specification
in row (a) shows that STEM workers increased wages paid to native high school graduates
by 5.5 percentage points for each percentage point increase in STEM employment. This
would be consistent with a claim that STEM-driven technological progress has been skill (or
schooling) biased rather than polarizing. The diﬀerence between the eﬀects on high school
graduates and dropouts is not usually significant, however, due to the lack of precision in es-
timating the dropout eﬀects. No evidence of polarization as a consequence of STEM growth
is found.

5.4    The Eﬀect on Housing Rents
The impact of STEM worker growth on college educated wages is significantly positive. Given
that college educated workers are generally mobile across cities (see Malamud and Wozniak
(2012), for example), it is interesting that STEM worker growth did not also generate a
significant employment response for this group. A plausible explanation, emphasized by

                                             19
Moretti (2011) and Saiz (2007), is that the cost of non-tradable services, mainly housing
rents, increases in the cities experiencing wage growth. Thus, housing prices might absorb
some of the college educated wage growth driven by an inflow of STEM workers that we
have identified in this paper.
    In order to check this adjustment channel, we analyze the eﬀect of STEM workers on
native house rents as measured by the U.S. Census in 1990, 2000, 2005, and 2010. We use
the data on rents, rather than house values, because they capture more closely the cost of
housing services provided by a building or unit, and their changes do not include changes
in their asset value (which was subject to large swings during our period of study). We
construct average monthly rent per room in constant 2010 dollars by using data on the
total number of rooms and monthly rent paid by native workers between 18 and 65 years of
age, who rent their house, in the 219 metropolitan areas.31 In order to identify the specific
eﬀect for college and non-college educated rents, we construct the rent per room for the two
groups separately. As rental payments are top-coded and in some cities more than 5% of the
individuals are subject to the top-code, we also calculate the median value of rent per room
in a metro area. We then adopt the growth rate of these rent values as the outcome variable
in regression (1), using the same methodology and instrument as in the estimated wage and
employment regressions.
    Table 9 reports the estimated eﬀects of changes in foreign STEM employment on changes
in rents paid by native college (column (1)) and non-college educated workers (column (2)).
Each of the six rows of the table correspond to diﬀerent specifications. Row (a) uses the
O*NET 4% definition of STEM (both in the explanatory variable and instrument) and me-
dian rent as the dependent variable. In row (b) we use the average rent as dependent variable.
Row (c) shows the results obtained using the broader O*NET 8% definition of STEM (both
in the explanatory variable and instrument). Row (d) uses the same specification as in row
(a), but omits the top five STEM cities. Similarly, row (e) omits Indians in the calculation of
STEM workers. Row (f) shows the estimates when we use total (rather than foreign) STEM
as the explanatory variable.
    Each specification reveals a significant and positive eﬀect (at the 1% level) of STEM
growth on growth of rents paid by college educated workers. Point estimates center around
7. Conversely, point estimates of STEM eﬀects on rents paid by non-college educated workers
are near zero and are not significant. The inflow of H-1B STEM workers increased the wages
of college educated labor and increased their housing costs. These higher wages likely caused
college educated natives to bid up the rent price of houses in the parts of cities most desirable
to them. This diﬀerential increase in rents is therefore due to the more limited supply of
desirable locations for college educated labor and the larger increase in their income.
    Housing costs are likely to aﬀect the cost of other non-tradable local services as well,
and the sum of those eﬀects will influence real wages. The Consumer Expenditure Surveys32
for college educated workers from 1998-2002 show that housing costs represented 33% of
individual expenditures, while 17% of their expenditures were in utilities, health, and en-
tertainment (non-tradable services). Hence, 50% of college educated workers’ incomes could
easily be spent on non-tradable services.

    If we consider the average estimated price eﬀect (from Table 9) to be around a 7 per-
centage point increase for each percentage point rise in the STEM share of employment, and
the corresponding average eﬀect on native college wages to be around 7 percentage points as
well (from the average estimate in Table 6), then the real wage increase for college educated
labor, accounting for purchasing power, would be only around 3.5 percentage points. The
STEM eﬀect on non-tradables prices, therefore, contributed substantially to absorbing the
local eﬀect on college educated wages and helps to explain the small employment response.


6     Deriving Productivity and Skill-Bias Eﬀects
In this final section we sketch a simple model of production in cities that allows us to use the
elasticities estimated in Tables 6 and 7 for calculating the long-run eﬀect of STEM on the
total factor productivity (TFP) and skill bias of productivity (SBP) in a city. We present
the basic assumptions and the intuition of the model, and then we show simulations of TFP
and SBP eﬀects for 1990-2010 that can be explained by growth in foreign STEM workers.
We present the solution to the model and derive the exact expressions for the three demand
conditions used to calculate the eﬀects of STEM on TFP and SBP in the Appendix A.

6.1    Framework
Suppose a city () produces a homogeneous, tradable, numeraire product ( ) in year .
The economy employs three types of workers: non-college educated ( ), college educated
workers ( ), and STEM workers ( ). Production occurs according to the following
long-run production function:
                    ∙        µ            −1                    −1 ¶¸  −1
                                                                           
                                                                           
                                                                
                = ( ) ( )      + (1 − ( ))                          (8)

Input  is a composite factor obtained by combining college educated and STEM workers
as follows:
                                    µ  −1        −1 ¶  −1
                                                           
                                                           
                                                 
                                =     +                                           (9)

The parameter   1 captures the elasticity of substitution between non-college and college
educated labor. Similarly,    1 is the elasticity of substitution between college educated
(non-STEM) and STEM workers.
    Physical capital is absent from (8). Instead we assume that capital mobility and the
equalization of capital returns imply a constant capital-output ratio in the long run so that
capital can be solved out of the production function. In this sense, the comparative static
results that we find can be thought of as a comparison between long-run balanced growth
paths.
    STEM workers are the key inputs in developing and adopting new technologies, which
are widely credited for increasing the productivity of college educated workers as well as
increasing total factor productivity. Our modeling choices seek to capture these factors.

                                                          33
We follow the literature on human capital externalities
                                                  
                                                             and growth of ideas34 by allowing
the level of total factor productivity, ( )  −1  0 to be a function of the number of
STEM workers in the city. If 0 ( )  0, STEM-driven innovation externalities have a
positive eﬀect on TFP. At the same time we allow for skill (college) biased productivity,
( ) ∈ [0 1] to depend upon the number of STEM workers. If  0 ( )  0, STEM-
driven innovation externalities may have a college-biased eﬀect on productivity. Even if
STEM and college-educated workers are close substitutes in production ( ≈ ∞), in the
described framework STEM workers are uniquely capable of potentially generating ideas,
innovation, and externalities that benefit productivity.                             ³  ´
    The main goal of the model is to identify the eﬀect of STEM workers on TFP   −1
and its college-bias ((1 − )) in equilibrium. We proceed as follows. First we derive wages
paid to each factor as their marginal productivity, implied by the production function. Then
we calculate the total logarithmic (percentage) change in wages for each group (non-college,
college educated , and STEM) in response to the changes in the supply of each type of
worker (expressed as a percentage of total employment), allowing for mobility of workers
and, hence, for changes in each group’s supply in response to an exogenous change of STEM
workers. Next, we divide each side of the three labor demand conditions (one for each type
of worker) by the exogenous change of STEM workers expressed as a percentage of total
employment. This gives us three linear conditions35 relating the elasticity of each group’s
wage and employment to STEM (i.e., the coeﬃcients  estimated from Equation 1).
    The linear expressions also include terms that depend upon the wage and employment
                                                                                   ∆
share of each worker type and the four unknown parameters       = ∆         
                                                                                          and
        ∆
 = ∆   
               Wage and employment shares can be calculated from Census data. Values for
the elasticity of substitution between college and non-college educated labor ( ) can be
taken from prior literature. The  and  terms are the elasticity of  and  to changes
in STEM (relative to initial employment). These values, in addition to the elasticity of
substitution between STEM and college educated labor (  ) can be solved for by using the
three labor demand conditions derived from the model (which are linear due to the CES
structure of production).  and  allow us to evaluate the impact of STEM on TFP and
its skill bias.
    The advantage of this approach is that we have an intuitive and standard definition of
TFP and SBP based on a city-specific production function. We can use it to infer the pro-
ductivity impacts of STEM. Moreover, we can calculate these eﬀects without specifying the
labor supply-side of the model, which is aﬀected by mobility and labor force participation, as
long as we have the equilibrium elasticity for the employment of each factor to the exogenous
change in STEM (which we estimated in Tables 6 and 7). The limitations of this approach
are its dependence on the specific assumptions on the production structure and on the form
of the productive interactions between diﬀerent types of labor.

6.2     Estimated Productivity Eﬀects
By substituting the estimated values of b — the elasticity of outcome  for group 
to STEM workers — in the equations derived from our model (and described in Appendix
A), we can back-up the eﬀects on the growth of TFP and SBP.36 The literature provides
estimates of  that usually range between 15 and 25.37 We assume a  value of 2 in
our basic simulation, and we use values of 175 and 225 in two robustness checks. We
combine this value with U.S. Census data on the relative wage and employment of college
and non-college educated labor to obtain an implied value of  equal to 057 (in the basic
specification) for the year 2000.38 We also use the values of the share of STEM workers in
total employment (004) and in the total wage bill (009), plus the college educated share of
the wage bill (046) as obtained from the 2000 Census data for the aggregate U.S. sample.
Changing those parameters to their 2010 or 1990 values has only very marginal eﬀects on
the simulations.39
    Table 10 displays the simulated changes to TFP (column (1)) and SBP (column (2)) over
the period 1990-2010 attributed by our model to the average (aggregate) growth in foreign
STEM between 1990 and 2010. The change in foreign STEM was equal to an increase by
0.04% of the total employment each year. Actual annual changes in TFP (from Fernald
(2010)) is 0.89% and SBP, from our caluclations based on Census data, is 1.75%. Those
values are reported in columns (3) and (4). The last two columns then show the proportion
of the actual changes explained by the simulated eﬀect of foreign STEM.
    The first row of Table 10 reports the simulated eﬀects when we use the elasticities es-
timated from the basic specification of Table 6, row (a). Row (2) uses the estimates from
Table 6, row (f), in which we control for imputed unskilled immigrants and reduce the atten-
uation bias by including only large cities in the regression. We label this row “Conservative
Estimates” because the underlying regression leads to somewhat smaller estimates of the
eﬀect of STEM on native wages. In row (3) we use estimates from Table 7 row (a), obtained
using total STEM as explanatory variable,40 which tend to be 40-50% smaller than those
obtained with foreign STEM. The fourth and fifth row show the robustness of the estimates
to changes in values of the parameter   , using the Basic specification of Row (a).
    The estimated elasticities imply that foreign STEM growth can explain between a third
  36
      We also get from our model an estimate of   the elasticity of substitution between STEM and non-
STEM college educated in production. That elasticity is always very high and statistically non distinguishable
from infinity (1/  is not significantly diﬀerent from 0). This is because our estimates of the elasticity of
college educated wages and STEM wages to STEM supply are always very close to each other, implying high
substitutability between the two groups.
   37
      See Ciccone and Peri (2005) for a review of the estimates. Katz and Murphy (1992), Goldin and Katz
(2007), and Ottaviano and Peri (2012) provide some influential estimates of that parameter.

of  changes as well according to the above formula.
  39
     These simulations are available upon request.
  40
     In this case we used the estimated elasticity of college educated wages (3.96) also for STEM, as the
model implies that the elasticity of college educated wages to foreign STEM cannot be smaller than that of
native STEM wages.



                                                     23
and a half of the average productivity growth in the period 1990-2010, depending on the
particular wage regression coeﬃcients and value of  substituted into the model. Even
in the case of the smallest estimates, 30% of the TFP growth of the average U.S. city is
explained by foreign STEM. Let us emphasize that the average annual TFP eﬀect implied
by our simulations is about 0.44 percentage points per year. This annual growth implies
that income per capita of native workers in 2010 was 9.1% larger in the U.S. that it would
have been without contributions from foreign STEM. This is a significant eﬀect. We also
find an eﬀect on the skill bias, but it seems more modest and it does not explain more than
5 to 8% of the SBP growth over the period.41
    This macro exercise must certainly be taken with great caution as it is based on very
strong assumptions. In particular, we apply parameters that were estimated across cities to
calculate national eﬀects of foreign STEM. Simulations will overstate the aggregate eﬀects
on productivity if some of the wage eﬀects from the underlying regressions are due to the
selection of natives. However, since our regressions only capture the within city productivity
eﬀect, we may also be under-estimating the national impact on productivity.
    Despite its limitations, the exercise is informative as it provides a reference for the magni-
tude of productivity eﬀects. It is also reassuring that the simulated eﬀects are closely aligned
with the productivity eﬀects of scientists and engineers found by the growth literature. For
example, Jones’s (2002) very influential paper on aggregate U.S. data found that about 50%
of the long-run productivity growth of the U.S. in recent decades could be attributed to
growth in scientists and engineers as a share of employment. We find that during the 20
years leading to 2010, between one third and one half of the U.S. productivity growth can
be attributed to the growth of foreign STEM workers. As foreign STEM worker growth
represented about 80% of the net growth in STEM workers in those decades, our results
closely align with Jones (2002). It would be impossible to justify the estimated eﬀects of for-
eign STEM on native wages by considering them only as an increase in skilled labor supply.
However, if they are considered as a source of growth in R&D resources, then their eﬀect is
perfectly in line with the previously estimated eﬀects of R&D on productivity growth.


7      Conclusions
In this paper we used the inflow of foreign scientists, technology professionals, engineers, and
mathematicians (STEM), made possible by the H-1B visa program, to estimate the impact
of STEM workers on the productivity of college and non-college educated American workers
over the 1990-2010 period. The uneven distribution of foreign STEM workers across cities in
1980 — a decade before the introduction of the H-1B visa — and the high correlation between
the pre-existing presence of foreign-born workers and subsequent immigration flows allows
us to use the variation in foreign STEM as a supply-driven increase in STEM workers across
metropolitan areas.
    We find that a one percentage point increase in the foreign STEM share of a city’s
total employment increased wages of native college educated labor by about 7-8 percentage
points and the wages of non-college educated natives by 3-4 percentage points. We find
  41
    Our measure of college bias is the percentage change in the college to non-college labor wage ratio,
keeping their relative labor supply constant.


                                                  24
non-significant eﬀects on the employment of those two groups. These results indicate that
growth in STEM workers spurred technological growth by increasing productivity, especially
that of college educated workers. They also experienced increasing housing rents, which
eroded part of their wage gain.

A     A Model to Derive Productivity Eﬀects
In this Appendix we show the details of the calculations performed to obtain the elasticities

simulate the eﬀects shown in Table 10 and discussed in Section 6.

A.1     Wages and Labor Demand System
Using a production function as defined in (8) for each city we assume that each group
of workers is paid their marginal productivity. Hence, to obtain the wages of each type
of worker, we take the first derivative of the production function (8) with respect to the
employment of each group. This generates the following expressions (for brevity, we omit
the subscripts and the dependence of  and  on  ):

   In equilibrium we observe simultaneous changes in wages and employment of each type
of worker. Taking a total logarithmic diﬀerential of expressions (10)-(12) and writing all
employment changes relative to total employment  =  +  +  we have the following
three equations relating the equilibrium changes in employment and wages for each group of
workers (non-college educated, college educated, and STEM, respectively):

    These equations have to hold in equilibrium. The terms  and   appearing in all
expressions, are our main objects of interest. They capture the elasticity of productivity and
skill-bias to (foreign-born) STEM workers. Their expressions are:

    The terms          
                  and  , for  =    and  represent, respectively, the share of total
wage income and employment represented by factor  For example,             is the share of total
wage income accruing to workers with college education (STEM and non-STEM) and equals
(  +  )(  +   +  ), while     =   is the STEM worker share of
total employment.
    With the equilibrium response of wages and employment of each group to   esti-
mated in the text, and using census wage and employment data to calculate the shares                 
and   equations (13)-(15) only depend on four unknown parameters:    ,   , and   .
We adopt estimates of the parameter  from the extensive literature that estimates the
elasticity of substitution between college and non-college educated, and we use (13)-(15) and
our elasticity estimates to obtain values for    and   . The three equations are linear
in    and 1 

A.2      Solving the Linear System to Obtain TFP and Skill Bias

Hence for simplicity (and without aﬀecting much the simulations) we set them equal to zero.
This allows us to simplify the system and obtain the following three equations that identify
the remaining three unknown parameters:

  Note: Each cell shows the coefficient from a different regression. The dependent variable is the growth in foreign STEM as percentage of the labor force. The units of
  observations are 219 U.S. metropolitan areas over the periods 1990-2000, 2000-2005, 2005-2010. The explanatory variable is the H-1B-driven growth of foreign-STEM jobs,
  as a percentage of initial employment. Top 2 rows use the O*NET based definition of STEM occupations; Rows 3 and 4 use Major-based STEM definitions. Baseline models
  use the narrow (4%) definition of STEM. Column (1) also controls for a city’s native STEM employment in 1980. Standard errors (in parentheses) are always clustered at the
  metro area level.
  ***, **,*= significant at 1%, 5% and 10% level respectively.

Note: The table uses the formulas in the Appendix to calculate the implied elasticity φA and φ . We then use the growth of US foreign-STEM workers as a share
of employment to calculate the implied effects on TFP. The average TFP growth is taken from Fernald (2010) and the average skill biased growth is calculated
using the average U.S. values for the wages and employment (in hours) of college educated and non-college educated workers from the Census 1990 and 2010.
Unless otherwise noted, the elasticity of substitution between college and non-college educated workers is σΗ=2. The STEM share of employment is 0.04, the
STEM share of wages 0.09, and the college educated share of wages 0.46. The values are calculated from the 2000 US Census.
