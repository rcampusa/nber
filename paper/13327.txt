                                              ABSTRACT

Franchise jobs are often described as representing the epitome of the "low road" approach to managing
employees: high turnover, little training, deskilled jobs, and little employee involvement, practices
often seen as unsophisticated. Research on franchise operations suggests, however, that the basic operating
principles and practices of franchises tend to be more sophisticated than those of equivalent independent
operators. We might therefore expect their employee management practices to be more advanced
as well, challenging the stereotype of franchise jobs. We use data from a national probability sample
of establishments to examine the relationship between franchise status and employment practices.
While descriptive statistics suggest that franchise operations use low road practices, once industry,
size, and other control variables are included in the analysis, franchise operations appear on important
dimensions to offer better jobs with more sophisticated systems of employee management than similar
non-franchise operations.

Introduction

       Franchises are an important part of the U.S. economy. There are an estimated 1,500

franchise companies operating in the U.S. doing business through 320,000 retail units (see

International Franchise Association estimates). Our data, described in more detail below,

suggests that they represent about five percent of all establishments in the U.S. Franchises

represent an alternative to traditional forms of business operations. They signify a legal

agreement where the independent franchisee sells a product or service using the brand name

and/or operating system of the franchisor, typically in return for a lump sum payment and annual

royalty fee (Shane, 1996, Shane & Foo, 2001).

       Franchises have a market-like aspect due to the exchange of capital and products between

the franchisor and the franchisee; they also have a hierarchical aspect due to the uniform

operating procedures set by the franchisor (Norton, 1988). Franchises also represent a hybrid

between the attributes of small and large-scale operations in that they function with some

autonomy as independent establishments but are also part of a much larger franchise

organization. The product or service’s image, marketing, and basic operating practices are

produced most efficiently in large scale by the parent (Rubin, 1978), while the actual production

of the goods and services is most efficient when it is decentralized to the place of consumption

(Caves and Murphy, 1976).

       The management of employees and work organization issues is central to most franchise

operating procedures, in part because franchises are especially common in services where labor

content is the crucial component. And the popular image of franchises is that they provide low-

quality jobs. We consider the conceptual arguments behind that position and then examine it

empirically in the analyses below.



                                                3
Franchises and Employment Practices:

       The descriptive literature on franchises reinforces the idea that franchises provide low-

quality jobs (e.g. Zuber, 1997; Matusky, 1998; Schaaf, 1994; Feuer, 1988), although most of that

work is anecdotal. Franchise outlets appear to make extensive use of part-time and temporary

employees (Leidner, 1993) and do not invest much in recruiting because they do not expect

employees to be with the organization for a very long time (Royle, 1998). They also appear to

pay low wages. Royle (1998), for example, emphasizes the huge disparity between the US

average wage and the starting wage at McDonald’s. Benefits like health insurance and sick days

are entirely absent at some franchise operations (Leidner, 1993). Franchise operations are

marked by a very high rate of turnover that can reach 300 per cent per year (Krueger, 1991).

       While the practitioner-oriented literature hails the effectiveness and superiority of

training practices of franchises (e.g. Zuber, 1997; Matusky, 1998; Schaaf, 1994; Feuer, 1988),

Litz and Stewart (2000) survey 307 hardware stores in a trade name franchise chain and question

whether franchises train more than independent stores. Whether workers actually learn much

from franchise training is another open question. Wildavsky (1999) asserts that fast food

franchise workers learn both job-related skills, such as how to operate a cash register or train

others, and general, transferable skills such as teamwork, customer service or getting along with

coworkers; Leidner (1993), on the other hand, points out that the training for making French

fries, for example, consisted of simply watching a short videotape, and the most skilled job,

window work, demanded only three to four hours of total training time (Leidner, 1993).

       Among the larger and more sophisticated franchises, such as McDonald’s, there is at least

a priori evidence suggesting that the basic approach to management – generating standardized

“best practices” and transferring them across organizations - bears a great deal of similarity to




                                                4
that of scientific management. Frederick Taylor’s model for organizing production work began

by systematically gathering up the tacit knowledge of production held by skilled workers and

organizing it into precise, formalized rules that defined the performance of each specific task

performed by every individual worker (see Taylor, 1947 for a discussion).            The effect of

scientific management approaches on worker-level outcomes, particularly skill requirements, is

extremely well documented: Because knowledge is built into rules, procedures, and systems,

individual workers no longer need to have that knowledge, and job requirements fall. (See

Braverman, 1974 for the seminal work and Attewell, 1987 for a review.) Less-skilled workers,

who are cheaper, can be hired into these de-skilled jobs and then trained to follow the

standardized approaches. Leidner’s (1993) ethnography of franchise operations argues that their

routinization of work practices leads to tight managerial control, detailed job descriptions, and

plenty of specifications and regulations, very much like scientific management.

       Hierarchical and bureaucratic forms of supervision and control have an independent

effect on limiting the autonomy of employees by transferring decision making up the hierarchy

(e.g., Perrow 1972; Edwards 1978). The franchise model, where the design and control over

operating procedures lies at the franchisor headquarters, very much resembles a bureaucratic

control system. Bureaucratic systems of control through hierarchy are also part of the scientific

management approach, as the design and control of jobs is separated from the execution of work

and transferred to layers of industrial engineers and supervisors. In the case of highly specialized

jobs, for example, it is difficult for workers to coordinate their work with others on their own

because they often lack the knowledge and the links to do that. Further, highly specialized work

is less intrinsically motivating, which again increases the need for hierarchical supervision




                                                 5
(Lawler, 1988). The practices of scientific management and the practice of hierarchical control

systems both limit the autonomy and control of employees.

       Scientific management implies different outcomes for franchise management jobs,

however, as managers may need greater skill to execute the operating practices. Parcel and

Sickmeier (1988) highlight how McDonald’s simultaneously uses a secondary labor market for

front-line workers with low entry criteria, low wages, low degree of autonomy and little

employment stability, and an upper-tier labor market with high wages and benefits and clear

lines of promotion to attract managers with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to develop and

maintain these routines.

       One argument reconciling why franchises could have more sophisticated management

practices in general and apparently unsophisticated low road employment practices would be that

they rely on these scientific management principles. The poor employment outcomes for front-

line workers could be part of an intentional strategy. A great deal of contemporary research in

human resources and industrial relations, however, has emphasized the considerable advantages

for employers of “high commitment” or “high performance” work systems associated with

greater worker involvement and participatory decision processes (e.g. Berg, 1999; Berg,

Kalleberg and Appelbaum, 2003). High performance work practices, which focus on employee

involvement and team work arrangements, also tend to be accompanied by supporting programs

such as worker training (Osterman 1994). Wages for workers employed in high commitment

systems are higher than those employed by traditional organizations, especially for managers,

supervisors, and technical workers in unionized establishments (Black, Lynch and Krivelyova,

2004). While the early studies on high commitment work systems showed benefits associated

with individual performance, the more recent studies demonstrate effects associated with firm-




                                              6
level outcomes in services as well as the more typical manufacturing settings (e.g., Combs, Liu,

Hall and Ketchen, 2006; Preuss 2003).

       If the essence of franchise management is to identify effective management practices,

standardize and distribute them across franchise outlets, then it is not obvious why franchise

operations would not also include high performance work practices in their portfolio. Further, it

is not obvious that the descriptive literature on franchise jobs is definitive. Most of the studies

that point out the poor quality of employment practices at franchises focuses on fast food outlets,

especially McDonald’s (e.g. Love, 1985; Parcel and Sickmeier, 1988; Leidner, 1993; Royle,

1998 and 2000). Many of the characteristics of jobs at those franchises appear to be common to

all fast food jobs. The franchises that were examined in these studies also tend to be relatively

small operations, and small firms often lack the resources to develop human resource practices

like training (Kalleberg et al, 1996; Litz and Stewart, 2000). Vickerstaff (1992) found, for

example, that smaller firms lacked both the training infrastructure (training specialists and

budgets) and the training capacity (employees’ time and training skills) to implement training

programs.    To truly understand the workplace practices that characterize franchises, it is

necessary to control for these other attributes that are associated with typical franchise operations

as they may well confound any association between job quality and franchise status.

       The few studies that control for these factors carefully are those that compare franchisee-

owned establishments to company-owned establishments, often in the same chain, e.g., a

franchisee-owned Burger King store compared to a company-owned Burger King (e.g., Krueger,

1991 and Bradach, 1998). This approach is very helpful for examining the effects of ownership

structure per se, but it cannot examine the effect of franchise operating practices because the

basic operating models are the same in company-owned and franchisee-owned operations within




                                                 7
the same chain. The nature of the relationship between franchise operations and employment

practices therefore demands further examination, which we turn to below.



Hypotheses

       Our central question, based on the conflicting implications of the literature cited above, is

whether franchises offer lower quality jobs than do non-franchise operations. The perception

that they do is widespread, but whether that apparent association is due to confounding factors is

an important empirical question. Research suggests that franchises in general are more

sophisticated in their management practices than equivalent non-franchise operations, which

might lead one to hypothesize that their workplace practices would also be more sophisticated

and not necessarily the “low road” approach with which they are associated.

       Asking this question requires first establishing criteria for deciding the quality of jobs:

What constitutes a good job? One approach, for example, might be to compare the perceptions

of workers themselves in franchise and non-franchise operations: Which ones are more satisfied

with their jobs? The difficulty with this approach is that interpreting differences in attitudes

across jobs is very complicated because satisfaction levels are in part influenced by expectations,

and representative attitudinal data across operations is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. A more

straightforward approach is to examine the attributes of jobs directly. Kalleberg, Reskin and

Hudson, 2000 focus on three factors to measure job quality: wage level, pension benefits and

health insurance. Other aspects of jobs no doubt are important as well, such as promotion

prospects, the specific aspects of individual tasks as they relate to principles of job design,




                                                 8
relationships with superiors and other aspects of interpersonal dynamics, etc.2 Many of these are

complicated to measure (or even to define) and, unfortunately, are beyond the scope of the data

that we know to exist. We believe most observers would agree that important measures of job

quality include aspects of the rewards from work (pay and benefits), employer investments in

employees (training programs), and, especially in the context of franchises, work organization

practices that affect employee involvement along the lines of high performance systems.

        An important caveat to the notion of assessing job quality is that the distinction between

good jobs and bad jobs is somewhat arbitrary. In fact, job quality is likely to represent a

continuum that depends on which attributes of jobs are being examined. And the fact that

workers may have different preferences with respect to these attributes (e.g., some prefer part-

time work) makes even a continuum complicated to construct.

Methods and Data

        To address the questions above, we need data that can compare the employment practices

of franchises to equivalent non-franchises in order to control for possible confounding

relationships. To do so, we turn to the National Employer Surveys (see Cappelli 2001 for a

description). Conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the National Employer Surveys are

representative surveys of all private sector, for-profit U.S. establishments with more than 20

employees (excluding corporate headquarters). The 1994 National Employer Survey sampled

over 4000 of these establishments. The survey was administered via Computer Assisted

Telephone Interviewing to a target respondent of the plant manager in manufacturing

establishments and the local business site manager in service establishments. The survey also

obtained information from multiple respondents where the target respondent thought those

2
 One could imagine controlling for the attributes of individuals holding those jobs as well in order to determine
whether jobs are better than one would expect given the quality of the workers. This approach answers a slightly



                                                         9
responses would be more accurate. It asked about establishment characteristics, work

organization practices, and human resource practices. The overall response rate was 72% with

no apparent differences between respondents and non-respondents on dimensions such as

industry type or size. The 1994 public use data file that resulted contains data on 3173

establishments.

         The 1996 National Employer Survey interviewed a sub-sample of the establishments

from the 1994 survey and also asked whether the establishment was a member of a franchise

organization. The response rate for the 1996 survey was 75%. By matching the data from the

1994 survey to the franchise question from 1996, we have a data set with 2136 observations that

identifies organizational and work practices for a national sample of franchises and non-

franchised establishments.3

         Cross-sectional data of this kind creates obvious difficulty in establishing causal

relationships. That concern is mitigated in this context, however, because the direction of

causation seems clear on logical grounds. It is straightforward to see how the decision to

become a franchise drives work practices because the use of specific operating procedures is

typically required by the franchise agreement. These, in turn, either define the employment

practices or drive employment outcomes. It is much more difficult to imagine the reverse case,

where employment outcomes exogenously cause an establishment to become a franchise or a



different question, though, whether jobs offer a market premium as opposed to whether they are good per se.
3
  Establishments do switch status from franchise to non-franchise and visa versa, although such changes are rare –
Peterson and Dant (1990) found that the number of franchisees that have ever been an independent operator, e.g.,
was only 6.7 percent. The rate of change over a short period like 1994 to 1996 is likely to be insignificant for the
purposes of empirical analyses. We know so little about what causes franchise status to change in either direction
that it is difficult even to speculate as to possible relationships with the other variables. Not all franchise agreements
are the same. The important distinction is between “trade name” franchises, where the franchisee acquires the right
to sell a particular product and manage its operation with considerable autonomy (e.g., a gas station’s relationship
with an oil company) versus “business unit” franchises, where the operations are highly structured according to prior
agreements (e.g., most fast-food chains). While we might expect relationships with work practices to be stronger for
business unit franchises, we cannot distinguish the two in our data.


                                                           10
franchise to switch to a different ownership form. Further, the type of work practices and

outcomes we are considering are in no way unique to franchise status, so there is no reason to

believe that having these practices would require that a firm take the franchise form.

       A different concern with respect to estimation is whether franchise status and work

practices are determined simultaneously. Simultaneous observations could bias OLS estimators

asymptotically, although OLS estimation may still be preferred over other forms (e.g., by being

more robust). Again, the process through which franchise operations take place suggests that

franchise status occurs first and then work practices follow. While they may appear to be

simultaneous in the sense that most franchise firms begin operations with their work practices in

place, the actual process is invariably that operators decide to become a franchise and then roll

out the operating procedures, which include work practices.



Variables and Analyses

       The arguments above at least satisfy the requirement of Granger Causation and suggest

that simple regression models are sufficient to establish the estimates of the relationship between

franchise status and work practices and associated outcomes. Among the primary variables to

consider in deciding whether franchises offer good jobs are wages, which we measure separately

for managerial and non-managerial (typically front-line) workers.4 This measure is for full-time

workers. It would be useful to have similar data for part-time workers as well but such data is

unavailable. We also include a count of how many among 10 important benefits the

establishment offers its employees. All of these benefits add fixed costs to employment and are

typically seen as practices that help create attachment between firms and employees. Not all




                                                11
benefits are equal in terms of value or cost, of course, and there is a wide range of possible

analyses one could conduct to examine relationships with benefits. This approach at least has the

benefit of parsimony.5

        Another important variable is the extent of training offered to employees, which we

measure with three variables: First, whether the establishment has a written training program or

policy in place, second, the percentage of employees who receive formal training each year, and

third, the number of hours of formal training employees receive each year. The last two

variables are measured separately for managerial and non-managerial employees.

        One way to capture the extent of pay, benefits, training, and other expenditures on

employees is with a single measure of total labor costs. This variable comes from the 1997

National Employer Survey, which asks about expenditures for 1996, the year for which the

franchise question is collected. 6 We also include other measures of job quality – the percentage

of workers who have part-time status, the average education level of the workforce (measured

separately for management and non-management employees), and a proxy for turnover and

tenure. Actual turnover measures are not available, only the percentage of the workforce with

less than one year of tenure. This measure is important in its own right as an indication of the

extent of new hires in the workplace. It should vary directly with turnover, but it, like all

measures of tenure, can be confounded by employment growth: Growing companies, other


4
  The original question in the survey asked for average hourly pay, but because not all establishments had
compensation data in that format, they were allowed to report it as weekly, monthly, or hourly pay. The reports
were therefore converted to a standard metric of annual salaries based on 40 hour workweeks and 52 week years.
5
  The benefits are: pension, severance pay, health insurance, dental insurance, life insurance, sick pay, paid
vacations/holidays, family leave (this was before the Family and Medical Leave Act), grievance/complaint
procedures, and stock options.
6
  The size control variable helps to adjust for difference in labor costs based simply on having more employees. Per
employee measures have important caveats, though, in that establishments may differ in their use of part-time labor
and overtime hours. If franchises make greater use of part-time workers, e.g., then their labor cost per employee
measure should be understated compared to the true expenditure per unit of labor.



                                                        12
things equal, have lower tenure independent of turnover rates. Because employment growth

rates are not available, it is important to recognize that this measure is an imperfect proxy for

turnover.

       We also have two measures for high performance work systems that have been used in

previous studies. The first is the percentage of the workforce involved in regularly scheduled

meetings to discuss workplace problems. This measure captures something about the extent of

employee participation in the workplace, but it is also fair to say that it is an imperfect measure

as we do not know how much involvement employees truly have in these discussions. The

second measure is whether the establishment has a total quality management program. Hackman

and Wageman’s (1995) study of TQM practices found that problem-solving teams, a central

aspect of high performance systems, was the most common attribute of TQM programs.

       In addition, we control for establishment size (measured as the logarithm of the number

of employees working at the establishment in 1996) and the industry that the establishment

operates in (measured by ten binary variables, the omitted category is “Other manufacturing”).

Table 1 presents a description of the ten industries.

       We do not have detailed measures of the human capital and demographics of the

employees in these establishments other than their average education level. The focus here is on

the jobs per se, but attributes of the employees would allow us to answer other questions as well,

such as whether franchises disproportionately employ younger workers or whether they pay a

premium for equivalent workers as compared to non-franchises.

       The analyses below begin with difference-of-means tests for franchise and non-franchise

establishments followed by regression models that control for the most important characteristics

of establishments that may be spuriously associated with the franchise form. Because the




                                                 13
analyses are examining the possible effect of the franchise form on various practices and aspects

of employment, each such aspect in measured by a different dependent variable and is therefore

essentially a separate model. Whether each equation should have a unique model specification

based on its own theoretical underpinnings is an important question. Without an established

literature to define what such models should look like in each case, however, it is not obvious

what characteristics or management practices other than industry, size, and establishment age are

truly exogenous to franchise status and therefore should be controlled for in the equation. There

are also advantages of consistency in using the same model across equations.

       In addition to direct effects, franchise status may also have indirect effects on the

dependent variables considered here through relationships with other variables. For example,

greater use of part-time jobs may reduce average education levels. If the goal is to see what the

net effect of franchise operations is, then it is sufficient to examine the reduced form of what are

no doubt more complicated relationships: By leaving out possible control variables that could be

endogenous to franchise status, all of the possible indirect effects appear together in the franchise

coefficient.   This approach is sufficient to address the question as to whether franchises are

associated with good jobs. The caveat is that it does not answer the more complicated question

concerning why franchise jobs might be better or worse.

Results

       Table 1 provides descriptive detail on some of the characteristics of franchises in the U.S.

by size and industry classification. Smaller establishments (with less than 100 employees)

contain a slightly greater proportion of franchises than in the overall population (8 versus 5.4

percent). Mid-size establishments (between 101 and 435 employees) have about the same

proportion of franchises as in the economy as a whole, while larger establishments




                                                 14
(establishments with more than 435 employees) have about half as many franchise organizations

as in the overall economy (3 versus 5.4 percent). Franchises are quite rare in manufacturing.

They represent 2.2 percent of organizations in the manufacturing sector versus 5.4 percent in the

whole economy. The distribution of franchise organizations in the service sector is twice as great

as in the economy as a whole (10.9 vs. 5.4 percent), and franchises are disproportionately

concentrated in retail (31.1 percent), in hotels and restaurants (29.7 percent) and in business

services (11.8 percent). They are roughly in proportion to the economy as a whole in most of the

other service industries. As one would expect, franchise status appears to be related strongly to

other important attributes of employers.



                                    -- Insert Table 1 about here –



       The difference-of-means tests in Table 2 show that in terms of human capital, franchises

pay lower wages and salaries both to their non-managerial workers (20.5 vs. 24.7 thousand USD,

p<.001) and to their managerial employees (40.6 vs. 49.1 thousand USD, p<.01). They employ

three times as many part-time workers (6 vs. 18%, p<.001) and twice as many employees who

have less than one year of tenure with the organization (27 vs. 14%, p<.001). The results seem

consistent with the stereotype of “bad” jobs, although franchises are significantly more likely to

have a formal training policy (72 vs. 58%, p<.01) and, on balance, they may provide more

training both in terms of the percentage of employees trained and total training hours. What we

cannot know from these results is the extent to which the differences in Table 2 are driven by

franchise status per se or other attributes that are associated with franchises.

          The regressions presented in Table 3 control for industry and the size and age of the

organization. The results are strikingly different from those in the difference in means tests.

There are no significant differences with respect to pay or benefits for franchises; the signs of the

variables actually point toward higher pay and benefits for franchises. The results for training

are consistent with the idea that franchises provide more extensive and intensive formal training

to their employees than do non-franchise operations. Franchise operations are more likely to

have a formal training policy (ß=.45, p<.1), they train a significantly higher percentage of their

non-managerial workforce (ß=9.34, p<.05) and they provide more training hours per employee

(ß=.4, p<.05). And overall, labor costs per employee are higher in franchise operations. There is

no support for the idea that franchises pursue a strategy of lower expenditures on employees.

Franchises also appear to make greater use of work organization practices associated with

employee involvement, such as work-related meetings (ß=2.26, p<.1) and TQM practices (ß=.56,

p<.01).

          On the other hand, franchises do employ non-managerial employees with fewer years of

education (ß=-.19, p<.1), they have a higher percentage of part-time workers (ß=.03, p<.05), and

have a higher percentage of employees with less than one year of tenure on the job (ß=4.43,

p<.01) than do non-franchise operations.

           The size of the coefficients on the control variables remind us just how important basic

factors like industry and establishment size are in determining employment outcomes.

Consistent with the argument that larger employers provide better working conditions (Brown,

Hamilton and Medoff, 1990), large-sized establishments in this sample are also significantly

more likely to have higher labor costs, provide higher pay for their managers and for their non-

managerial staff, make more investment into the training of their employees, and hire employees




                                                 16
of higher human capital.      But the effects associated with franchise status are also sizeable:

Controlling for industry and employment levels, for example, franchises spend $170,000 more

per year on employees than do non-franchises.

       From among the industry controls, the comparison of the “Franchise” variable with the

“Hotels and restaurants industry” and “Retail” controls provides useful insights, given that most

of the franchises examined in the extant literature operate in these two industry classifications

(e.g. Bradach, 1998; Leidner, 1993; Royle, 2000). The predictor “Franchise” often has the

opposite coefficient than the predictors “Hotels and restaurants” and “Retail”, showing that

franchises do take a different approach to managing their employees than establishments in the

hotels and restaurants and retail industries per se. In separate analyses, available on request, we

examine the interaction between the hotel/restaurant industry variable and franchise status. The

coefficient of the interaction variable across the models in Table 3 generally suggests that

franchises in that industry provide better employment outcomes, although the results are

significant in only about one-third of the cases, possibly because the number of observations in

that industry (101) is relatively small.

       Finally, the control variable that measures the establishment’s turnover rate is significant

in all but three of the equations where it is included. Establishments with a higher turnover rate

provide lower pay and fewer benefits both to their managerial and non-managerial employees.

Their managers and non-managerial employees have lower education levels, and fewer of them

are involved in work-related meetings. Such establishments are also less likely to have TQM

practices.

Discussion and Conclusions

       This study is the first to use nationally representative data to examine franchise

operations and their work practices in detail. The basic question we investigate is whether

franchise forms of operation are associated with lower quality jobs. The results above suggest

that this bad jobs stereotype in franchises may have been based on confounding attributes

associated with franchises rather than franchise status per se. Franchises are concentrated in

smaller establishments, which have fewer resources, and in industries like hotels and restaurants,

which have lower-quality jobs. But within those sectors, franchise operations appear to offer

more sophisticated management practices and to make greater investments in their employees.

Once we control for size and industry, we find little evidence that jobs are worse in franchises

and considerable evidence that they are better than in equivalent, non-franchise operations.

While there is some evidence that franchises may hire less qualified workers (in terms of

education) and use more part-time roles, they spend more on these workers, offer them more

training, and are more likely to engage them in employee involvement-related work systems than

do non-franchise establishments. A fair assessment might be that franchise jobs offer more to

lower-quality workers.

       A related question is whether franchise operations appear to be closer to the scientific

management model or the high commitment model for managing employees. The bad jobs

argument, especially directed at fast food companies like McDonald’s, emphasizes deskilled jobs

based on approaches that look much like scientific management. On the other hand, the fact that

franchises are generally seen as more advanced in their management practices than equivalent

non-franchise operations suggests that they would be more likely to use high performance work

practices than non-franchise operations. Franchises do hire less educated front-line employees,




                                               18
as one would expect from scientific management, but the fact that they spend more money on

their employees is certainly inconsistent with the goal of scientific management, which is to

lower employee costs by deskilling jobs. We also find no evidence that franchises use better paid

and educated managers, as scientific management implies.7 But the most compelling evidence

that franchises are closer to the high performance model is that they make greater use of systems

associated with employee involvement and teamwork. Data that could measure more precisely

the tasks individual workers perform and the aspects of their job design would be helpful in

establishing more clearly the extent to which franchises make use of scientific management as an

organizing principle. Additional data on the attributes of the employees might also make it

possible to tell whether franchisees treat equivalent workers better and whether, for example,

they offer efficiency wage levels of compensation.

        One conclusion to be drawn from the results above is that jobs cannot necessarily be

classified easily into categories of good and bad. The particular choice of attributes and the mix

of outcomes across them suggest that we might need a much more sophisticated system of

classifying to reveal how they stack up for workers.

        Several important puzzles remain about franchises and work practices, though.                         An

obvious question is why franchises invest more in training but also appear to have higher

turnover at least as measured by more low-tenure workers because training investments are lost

when workers leave. Franchise training and other arrangements could be structured to earn a

return in a shorter time period; it is also possible that turnover at franchises is actually lower than

one would expect given the characteristics of the workers they hire (e.g., less educated). But this



7
  An alternative that we cannot examine is that franchises concentrate management skill requirements at
headquarters where the operating systems are designed, allowing them to use lower quality, lower paid managers in
the establishments.


                                                       19
explanation leads to the more general question that has yet to be answered clearly: What is the

comparative advantage of franchises? Spending more per employee than non-franchise

operations would appear to put franchises at a considerable cost disadvantage that somehow has

to be offset – possibly through superior productivity or some other method of adding value. It is

clear, though, that the competitive advantage of franchises is not based on a model of spending

less on its employees. The fact that they continue to exist and at least in many areas thrive

against non-franchise forms suggests that they must be able to offset the labor cost disadvantage

in other ways.

       A logical explanation for the above would be that franchises have productivity

advantages over non-franchise forms. Unfortunately there is little research on this issue, due to

the difficulty of accessing data on franchise financial performance in part because most franchise

chains are privately owned (Combs, Michael and Castrogiovanni, 2004). The papers that do look

at financial performance compare the performance of the various franchisee-owned outlets

(Combs, Ketchen and Hoover, 2004; Darr, Argote and Epple, 1995; Hennessy, 2003), or the

franchisee- and company-owned units of the same chain (Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001; Thomas,

O’Hara and Musgrave, 1990). The financial performance of franchises vs. non-franchise forms

remains for future research to examine. The place to begin would be with the hypothesis that the

greater use of practices such as TQM and training in franchises drives higher performance and

offsets the labor cost difference.
