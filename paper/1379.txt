       The Reaction of Reduced-Form Coefficients to Regime Changes:

                          The Case of Interest Rates



                                   ABSTRACT


       This study investigates whether the apparent intertemporal

instability of a particular reduced-form equation (that for interest rates)

can be explained by changing government policy parameters, or regimes, and

otherwise stable structural parameters. We hypothesize that major fiscal,

monetary, and regulatory policy parameter shifts have been important

sources of that instability. Direct tests imply that reduced-form

coefficients move by statistically significant and economically meaningful

amounts in response to policy parameter change. Allowing for this

systematic parameter variation produces greater stability in the remaining

parameters. Furthermore, in-sample and out—of-sample forecasts from the

proposed model outperform those from the non-responsive parameter

specification.

A. Introduction

    For more than a decade, empirical studies have sought to determine whether

nominal interest rates adjust such that real rates are unaffected by changes in

the anticipated inflation rate (the Fisher neutrality hypothesis).           An

unsettling aspect of these studies is the volatility of the estimated interest

rate response to anticipated inflation over various sample periods.' Estimates

based on data for the 1950s provided low and insignificant values for the

response.2   As the sample period was extended, larger point estimates of the

response were obtained, finally approaching unity. Carlson (1979), Cargill and

Meyer (1980) and Levi and Makin (1979) produce estimated interest rate responses

that decline, often dramatically, when the sample period is extended to include

the first half of the 1970s. Peek and Wilcox (1983) find that the inclusion of

income tax and aggregate supply shock effects reduces, but does not eliminate,

the observed coefficient instability.     This suggests other relevant factors

remain.

    The Lucas (1976) critique suggests that conventional reduced—form coef-

ficients may vary over time due to the dependence of private sector expec—

tational parameters on government policy parameters.   Sims (1982) has recently

countered that this objection should be regarded as no more than a "cautionary

footnote" (p. 108) since policy rules "have not changed frequently or by large

amounts" (p. 138). He argues that in fact there has been little drift in (final

form) parameter estimates through time. Here we test directly whether changes

in policy parameters have produced changes in reduced—form parameters.        We

hypothesize that significant, quantifiable changes have occurred in the policy

parameters that are especially relevant to the reduced form for interest rates.

We incorporate these para—meters in our model and investigate whether the




                                    —1—
apparent intertemporal instabil—ity of the reduced—form equation for interest

rates can be explained by the changing values of government policy parameters

through time and otherwise stable structural parameters.

    We address three major sources of change in the government's policy parame—

t ers :


     1) changes in fiscal policy parameters,

    2) changes in monetary policy parameters, and

    3) changes in financial regulatory policy parameters.

The first category is exemplified by changes in personal tax rates. Peek (1982)

presents evidence that changing tax rates significantly affect interest rates

and that incorporating their movements substantially reduces the instability of

interest rate coefficients.   Furthermore, Peek and Wilcox (1984) find that such

tax effects are complete; that is, there is no evidence of the 'fiscal illusion

suggested by Tanzi (1980).    The second category of policy parameter change is

typified by the October 1979 change in monetary policy (as well as by the 1951

Treasury Accord). The creation of negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs) in

the early 1960s and of six—month money—market certificates in the late 1970s and

the elimination of interest rate ceilings on large CDs in the early 1970s

exemplify the regulatory changes most directly relevant to financial markets.

By reducing the degree of disintermediation when rates rise, these financial

innovations may have reduced the impact of monetary restraint through credit

availability and thus may have decreased the interest elasticity of private

expenditures. To the extent each of these policies influence structural para-

meters, the reduced—form response of nominal interest rates to anticipated

inflation (and to other factors) will vary with regime changes.

    Below we present a simple macro model which highlights the link between


                                     —2—
policy parameters and reduced—form coefficients. Sections C and D describe the

estimation and measurement methodology and present our empirical results. The

final section concludes.


B. A Model of Interest Rates

      This section presents a model of interest rates that embodies both fiscal

and monetary policy parameters.            Solution of the model produces reduced forms

that highlight the link between policy parameter variation and movements in the

reduced—form coefficients. The model consists of IS, LM, wage, aggregate supply,

and monetary policy rule equations. These five relationships can be expressed

in linearized form as


  y — yN = ao      —
                       alr*   + a2AY + a3(X_YN) — a4LIQ — a5SS                      (1)


  M —      — yN = b0 + b1(Y — yN) -      b2i*   +                                   (2)

  W =       + pe -     c1SS                                                         (3)


  P        d+W+d1(Y_YN)+d2SS,                                                       (4)

where the coefficients of all the variables are assumed to be positive and:

      Y = the logarithm of actual real output,

      yN        the logarithm of naturalreal output,

           =    the percentage change in real output lagged one period,
      X =      the logarithm of the sum of real exports and real

            government expenditures,

               tive to its recent growth trend,




                                            —3—
       M =       the logarithm of the nominal money supply,
             =    the logarithm of the non—interest—rate—reactive component
              of the real money supply,

       P = the logarithm of the actual price level,

       pe =       the logarithm of the expected price level,
       W =    the      logarithm of the nominal wage,

       SS =      the supply shock variable,
       a =    the standard deviation of the after—tax nominal interest

              rate,

       r =    the real interest rate,
          =      the after—tax real interest rate,
          =      the   after—tax nominal interest rate.


The two after—tax interest rates are related to the nominal interest rate (i) by

(6) and (7):


         i(1 —      t)                                                               (6)


  r*    1* _pe                                                                       (7)


where t is the marginal tax rate on interest Income and pe is the anticipated

inflation rate.

   Real expenditures depend on the real after—tax interest rate, an investment

accelerator term, exogenous real export and real government demand, and real

shocks emanating from the supply side.                  In addition, the presence of the

liquidity variable (LIQ) allows us to capture the difference between short—run

and long—run IS curves. This difference follows from the assumed differential

adjustment speeds in real and financial markets. Since real variables (such as




                                             —4—
output) adjust more slowly than financial variables (such as interest rates), we

hypothesize a steeper (e.g., vertical) short—run IS curve. The liquidity term

represents accelerations (or decelerations) in nominal money growth relative to

normal. Given an acceleration in nominal money growth, the LM curve would shift

to the right and the economy would move from point A to point B along the ver-

tical short—run IS curve in Figure 1.     Movement down the short—run IS curve is

captured by a temporary downward shift of the flatter long—run IS curve to IS'.

Thus, this term allows us to capture the well known liquidity effect.    If this

higher growth rate persists, LIQ returns to its long—run value of zero and the

IS curve returns to its original position.

   Money demand is hypothesized to depend on output and on the after—tax nomi-

nal interest rate, which represents the opportunity cost of holding money when

interest income is taxed. The third argument in the money demand function (a)

represents a measure of the capital—value risk associated with holding bonds as

alternatives to money in wealth portfolios (see Slovin and Sushka (1983) for

discussion and empirical evidence in favor of this hypothesis). The wage and

price equations embody the natural rate hypothesis.

    Equation (5) posits a monetary authority (Fed) policy whereby the money

supply rises and falls with the expected price level, natural real output, and

the real interest rate. The Fed almost certainly has reacted to other factors

as well, e.g., cyclical unemployment, inflation, international forces, and the

preferences of individual policymakers.      Shifts in the slope parameter ei in

(5), however, can be viewed as capturing some of the major policy shifts of the

postwar period. That parameter measures the extent to which the Fed stabilizes

interest rates in practice, i.e., accommodates. This parameter can be thought

of as a measure of the degree to which the nominal money supply (given e and

pegging of interest rates after the 1951 Treasury Accord, the increased emphasis

on monetary aggregates in the l970s, and the October 1979 shift to reserves

targeting can each be represented by changes in the policy parameter ei. Since

each of these changes involved moving toward a less procyclical monetary policy

(and a steeper effective LM curve), each can be characterized as a reduction in

e1.

      Equations (1—7) can be combined to yield the reduced—form equation for the

nominal interest rate:

The sign of f is Indeterminate a priori.          An adverse supply shock reduces

investment and real wages and thus the interest rate, while at the same time

increasing input costs operating through the aggregate supply equation which

raises the interest rate. The investment—real wage effect might be expected to

dominate, suggesting a negative value for 86. The results presented in Peek and

Wilcox (1983) and Wilcox (1983a, 1983b) support this interpretation.

       The three policy parameters t, e1, and ai are of particular interest. To

the extent that any of these parameters (or for that matter, any of the struc-

tural parameters) vary over time, the reduced—form coefficients will also

change.       Insofar as the structural parameter in question enters more than one

reduced—form coefficient, the B's will covary deterministically. For example,

the marginal tax rate (t) enters all of the reduced—form coefficients in the

same way. An increase in the tax rate will raise not only the interest rate

response to expected inflation, but also all of the other reduced—form coef-

ficients. A decrease in the response of private expenditures to the real after—

tax interest rate (ai) will reduce the denominators of all eight B's by the same

amount.       However, since a1 also appears in the numerator of 81, the interest

rate response to the expected inflation rate will be differentially affected;

the decrease in a1 will raise all of the other reduced—form coefficients, while

the response to expected inflation will be reduced.       Similarly, a decrease in

e1 will raise all of the B's except Bi through its effect on D. But, as with



                                       —8--
al, ei also enters the numerator of .      In   this instance, however, the direc-

tion of the net effect of the change in e1 on      is ambiguous a priori.


C. Methodology

    Equations (9)—(17) Illustrate the relationship between policy parameters and

the reduced—form coefficients.    Our hypothesis is that failure to allow for

movements over time in these policy parameters has contributed to observed

reduced—form estimate instability.    We rectify this shortcoming by including

values of the time series of the proxies for fiscal, monetary, and regulatory

policy parameters.    This allows us to test directly for the significance of

policy changes in explaining reduced—form coefficient variability and to eva-

luate whether the remaining, deeper parameters are stable. Incorporating fiscal

policy parameter movements requires a measure of the marginal tax rate of the

marginal investor, t. If a tax—exempt institution is the marginal investor, the

marginal tax rate is zero.     If individuals are the marginal investors, the

appropriate tax rate is the marginal personal income tax rate. The progressi—

vity of the personal income tax rates makes measuring that rate problematic. As

our measure of t, we use the average marginal tax rate on interest income

constructed from data contained in annual editions of Statistics of Income,

Individual Income Tax Returns (see Peek (1982)). The tax rate is calculated as

a weighted average of the marginal personal income tax rate for each adjusted

gross income class.    The weight for each class is equal to its share of the

total interest received by all income classes.4

    A downward drift in the measured interest rate response to expected infla-

tion as the sample period was extended into the 1970s has been noted by Carison

(1979), Cargill and Meyer (1980), and Levi and Makin (1979). This may be due to

the continuing financial institution deregulation and consequent reduction In




                                     —9—
disintermediation.         A number of regulatory changes reduced the potential for

disintermediation throughout that period (e.g. ,      the creation of negotiable cer-
tificates of deposit, increases in Regulation Q ceilings, the introduction of

six—month money market certificates).          Such changes might reduce the interest

response of private expenditures (a1), thereby lowering the reduced—form coef—
                                                        5
ficient on expected inflation (see equation (10)).

    We allow for changing regulatory policy (and innovation) with a measure of

the effect of such changes rather than attempting to quantify the changes them-

selves. To do so, we take as our regulatory policy indicator, s, the share of

commercial banks' and thrift institutions' liabilities that pay market—related

interest rates. We assume that the interest response of expenditures is a func-

tion of s and DCC:


     a1 =   f + (f1 + f2/s)DCC,                                                  (18)


where DCC is a dummy variable that takes a value of unity when the three—month

Treasury bill yield exceeds the regulation Q ceiling interest rate on savings

deposits and is zero otherwise. Thus, DCC switches on when disintermediation is

likely. The extent to which a1 changes then depends upon the share of liabili-

ties subject to disintermediation. We also allow the IS curve intercept (a) to

move during these periods so as not to constrain the IS function to pivot about

its horizontal intercept:


     a =
      0
            f3   +   f 4DCC.                                                     (19)



In this specification, f(>0) represents the (absolute value of the) interest

response of expenditures in the non—disintermediation periods.            During the

disintermediatlon periods, the value of a1 will increase.            Thus, we expect




                                        —10—
(f1 +           to    be positive.         Furthermore, we expect the increase in a1 to be

larger the smaller is the value of s (f2 > 0). We also expect f4 to be positive

in (19).

    Similarly, we seek a measure of the time series for the money supply policy

parameter, e1.          We obtain an estimate of this series from the following

regression estimated with semi—annual data over our full 1952:06—1983:06 sample

                                                     ,e      D8006 is a dummy variable that takes

the value one during the credit control period in 1980. A linear time trend is

included to pick up the long—term increase in velocity. The last term in (20)

indicates a first—order autocorrelation correction coefficient estimate of 0.90.

     This specification allows e1 ,            the reaction of the money supply to expected
real interest rates, to vary across the regimes of the different Fed chairmen,

but restricts it to be constant within regimes. The four intercept dummies are

included to lessen the likelihood that variations in the overall stringency of

monetary policy across regimes be mistakenly attributed to variations in the

systematic—response coefficient, i.e., to avoid empirically confusing intercept

and slope shifts in the money supply function.                        The estimated time series for




                                                —11—
the money supply reaction coefficient can be read directly from (20).                The

values for e1 are 0.35, 1.38, 1.12, and —0.012 for 1952:06—1970:06,

1970:12—1978:06, 1978:12—1979:06, and 1979:12—1983:06, respectively.                This

series suggests that the Voicker regime has accommodated real rate shocks least

while the Burns and Miller years saw the most accommodation.                The William

McChesney Martin regime appears to have been in between. F—tests allow us to

reject the hypothesis that the money supply reaction coefficient, e1, was the

same across Fed chairmen.6 M is also based on (20). M is                       minus the

estimated trend, credIt control and real—rate—reactIon elements. Movements in

       the intercept dummies plus the error term, u, imply that monetary policy

loosened from the latter 1950s until the early 1970s and has been tighter than

average since the tnld—1970s, especially during the Voicker years.


D. Empirical Results

    1. Estimates Based on Constant Policy Parameters

    This section presents the results of estimating (8) subject to (9)—(19).

When e1, f1, f2, and f4 are taken to be zero through time, constant—coefficient,

ordinary least squares (OLS) suffices.              These restrictions are equivalent to

setting M to equal (M_pe_YN), e1 equal to zero, and a1 equal to a constant. As

a result, (8) can be expressed as:


    i =     + 61e     +          + 3X' + LIQ + 5M' + $6S5     +                    (21)

     Tanzi (1980) suggests that individuals have suffered from "fiscal illusion"

by falling to take complete account of tax rates.         Peek (1982), using a
1960—1979 sample, can be interpreted as testing the hypothesis that individuals

rather than tax—exempt institutions are the marginal investors in the six—month

and one—year Treasury bill market. Alternatively, the null hypothesis could be

that individuals are the marginal investors but ignore income tax considerations

In making their financial decisions. Using the Davidson—McKinnon (1981) non—

nested model specification test, the non—tax adjusted model (equivalent to our

equations (21)—(23) with t = 0) was rejected in favor of the tax—adjusted for-

mulation (equations (21)—(23)) using an index of marginal personal income tax

rates. Employing a more detailed model incorporating supply shock and foreign—

held bond effects, Peek and Wilcox (1983) reconfirmed these results for the

entire 1952—79 period for the one—year Treasury bill rate. We also showed how

changes over time in the correlations between the anticipated inflation rate and

the tax rate and supply shock variable contributed to previously measured inter—

temporal instability in the estimated expected inflation coefficients. Further,

Peek and Wilcox (1984) estimate a specification similar to (21)—(23) with (1—t)

replaced by (1—Ot), where 8 reflects the degree of (lack of) fiscal illusion.

Using nonlinear least squares, the estimate of 8 closely approximates one, indi-

cating no fiscal Illusion.    Therefore, we here restrict 8 to unity, implying

complete adjustment to changes in tax rate policies. From (23), it can be seen

that (1—t) can be factored Out of the coefficient of each explanatory variable.

Using our tax rate series, we can express (21) with constant reduced—form coef-

ficients when we divide each of the right—hand—side variables by (1—t).     The

implied reduced—form coefficients at any time are then the estimated constant

coefficients times the value of (1—t) for that period.

    Table 1 presents the results of estimating (21). June and December averages

of the secondary market yield (on a bond equivalent basis) on one—year U.S.

Treasury bills are used as the dependent variable. e is the Livingston one—

year expected inflation rate, recorded in June and December. This measure of

expected inflation has the advantages of being truly ex ante and of embodying

whatever sophistication agents actually use to form their expectations.7     The

remaining variables are measured with second and fourth quarter data (except a).

Ml is the nominal money supply. e is the price level expected six months ahead

from the Livingston survey data. N, natural real output, is from the Council

of Economic Advisors.   (M_Pe_YN) has been detrended by regressing its log on a

linear time trend and using the residual as M'. LIQ is the difference between

the annualized growth rate of Ml measured from the current to the previous

quarter and its four—quarter growth rate up to that previous quarter. X' is the

logarithm of the ratio of real government expenditures plus real exports to real

natural output. LY is the four—quarter growth rate of real CNP up to the pre-

ceding quarter.    SS is the ratio of the import deflator to the CNP deflator,

adjusted for exchange rate changes. a is the 18—month moving standard deviation

of the after—tax nominal interest rate, lagged one month.      D7983 is a dummy

variable that takes the value one starting with the December 1979 observation.

The June 1980 observation has been omitted due to the presence of credit

controls; otherwise, the full sample is 1952:06—1983:06.

   The estimates in row 1 imply that rises in expected inflation, exogenous

spending, faster real growth, and more volatile interest rates raise rates while

accelerations in money growth, higher real balances, and positive supply shocks

each lower them.    After 1979 interest rates were both surprisingly high and

volatile. Row 2 shows that when the post—1979 period is added to the sample,

 the standard error of the estimate rises by 69 percent and the measure of

 interest rate variability gains in significance.   This appears to confirm the

 popular attribution of the high post—1979 interest rates to sharply increased

 interest rate volatility. Including D7983 in row 3, however, reduces the effect

of volatility to insignificance. The coefficient of 4.21 on D7983 in row 3 indi-

cates that the surprises were large and primarily on the upside.   However, even

allowing for this nonexplained upward shift leaves the standard error of the

estimate much larger than before 1979.

    Adding the post—1979 period seems to change the estimated coefficients rela-

tively little. When a time series of the expected inflation coefficient esti-

mate is generated by rolling over a fourteen—year (n=28) sample using the

specification of rows 1 and 2, however, a different picture emerges. Figure 2

plots this series.    Although these coefficients abstract from changes due to

changes in tax rates, they still exhibit considerable movement. In particular,

the sharp jump in the series after the 1952 and 1953 observations are eliminated

and the early 1970s observations are added to the rolling sample, the downward

drift as the sample leaves the 1950s and enters the 1970s, the rise as the

sample moves into the second half of the 1970s, and the resumption of the

decline as the 1980s observations are included, suggests that major movements

are left to be explained.


    2. Estimates based on Changing Policy Parameters

    To estimate (8), allowing for variations in monetary and regulatory policy

as well as tax policy changes, we substitute (18) and (19) for a1 and a. Later

we wish to calculate the marginal significance levels of each explanatory
variable.   We require an estimate of the numerator of     to obtain a marginal

significance level on M. To obtain a unique set of parameter estimates when

g9 applies to D7983 (not divided by D). Our model predicts that h, h2, h3, and

positive values for g2, g3, g7 and g8, and negative values for g4, g5, and g6.

where the numbers in parentheses below the coefficient estimates can be

interpreted approximately as t—statistics.    They are calculated as the square

root of the chi—square test statistic used to perform the likelihood ratio tests

of the restriction that each of the relevant coefficients was zero.8         The

general pattern of signs and significance of the coefficients in (35) mirrors

the OLS results of Table 1.       The coefficients of particular concern here,

however, are those associated with the regulatory and monetary policy para-

meters, s and e1.

    The estimates of their coefficients are both positive and decisively signi-

ficant, indicating that the reduced form coefficients do in fact respond to

regime changes.     As e1 falls, i.e., as monetary policy becomes less accoin—

modative of real rate shocks, D falls.       The response of interest rates to

changes in the explanatory variables (except possibly for e) then rises, as the

economy is effectively operating with a steeper LM curve. As s rises, i.e., as

the share of liabilities which are unregulated rises, D falls, increasing all of

the reduced—form coefficients except that on e Due to the effect of s on the

numerator of , the increase in s (reduction in a1) will reduce the reduced—

form expected inflation coefficient. As fewer liabilities are regulated, market

interest rate increases induce less disintermediation and less credit rationing.

Less expenditure is deterred by given interest rate increases, generating an

effectively steeper IS curve, as hypothesized.

    Adding D7983 to this specification (not shown) permits us to test whether

the reduced—form coefficient movement that we ascribe to policy shifts remains

when a dummy variable for the later part of the sample is included. The coef—




                                      —19—
ficient estimate of 2.87 (t—statistic =      2.67) on D7983 does indicate that our
model still leaves an important part of the recent interest rate story to be

told. Our expanded specification has reduced the post—1979 dummy coefficient by

one—third, however, and the coefficients associated with e1 and s retain their

significance.

     The summary statistics listed in Tables 1 and 2 suggest that allowing for

changing policy parameters improves the interest rate model. The standard error

of the estimate falls 24 and 30 percent for the short and long samples, respec—

tvely, when we incorporate policy—induced parameter movement. Likelihood ratio

tests more formally confirm the improvement.       The specification that jointly

restricts the a and a parameters to be constant and e to be zero in favor of
                0     1                                   1

the expanded model that posits their movement according to (18)—(20) is rejected

at the 5 percent level. This is true for the shorter sample (1952:06—1979:06)

as well as for the sample that includes the post—1979 period, either with or

without the D7983 dummy. For the longer period, the data also decisively reject

the hypotheses that the coefficients associated with monetary policy and regula—

tory policy individually were zero.     Further, the expanded model is statisti-

cally superior in—sample to the model that includes D7983 but ignores regulatory

and monetary policy changes. Thus, in addition to producing reduced—form coef-

ficients that move as our theory hypothesizes, allowing for structural change in

response to policy change produces a significantly improved specification.

     Figure 3 plots the estimated time series values for , the reduced—form

coefficient for expected inflation implied by (36) and (37). The implied coef-

ficient exhibits a slight downward drift until the mid—1960s, due to a small

decline in the effective tax rate series. Tax schedule reductions in 1954 and

1964—65 and a slight cyclical response to economic slack in the late 1950s and

income growth lifted the effective tax rate and, hence, 8.       rose sharply in

1970 with the higher e1 of the Burns regime. The large fall—off in         in 1979

Is associated with the dramatic decline in e1 attributed to the Voicker regime.

The sharp upward spikes in       reflect the disintermediation effects.     During

potential disinterinediation periods (when DCC takes on a nonzero value), the

interest sensitivity of expenditures (a1) and      rise. The magnitude of these

increases is related to the share of financial institutions' liabilities that

pay market—related interest rates (s).     As s increased over time, the size of

the spikes diminished. After the removal of interest ceilings on large CDs in

the early 1970s, the spikes become almost indistinguishable.

   Though the two series are not directly comparable, the pattern in Figure 3

broadly mirrors the rolling sample estimates in Figure 2 (with the exception of

Figure 2's mid—sample spike). The implied time series of the other reduced—form

coefficients are proportional to (lID).     Given the form of the model and the

particular set of coefficient estimates, changes in a1 and e1 produce values for

these remaining reduced—form coefficients that move inversely to          Figure 3

then shows movements in      and the mirror image of the movements of the other

reduced—form coefficients. Changes in t move all coefficients proportionately.

    Ignoring regime changes may have been responsible for spuriously unstable

estimates over this period. Our model explains not only statistically signifi-

cant movement of structural, and thus reduced—form, coefficients, but economi-

cally meaningful changes in those parameters. Stability tests conducted over a

mid—sample split using the constant policy parameter specification indicate that

specification Is unstable. By contrast, when we allow reduced—form parameters

to respond to regime changes, the resulting specification Is stable.8

     Table 3 lists the actual values of interest rates and the values predicted

out—of—sample by row 1 and in—sample by rows 2 and 3 from Table 1 (constant

policy parameters) and Table 2 (variable policy parameters). The 1980:06 credit

control observation is omitted. The summary measures in Table 3 show that, out—

of—sample or in, the Table 2 equations outperform those from Table 1 over the

most recent period.9 The relative improvement appears to be approximately the

same for either in— or out—of—sample forecasts. In the out—of—sample case, the

mean error is reduced by (4.33—3.01=) 132 basis points (or 30 percent) and the

mean square error by 45 percent.

    Fama and Gibbons (forthcoming) suggest that interest rate—based forecasts

may be better predictors of inflation than survey—based forecasts. To investi-

gate the robustness of our findings, we have substituted a measure of expected

Inflation based on prior interest rates for the Livingston survey measure. We

generate these forecasts using only Information publicly available when the

interest rate was determined each period. The forecast during June depends on

the six, monthly—average Treasury bill yields from December to May and on the

forecast equation coefficients.    The coefficients are obtained by regressing

inflation on a constant and six lags of one—month Treasury yields over the

forty—eight months ending two months before the forecast is made. Using coef-

ficient estimates from a sample that edged closer to the forecast dates (June

and December) would require more information than agents actually had. Using

these expected inflation proxies, likelihood ratio tests of the hypotheses that

the coefficients on the regulatory regime measures and the coefficient on the

monetary regime proxy are zero are rejected for both the pre—1979 and the longer

sample period.   Thus our finding that the reduced—form coefficients respond

systematically to government policy parameter shifts is further substantiated.

E. Concluding Remarks

    There is considerable intertemporal instability in previous interest rate

equation estimates. We hypothesize that major fiscal, monetary, and regulatory

policy parameter shifts have been important sources of that instability.      We

embed estimates of the time series values of these policy parameters in our

model and estimate the deeper, more stable, underlying parameters. The estima-

tes generate reduced—form coefficients that move by sizeable amounts in response

to policy parameter change.   Statistical tests imply that allowing for varying

policy parameters provides a significantly better explanation of interest rates.

These explainable movements in the reduced—form coefficients correspond rather

closely to the heretofore unexplained movements in the rolling sample estimates

obtained from the constant policy parameter model.    The variable policy para-

meter model passes the test of stability that the model which ignores regime

switches cannot.    Furthermore, in—sample and out—of—sample forecasts from the

proposed    model     outperform   the     more    traditional    specification.
