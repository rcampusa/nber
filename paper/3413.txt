                                  AND   GROWTH



                                   ABSTRACT


     A growth model is developed in which finite-lived individuals invest in

human capital1 and investments have a positive external effect on the human

capital of later cohorts, Heterogeneous labor is the only factor of

produotion, and higher-quality labor produces higher-quality goods,

Stationary growth paths, along which humen ospital and the quality of

consumption goods grow at a common, constant rate, are studied.      It is also

shown that if a small eoonomy is very advanced or very backward relative to

rhe rest of the world, then its rate of investment in human capital is lower

uuder free trade than under aurarky.

      In many of the most successful of the newly industrialized economies,

countries like Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and Hong Kong rapid growth in per

capita income has been accompanied by rapid expansion in the volume of

exports, rapid growth in education, and rapid changes In the composition of

curput. The purpose of this paper is to develop a theoretical model that is

useful fot studying this phenomenon,

      In the model developed here, heterogeneous labor, differentiated by

level of human capital, determines a country's comparative mdvsntagej

Empirical work supports this idea. Cross-country differences in hitean

capitat are large and are systematically related to patterns of production

sud trade. Leamer (1984), for example, finds that separating labor into

three categories, defined in terms of human capital, is important in

explaining world trade patterns for manufactured goods.2

      In much of the existing literature on long-run growth, labor of

different skill levels is assumed to be perfectly substitutable in

production. That is, one hour of labor with human capital K is token to be

perfectly substitutable for K hours of labor with human capital of unity.

Under this assumption, relative wage rates for labor of different types is

determined entirely by the production technology. This simplifying device

is useful for many putposes, but it puts severe limitations on the role

international trade can play in determining incentives to invest in human

capital. In the model developed here, wage rates are affected by the

supplies of labor of various types, as well as the demands. The technology

for human capital accumulation is important for determining the former;

preferences and the technology for goods production for the latter.

      The technology for human capital accumulation used here is one that

distinguishes between the private human capital of individuals and the stock
uf knowledge of society as a whole. An individual accumulates human capital

by investing- - going to school- -when young. His level of human ospital upon

leaving sohool and entering the workforce depends en the length of thIs

investment period, which he chooses and on the effectiveness of the time

spent, which is determined by the social stock of knowledge available. His

level of human capital upon entering the wntkforce determines his wage rate

over the rest of his life, which he spenda working. Thus his choice shout

the length of the investment period is made by balancing the opportunity

cosf of later entry into the workforee against higher wage rate apid to sore

skilled labor. Private investment in schooling also has an external effect:

it causes growth in the social stock of knowledge, which increases the

effectiveness of tixe spent in school by later cohorts. Since individuals

are finite lived, the external effect is the only source of steady-state

growth.

      Imperfect substitutability smeng different types of labor is modelled

here by allowing higher-quality labor to perform more highly valued

services. Specifically, there is a continuum of goods, differentiated in

terms of quality, where quality is defined in terms of Lancasterian (1966)

characteristics. Labor is the only factor of production, and only hfghor-

skill labor can produce higher-quality goods. In this setting, as aggregate

human capital grows, output growth consists of dropping lower-quality goods

iron production and adding higher-quality gonds. Houaehold preferences over

characteristics, together with the production technology, determine a
   -                          .           .                  4
dertved demand for labor services of varrous skill levels.

      The model below is developed first for a closed economy. Existence is

proved for a stationary growth path, a competitive equilibrium in which

human capital and the quality of consumption goods grow at a common,
constant rate, It is also shown that if the external effect of investment

is sufficiently small, then the equilibrium is unique. In this case,

changes in the discount tate, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution,

and the productivity of the technology for human capital accumulation affect

the equilibrium growth tate in sensible ways.

      The effect of free trade is then examined for a small economy, under

the assumption that the rest of the world is following a stationary growth

path. It is shown that if the small economy is initially much less

developed or ouch more developed than the rest of the world, then a shift

from autarky to free trade slows its rate of human capital accumulation.

      The test of the paper is organized as follows. In section 1 the

environment is described, and in section 2 competitive equilibria are

defined. Stationery growth paths are described In section 3, and the

existence and uniqueness of such paths is established in     section 4.   The
small open economy is examined in section 5. Section 6 contains concluding

comments, The proofs of all theorems are gathered in the Appendix.



1. The Envi:grrient

      In this section the economic environment is described. Continuity

restrictions end other technical issues are ignored, since they do not arise

in the anslysis of ststionary growth paths.

      The model is formulated in continuous time, beginning at date t —      1.
The economy is composed of many, identical, infinitely-lived households,

each composed of an infinite stream of continuously-overlapping generations.

Each generation is the same   size,   and each individual lives for one unit of

time. Hence the size and demographic composition of the population are
                                      4


constant ovar time.   The size of each cohort is normalized to unity, so the
size of the population at each date is also unity.

      tonsumption and time allocation decisions are made by the honsehold.

Its preferences over infinite consumption streams are stationary and

additively separable over tiree, with a constant tate of pure time

preference. There is no utility of leisure, so the tine of every individual

in every generation is allocated in a way that maximizes the individual's

contribution to household income,

      At the beginning of his life an individual can spend time investing in

human capital. The effectiveness of this investment depends ,upon the stock

of knowledge in society while the investment is undertaken. Let 0(t)

t a 0, denote the stock of knowledge at date t, and let (t) C [0,1]

denote the amount of time invested by members of cohort t. Then

GCt)[(t)] is the human capital of sn individual who is born at date t and

spends fi(t) units of time investing.



Assuisotion 1 The function : [01] -'       is strictly   increasing, strictly

concave, and twice continuously differentiable, with <0) —     I.

There is no soquisition of human capital on-the-job,5 so the individual's

human capital is constant nver his working lifetime, the inter-vel of time

[t ÷ fi(t), t + 1].

      The stock of knowledge 0(t) grows over time at a tate that depends

upon previous cohorts' decisions about investment in human capitsi. As

noted above, this external effect provides the only "engine of growth." For

simplicity, it is assumed that the rate of growth of the initial endowment

at date t depends only on the investment decision of members of cohort tl:
(1)             G'(t)/C(t) —    g[g(t-l)],      t a 1.




Assunotino 2 The function g: [3,1) -.                is   continuous and strictly

increasing, with g(O) —        0.


        The size and composition of the workforce at each date is described by

a function L(z,t), a a 0, t a 1, where L(z,t) is the number (mess) of

individuals in the workforce at date t who have human capital of at least a.

That is, L(. ,   t)   is a gjgj cumulative distribution function for skills in

the wcrkfsrce at date t. Hence for each t a 1, L( ,              t)    is a ncnincreasing.

left-continuous function. Moreover, given the stock of knowledge at date 0,

it follows from (I) that the stock at date t is bounded. Rence for each

t     1, the support of L(' ,       r)   is bounded. Over intervals where L(' ,       c)   is

differentiable, .3L(z,t)/dz is a density function for skills in the

vorkforoe. Each discontinuity in L(. ,          t)   corresponds to a mass of workers

with the same level of skill. Figure 1 depicts a typical cumulative

distribution function for skills and its derivative. There is s continuous

distribution of workers in each of the intervals )t1,z2] and [z4,z5), and

there is a mass of workers with skill level

        To compute L from 0 and fi,           note that L(z,t)        Is the number uf

individuals who are in cohorts r E [t -           1, t] (so they are alive at date c)
for whom c + fl(r) d t (so they have finished investing and begun working

by date r), and for whom G(r)[$(r)J a a              (so they have human capital of at

least a). Hence,

             Figure 1
where       denotes the indicator function for the set A.

        Goods are valued for the characteristics they tontain, At each date

there is a continuum of goods and a continuum of characteristics, both

indexed on R÷. A unit of the good of quality z provides one unit of each

of the characteristics f C O,z, so higher-index goods are better in the

eenae that they provide aore characteristics. The allocation at every date

is described by a function Q(z,t), z     0, t a 1, where Q(z,t) is the

cuantity nf goods consumed at date t that have quality of at least a.

Therefore, like L(.,t), the function Q(',t) is a right cumulative

distribution function, so it is nonincreasing and left-continuous. For

reasons that will become apparent below, the bnund on skill at each date

will also be a bound on the quality of goods available at that date.

        Since each unit of each good of quality a end above contains one

unit of characteristic a, Q(z,t) is quantity of characteristic a

contained in the allocation at date t. Over intervals where Q(' ,t) is

differentiable, -aQ(z,t)/da is a density function for the quality levels

of goods in the allocation. Each discontinuity in Q(' ,     i)   corresponds to a

tease point of consumption goods of the same quality level. The two panels

of Figure 1 can, without change, be interpreted as depicting a typical

allocation of characteristics (the cumulative function) end the

corresponding allocation of goods (its derivative).6

        The technology is unchanging over time and displays constent returns

to scale at each date, Labor of various skill levels is the only input into

production. An individual with human capital a can produce (a flow of)

one unit of any good of quality less than or equal to a. Hence the

feasiblity constraint is
(3)          Q(z,t) S [(st)     all z so,    t a 1.

In equilibrium, since higher-quality products will command higher prices,

each individual will produce the highest-quality he is capable of producing,

and (3) will hold with equality.

      The utility function of the representative household is additively

separable over time, with a constant discount rate p > 0 and a constant

elasticity of intertemporal substitution 1/a > 0. In addition, its

preferences over characteristics at each date are stationery over time,

additively separable, and symmetric. Hence, the intertemporal utility
function ham the form




(4)             c_Pt __j_•_ (U[Q(. t)fl1° dt,



where a > 0, and where



(5)          U[Q(. ,t)] -   u[Q(s,t)]dz.


For a — 1,   (4) is interpreted as f   e)t   in(U[Q(•,t)J dt.



Aesumotion 3 The function u is strictly increasing, (weakly) concave, and

twice continuously differentiable, with u(0) — 0      and u'(O) C m



It is important that u'(O) be finite, so that zero consumption of some

characteristics, end hence of some goods, is possible.
        In the limiting case where u is linear, all characteristics ate

perfect substitutes.      In this case, let c(t) —   U[Q(.   t)] —   f   Q(z,t)dz

denote the total quantity of characteristics consumed at date t. The

intertesiporal utility function in (4) then has the standard form




                   -pt _1_— [c(.t)]1 dt.



Definition A feasible allocation, given the initial conditions [0(t), $(t),

0 at < 1], consists of functions [0(t), $(t), L(z,t), Q(z,t), a a O,t a lJ

such that (l)-(3) hold and the integrals in (4) and (5) are well defined.



2, CompetitiVe Eouilibria

        At each date t     1, there are perfectly competitive spot siaricets for

goods of every quality level and labor of every skill level, Let P(z,t),

and W(z,t), t a 0, t      1,    denote goods prices and wage rates, and let

Et(t)   t a 1, denote interest rates.

        Firma, taking prices and wage rates as given, hire labor of various

skill levels and uaa it to produce goods of venous quality levels. Since

higher-quality goode always command strictly higher prices, a wotker with

human capital z always produces the good of quality t.               hence, in

equilibrium (3) holds with equality:



(3')           Q(z.t) —   L(z,t),   all z   0, all t a 1.



Since perfect competition implies that labor is paid its marginal product,

Firma earn no profits.

        Households, raking as given wages, prices, inrerast rates, and the

stock of knowledge, make decisions about investments in human capital,

labor supply, and goods purchases. Households can borrow or lend at the

market rate of interest, and they have rational expectations (periect

foresight). The household's objective is to maximize its total utility, as

given by (4) and (5), subject to an intertemporal budget constraint.

        First, consider the household's investment decisions. Since leisure

is not valued, each household member divides his time between human capital

accumulation end work with the objective of maximizing the present

discountedvalue of his lifetime earnings--his contribution to family
income. If an individual born at data t, when the stock of knowledge is
0(t), invests for b units of time, then his human capital is 0(.t)(b),
and   he works over the time interval [t + b, t + lj.         Therefore, given the
paths    K(') and W(.,') for interest rates and wage rates, his investment

problem is


                          1    r    t+s
(7)             max f exp- ft             R(v)dv   W[C(t)#(b), t + sJds.
              b€[O,l] b


Hotice that in solving the investment problem, the household ignores the

external effect of its investment decision on the stock of knowledge. Since

the external effect is a function of the economy-wide average rate of

investment, and since each household is negligably small         relative   to the
                                              10


whole economy, each household correctly perceives that its own investment

plans have no effect on the aggrefate.

        Given the initial conditions G(t), (t), Os t < 1, at date 1 and

the function G(t) ,    ta   1, describing the clock of knowledge at all later

dates, and with investment decisions flt), t              a   1, determined by (7), the

household's labor supply function L(h,t), h a 0, t a                   I,     can be calculated

from (7). The household's total, discounted income can then be calculated

by summing over family members, to find the flow of income at each date, and

then summing over time. The household's income at any date t a I is

coaputed by integrating the distribution function L(. ,                t)   against the wage
function (t). Hence family income at date I is                     -
                                                                       j' W(h,t)L(dh,t),
and total, discounted, family income at date I is8

                      17 exp[-     '1 K(v)dv] [-


        Next, consider the household's expenditures. Given market prices

P(.t) at all datee t a        I,     the cost of any allocation function QN,t),

t 5 1, can be calculated by summing expenditures on various goods at each

date and than summing over time, The cost of the allocation at any date

I a I is computed by integrating the cumulative distribution function

Q(.,t) for goods consumed at that date against the price function P(•,t).

Hence total expenditure at date t is -

budget constraint for a household with total discounted incooe Y > 0 at date

t — 1    is

The household chooses a consumption allocation Q(z,t), z a 0, t a 1, to

maximize lifetime utility, as given by (4) and (5), subject to the budget

constraint (9)



Definition A competitive equilibrium, given the initial conditions [G(r),

fl(t), 0    t C 1J at date 1, consists of functions [0(t), fiR). L(r,t).

subject to (8)-(9).



3. Stationary Growth Paths

        None of the existing theorems on existence of a competitive

oquilihriuie appear to apply to this system. The analysis below considers

the more limited issue of the existence of a stationary growth path, a

competitive equilibrium in which all cohorts inveet in human capital at a

constant rate , and the stock of knowLedge grows at the constant rare g(a)

due to the external effect.



Defioition A srationanzroxtk..cmih         is   a competitive equiLibrium     in   which,

for some a a [0,l,



(be)           fi(t) —   a,   all t a 0; and



(lOb)          0(t) —    G(0)e,       all t a 0,



        The main   idea behind   the proof of existence of a stationary growth

path is as follows. Fix any constant rate of investment fl(t) —              am [Oh,
                                               12


and, without loss of generality, let 0(0) —                 I.    Then the path 0(.) for

the stock of knowledge is given by (lob), and L(•,1), the distribution

function Lot skills in the workforce at date 1, can be computed from (2).

Let q() —    L(.,l).     Ic then follows immediately from (2) that the

distribution functions for skill at all later dates satisfy



(lot)         L[e5t])z,t) — q(z),                   all z        0, all t a 1.



The upper panel of Figure 2 depicts L(.;) at date 1 and at a date t when

the stock of knowledge hoe doubled. The doubling in human capital shifts

the distribution function to the right by a factor of two. The lower panel

of Figure 2 depicts the corresponding density functions. Since each

individual spends         units of rime investing in human capital and the size

of the population Is normalized to unity, the size of the workforre is

constant at 1 -     a.   Hence I - a         is the height of each distribution

function and the area under each denaity functionS

        Paths for wages end interest rates can then be constructed from the

marginal utilities of a household that consumes the allocation Q(. 0

L(',•) given by (10c), As will be shown below, the wsge profile also shifts

at the constant rate g(s), and the interest rate is constant. That is



(lOd)          [g(e)(tl)1 — p(z),                   all z a 0, ell t a       I,   and



(be)           R(t) —    r,   all t a   1,


where p(.) — W( .1) is the wage profile at date l. Note that labor quality

available at a fixed wage rate increases mc the rate g(a) over rime.
                                                   13


        Figure 3 displays the wage profiles corresponding to the quantities in

Figure 2.       The upper panel of Figure 3 shows the marginal utilities

associated with the quantities at date I, the function aw(z,1)/3z —                            p'(z)   —

u'[q(t)],   all z       0. The lower panel shows the corresponding integral the

wage profile W(. .1) at date 1. It also shows how wages change over tics.

Since the skill distribution shifts to the right by a factor of two by

date t,   the   wage profile also shifts to the right by a factor of two.

        It can be shown that ClOd) and (lOe) imply that the invsstncnt problea

(7) has a stationary form. Therefore, the only equilibrium condition that

must be checked is the solution to this single maximization problers. If the

solution is , the constant investment rate fixed at the beginning of the

exercise, then there is a stationary growth path with investment rate a.

Thus, establishing the existence and uniqueness of a stationary growth path

involves establishing that a certain mapping from investment rates into

investment rates has one and only one fixed point. This mapping is

developed   formally in the current section and analyzed in the next.

In   this case the distribution function for skill is continuous, with a

strictly decreasing region connecting two flat reflona. Let p(. ;a) be the

price function given by the marginal utilities associated with q( ;a):



(12)           p(C;a) — 0,



                                       Iu'(la).                     se(-,GJ,

                                                                                  a],


If     u is strictly concave, then the price function has a strictly convex

region between two       linear regions.    If u is linear, then the price
                -                      10
function is linear on all of k+.

         If a — 0, then Assumption 2 implies that g(a) — 0,                  so the stock of

knowledge is conarant over time. At date 1, cohorts t e 0,1] are in the

workforoe, and Assumptions 1 and 2 imply that each of them has human capital

G(0)e#(0) —         1.    Since the size of the uorkforce is unity and all

workers have human capital level z — 1.



                            (1,    z e (0, 1].

                              0,   z a (1, ÷).


In   this case the distribution function for skill hes a discontinuity at

z — 1.     The associated prices are given by (12) end

If u is strictly concave, then the price function is composed of two

linear regions, with a kink at z — 1,                   If u is linear, then the price

function is also linear.

       The following assumption ensures that utility is bounded along any

stationary growth path. This reatriction is needed to ensure that the

equilibrium interest rate is positive.



Aasuxaotion 4     p > (1 -     c)g(l).

Theorem 1 establishes necessary conditions for a stationary growth path with

investment rate .



Theorem 1 Let Assumptions 1 - 4 hold. If there is a stationary growth path

with investment rate a              [0,1], then the allocation L(•,•) satisfies

(lOt), where q() is given by (11). Supporting wage rates and interest

rates W(.,.) and RN) satisfy ClOd) and (lOe), where p(') is given by

(12) and (13) and r by11

       The final equilibrium condition involves the investment prohlem for a

typical family member. In an economy that is following a stationary growth

path with investment rate ,                the stock of knowledge is given by (lob), the
wage profile by (lOd), snd the interest rate by (14). Hence the lifetime

income of an individual born at date t who invests for b units of time, as

given by (7). is

(15)          (b;a) — Jb      ep[e(bfla[ds,
which is independent of t.     The following result is then immediate.                -

with investaent rate 5* C [0,1] if and only if a* —
                                                                  arEmaxbC[Gl] (b;a*).


4. Existence oLa StationarY Growth Path

       To establish the existence of a stationary growth path, (15) will he

used to define a continuous mapping from economy-wide inwestment rates                to

optimal individual investment rates b(a). Since p(. ;a) Ia convex, however,

the problem in (15) is not concave. Therefore, the following assumption is

needed to establish that the optimal response b(a) is unique and varies

continuously with .



Assumption 5 For some e >     0,


(16)          (1 -   b)*'(b)/#(b)

                                                         all be   [0,c[.   all a   [0,1],

(17)          r(a) +   '(h)/#'(b)       C   0,    all e,b     ¶c,l], and



(18)          [1 -                  a                ,    all e,b      [,l].
                                      17


The ratio (b)/(b) is the percentage rate of growth in human capital for

additional time invostod, for an individual who has already invested b. The     4

restriction in (15) ensures that for sufficiently low rates of investment,

this rate of growth is large. The restriction in (17) holds if the

technology for human capital accumulation shows strongly diminishing

returns: if '(b)/'(b) is large in ahsolute value. The restriction in

(1B) holds if the utility function fcr characteristics shows only wildly

diminishing returns: If u '(l)/u'(O) is close to unity. Under Assumption 5,

a statinnary growth path exists.12



Theorem 3 Let Asenieptiona 1 - 5   hold, Then there exists at least one

stationary growth path, and all stationary growth paths have investment

rates a* that lie in the interval (el).



The main ides of the proof is as follows. First (16) is used to show that,

for any rate of investment in the reef of the economy, the optiaal tate ci

investment for an individual exceeds e.     Hence there can be no stationary

growth path with a rate of investment less than e.     Then (17) and (18) are

used to show that, for etcnomy-wide investment rates exceeding e, the

individual's best response--the solution to (l5)--is unique. That is,

together (17) and (15) ensure that         is concave enough" to offset the

convexity of p(. a), so that (15) has only one local eaxioum. That

solution is a continuous function of a, so (15) defines a continuous

mapping from the interval [el] into itself. Fixed points of that rapping--

and there rust be at least one--correspond to stationary growth paths.

      Along a stationary growth path, the rate of growth of output, as

conventionally measured, is constant over tire. To see this, choose any two
                                                     is


dates t   and   t       + h, and   evaluate the     labor supplied    at date t   +h    at the

wages prevailing at data t.              It follows from (lot) and (lOd) that

                    -
                         J   w(et)L(e,t 4 h)de

                               —   -S


                               —   - ,jI p(eghz)q   (z)dz —    P(h)


The measured rate of output growth between t and t +                    h   is I'(h)/I'(O) -     1,

This expression depends on h, the length of time between observations, but

act on the date t.             Henhe the rate of growth, if measured at regular

intervals, is constant over rime.

      The presence of an external effect in this model means that

competitive equilibria are inefficient and that there may be multiple

equilibria. Theorem 4 establishes that if the external effect is

sufficiently small, then the equilibrium is unique. in this case, the

effect on the investment rate of changes in                   the rate of time preference p
and in the elasticity of intertemporal substitution 1/c can be determined,
as well as the effect of a change in productivity of the technology for

human capital accumulation, for the case (h) — (1 +                     b),       0 C   p C 1.
Theorem 5 summarizes these reeults,



Theorem 4 Let           Assumptions I -     5 hold. If g' is sufficiently small, then

the stationary growth peth is unique.
                                           19



Thaoram 5    Let Assumptions 1 - 5 hold, and suppose that the stationary

growth path is unique. Then a higher rate of time preference p leads to a

lower rate of investsaenr along the stationary path, as does a lower

elasticity of intertemporal substitution 1/s. If the production function

for human capital has the form (b) — (1 +          b)',   0 C p   <   1, then a higher

value for p leads to a higher rate of investment along the stationary path.



5.   itixeatment   in   a Small Open Economy

       In this section, the consequences of a free-trade policy are examined

for a small economy. Throughout the sectien, the stationary investment rats

a* is taken to be unique. The small economy and the rest of the world have

identical preferences and technologies, and initially each is following a

stationary growth path of the type described above. The two have different

initial stocks of knowledge, however, and knowledge does cot spill over

across international boundaries.

      Without less of generality, let the stock of khowledge in the rest of

the world at date 0 be unity, 0(0) — 1,         Let ihe stock in the small economy

be 0(03 — 9 > 0. As long as autarky prevails, both regions invest at the

rate a*, both stocks grow at the rate g(a*), and the ratio C(t)/C(t) is

constant. If 9 s 1, however, then relative prices differ in the two

countries,   and there are potential (static) gains from tradej3

      In the test of the world, a shift from autarky to free trade leaves

the paths for prices, wages, and the interest rate are unchanged. Hence the

rate of investment e* and the rate of growth of the stock of knowledge g(a*)

there are also unchanged. In the small economy, the shift does alter the

paths for prices and wage rates, and therefore doee alter incentives to

invest in human cmpital. The question, then, is whether a ahift to free
                                               20


       trade strengthens or weakens the incentives for human capital accumulation
'1-
       in the small economy. That is, do individuals in the smell economy, under

       free trade, choose to invest more or less than a*7

                Recall that the investment problem for an individual born at date r in

       the rest of the world is given by (15). Suppose that the smalt economy
       makes a permanent shift to free trade at date r. Then the investaent
       problem for an individual born at that date in the small country is similar,

       except   that the human capital term, the first argument of p in (15), must
      be multiplied by 0.     Hence, the modified version of (15) takes the form



       (19)           (b,;a*) —     J er5p[eR*5)(b);a*]da,
      If Assumptions 1-5 hold, then for each > 0
                                                      the problem '%e[o 1b*)
      has a unique solution (see Lemma 4 in the Appendix). This solution, call it

      b*(0), lies on the interval (,l) and is characterized by the first-otder

      condition II1rbt(0),6;a*] —0. The function b* describes the optimal rate

      of investment for sn individual in the small economy as a function of the

      relative size of the stock of knowledge there. By definition, b*(l) —        a*.
               First, note that if the utility function u over characteristics is

      linear, then (12) and (13) imply that p is linear. Hence the parameter

      simply multiplies the expression on the right side of (19), so the optimal

      investment rate is independent of 0. That is, b*(0) —      e*   all   > o,

      Therefore, the stock of knowledge in the small economy grows at the rate

      g(a*), and its relative position does not change. In this case free trade

      has no effect on the investment rate or growth rate of the small economy, or

      on its relative position over time.
                                      21


     The intuition behind this result is very   simple.   If u is linear,

then all characteristics are perfect substitutes. In effect, there is only

one characteristic, and higher-quality labor produces proportionately note

of it. Therefore, labor inputs of all quality levels are perfectly

substitutable, and there Is no incentive for dissimilar countries to trade.

Hence free trade does not affect investment or grcwth rstea.

      If u is strictly concave, then (12) and (13) imply that p has a

strictly convex region between two linear regions. In this case, the

following additional restriction is needed.



Assueittion 6 '(b)/(b)       g(a*), all bc [0,1],



Asenieption 6 states that the percentage rate of increase in an individual's

human capital for incremental time investments aiways exceeds the percentage

reta of increase in the stock of (social) knowledge due to the exrernsl

effect as time passes. This restriction, like those made previously, holds

if the external effect is not too strong.

      Theorema 6 - 8 describe the effects of free trade on the incentives to

invest in human capital in the case where u is strictly concave.       Note

that 9[b*(9)] deecribes the human capital upon entry into the labor

force, under free trade, for an individual in the small economy.



Theorem 6 If Assumptions i - 6 hold, then 9[b*(9)] is strictly

increasing in 9.



flggjgJ.    Let   Assumptions I - 6 hold, and ssaume that u is strictly

 concave. Then there exists 9 C I and b <       a* such thet h*(9) — h      for

     8 a 8; and there exists I > 1 such that b*(8) < a* and b* is strictly

1'   decreasing for 8   > 8,   with lin8b*(8) — b.


     Theorem 8 Let Assumptions 1 - 6 hold, and assume that u is strictly

     concave and that -u"(cj)/u(q) is rrnnincreasing on (0, 1 -   a*]   .   Then

     b*(8) is strictly increasing at     — 1.



           Theorem 6 states that under free trade the optimal final level of

     human capital for an individual in the small economy is a strictly

     increasing function of the stock of kncwledge there. It is reassuring to

     find that the model delivers this sensible, if unsurprising, conclusion.

     Theorems 7 and 8 imply that b*(8) is as sketched in Figure 4. Since the

     relative position of the small economy improvss or deteriorates as b*(8)

•
     exceeds or falls short of a*. this figure can be used to study the short-

     run and long-run dynamics of the system.

          The first part of Theorem 7 states that if the small economy is

     sufficiently backward relative to the rest of the wotld, then the optimal

     investment rate for an individual there is less than the steady-state rate

     and is independent of the degree of relative backwardness. The intuition

     behind this result is very simple. Since high-skill lahor is relatively

     abundant in the rest of the world, the effect of free trade in the small

     economy is to lower the relative price of the goods produced by high-skill

     labor. Hence the incentives to acquire skill are reduced. The long-run

     dynamics are then clear: the sash economy falls ever farther behind the

     rest of tha world in terms of human capital. It does not follow, however,

     that the small economy is made worse off by free trade. The gains from

     trade may outweigh the loss from slower growth in human capital.

       The second part of Theorea 7 states that if the small economy is

 sufficiently highly developed relative to the rest of the world, then the

 optimal investment for an individual there is less than a* and decreases

with the relative level of development.14 The intuition behind this result

is that even with modest levels of investment, individuals in the smsll

economy are highly skilled relative to labor in the rest of the world.

hence their opportunity cost of investment is high and theit optimal

investment rate is low. In the short-run,             then,   the stock of knowledge in

the snall economy grows at a rate less than g(at), and its relative

advantage shrinks. Theorem 8 provides information about the long-run

dynamics.      Since b is increasing at $ —         1 and b*(i)   <   aft,   it follows that
b*(9) —   a*   for some 1 < G < 7,   as   shown in Figure 4. After its relative

position has fallen to 9, the smell economy invests at the rate at, its

stock grows at the rate g(a*), and its relative position is unchanged. As

before, the welfare effects of free trade are ambiguous.

 •    Figure 4    also provides information about the effect of free trade on

investment in a small open economy that begins with a stock of knowledge

just slightly larger (smaller) than the stock in the rest of the world. At

least in the short run, the small economy invests at a higher (lower) rate

than at, so its stock of knowledge diverges even farther from the stock in

the rest of the world. The long-run behavior of the system is also clear

from Figure 4: in genersl, there are an odd number of steady states,

including (at least) the points $ —       0,    1, and 9, with stable and unstable

points alternating.

6. Conclusions
     The model analyzed here has emphasized the role of decisions about

human capital accumulation in determining the rate of growth. Pithin this

context, international trade affects growth by affecting the incentives for

schooling or other investments in human capital. This view of growth and of

the relationship between trade and growth raises a number of questions.

      Distinguishing between individual human capital and the aocial stock

of knowledge, as has been done here, allows a clearer discussion of ihe

incentives and aechacisns governing rhe growth of each, The individual

investment problem can be treated in a standard, decision-theoretic way, as

it has been bore. The growth in the stock of knowledge is more problematic,

however. Here it has been modeled simply as an external effect.

     An interesting extension of the present work would be to introduce a

separate research activity, like new product development, that augments rho

stock ot knowledge. If both new blueprints end better-trained workers are

needed to produce higher-quality goods, then investments in R&D and

in conventional human capital are complementary, and the incentives

governing them are linked. The models of growth based on R&D in Aghion and

Hewett (1939) and Groesmen and Helpman (1939), for example, provide

frameworks within which conventional human capital might he incorporated.

      The location of the external effect, here at s level that can be

called national, is also important. The presence of effects that are

external to the family immediately implies that the competitive equilibria

of the model are inefficient. Tee if trio investment is undertaken, so at

rhe margin, subsidies to education, child labor laws, and other policies

that encourage investment will raise welfare. Similarly, as shown in

section 5, the presence of effects that are internal to the nation implies
                                     25


that free trade may adversely affect investment and growth. To the extant

that the externalities operate at a lower level, within the family. or at a

higher one, internationally, these contlusions will be changed.

      The analysis above has stressed intreases in the quality of schooling

rathet than the quantity (years) as the source of long-run growth.

Conventional methcde of measurement pick up only the latter, however, and it

is far from obvious how the former tan be measured. In the ntndel above,

quality improveaentz can be determined from the shape of the age-earnings

profile. Rut if on-the-Job learning is present as well, then the age-

earnings profile confounds the two. An interesting eopirical issue is how

increases in human capital due to improvements In the quality of schooling

might he measured.

      The conclusion that trade may impede growth for a small, backward

economy also follows from a variety of other models In which static

comparative advantage determines patterns of long-run growth and trade.

Recent papers by Roldrin and Scheinlunan (1988), Krugman (1987), Lucas

(1988), Stokey (1989) • and Young (1989) have explored aodels in which

learning by doing Is the only source of productivity gains. If the

Industries in which the less developed country has a static comparative

advantage are industries In which there ate limited opportunities for

learning, then the affect of free trade is to speed up learning in the more

developed country and to slow it down in the less developed one. The aodel

here shows that similar reasoning applies when the external effect operates

at arm's length from the production process. An interesting question is

whether selective trade restrictions might ha useful In allowing a country

to protect the incentives to invest in human capital accumulation, while at
                                      26


the same tiae allowing it to capture a substantial portion of the static

gains from trade.

      Finally, it is clear that the production technology, which includes no

coaplementarities between labor of different skill levels, is important in

arriving at many of the concluaions. If such ceaplementarities were

present, and if trade in intermediate goods allowed them to he exploited

across international boundaries, then free trade might have very different

effects on the incentives for human capital accumulation.

         The ptoof of Theorem 1 draws on the following two lemmas.

Proof of Theorem 1 Suppose there is a stationary growth path with

Hence by Lemma 1, for each t                a 1, L(. ,t)   solves   (A.i) for the prices

J(.,t) given by (lOd) and expenditures y(a). Hence by Lena 2, the

        The   proof   of Theorem 3 draws on the following two lemmas.



Lemma 3 Let Assumptions 1,3, and 5 hold, fix a c [0,11 and > 0, and define


                                     1
(A.3)           *(b,8;a) —

Then t(•,9;a) is differentiable, with 91(b,$;a) >0, all be [O,E].

Lemma 4 Let Assumptions 1, 3, and 5 hold, and fix a C                           El]   and 9 >   0.
Then there exists exactly one value b c (,f) such that P1(b,9;a) — 0, and

this value is the uniqua solution to the problem: maxb[olI W(b,6;a).



f_f It follows from Leomia 3 that 'P,(s,8;a)                         > 0,   from (4.4) that

           C   0,     and from Assumptions 1 and 3 that P1(. ,O;a) is continuous

on ]s,l]. Hence there exists at              least      one value b for which 1(b,6;a) —         0,
and it suffices to prove that ¶1i1(b,6;a) — 0                        implies that '911(b,9;a) C 0.

        Differentiating (4.4), suppressing a as an argument of eli.

functions, and substituting from (4.4), we find that P1(b,B;a) — 0                            implies

Proof of Theorem I Note that *(b;a) —                        '(b,1a),   all a,b e [0,1). By
Theorem 2 and Lemma 4, there is a stationary growth path with investment

rate a* e k,l[ if and only if 1(a*;a*) —                        0.   It follows from Lemma 3 that

that #1(a;a) is continuous on (,l[. Hence there exiots at least value
a* for which *1(a*;a*) — 0.                  Together, Theorem 2 end Lemma 3 rule out

stationary growth paths with investment tatas on [0,![. 0



Proof of Theprem4 It follows from (12) and (13a) that for am [0, 1 -                                a[,

Therefore, evaluating (A.4) at b — a                     end 9 — 1,     substituting from abovo

Proof of Theorem 5 Let r(a,p) and H(a,p) denote the functions defined

r(a,p) > 0 and since H(a,p) depends on p only through the interest
rate, H(a,p) C C. The claim then follows iron the fact that H5(a,p) C 0.

        Define r(a,c) and H(a,ce) as above. Since r(a,a) > 0 and since H(a,c)

depends on a only through the tnterest rate, the sane argument applies.

        Finally, define }1(a,p). Since '(b)/(b) —                           M/(l    + b), clearly

H(a,j) > C. The claim then follows from the fact that H(a,p) C 0. 0

                                                                           —   0. Then (AN) also implies
that b*(8) —          b,       all 9 C     9.
         Next, define 9 by e°4(b*(9°fl                                  g(a*)(l.a*)(5)          By Thecrem 5,

9° is well defined and 9° > 1.                        It also follows from (13a) and (A.4) that



(A.12)            1(b,9;a*) —               C   + 8u'(O)Nb),                if o(b) >
where
                  C —          -                                       -    S(l5*)(a*)u(o)) >           0.



Since    r(a*) C      0, far some i             suffioiently large, t1(a*,9;a*) C0, all 9 >
Than by Lemma 4, b(#) C 5*                         all   9>
         Recoil   that b*'(6) has the sign of iV12]b*(O),9]. Using (12) and (l3a)

to evaluate (AS), we see that for 6                              6°,        the term in braoes      is negative

and the integrand is identically zero, hence b*'(6) <0, all 8 a 80.
Finally since C > 0, since C(b) — 0                            only if b —   b,    and since       r'   is
continuous at b, it follows from (AU) thac b*(9) - b                                as 8


Proof of Theoreet 8 It suffices to show that W13(a*11;a*) > 0. Note that

for any function f that is differentiable on an interval [A,BJ,

f(B) —   f(A)   ÷ Bf'(B) -            Af(A)   -
                                                    vf(v)dv.        Choosing A —     (a*)      sod

                                                                      Ø(a*)p1[(a*)],

                                                                             1a*
                p[eS(l_a*)]                                             -
                                                                            J0     e251g2p11(e)dv,

Therefore, evaluating (A.B) at (a*,l) and using (13a), we find that

                                  Fpptnotes



  A static model in which human capital accumulation determines comparative

advantage is developed by Findley and Kierzlcowski (1983) ,   who analyze a two

sector two-country model of trade in which unskilled labor and °classrosms"

are primary factors, and skilled labor is an intermediate product They do

not consider the issue of growth, however.



2 Learner's results confirm earlier work by Keesing (1966, 1971) analyzing

nba mix of labor skills in imports and experts of the indnstrialized

countries, and by Baldwin (1971), Branscn and Jutes (1911), and Waehrer

(1968) establishing that U.S. experts are intensive in the use of human

capital.



  The model of threshold effects in Ararisdis and Drsren (1990) uses a

technology for human capital accumulatioc very similar to the one used here.



  A similar framework io used in Stokey (1988) in a model of learning by

doing, and in Stekey (1989) in a static, twa-country model of trsds.



  The assumption that no skills are acquired on the job leads to    an sdd age-

earnings profile: it is downward sloping aver the individual's entire

working lifetime. This could be remedied by incorpnreting some version cf

Rosen's (1976) medal of human capital accumulation. This would permit human

capital to grow after an individusl begins working, giving a more reasonable

age-earnings profile.

 6 See
         Stokey (1988) for a more derailed description of the relationship

 between allocations of characteristics and goods, and of prices for

 allocations of either sort.



   The wage rates for types of lebot in zero supply are, within some range,

 indeterminate. Equation (6) imposes a particular pricing convention for

 these types of labor: they are priced at the lowest wage rate consistent

with zero demand by firms.



8 It is also possible to calculate total, discounted, family income by

calculating the total discounted income of each family member and then

aggregating across faoily members. Care must be taken to include the income

earned after date 1 by family members in cohorts t      [0,1).


  Implicit in Clod) is a particular normalization for prices at each date:

they are normalized so that current output evaluated at current prices is

constant over time. The choice of normalization convention is, of course,

purely a matter of convenience, but it does affect the interest rate.



10 The
         prices of goods in zero supply are, within some range, indeterminate.

Equations (12) and (13) impose a particular convention for them: they are

priced at the lowest price consistent with zero demand by households.



It The
         supporting prices are unique, given the conventions for pricing

commodities in zero supply (see footnotes 7 and 10) and for normalizing spot

prices at each date (see footnote 9).

12 A   parametric   family of examples that satisfy Assumptions 1 -   5 is the

following: (b) — 1 +          4V;   g(a) — Ax,   0 C A C 1/2; u(q) — (1   -


  > C;      1; Cc p C 1/2; p + A + s C .Pn(3/2);
          a —                                               — 1/18.
                                                               It is

immediate that under these parame ter restrictions Assumptions 1 - 4 and

(Ii) and (17) hold. For > 0 sufficiently smell (18) also holds.

         some cosetodicies,

heterogeneity    also creates migration pressures. These are ignored in the

analysis here.



14 Under free trade with a small, more advanced economy, small quantities oi

previcusly unproduced goods become available in the rest of the world.

Under autarky, the prices of these goods were, within some range.

indeterminate. Under the pticing convention in equations (12) and (13),

however (see footnote 10), the prices of these goods remain unchanged under

free trade with the small economy.
