                                               ABSTRACT

This paper explores the impact of immigrants on the imports, exports and productivity of service-
producing firms in the U.K. Immigrants may substitute for imported intermediate inputs (offshore
production) and they may impact the productivity of the firm as well as its export behavior. The first
effect can be understood as the re-assignment of offshore productive tasks to immigrant workers. The
second can be seen as a productivity or cost cutting effect due to immigration, and the third as the
effect of immigrants on specific bilateral trade costs. We test the predictions of our model using differences
in immigrant inflows across U.K. labor markets, instrumented with an enclave-based instrument that
distinguishes between aggregate and bilateral immigration, as well as immigrant diversity. We find
that immigrants increase overall productivity in service-producing firms, revealing a cost cutting impact
on these firms. Immigrants also reduce the extent of country-specific offshoring, consistent with a
reallocation of tasks and, finally, they increase country-specific exports, implying an important role
in reducing communication and trade costs for services.

          This paper explores the impact of immigrants on the imports, exports and productivity of service-

      producing firms in the U.K. Immigrants may substitute for imported intermediate inputs (offshore produc-

      tion) and they may impact the productivity of the firm as well as its export behavior. The first effect can

      be understood as the re-assignment of offshore productive tasks to immigrant workers. The second can be

      seen as a productivity or cost cutting effect due to immigration, and the third as the effect of immigrants

      on specific bilateral trade costs. We test the predictions of our model using differences in immigrant inflows

      across U.K. labor markets, instrumented with an enclave-based instrument that distinguishes between ag-

      gregate and bilateral immigration, as well as immigrant diversity. We find that immigrants increase overall

      productivity in service-producing firms, revealing a cost cutting impact on these firms. Immigrants also

      reduce the extent of country-specific offshoring, consistent with a reallocation of tasks and, finally, they

      increase country-specific exports, implying an important role in reducing communication and trade costs for

      services.

1     Introduction

The connections between immigration and productivity, and between immigration and trade, have been the

focus of active research in recent years. Several papers have analyzed the role of immigrants, especially highly

educated ones, in promoting skill diversity which can generate positive productivity effects for firms (see for

instance Ottaviano and Peri 2012, Ortega and Peri 2014, Peri, Shih and Sparber, forthcoming and Ghosh, Mayda

and Ortega, 2014). Other papers have focused on the role of immigrants in promoting specialization and the

division of jobs along the manual-complex task spectrum (Peri and Sparber 2009, Damuri and Peri, 2014, Foged

and Peri 2015). Within this literature researchers have also recognized that immigrants may be substitutes for

the performance of tasks offshore (Ottaviano et al 2013), thereby generating a cost-reduction effect that may

increase firm productivity in the same manner as offshoring (Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg 2009). To the extent

that this substitution effect exists, it will produce a negative correlation between the employment of immigrants

and imports of intermediate goods (i.e., “offshoring”) at the firm level. A separate branch of the literature has

instead analyzed the effect of immigrants in promoting goods exports via the reduction in bilateral trade costs,

by enhancing information flows, trust and linkages between countries (see Felbermayr, Grossman and Kohler

2012 for a review of these studies).

    Most of the literature described above has analyzed trade in goods while omitting any discussion or analysis

of trade in services. As a result, the literature has focused narrowly on firms in the manufacturing sector.

To the best of our knowledge, no paper has analyzed the impact of immigration on the imports, exports and

productivity of firms who trade in services. While immigrants’ origin-country networks may lower the costs of

both goods and services trade, selling services in foreign markets may require overcoming barriers that are more

significant and more pervasive than in the trade of goods. For instance, selling business services abroad requires

a relatively nuanced understanding of the idiosyncrasies of country-specific business culture. Similarly, selling

legal services abroad requires a deep understanding of the subtleties of a country’s legal system. In this respect,

delivering services effectively across country borders requires a sophisticated and detailed understanding of the

specific foreign markets. Immigrants from those countries may be particularly useful in enhancing and refining

that understanding.

    In this paper, we analyze the impact of an increase in total immigration, as well as of immigration from

specific countries, on firm productivity (measured as gross value added per worker) in the service sector and on

the firm’s bilateral imports and exports of services with those countries. In doing so, we are able to separately

estimate three effects of immigration: a “productivity (or general export promotion) effect”, due to the overall

cost reduction in production; an “import substitution effect”, due to the reduction in the relative cost of having

some tasks (services) performed domestically by immigrants rather than being moved offshore; and a “specific

export promotion effect”, due to a reduction in the bilateral costs of exporting.


                                                        2
   We do this in the context of the service sector in the U.K., the world’s second most popular immigrant

destination (in absolute numbers) and the second largest service trader (in value). Just in 2013, approximately

half a million immigrants arrived in the U.K.1 Figure 1 shows the average share of foreign-born workers over

the period examined, for several U.K. labor markets. Formally, the labor markets considered in the figure, and

in the rest of the paper, are Travel to Work Areas (or TTWAs for short), a U.K. geographic unit defined to

encompass areas in which the bulk of people both work and live. Hence they represent self-contained labor

markets. Those shown in Figure 1 are those whose immigrant population share was above the national average

in the period that we consider (1999-2005). The figure suggests a significant geographic heterogeneity in the

presence of immigrants, which generates a corresponding heterogeneity in the supply of the specific skills that

they possess, variation that we will leverage in our analysis. We also note that during this period services

exports and imports were important and growing, accounting for 9.4 percent and 7.4 percent of U.K. GDP,

respectively. Figure 2 documents the volume of trade by type of aggregate service in which U.K. firms are

active, where we see that various types of Business Services as well as Royalties and Licensing constitute the

bulk of value of U.K. imports and exports.2 In the empirical analysis we exploit these data at the firm level over

the period 1999-2005, where we link information on firm characteristics with information on the destination of

the exports and origin of the imports for each firm. We further link this firm data with data from the U.K.

Quarterly Labour Force Survey, which describes worker characteristics across local labor markets (TTWAs).

We consider inflows of new immigrants into a TTWA as reflecting changes in the immigrant supply in the local

labor market.

   Several stylized facts are consistent with the channels of firm response that we explore. First, services

imported by U.K. firms (such as accounting, technical, or computer services) may subsequently be reassigned

from the overseas (offshore) location to in-house provision if the individuals performing them immigrate to the

U.K. These services may have a degree of country and cultural or institutional specificity such that immigrants

from those countries may in fact be essential in order to produce them in-house. Figure 3 presents a correlation

that is consistent with this notion. The figure plots the 1999-2005 change in the share of immigrant employment

across TTWA-sector and country of origin cells against imports of services by local firms in the sector-TTWA

from the same country. The negative and significant relationship between them is consistent with substitutability

between the two. At the same time, some final services that are exported, especially those requiring knowledge of

the language, institutional settings or norms of a country, could be exported more efficiently if some individuals

from the country migrate and work in the U.K. Figure 4 provides a stylized fact consistent with this idea. The

figure shows a positive relationship between the 1999-2005 change in the share of immigrants in a labor market

and country-of-origin cell and the change in bilateral exports (to the same country) of services from the same

                                                                    3
labor market. Next, Figures 5 and 6 consider the correlation between aggregate immigration in a labor market

(TTWA-sector) and aggregate imports and exports. They clearly show that there is a positive relationship

between the immigrant share in a local labor market and aggregate exports and imports of services. In sum,

these stylized facts indicate a negative correlation between bilateral immigrants and offshoring, and a positive

correlation between bilateral (aggregate) immigrants and bilateral (aggregate) exports.

    Motivated by these facts, we develop a simple model in which the presence of immigrants may generate these

correlations. First, in the model immigrants substitute for offshore workers and, therefore, for the imports of

intermediate services (an “import substitution effect”).3 Second, they increase firm productivity and hence total

exports by reducing the labor costs faced by the firm (a “productivity” or “general export promotion effect”).

Finally, they reduce the specific cost of exporting to their country of origin, by improving communication and

delivery of the service (a “specific export promotion effect”). The offshore substitution effect and the export

promotion effect are very likely to be country-specific, due to the specificity of traded services. On the other

hand, the overall productivity effect is generated by immigrants more broadly, and potentially by their overall

diversity. Hence we can distinguish between these effects by exploring the impact of an exogenous increase in

the number and diversity of immigrants on the productivity of the firm and, separately, the effect of an increase

in immigrants from a specific country on the level of imports and exports from those countries. The literature

has thus far not attempted to separate these effects from one another, and we believe that this approach is

particularly relevant for the case of service-producing and service-exporting firms, which may reap relatively

large benefits from the country-specific knowledge and skills of immigrants.

    Our main empirical findings confirm the implications of the model and can be summarized as follows:

(i) We find a bilateral import-substitution (offshore-reduction) effect of immigrants; (ii) We find a bilateral

export-promotion effect of immigrants, particularly for language-intensive and institutional-knowledge intensive

services; (iii) We find a positive productivity effect of aggregate immigration that, in some cases, is associated

with country-of-origin diversity.

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related literature and Section 3 describes

the data we use. Section 4 presents some basic facts regarding immigration and services trade in the U.K. Section

5 presents a model and discusses the predictions that the model generates. Section 6 describes the details of the

empirical specification and of the identification strategy, whose results are then presented in Section 7. Section

8 provides some concluding remarks.
   3 We note that, anecdotally, this is consistent with stories told in several sectors. For instance, many Silicon Valley firms claim

that they must negotiate the margin between hiring software engineers from sub-contractors in Bangalore and sponsoring H1B work
visas for the same workers in the U.S.




                                                                  4
2      Related Literature

Beginning with Gould (1994) and Head and Ries (1998), a large literature has explored the effect of immigration

on bilateral trade flows, typically finding an important role for immigrants in facilitating trade with their country

of origin – i.e., immigration and trade (especially exports) are typically found to be complements. In particular,

immigrants are found to reduce barriers to exports by facilitating communication between firms and reducing

set up costs in the destination country (Rauch and Trindade, 2002). Immigrants may, at the same time, demand

goods and services from their home countries, leading to an increase in imports. Putting these ideas together,

many researchers have looked for different effects of immigrants on imports and exports. Recently, it has

been pointed out (by Ottaviano et al 2013 among others) that, when a good is part of a production chain,

such that firms must decide whether to produce the good locally or overseas (offshore), overseas workers and

immigrants may be substitutes in production. Increased immigration may reduce imports of intermediate goods

as immigrants can be employed by firms to produce those intermediate goods in house. On the whole then, it is

not clear whether one should expect a positive or negative effect of immigration on trade and this effect could

be different for import and export.

     In terms of the economic magnitudes involved, immigrants seem to generate a substantial amount of trade

on average. For instance, Genc et al (2011) perform a meta-analysis of this literature and conclude that a 10

percent increase in the number of immigrants to a country increases the volume of trade by 1.5 percent. At

the same time, the literature has pointed out for a while that the immigrant-trade relationship may be different

depending on the type of good being traded (Rauch and Trindade, 2002) and on the initial stock of immigrants

(Gould, 1994), among other dimensions. For our purposes, it is important to note that, while several of the

above considerations about the connection between immigrants and trade should apply very strongly to service

trade, so far no paper has explored such nexus.4

     A more recent branch of the literature focussed on immigration (e.g. Ottaviano, Peri and Wright, 2013) has

estimated the productivity impact of immigrants. In this framework productivity gains may arise simply from

the cost-savings realized from hiring lower-cost immigrant workers (if a firm can discriminate wages of natives

and immigrants). Beyond this, several studies find evidence suggesting that the change in skill mix in a local

labor market due to immigration may induce firms to adopt new production techniques that use the immigrant

labor factor intensively. These new techniques, in turn, may generate productivity gains (Beaudry and Green

2003 and 2005; Beaudry et al 2010; Caselli and Coleman 2006). Another channel through which immigration

may foster productivity gains is through increased competition or specialization of production activities between

natives and immigrants. Peri (2012) estimates the long-run impact of immigration in U.S. states and finds a

positive effect on state-level TFP that can be explained in large part by increased specialization. Peri, Shih and
    4 An   exception is Gheasi, et al (2011) who explore the impact of immigrants on tourism.



                                                                  5
Sparber (forthcoming) find a positive long-run effect of foreign scientists and engineers on productivity in U.S.

metropolitan areas. Similarly, estimates from Ottaviano et al (2013) suggest a positive, short-run productivity

effect at the industry level, while Brunow, Trax and Sudekum (2013) find little direct impact of immigrants in

Germany on firm-level productivity, but they do find a positive effect that operates through immigrant diversity,

especially at the local labor market level. Paserman (2013) exploits the mass migration of high skilled workers

from the Soviet Union to Israel in the 1990s, finding no overall productivity effects related to the immigrant

share, though he does find a positive effect in high-tech industries. Overall this line of research seems to find

positive productivity effects of immigrants, however it does not focus on the service sector and it does not

connect with the literature on firm imports and exports, both of which will be important contributions of this

paper.



3      Data

Our dataset combines U.K. data on workers, firms and trade in services over the period 1999-2005. These

data are collectively compiled from three sources: the Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS), the Annual

Respondent’s Database (ARD) and the International Trade in Services (ITIS) dataset. The QLFS is a one

percent sample of individuals in the U.K. and it includes a variety of demographic, education and work-related

information, including the geographic location and industry in which an individual works. The ARD provides

information on U.K. businesses and it is the equivalent of the U.S. Longitudinal Respondents Database. It is

administered by the Office of National Statistics and the data are drawn from the Annual Business Inquiry. The

data consist of the full population of large businesses (those with more than 100 or 250 employees depending

on the year) as well as a random sample of smaller businesses.5 The ARD includes many firm-level variables

and, for our purposes, the most relevant will be the total value of imports and exports of services by the firm,

as well as the 4-digit industry and geographic location of the firm. We can also control for various firm features

such as capital expenditures and employment.

     The ITIS dataset consists of firm-level information on the value of imports and exports of services by country

of origin/destination and by service type, details that are missing from the aggregate trade values provided by the

ARD. The ITIS includes information on producer services and excludes travel and transport, higher education,

the financial sector and the public sector, each of which are covered in other surveys that are, unfortunately,

not available to researchers. We link the ARD with the ITIS via the common establishment identifier in both

datasets, and we link this combined dataset with the QLFS by the “travel-to-work” area (TTWA) and one-digit

sector of the establishments and workers. Though we could link these datasets at a more disaggregate level

(such as the 4-digit industry level), because the QLFS is a one percent sample of workers we need to be sure
    5 For   a comprehensive description of this dataset, see Criscuolo, Haskel and Martin (2003).


                                                                   6
there is an adequate number of workers in each cell. By matching at the one-digit sector level we ensure that

each cell contains at least 1000 immigrant hours worked from each of the top 20 immigrant origin countries,

thereby alleviating concerns about measurement error and the related attenuation bias6 . We will then focus on

the impact of immigrants from these specific countries when analyzing any bilateral effects. Ultimately, the final

dataset encompasses workers from 142 countries (though the bilateral analysis focuses on the top 20) located

across 243 TTWAs, working within 6 one-digit industries and trading with 180 countries (again, bilateral effects

are constrained to the top 20 countries of immigrant origin) over 7 years. We will exploit firm-by-year level

variation in our dependent variables and TTWA-sector by year level variation in the immigration regressors.

There are 309,930 year-firm combinations and 640,054 year-firm-origin combinations. In addition, there are

11,649 export “bilateral matches” – i.e., instances in which a cell contains an immigrant from, and some firm’s

export services to, a particular country.

    In our empirical analysis we will also distinguish between broad categories of services in order to account for

the different ways in which service provision interacts with immigrant workers. Specifically, we categorize service

output as belonging to one of three categories: Technical-Financial, Legal and Related, or Language-Human

Resources. Table 1 lists how each detailed service type is categorized in one of these three broad categories. The

idea is that immigrants may facilitate or, alternatively, substitute for trade in services when language or culture

is an important aspect of the service provision, because these have a high degree of country-specificity. We

refer to these services as Language-Human Resource (LHR) intensive services. Similarly, when service provision

relies on country-specific norms and institutions, immigrant workers may be particularly strong substitutes or

complements – these are what we call Legal and Related (LR) services. Finally, Technical-Financial (TF) services

are likely to be relatively unaffected by country-specific knowledge, as they are based on international and

quantitative standards rather than country-specific ones so that immigrants are less relevant in cost-reduction

for firms when trading these service types.

    Finally, we also collect information on services trade barriers from the OECD.7 Since the bulk of U.K.

exports are with OECD countries, these measures will serve as useful proxies for the overall barriers faced by

U.K. firms in exporting services to foreign markets and will serve as an important proxy of import and export

costs.



4        Stylized Facts on Services Trade and Immigration

To illustrate some important features of service production and trade, that will inform the development of our

model, we augment the stylized facts presented in the introduction with some additional ones. In our sample
   6 Aydemir and Borjas (2011) show that measurement error can be a significant concern leading to attenuation bias when measuring

the share of immigrants in employment with cells of small size.
   7 See http://www.oecd.org/trade/services-trade/towardsaservicestraderestrictivenessindexstri.htm for more information




                                                                7
around 8 percent of firms trade in services. For those that export, the mean export-to-sales ratio is 30 percent

and the corresponding number for imports is 10 percent. Despite these relatively small shares, services traders

are an important part of the economy, accounting for 22.5 percent of total employment and 30 percent of value

added. Figures 7 and 8 document the primary destinations and source countries for service imports and exports

and here we see the dominant role of the U.S. and, not surprisingly, a strong role for the large E.U. countries.

This pattern is not unlike the one for goods.8

   In fact, the cross-section of services traders displays much of the same pattern of heterogeneity as goods

traders. In particular, few firms are responsible for the bulk of services trade, and within sector the volume

of trade is positively associated with firm size and productivity. Along the extensive margin larger and more

productive firms are much more likely to trade in services, and to trade with more countries. At the same

time, on average, a service exporting firm sells 68 percent of their output to a single market, while importing 76

percent from a single market. Even more starkly, a single service type accounts for 95 percent of exports and 86

percent of imports for the average service trading firm (see Breinlich and Criscuolo, 2010). Each of these facts

is broadly consistent with the characteristics of good trading firms, as evidenced by the literature. Hence firm

heterogeneity, the presence of an important intensive and extensive margin of trade and the concentration in one

foreign market are features that motivate the structure of our model below, partly inspired to good production

and trade.

   Immigration to the U.K. was significant over the period 1999 to 2005. This phase of large immigration

inflows began in the early 1990s when there was a sharp increase in the number of immigrants to the U.K.

Importantly, looking over the period 1990 to 2005 twice as many immigrants worked in professional and man-

agerial occupations relative to other ‘less skilled’ occupations. Immigrants, that is, worked in occupations that

are relatively abundant in the service sector, hence they may play a particularly relevant role in it. In terms of

policy events, it is important to note that in 2004 several Eastern European countries joined the European Union

and their workers gained access to U.K. labor markets. This partly altered the composition of new immigrants,

tilting it toward the less skilled.9 This event, however, took place very late in our sample. In addition, there

was an expansion of the points-based immigration system in 2002 by the U.K. government in order to target

highly skilled immigrants, a policy that provided a route to U.K. citizenship for both high-skilled workers and

their spouses and children. Part of the aggregate variation in immigration inflows and countries of origin that

we exploit is due to this policy. In Figure 9 we document the cross-sectional distribution of immigrants across

education groups during our period, along with the native distribution. We can see that, as it has already been

documented for the United States (e.g. Ottaviano and Peri 2012), U.K. immigrants are polarized (U-shaped) in

their educational attainment relative to natives, and they are over-represented among highly and less educated

groups, while under-represented in the intermediate education groups.



5     The Model

In this section we present a model of immigration and international trade in services in which firms are het-

erogeneous in their productivity, as in Melitz (2003). Although heterogeneous firm models have typically been

motivated by stylized facts that are based on goods producers, in the previous section we noted the wide-ranging

similarities between goods producers and services producers. Most importantly, services traders are – like goods

traders – larger and more productive than non-traders. Moreover the most productive firms sell a wider variety

of services in a greater number of markets. These facts, along with the empirical correlations depicted in Figures

3 to 6, motivate the model presented here.10

    Consider a TTWA in which intermediate services are transformed into final services to foreign customers

located in a number of export destinations indexed x = 1, ..., X. The TTWA is modeled as a “small open

economy” in partial equilibrium so that all foreign variables and all prices are exogenously given except for the

prices of final services.


5.1     Revenue and Cost

Final services are horizontally differentiated. In a representative TTWA there is an exogenously given number

N of monopolistically competitive final service providers, each supplying one and only one service. For exports

to destination x each final service provider faces CES demand

                                                                      1−δ
                                                                  Px          Ex
                                                       Dx =                                                                        (1)
                                                                  Px          Px

where Dx is quantity demanded in the destination x, Ex is its total expenditure on final services, Px is the

delivered price quoted by the provider, δ > 1 is the elasticity of substitution between final services offered by

different providers, and P x is the destination’s price index of these services. Due to the small open economy

assumption, both Ex and P x are exogenously given.

    Final service providers are heterogeneous in terms of their efficiency. This is denoted by ϕ > 0 and is

distributed according to the continuous c.d.f. F (ϕ). For a firm with efficiency ϕ > 0 the total cost of delivering

its service to country x is


                                                                          qx    qx

 10 While there is little in the model that makes it specific to services rather than goods, the effects it highlights are likely to be

more important for services than for goods as discussed in the Introduction.



                                                                  9
where qx is output exported to x, pf,x fx is a fixed export cost incurred in terms of a bundle of x-specific

intermediate services with price index pf,x , pf,x tx is a marginal export cost also incurred in terms of the same

bundle of x-specific intermediate services, and p/ϕ is the marginal production cost incurred in terms of a different

bundle of services not specific to x with price index p. The export cost parameters fx and tx depend on the

cultural distance between the TTWA and destination x as well as on the importance of such distance for the

type of final service the provider supplies. In particular, all the rest equal, they are larger for final services with

more relevant cultural content and for destinations with longer cultural distance from the TTWA. We think of

cultural distance in terms of linguistic and institutional differences, and of cultural content in terms of linguistic

and institutional intensity.

   Whereas x-specific intermediate services can only be imported from x or sourced locally from workers who

immigrated from x to the TTWA, production services can be sourced locally also from native workers. We call

‘foreign’ services those sourced from abroad (‘offshore’) or from immigrants, and ‘native’ services those sourced

from natives. All these services are imperfectly substitutable. Specifically, using pm,x and po,x to denote the

prices of x-specific intermediate services sourced from immigrants and offshore respectively, the price indexes of

the two intermediate service bundles used for export and production are respectively

Given δ > 1, both Rx (ϕ) and Πx (ϕ) are increasing functions of efficiency ϕ.

   Final service providers with efficiency ϕx such that Πx (ϕx ) = 0 are indifferent between exporting and not

exporting to x. Solving this indifference condition under (8) yields

As Πx (ϕ) is an increasing function of ϕ, efficiency ϕ < ϕx is associated with Πx (ϕ) < 0 while efficiency ϕ > ϕx

is associated with Πx (ϕ) > 0. This defines a cutoff rule for exporting to x such that only the selected group

of final service providers with efficiency ϕ ≥ ϕx serves destination x. As these exporters account for a share

πx = 1 − F (ϕx ) of all final service providers, the number of exporters is Nx = πx N . From a different angle, πx

is also the probability that a randomly picked final service provider exports to x.


5.3       Immigration and Trade

To study the impact of (exogenous) immigration on international trade by final service providers in the TTWA,

we assume that the price of intermediate services sourced from immigrants is an increasing function of the

x-specific immigration cost µx > 0 that diminishes the (productivity of the) stock of immigrants in the TTWA:

pm,x = pm,x (µx ) with p0m,x (µx ) > 0 and constant elasticity εpm,x ,µx = µx p0m,x (µx )/pm,x (µx ) > 0. A decrease

in this cost will both increase the number of immigrants in the local labor market and decrease the cost of

producing one unit of the cultural good they provide. We then characterize an x-specific immigration shock as

an exogenous change in µx .11

   We distinguish between country x and all other countries y 6= x the TTWA trades with, and we assume

that immigration becomes easier from country x, so that µx falls while µy remains constant for any y 6= x. The
 11 See   the Appendix for detailed proofs of the propositions in this section.


                                                                     11
probability that a randomly selected final service provider exports to x (y) is πx = 1 − F (ϕx ) (πy = 1 − F (ϕy )),

which is a decreasing function of the export cutoff ϕx (ϕy ). Given (9), differentiating ϕy with respect to µx

gives
                                d ln ϕy       p        d ln p

τy ≡ p/ (p + pf,y ty ) ∈ (0, 1) measures the ‘tradability’ of final services with respect to shipments to country

y. This is a decreasing function of both the cultural content of final services (as captured by the importance

of foreign services for the production cost pf,y /p) and of the cultural distance between y and the TTWA (as

captured by ty ). This shows that easier immigration from country x raises the probability of exporting to

all other countries y due to lower production cost (smaller p). This ‘extensive margin’ effect is stronger for

countries at closer cultural distance to the TTWA (smaller ty ) and for services with smaller cultural content

(smaller pf,y /p). Clearly this effect is also at work for the probability of exporting to country x.

   Consider now export sales and focus on final services providers that export to x (y) both before and after the

decline in immigration cost µx . These are providers with efficiency ϕ > ϕx (ϕ > ϕy ). Given (7), differentiation

with respect to µx gives
                                    d ln Ry (ϕ)
                                                = − (δ − 1) τy sm,x εpm,x ,µx < 0
                                      d ln µx

given δ > 1. This shows that easier immigration from country x raises the export sales of each provider to

all other countries y due to lower marginal production cost (smaller p). This ‘intensive margin’ effect is also

stronger for countries at closer cultural distance to the TTWA (smaller ty ) and for services with smaller cultural

content (smaller pf,y /p). And it is at work for exports to country x too.

   Hence, we can state:


Proposition 1 (Productivity or general export promotion effect) Due to lower production costs, easier

immigration to a TTWA from any given foreign country raises the probability that a service provider located in

the TTWA exports. Conditional on exporting, it also increases the provider’s export sales.


   This effect is similar to what in Ottaviano et al (2013) was called the “cost-reduction” effect of immigrants

and it is effectively the impact on exports of a positive productivity effect due to immigration. While this effect

is also at work in increasing exports to country x, the bilateral export probability and the bilateral export sales

to x are also affected by an additional term, associated with the reduction of bilateral export costs. Specifically,




                                                         12
differentiating ϕx and Rx (ϕ) (for ϕ > ϕx ) with respect to µx yields

                                                                    

                             d ln µx

given δ > 1. While the term τx sm,x corresponds to the productivity effect we have already discussed, the term

(1 − τx ) sfm,x corresponds to an additional effect due to the change in bilateral export costs. Accordingly, easier

immigration from country x (smaller µx ) raises the probability πx of exporting to that country through two

channels: lower production costs (smaller p) and lower export costs (smaller pf,x ). The relative importance of

the former channel (as measured by tradability τx ) is a decreasing function of cultural distance (tx ) and of the

cultural content of the exported service (pf,x /p). Hence, we have:

Proposition 2 (Specific export promotion effect) Easier immigration to a TTWA from any given country

disproportionately raises the probability that a service provider located in the TTWA exports to the country and,

conditional on exporting, it also increases disproportionately its export sales to the country. This effect is larger,

the greater the cultural content of the service and the larger the cultural distance of the country from the TTWA.

   Finally, easier immigration also affects imports of intermediate services, and thus their shares in production
                                                                                                   θ−1
and export cost. The share of foreign services sourced offshore is sfo,x = 1 − sfm,x = (pf,x /po,x )     . Given θ > 1,

differentiation with respect to µx yields

                                         d ln sfo,x
                                                    = (θ − 1) sfm,x εpm,x ,µx > 0
                                         d ln µx

so that easier immigration from x (lower µx ) reduces the share of foreign intermediate services that are offshored

to x. Moreover, given σ > 1,we have

                                  d ln sf,x
                                            = − (σ − 1) (1 − sf,x ) sfm,x εpm,x ,µx < 0.
                                   d ln µx

Thus, easier immigration from x (lower µx ) increases the share of foreign intermediate services that are provided

by country x to the detriment of the share of those provided by all other countries y (and by the TTWA). All

this leads to:

Proposition 3 (Import substitution effect) Easier immigration to a TTWA from any given foreign country

decreases the share of offshore intermediate services used by final service providers in that TTWA. This happens

disproportionately for offshore intermediate services imported from that country.


                                                           13
    We will test these three qualitative predictions in the empirical analysis below, distinguishing between the

productivity or general export promotion effect, the specific export promotion effect and the import substitution

effect. As far as we know, this analysis has been absent from the literature, and we believe that service firms

are an ideal group to analyze these effects, given the country-specificity of many services.



6     Empirical Strategy

Our first empirical specification is aimed at testing Proposition 1, which states that immigration into a local

labor market k in period t raises the total value of exports of firm i in that local labor market. Specifically, we

estimate the following regression:


                 ln(yikt ) = φi + θt + ξst + ξat + β1 ImmShkt + β2 ImmDivkt + βx ln Xijkt + ijkt                       (10)


The unit of observation for the dependent variable is the firm, while the units for the immigrant share (which

are negatively correlated with migration costs to that market, as described in the model) are TTWA-Sector

cells in each year. In (10) the outcome yikt is the value of exports of firm i belonging to TTWA-sector cell k in

year t. The variable ImmShrkt is the share of immigrants in the TTWA-sector cell k; ImmDivkt is a measure

of country of birth immigrant diversity in cell k, constructed as (one minus) a Herfindahl Index across origin

countries;12 Xijkt is a set of firm-level control variables; φi and θt are firm and year fixed effects, respectively;

ξst are sector-by-year fixed effects capturing sector-specific changes in UK exports and ξat is a TTWA-by-year

effect capturing the differential aggregate economic success of UK labor markets over time. The term ijkt then

captures zero-mean idiosyncratic errors. We cluster standard errors at the TTWA-sector level which is the level

of variation of our regressors of interest. The coefficients of interest in this specification are β1 and β2 which

capture the aggregate effect on exports of the share of immigrants and their diversity, respectively. To the

extent that the changes in the share and diversity of immigrants is driven by the change in the cost of migrating

from each origin country, a finding of positive and significant values for these coefficients would be consistent

with a positive general export promotion effect generated by the lower costs of production as highlighted in

Proposition 1. To check that productivity is indeed increasing with immigration, and hence a plausible channel

for this export-promotion effect, we run also specification (10) considering the labor productivity of firm i as

the dependent variable (rather than the export value as before), yikt .

    We then move to a bilateral firm-country setting in order to test Propositions 2 and 3. Those Propositions

state that increased immigration from country n into sector-TTWA k in period t due to a decrease in immigration
 12 Formally,the measure is defined as ImmDivkt = 1 − N                  n 2
                                                           P               
                                                             n=1 ImmShkt , where n = 1, ..., N indexes countries of immigrant
origin. The measure is therefore constructed to be increasing in immigrant diversity.




                                                             14
costs raises (reduces) the volume of final exports to (intermediate imports from) country n by local firm i in

that sector-TTWA. Hence we run the following regression:


     n
 ln(yikt ) = φi + θt + ξst + ξat + γnt + β1 ImmShkt + β2 ImmDivkt + β3 ImmShnkt + τjn + βx ln Xijkt + ijkt (11)


   In this case the units of observation for the dependent variable are firm-by-export destination cells. In (10)
             n
the outcome yikt can be either the value of exports from firm i to country n in year t (to test Proposition 2)

or the value of intermediate imports of firm i from country n (to test Proposition 3). ImmShkt is the share of

immigrants in TTWA-sector cell k and ImmDivkt is the measure described above of country of birth immigrant

diversity in cell k. In this case these variables control for the overall productivity and export promotion effects.

However, we now also include ImmShnkt , which is the employment share of workers from country n in area-sector

cell k. Xijkt is a set of firm-level control variables; φi and θt are firm and year fixed effects, respectively; ξst

are sector-by-year fixed effects and ξat is a TTWA-by-year effect. In this specification we also include γnt , a

destination-country specific annual trend, to capture import trends from destination countries. Export barriers

to services trade, denoted by τjn , are also included in the regression, and we use the OECD services trade

barriers described above as indicator of service trade barriers. In this case, while the coefficients β1 and β2

reflect the overall productivity effect due to immigrants on the imports and exports of the firm (depending on

the left-hand side variable) and should confirm the positive estimates from (10) above, the coefficient β3 captures

alternatively the effects stated in Propositions 2 and 3. When the dependent variable is the value of export,

we expect a positive estimate of β3 as the additional export promotion effect of immigrants that arises due

to a reduction in exporting costs is positive. When the dependent variable is the value of intermediate inputs

we expect a negative estimate of β3 capturing the substitution effect of immigrants on imported intermediates.

Taken together the size and significance of these coefficients allow us to test Propositions 1, 2 and 3 from the

model.

   Before moving on to a discussion of identification, we note that while the simple model described in section 5

above is a useful way to organize the analysis, the three effects that we are testing are very general and intuitive

and a larger class of models could potentially generate them. The productivity or general export promotion

effect described in Proposition 1 exists as long as lower immigration costs allow firms to cut costs of production

thanks to intermediate services sourced from immigrants. The effects on exports described by Proposition 2

will exist as long as lower immigration costs, generating more immigrants from a country, reduce the costs to

export specifically to that country. Finally, the effects described in Proposition 3 on imports of intermediates

will exist as long as immigrants’ productive services are partially substitutable for intermediate goods that can

be imported from the same country.

6.1    Identification and Instrumental Variable Strategy

While in the empirical specifications we control for an array of fixed effects – in particular sector-year, TTWA-

year and firm effects – aimed at capturing unobservable local shocks and firm heterogeneity, the presence of

unobservable shocks still threatens proper identification. If the inflow of immigrants in a TTWA-sector in a
                                                                                                         n
year is driven by a demand shock (in that labor market) and such a shock is correlated with the outcome yikt

then the estimated coefficients β1 , β2 and β3 are not consistent estimates of the effect of reducing immigration

costs (and hence changing immigrants supply) on the corresponding outcomes. In order to address this issue we

construct instruments for the share of immigrants in a cell. The instrument that we use to isolate exogenous,

supply-driven, variation in the share of immigrant hours worked in a cell extends the method proposed by Altonji

and Card (1991) and Card (2001) and then used in several papers exploiting the area-variation of immigrants

in the U.S. (e.g. Card and DiNardo, 2000; Ottaviano and Peri 2006, Peri and Sparber, 2009) and in the U.K.

(e.g. Dustmann, Frattini and Preston, 2013, Bell et al 2013). Specifically, we exploit the fact that foreigners

from different countries have increased or decreased their relative migration flows to the U.K. according to

changes in the cost of migrating and other factors that are specific to their countries of origin and we interact

this with their initial differential presence in local labor markets in the U.K. Variation in the initial presence of

immigrants from different countries in a TTWA-sector cell makes firms in that cell more or less subject to shifts

in origin-specific push factors. Using these two facts we impute the population of immigrant groups across these

cells over time.

   More precisely, we first consider immigrant workers from country of origin n, working in each local labor

market (TTWA-sector) k in 1997 as a share of the total employment of TTWA-sector k and denote this as

ImmShnk1997 . We then augment this share by the aggregate growth rate between year 1997 and year t =

1999, ..., 2005, of the specific immigrant group n , (1 + gnt ) relative to total U.K. population growth (1 + gU
                                                                                                               t
                                                                                                                 K ).
                                                                               t
Hence we multiply ImmShnk1997 by this relative growth factor(1 + gnt ) / (1 + gU K ). In so doing we obtain an

imputed value for the country-specific share of immigrants in a labor market. This value interacts the initial

presence of immigrants in 1997 and the subsequent aggregate growth by country. We call this variable the
                                                                                       \ n . We will
imputed share of immigrants from country n in cell k at time t and we denote it with ImmSh kt

use this variable as an instrument for ImmShnkt in the regressions. Then summing ImmSh
                                                                                   \ n across countries
                                                                                       kt

of origin n, we obtain the imputed share of all foreign-born in employment in that cell that can be denoted
              \ kt = N ImmSh    \ n This variable, which we use as an instrument for ImmShkt , varies
                         P
as follows: ImmSh          n=1        kt

across labor-market cells and time. On the one hand, because of localized ethnic networks (Bartel, 1989), we

expect that the initial distribution of immigrants will be a strong predictor of future immigration flows into

a TTWA-sector cell. On the other hand, because we rely on history-determined initial immigrant group this

imputed variable is likely to vary with changing immigration costs, rather than with local demand shocks in


                                                         16
the 1999-2005 period. Certainly, however, unobservable persistent demand shocks, correlated with the presence

of a specific group of immigrants in 1997, may threaten this identification strategy. However the large set of

fixed effects attenuate this problem by capturing all location-specific and sector-specific shocks. We also check

that the constructed instrument is not correlated with some of the outcomes in the pre-1999 period. To do so

we regress the growth in imputed immigrant share over 1999-2005, which constitutes our instrument, on the

growth of native employment and wages across TTWA cells in the period preceding our analysis 1992-1999. We

find no significant correlation between these variables.



7     Empirical Results

In this section we present the results from estimating specifications (10) and (11) and in particular we report

the coefficients β1 , β2 and β3 in tables that share a similar structure. We first present the impact of immigrants

and their country of birth diversity on the productivity of the firm and on variables that should be correlated

with productivity at the firm level (capital and employment). We then analyze how, controlling for aggregate

immigration, bilateral immigration affects bilateral offshoring and exports.


7.1    Immigrants and Firm Productivity

Our model predicts that a lower cost of immigration reduces the price of the services provided by immigrants and

thereby reduces production costs, increasing firm productivity. More generally, a larger class of models imply

that when firms produce using differentiated services, a greater variety of locally available skills can increase

their productivity (Ottaviano and Peri, 2012). Alternatively, if workers specialize in tasks according to their

relative ability, a broader variety of abilities could increase specialization and productivity (see, for instance, Peri

and Sparber 2009 and Brunow et al 2013). On the other hand, if differences in the country of origin of workers

lead to costly coordination problems within the firm, then the increased presence of immigrants may cause a

reduction in productivity (see Kahane et al 2013). Using variation in immigrant shares across labor markets

(represented by TTWA-sector cells), instrumented with the imputed value obtained from the pre-determined

distribution of immigrants interacted with aggregate flows by country of origin (as describe in section 6.1),

we estimate the impact of the immigrant share on firm productivity. Table 2 presents the results from three

specifications of the estimating equation (10) that include different combinations of fixed effects. Throughout,

we always include firm fixed effects and always cluster standard errors at the sector-TTWA level, which is the

level of variation of the explanatory variables in each of the specifications based on (10). Column (1)-(3) show

OLS estimates, while columns (4)-(6) show the 2SLS. The most demanding specifications are (3) and (6) which

include sector-year and TTWA-year effects to capture local and sector-specific variation over time.



                                                           17
   The results, presented in Table 2, indicate that immigration inflows were associated with an increase in

gross value added per worker (our simple measure of productivity) within the firm, where a one percentage

point increase in the share of immigrants in a local labor market produced a one to two percent increase in

firm labor productivity. This result is significant and robust across specifications. In contrast, while the OLS

results suggest an association between immigrant diversity and firm productivity, the 2SLS estimates are not

significant.13 The measure of immigrant diversity used is also instrumented when we use 2SLS estimation, by

constructing an analogous Herfindahl Index IV, in which the immigrant shares used in its construction are the

imputed bilateral immigrant shares.14 Table 3 then shows the estimates of similar specifications as in equation

(10) with the logarithm of firm investments in plant, machinery and equipment capital as the dependent variable.

The estimates are positive and significant, though economically small, suggesting that the labor productivity

gains only in small part accrue via an increase in the capital stock. Improvements in human capital and in

productivity account for the remaining positive correlation detected in Table 2. Finally, Table 4 performs a

relatively standard regression, usually estimated when analyzing the “crowding out” effects of immigrants in

the labor market (e.g. Peri and Sparber 2011). The dependent variable is the (logarithm of) native employment

and the explanatory variable is, as before, the immigrant share in employment. This regression detects a small,

positive and significant effect, suggesting that the labor productivity gains may also manifest in part through

increased employment within the firm and that this is consistent with no displacement effect on (hence weak

complementarity rather than substitution with) native workers at the firm level.


7.2      Immigrants and Offshoring of Intermediate Services

Table 5 presents the results of specification (11) in which the dependent variable is firm imports of services

from a specific country n. The explanatory variables include both the aggregate share of immigrants in the

TTWA-sector and the country-specific immigrants in the same market. Moreover, we still include the index of

immigrant diversity as it may potentially affect imports through increasing aggregate productivity of the firm.

The structure and specifications of the table mirror those of Table 4 with the inclusion of the bilateral immigrant

share as an explanatory variable. In addition, we also report the coefficients on the variable reflecting service

barriers as it is a direct determinant of the cost of trading.

   Several interesting results emerge from Table 5. First, all estimates, using both OLS and 2SLS methods,

indicate a negative and significant effect of the bilateral immigrant share on bilateral services offshoring. This

implies that, for instance, an increase in Pakistani workers in a company producing business services in the

U.K. is associated with a reduction in the imports of intermediate services from Pakistan for that same firm.
 13 We   also note that the power in the first stage is significant, as evidenced by the reported partial F-statistics.
 14 This                               \ kt = 1 − N                \n 2                                                  \n
                                                        P                  
          IV is therefore defined as ImmDiv                n=1 ImmShkt , where n are countries of immigrant origin and ImmShkt
is as defined in section 6.1 above.




                                                             18
This is consistent with the idea that offshore workers and immigrants from the same country are substitutes in

the provision of services that are used as inputs for the firm. At the same time, the estimates on the aggregate

immigrant share is positive and significant. This implies that an increase in the share of immigrants is associated

with a large increase in imports of intermediate services, and this is consistent with the existence of a positive

productivity effect of immigrants on the firm.

   Beyond these effects there is also a positive effect of immigrant (country-of-origin) diversity on firm imports,

also indicative of a positive productivity effect of that index. In terms of economic significance, the results suggest

an important role for each channel. Over a period in which the overall share of immigrants in employment within

a sector-TTWA cell increased by an average of 0.3 percentage points per year, the 2SLS estimates indicate that

these inflows raised the volume of services imports by an average of around 6 percent per year, clearly a large

effect. The bilateral and diversity effects were also important. Bilateral offshoring with the same country of

origin of immigrants declined by about one percent per year for every three percentage point increase in the

share of immigrants. The direct effect of immigrants in reducing offshoring to their specific country of origin is

more than balanced by the effect of aggregate immigration in raising the amount of offshoring. Finally offshoring

increased by about 0.3 percent per year due to increased immigrant diversity. We performed a further robustness

check on the impact of immigrants on offshoring, not reported in the table. Namely we checked whether the

exclusion of London, the most diverse and largest local labor market, from our regression affected the results.

The results, available upon request, are very similar to those reported in Table 5.

   Having established, consistent with Proposition 3, that immigration substitutes to some extent for offshoring

to the country of origin of immigrants, we next test whether this effect is sensitive to the country-specific nature

of services. Namely, the model suggests that this displacement effect should be stronger, the greater is the

cultural content of a service, which can be proxied by the degree of country-specific content of the service in

terms of knowledge of institutions, language, or cultural details. Hence, using our partition of service types into

Technical (TF), Legal (LR) and Language (LHR), we hypothesize that the cultural content increases from the

first to the third, while the Legal and Language service types involve a higher cultural (country-specific) content

relative to the Technical. Table 6 presents the estimates with respect to the same specification as columns (4)-

(6) of Table 5, except that the dependent variable includes only the imports of services within one of the groups

defined above. Columns (1)-(3) present the estimates when the log import of Technical and Financial services

(TF) is the dependent variable, columns (4)-(6) show results for Legal and Related services as the dependent

variable and columns (7)-(9) focus on the effects on imports of Language and Human Resources services.

   Confirming our hypothesis, the bilateral effects of immigrants are negative and significant and similar in

magnitude for LR and LHR services. In contrast, they are unimportant for TF Services. This is consistent

with immigrants being substitutes for foreign service provision when the services are intensive in language,



                                                          19
cultural and institutional content that may be specific to a country. The estimates suggest that TF services,

on the other hand, are in a sense more “neutral” and do not have strong country-of-origin specificity. This

translates into less direct substitutability between the offshoring of a service and having immigrants from the

same country perform the service domestically. In each case, as before, the aggregate immigrant share and

the aggregate immigrant diversity variables have a positive and significant coefficient. In terms of magnitudes,

however, the positive aggregate effect of immigrants seems to be driven primarily by firms that offshore LHR

and LR services. Finally, as expected, the effect of the service barrier index on offshoring is negative, implying

that service barriers reduce the offshoring of intermediate services.

   We further note that the negative (displacement) effect of immigrants on offshoring activities to the same

country of origin, together with the positive effect of all immigrants on offshoring, suggests that the variety of

immigrants generates a complementarity between immigrants as a whole and offshoring as a whole, in spite of

the fact that each group of immigrants can be substitute for the specific services from their own country. It is the

complementarity across skills and countries that produces this effect. This is also consistent with the aggregate

complementarity of immigrants and natives, consistent with the positive correlation between immigrant and

native employment shown in Table 4. In turn, this is consistent with a model in which immigrants displace

specific offshore production tasks, but help overall productivity as well as native employment, an effect also

found in Ottaviano et al (2013).


7.3    Immigrants and Exports of Services

Table 7 presents the results from estimating an equation similar to (11) in which the dependent variable is (the

logarithm of) firm exports of services. The usual structure with OLS (Columns 1-3) and 2SLS (columns 4-6)

estimates is presented and we focus on the estimated value of the coefficients in the top two rows, corresponding

to the explanatory variable ImmShkt , which captures total immigrants as a share of employment in the local

labor market, and ImmShnkt which captures immigrants from country n as a share of employment in the local

labor market. As usual we always report the estimated coefficient for the Immigrant Diversity Index and for the

Service Barrier Index as controls. The results confirm the positive effect of the aggregate immigration share, as

even for exports we identify a positive impact of this variable. Firms in labor markets with more immigrants

have a significant tendency to export more. An increase in immigrants equal to one percentage point of local

employment increases exports of firms in that TTWA-sector by about two percent.

   As for immigrants from a specific country n, the estimate of the coefficient on ImmShnkt suggests an ad-

ditional positive and significant effect on services exports which is three to four times the magnitude of the

aggregate effect. We interpret this “specific export promotion” effect as a result of the reduction of the specific

bilateral cost of trading services with the country of origin of immigrants. By hiring immigrants from a certain



                                                        20
country the firm can deliver more effectively, in a more country-specific way, the services to that specific country.

While a one percentage point rise in the share of immigrant employment increases aggregate firm exports by

around two percent, the bilateral effects are much larger indicating a 6 to 10 percent rise in bilateral export

volumes for the same increase in the share of immigrants from the export destination country. Little evidence

of an effect due to immigrant diversity exists while the service barrier index is still negatively and significantly

correlated with exports of services.

    Immigrants may increase the flows of exported services to their country of origin in two ways. First, they

may help customize and target the service toward their home country customers, such that domestic firms are

better able to successfully penetrate the new market. This reflects the extensive margin of trade: opening new

markets for a firm. Alternatively, they may help expand an existing market for the firm by improving services

already offered and hence increasing sales and revenues from that market. This is the intensive margin of trade.

In Table 8 we explore the effect of immigration on the extensive margin of exports. The estimates indicate that

a one percentage point increase in the aggregate immigrant share raised the probability of exporting by about

0.10 percent via the productivity channel (consistent with our model in which productivity increases expand the

set of exporting firms). However, there is no strong evidence of an effect of the bilateral share on the extensive

margin of trade. This suggests that rather than opening new markets to exports of services, immigrants from

a country may mainly help expand the existing market. Interestingly, most of the estimated coefficients are

rather weak in the regressions capturing the effects on the extensive margin of trade. This is potentially due

to the fact that many observations are 0, as there may not be a very large number of firms expanding in new

markets in the relatively short period 1999-2005 that we examine here.15

    Table 9 explores the role of the “cultural content” of services in relation to the immigrant export-complementarity.

The prediction of the model is that the trade-creation effect of immigrants, by reducing the cost of exporting

services to their country of origin, should be greater for those services that have stronger cultural and country-

specific content. Mirroring Table 6, Table 9 presents the effect of aggregate and bilateral immigration on the

exports of the three type of services. Confirming our hypothesis, the strongest effect of both aggregate and

bilateral migrants is for exports of LR services followed by LHR services. The effect on bilateral exports of

FT services is only significant at the 10 percent confidence level. The bilateral effects are strongest for LR ser-

vices, suggesting an important role for institutional knowledge transfer between immigrants and firms. When

expanding service exports to a foreign market, employees from that same country are a great boon. They likely

understand and connect better with those customers and, eventually, they facilitate the expansion of the market

for those services. Finally, focussing on FT services, whose exports are those most positively affected by immi-
  15 We have also analyzed the effect of aggregate and bilateral immigrants on the extensive margin of bilateral offshoring, and even

in that case we did not find significant effects of the bilateral share on bilateral offshoring. This implies that the substitution effect
between immigrants and imports of intermediates reduced but does not eliminate firm imports from that country. The results of
these regressions are available upon request.



                                                                   21
grants (see Row 2 of Table 9), Table 10 explores what type of markets are more likely to benefit from bilateral

migration. Specifically, for a U.K. firm looking to export to a foreign country, the more distant this country is in

terms of U.K. laws, culture and language, the larger should be the benefit of gaining insight through immigrant

employees.

    In Table 10 we decompose the effects of immigrants on the exports of LR services, dividing exports into trade

with Anglo-Saxon versus Non-Anglo-Saxon countries. Here we define Anglo-Saxon countries as the five core

English-speaking countries: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. In

robustness checks we expand the set to also include South Africa, Ireland and India, but the results are virtually

unchanged. The regression results are unambiguously in the expected direction. Our model predicts that the

trade cost-reducing effect of immigration will have a stronger effect for services with a larger cultural content

and for services with a larger bilateral cost. The estimates show an effect on exports of bilateral immigrants

that is two to three times larger for Non-Anglo-Saxon than for Anglo-Saxon countries. Those countries whose

laws and institutions differ the most from the U.K., and are therefore harder to penetrate by U.K. service firms,

benefit substantially from immigrant employees in the U.K. who are able to help their company deliver better

and more customized services. Even the overall effect on exports is larger when considering immigrants from

non-Anglo Saxon countries, as they may bring new perspectives to the firm that complement the local employees

to a relatively greater extent. Exports of services, especially services with a high degree of country-specificity,

seem to benefit substantially from immigrants.



8     Conclusions

This paper uses a novel micro-data set on U.K. service-producing firms to illustrate some basic empirical

facts regarding the relationship between services trade and immigrant workers in the U.K. We developed a

simple model in which immigrants have three potential effects on the production, imports and exports of

services. First, immigrants can reduce costs and increase the productivity of the firm, allowing it to produce

and export more overall. Second, by bringing country-specific skills with them, they may substitute for the

import of intermediate services that were previously offshored by the firm. Third, in bringing their country-

specific knowledge, immigrants may increase exports of services to their country of origin. Our empirical

analysis confirms each of these hypotheses. We find a productivity and general export promotion effect of

immigrants. We then identify an import-substitution effect of immigrants that operates primarily through

imports of services that rely on country-specific language, cultural and institutional knowledge. Finally, we

find that immigrants promote bilateral exports to their countries of origin. Each of these effects is greater

for services that involve relatively large “cultural” and “country-specific” content. As trade and offshoring of

services becomes more important and as the mobility of highly skilled workers grows, the interplay of these two


                                                        22
