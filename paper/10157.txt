The Risk Tolerance of International Investors

                                              ABSTRACT

Investor confidence and risk tolerance are important concepts that investors are constantly trying

to gauge. Yet these concepts are notoriously hard to measure in practice. Most attempts rely on price

or return data, but these run into trouble when trying to disentangle whether an observed price

change is attributable to a shift in investor confidence or a change in fundamental value. In this

paper, we take an alternative approach by looking at the world-wide holdings and trading of risky

assets. We model global capital markets as the interaction between large global institutional

investors and smaller domestic investors from each country. This permits separation of global price

changes into two components, one that reflects changes in demand and fundamentals perceived by

all investors, and a second that reflects changes in the relative risk tolerance of institutional investors

over and above that of domestics. The latter component, changes in relative risk tolerance of global

institutions, is driven by the willingness of these investors to acquire additional assets in each

country in proportion to their current holdings. Using our model, we show how data on asset

holdings and flows across countries can be used to identify changes in risk tolerance. We then apply

this identification scheme to recent data on the global portfolio holdings of institutional investors.

The resulting measure of risk tolerance impressionistically accords well with periods of market

turbulence and quiescence. It also accounts for a considerable portion of the variation in portfolio

holdings and is informative about future returns.

1     Introduction

Each time there is a major change in global equity prices, investors naturally wonder how to interpret
it. Was it attributable to a change in investor confidence (i.e., risk tolerance or sentiment)? If
investors have less tolerance for risk, then presumably equity prices fall. However, this is not the
only conclusion one can draw from a price decline. One sensible alternative is that a fall in asset
fundamentals may have been responsible. That is, expected future cashflows may have declined, or
the systematic risk of future cashflows may have increased. Another alternative is that the price
change was attributable to a change in investor wealth. For example, a decline in future wage
income reduces wealth and may undermine investors’ willingness to hold stocks.1
    With the supply of shares constant in the short run, one or more of the elements of investor
demand—risk tolerance, wealth, and expectations of future fundamentals— must change if prices
are to fall. To successfully extract a measure of risk tolerance from the data, it is necessary to
distinguish among these competing factors. This is particularly difficult because both investor
confidence and asset fundamentals cannot be directly observed. As a result, large and widespread
price changes generate considerable disagreement as to their source. Good examples would include
the ’bubble’ in technology stock prices at the end of the last decade, or the Asian crisis of the
mid-to-late-1990s.2
    Our approach to identifying investor confidence focuses on the behavior of market participants,
rather than on price changes. We do this by allowing for heterogeneity between global institutions
and domestic retail investors, so that they trade with one another. Specifically, we model the
global capital-market equilibrium as having different types of investors: domestic investors from
individual countries who hold only local risky assets and a global risk-free asset (e.g., US Treasury
bills), and a single type of global investor who can trade any and all assets. In this setup, when
global institutional investors are buying assets from a given country, smaller domestic investors from
that country are selling. In equilibrium, these investors trade with each other because of changes
    1
      Our focus in this paper is on investor confidence—defined as risk tolerance—and not necessarily on notions of
investor sentiment discussed by many economists. Most approaches to modeling sentiment take investor risk tolerance
as fixed, assuming instead that investor expectations depart from those of a rational investor. These approaches are
equivalent if there is only one risky asset. For example, in DeLong, Summers, Shleifer, and Waldmann (1990),
sentiment shocks affect the expectations of one group of investors, pushing prices away from a rational level. Shocks
to this group’s expectations under constant risk preferences are isomorphic to shocks to the group’s risk tolerance
under rational expectations.
    2
      Corsetti, Pesanti and Roubini (1998), Kaminsky and Schmukler (1999) argue that the price changes in multiple
countries represented shifts in underlying fundamentals. Kyle and Xiong (2002) argue that wealth effects were an
important propagation mechanism. Forbes and Rigobon (1999) and Rigobon (2001) hold that the covariance matrix
of shocks fundamentally changed.
Risk tolerance of interational investors                                                               2


in their views about asset fundamentals (expected returns and risk at current prices), changes in
their relative wealth, or changes in their relative risk tolerance.
   We assume that all investors observe a fundamental shock in each country, a component of which
is common across investors. This common component may also be correlated across countries or
regions. Because these shocks affect all investors symmetrically, they move prices but create no
incentives for trade. Such price changes therefore cannot be interpreted as a change in relative risk
tolerance. However, these price changes can be arbitrarily correlated across countries and regions.
   In addition to the common shock, each type of investor also observes his or her own perceived
country-specific fundamentals shock. Unlike the common shock, there are differences in these shocks
across global and domestic investors. These shocks therefore generally lead to both trading as well
as price changes. From the perspective of a given investor, investor-specific shocks may be correlated
across countries in a region, but, critically, not across regions. So, for example, global investors may
learn something that causes them to revise upward their expected returns for one country, or all
countries in a region, and therefore, all else equal, to purchase assets from that region’s domestics.
Anything global investors may learn that affects their expected returns simultaneously across all
countries is assumed to be common across investors, not investor-specific.
   With this setup, purchases by global investors that are common across all countries can come
from only two possible sources: changes in wealth or changes in risk tolerance. These two sources
are easily separated given the structure of our model. Because each security can be held by only
one investor type other than the global investors, it is possible to measure all types of investors’
wealth by observing total market capitalization and the holdings of global investors only. Subject
then to an assumption about the form of investors’ utility functions, we can isolate shocks to wealth.
The remaining portion of the common component in purchases by global investors is the change in
investor risk tolerance.
   The common component across countries of global investor trades we wish to measure is a
proportional one. That is, we look for a common component in purchases as a fraction of global
investor holdings in that country. This is because changes in risk tolerance should affect holdings
equiproportionately. To see this, consider what happens if, all else equal, institutional investors’ risk
tolerance declines. These investors would then sell risky assets in proportion to their initial holdings.
This pattern of selling is very different from what would take place if expected fundamentals changed
randomly across regions. In such a case, we might at any given time, observe institutional investors
are on average selling across countries. However, the selling would be proportional to the declines
Risk tolerance of interational investors                                                                               3


in expected fundamentals, and not proportional to prior holdings.3
   Our ability to identify changes in risk preferences relies on the empirical measurement of insti-
tutional investors’ evolving positions and trades. We observe directly the wealth and positions of
a large group of international institutional investors. The data are from State Street Corporation
(SSC), and they encompass approximately one eighth of all globally tradable securities. We use
these data to measure the demand by institutional investors for equity securities in 29 markets,
both developed and emerging, over the period January 1996-July 2003. Using our model and the
portfolio flow and holding information of this group of institutional investors, we can identify shifts
in relative investor confidence.
   Our approach to confidence can be compared to, and contrasted with, a very vast literature on
investor sentiment. Sentiment, broadly interpreted usually means that investor expectations depart
from full rationality. In other words, most economists modeling sentiment let expectations of at least
one group of investors wander, but take risk tolerance as fixed. We do the opposite, in that we let risk
tolerance of one group of investors wander, and instead assume that the cross-country components
of expectations are common across investors. These two approaches can appear equivalent if there is
only one risky asset. For example, in Delong, Summers, Shleifer, and Waldmann (1987), sentiment
shocks affect the expectations of one group of investors, pushing prices away from a rational level
as these investor buy or sell assets. The same price movement and trading could result if these
investors’ expectations were to remain constant, and instead their risk tolerance were to change.
Thus, for a single risky asset there is no observational distinction between confidence and sentiment.
   With multiple risk assets, however, investor confidence and sentiment depart. Confidence—or risk
tolerance—is a property of the investor’s preferences, and not at all related to the asset. Sentiment,
however, is specific to both the investor and the asset, in that an investor may simultaneously
have positive sentiment about some assets and negative sentiment about others. Nevertheless, with
multiple assets, any common component of an investor’s purchases relative to their holdings can
be interpreted either as a confidence or sentiment shock, since there is no meaningful distinction
between them.
   3
     This equiproportionate property is a feature of many standard investor demand specifications, such as constant
absolute risk aversion (CARA) and constant relative risk aversion (CRRA). Changes in prices are often associated
with, and used to measure, changes in risk tolerance—see for example Eichengreen, Hale and Mody (2000) and Kumar
and Persaud (2001). As with our approach, this is motivated by the equilibrium implications of the original Tobin
Separation theorem, set out by Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965). Brennan (1989) provides a clear exposition. In a
one-period setting, equilibrium prices equal (P̄ − θΣ1)/r, where P̄ represents end-of-period prices, θ is risk-tolerance,
Σ is the covariance matrix, and r is the risk-free rate. If θ changes, the vector of equilibrium prices changes by −Σ1/r.
Only in special cases (e.g., unchanging fundamentals with an identity covariance matrix) will this produce equal
returns across assets, and, therefore, cross-sectional price changes that are consistent with a change in risk tolerance.

    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a simple model exploiting our identification
scheme and demonstrating how we decompose changes in observed asset allocation for a group of
investors. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 estimates the various components of demand,
including investor risk tolerance, by means of the Kalman filter. Specifically, we use the Kalman
filter to retrieve a latent common component from the asset allocation data. The technique is similar
to that used by the National Bureau of Economic Research in determining concurrent conditions of
the U.S. economy. Finally, Section 5 characterizes the various components and their relationship to
returns.




2     Asset demand

2.1     The components of equilibrium investor demand


Define investor demand Dj as the desired allocation of wealth W to country j,

                                                     Pj Qj
                                              Dj ≡         ,                                     (2.1)
                                                      W

where Pj and Qj are the price and desired quantity of shares held from country j. This implies
that percentage changes in demand can be written as

                                           bj = Q
                                           D    b j + Pbj − W
                                                            c,                                   (2.2)

where the “hat” notation is used to signify log changes.
    The task at hand is to decompose the right-hand side of Equation (2.2) into its fundamental
components. Note that with a representative agent model (which assumes that all investors have
                     b j = 0, so that changes in demand are determined by changes in prices and
identical holdings), Q
wealth only. Prices and wealth are observable, making representative agent demand easy to estimate.
However, it is impossible to determine whether an observed change in price is attributable to a
change in the risk appetite of the representative investor or a change in expected risk and return
(given initial prices). In the case of heterogeneous agents, however, we can hope to identify changes
in the preferences of one group versus another. We do this by making some assumptions about the
information each group receives and by observing how ownership of risky assets changes over time.
    Equation (2.2) can be decomposed with an asset pricing model that connects demand to risk
tolerance, perceived return and risk. In the case of the international CAPM with a single world con-
sumption basket and CRRA utility, demand is proportional to relative risk tolerance and expected
Risk tolerance of interational investors                                                            5


returns, and inversely proportional to the covariance matrix of returns:

                                             Dj = θΣ−1
                                                    j µ,                                         (2.3)

where θ is risk tolerance, Σ−1
                            j is the jth row of the inverse of the country-return covariance matrix,

and µ is the expected excess return vector. In this model, as in many others, changes to demand
emanate from proportionate changes in both risk tolerance and perceived asset-return moments.
As an alternative preference specification, we can consider the equilibrium under CARA utility, in
which case
                                           Dj = (θ/W )Σ−1
                                                       j µ.                                      (2.4)

For now, we leave open the importance of wealth effects across markets by specifying demand as

                                           Dj = (θ/W γ )Σ−1
                                                         j µ,                                    (2.5)

where γ can vary from 0 (CRRA) to 1 (CARA). Hence the percentage change in the desired
allocation to country j can be written as

                                       D            c + Σd
                                       b j = θb − γ W    −1
                                                         j µ.                                    (2.6)

Note that over short horizons, γ is likely to be close to one. We return to this point below.
   If shocks to ex ante country risk or return were uncorrelated with one another, any common
component of returns would necessarily be attributable to changes in risk aversion, γ. In that
case, Equations (2.2) and (2.6) would be sufficient to identify changes in investor risk tolerance. We
could estimate a single factor model of the cross-section of country demands, associate the estimated
                    c ), and leave the country-specific residuals to account for Σd
factor with (θb − γ W                                                             −1
                                                                                  j µ. Essentially, we

could measure change in risk aversion from price changes without the ambiguity discussed above.
   Of course, the assumption that fundamentals are uncorrelated across countries is not realistic.
That is the underlying reason why return data alone are inadequate for measuring investor confi-
dence. Worldwide shocks to expected returns and risk are very important. The presence of this
common component in fundamentals confounds the identification of pure risk tolerance changes in
the equations above. To see this, consider the sharp drop in prices recorded globally in 2001. Is
it right to attribute this to a universal decline in risk-tolerance, or to a systematic reduction in
the expected future earnings of assets, especially those in technology-related industries? It is not
possible to obtain the answer from the equations above, since we have not introduced any way of
separating shocks to investor confidence from systematic shocks to fundamentals.
Risk tolerance of interational investors                                                                              6


   With a little more structure, however, it is possible to control for common shocks to fundamentals,
and, therefore, to be able to identify changes in risk tolerance. To add structure, we allow for two
groups of investors in each country —internationals (I) and locals (L). The key assumption is
that international investors are free to diversify across countries, but local investors hold only
combinations of their own domestic risky assets and the riskless asset. Under this specification,
locals’ trades with foreigners represent a reallocation of local wealth between the local market
and the riskless asset.4 Thus, we assume Equation (2.6) applies to both internationals and locals,
although locals face restrictions on the assets that they can hold.
   The supply of country j’s risky assets is fixed at Qj . This supply is held only by internationals
and locals from country j itself:
                                                 Qj = QI,j + QL,j .                                               (2.7)

Imposing this equilibrium on the earlier demand equations, we can express equilibrium changes in
holdings and prices as:5

                                                       .   If locals’ holdings are small, they will have already
sold out to internationals, so further reallocations are, all else equal, small from internationals’ point
of view.
   The second equation shows that price changes contain these same excess demand and excess
wealth terms. However, price changes are not driven so much by excess demand and wealth, as
by the level of demand and wealth. As a result, this equation contains an additional component,
b L,j + W
D       cL,j , which is the change in domestics’ demand and wealth. The equations say that when

there is an improvement in the fundamental outlook, all investors’ demands increase (at existing
prices). Prices rise, but this does not require an inflow of international ownership into local markets.
This happens only when internationals’ demands increase by more than locals’ demands.
    4
      In the simplest international equilibrium, purchasing power parity holds, so that all investors share the same
consumption basket. In this case, if there is a riskless asset whose return delivers predictable consumption, it applies
to all investors.

Equation (2.12) says that changes in holdings depend on relative changes in risk tolerance and
wealth, (θbI − θbL ) + (1 − γ)(W
                               cI − W
                                    cL,j ), plus an error term, (νI,j − νL,j ). These changes affect all

assets in the international portfolio and can therefore be identified from the cross-section of portfolio
reallocations. This is the strategy we pursue in Section 4. Notice that prices cannot be used in the
same way. Equation (2.13) contains the additional terms θbL − (1 − γ)W
                                                                     cL,j + ηj + νL,j and includes

the common shocks to fundamentals, ηj . Prices respond to any global shock to demand shared by
locals and internationals. The source of this shock could be a change in global fundamentals (i.e.,
an loosening of major-country monetary policy), a change in common risk appetite, or a common
change in wealth. Price changes alone cannot determine the source of the shock. It is in this sense
that holdings data is much more potent than price data for the purposes of measuring risk appetite.



2.2   Cross-correlation and short-run dynamics


The schema laid out above ignores two stylized facts about real-world holdings and portfolio flow
data. The first is that flows tend to be cross-sectionally correlated across regions. The second is
Risk tolerance of interational investors                                                                              8


that flows tend to be persistent over time, rather than random. These facts are documented in
Froot, O’Connell and Seasholes (2001) and Griffin, Nardari and Stulz (2002), and together they
necessitate some modifications to the basic model.
   From Equation (2.12), regional correlation in flows cannot arise from shifts in risk appetite or
wealth, since these would affect all countries simultaneously. Nor can it be driven by covariation in
the common beliefs about country risk and return shared by both internationals and locals, since
the term ηj does not appear in the holdings equation.6 Instead, it must arise from cross-sectional
correlation in the relative assessments of risk and return by internationals and locals, captured in
νI,j − νL,j . For example, if international investors become more bullish about Asia as a whole than
domestic Asian investors, then flows into individual Asian countries would be correlated, even after
accounting for global shocks. To allow for such regional comovement, we allow for separate regional
covariation in νI,j − νL,j in the estimation stage below.
   The observed persistence of flows deserves somewhat more thought. If we think of the holding
horizon as relatively long, then by the law of iterated expectations, short-term updates in expected
returns and expected covariances should be unpredictable. Changes in expected returns and risk
should therefore be serially uncorrelated. The same seems sensible for shocks to risk tolerance.
However, unlike returns and wealth changes, raw changes in portfolio holdings are highly positively
autocorrelated in high frequency data. Typically, once initiated, portfolio rebalancings are persistent
for between three and five weeks.
   Such persistent behavior could of course be rational. It is certainly rational for traders with
private information. Large traders can maximize the value of their private information by breaking
up desired portfolio changes over time and thereby hiding their private information about value. In
effect, their demands are less detectable if they substitute current trades for future trades to hide
amongst more random transactions by uninformed investors.7
   There are other potential reasons for persistent flows and sluggish adjustment in holdings. For
example, it is well known that, based on risk and return alone, the optimal level of international
diversification is much higher than it appears historically (i.e., there is a ”home bias” in investor
portfolios). Over time, it seems that the degree of ”home bias” has consistently diminished. The
    6
      Of course, co-movement among the ηj terms is the likely driver for the very high levels of price co-movement
within regions.
    7
      Note that in most market-microstructure models with this property (e.g., Kyle 1985), informed order flow is not
unconditionally autocorrelated; the autocorrelation is conditional on the information. This is not the case with the
actual flow data, which appear unconditionally autocorrelated. However, in the real world, market makers can’t detect
all international investor flows across markets and apart from the local investor flows. In effect, this makes aggregate
order flow less than perfectly observable, which is the assumption in Kyle.
Risk tolerance of interational investors                                                               9


undoing of this initial home bias may partially account for the persistence in flows. Agency issues
which lead managers to anchor their asset allocations partly on peer-portfolio concerns would also
suggest a slow adjustment toward otherwise desired levels.
    A third possible explanation for the observed short-term dynamics is that risk tolerance itself
adjusts with some stickiness. There is less in the way of theory to support this explanation. However,
it is possible that new information about risk might both change current prices and cause follow-
on trading demand. For example, the large changes in asset prices that accompanied the Russian
default in August 1998 caused many investors to update their beliefs about the riskiness of the
credit markets. Prices fell as anticipated volatility rose. But the higher levels of volatility then
created additional, follow-on sales by institutions that have risk (or VAR) budgets. This may have
magnified future negative price changes and volatilities, leading to persistence in flows.
    Together these explanations suggest that we ought to allow for serial correlation in both νI,j −νL,j
and in risk tolerance θI . The Kalman filter, which we use to estimate the model in Section 4, is
well-suited to this purpose. It allows us distinguish the importance of each type of persistence.




3     Data

The data used to estimate the model are provided by State Street Corporation, one of the world’s
largest investor services providers. State Street clients are primarily large institutional global money
managers, and the total of all funds serviced by the Corporation is currently USD 8.5 trillion,
approximately 16 percent of total global assets. Given the nature and sophistication of this globally
footloose client base, we identify all SSC clients as “International” investors for the purpose of
estimating the model. Our sample covers the period from January 1996–July 2003, and encompasses
both the flows and holdings of this client group in 29 equity markets. The country coverage is shown
in Table 1.
    The percentage change in international holdings for a given country and day is calculated as the
dollar flow for that day divided by the dollar holdings as of the previous day:

                                        b I,j,t =        FI,j,t
                                        Q                           ,                              (3.1)
                                                    Pj,t−1 QI,j,t−1

where FI,j,t is the flows of internationals into country j. Implicit here is the assumption that flows
take place at the start of the day—the quantity FI,j,t / PI,j,t−1 is purchased at price PI,j,t−1 . An
alternative assumption would be that the flows FI,j,t take place at the end of the day, and are priced

at PI,j,t , but in practice the difference between the two definitions is very small. Weekly changes
in holdings are calculated as the sum of the daily percentage changes. Table 1 below presents some
descriptive statistics for our countries and regions as of June 30th, 2003: MSCI market capitalization
and the percentage of this market capitalization held by the internationl investors in our sample,
the mean weekly percentage change in holdings and the standard deviation of the weekly change in
portfolio holdings.
   A key ingredient in the model is the foreign ownership share. To capture this we measure holdings
as a share of market capitalization in each country over time. We use MSCI’s measure of market
capitalization, adjusted to control for the recent implmentation of MSCI’s Enhanced Methodology.8
This share will underestimate foreign ownership by a factor equal to SSC’s share of the global
custody marketplace. However, this turns out not to matter very much for our analysis, since it
is the relative international share across countries that is the key driver, not the absolute level.
Accordingly we make no adjustment for market share. We do, however, wish to mute some of the
“within variation” across the country shares, the idea being that the dispersion of ownership shares
reported by SSC may be partly driven by idiosyncratic factors.9 Toward this end, we average
the individual country foreign ownership share with the global mean foreign ownership share in
calculating our estimate.

     The MSCI Enhanced Methodology adjusts the market capitalization of index constituents for free float and targets
for index inclusion 85% of free float-adjusted market capitalization in each industry group and in each country. The
Enhanced Methodology was implemented in two phases. The first, on November 30, 2001, reduced the measured
market capitalization of the developed countries in our sample by an average of 6.6%, and that of emerging markets
in our sample by an average of 21%. The second phase, on May 31, 2002, reduced developed country market
capitalization by an average of 4.7% and emerging markets capitalization by 29%. Accordingly, we scale down our
market capitalization prior to both adjustment dates to avoid any discrete change in the series. See www.msci.com for
details.

     For example, SSC tends to service a disproportionate share of Anglo-Saxon investors.

4         Risk tolerance

4.1          Methodology

As discussed, Equation (2.12) applies to each country in the sample. We use a factor model to extract
h                                          i
 (θbI − θbL ) + (1 − γ)(W
                        cI − W
                             cL,j ) from the cross-section of the data. In particular, we estimate a

single factor model of the form

                                       b I,j    Q
                                       Q            = aj + rt + uj,t , j = 1, . . . , N,          (4.1)
                                               QL,j

where the aj are country-specific means, rt is the common factor capturing the effects of relative
wealth and risk tolerance on all country exposures, and uj,t ≡ νbI,j − νbL,j are the orthogonalized
residuals driven by idiosyncratic fundamentals. To cater to the presence of cross-sectional and serial
correlation, we allow rt and uj,t to have autoregressive dynamics, and the residuals to covary within
regions.
     To gauge the amount of persistence present in the data, we look first at the sample partial
autocorrelation functions of the data. The partial autocorrelation at one lag is significant for all 26
countries. As the lags increase, the number of significant statistics declines: 16 at lag 2, 10 at lag
3, 8 at lag 4, 5 at lag 5, and 2 at lag 6.10 This suggests that adjustment can take up to 5 weeks,
and accordingly we allow for up to fifth-order dynamics in rt and uj,t .
     To estimate rt , we use a framework very similar to that used in Stock and Watson (1991). Let
ξt capture the state of demand at time t:

                                                ξ t = [rt u1,t u2,t · · · uN,t ]0 .               (4.2)

The elements of ξt each have AR(p) dynamics, and disturbances that are cross-sectionally related
within regions:
                                     ξt = Φ1 ξ t−1 + Φ2 ξt−2 + . . . + Φp ξt−p + ²t ,             (4.3)

where the Φ matrices are diagonal matrices containing the autoregressive parameters, and ²t is
distributed as
                                                          ²t ∼ N (0, Σ),                          (4.4)

The sub-matrices Σ1 through Σ5 are the covariance matrices for our five regions identified in Table

covariation. To avoid over-parametrization, we assume that the correlation between all countries in
a region is the same.

4.2          Results

We estimate the model for autoregressive lags of p ∈ {1, . . . , 5}. The likelihood ratio statistics for
the nested models reject p = 5 in favor of p = 4 at the 1% level, but fail to reject p = 4 in favor
of p < 4 at any reasonable significance level. In addition, they fail to reject regional correlation in
favor of no regional correlation.11 Accordingly, we set p = 4. The key results are displayed in Table
2.
      The most striking finding is the persistence of the relative risk tolerance and wealth factor rt .
The sum of its four autoregressive parameters is 0.89. The coefficients imply that a change in rt
can remain in evidence for quite some time: even after three months, 22 per cent of any shock will
still be present. The idiosyncratic dynamics for each country are also persistent, though to a lesser
     11

degree—the sum of the first four autoregressive coefficients averages 0.49 across the countries. The
fact that these idiosyncratic dynamics are present suggests that some of the stickiness we observe
in real world flows is country-specific.
   Recall from Equation (2.12) that the common factor is a hybrid of both risk tolerance and relative
wealth. If rt is to be interpreted purely as changes in risk appetite, the influence of wealth must
be accounted for. Note first that, over short horizons, γ is likely to be close to one, in which case
no adjustment is necessary. The most compelling evidence for this is that the volatility of ex post
returns, and hence wealth, is much higher than the volatility of holdings. If CRRA investors were
adjusting their holdings optimally in response to wealth changes, then from Equation (2.4), each
series would have roughly the same percentage volatility. Instead, holdings are about one fifth to
one quarter as volatile as wealth at the weekly frequency, implying that the elasticity of demand
with respect to wealth is well below unity. Indeed, given that a portion of holdings volatility comes
from shifts in relative moments νI,j − νL,j , the short run value of γ is likely to be above 0.75.
   Having said this, we wish to allow for some elasticity of holdings with respect to wealth. To
accomplish this we subtract an estimate of each period’s percentage change in wealth, scaled by
the local ownership share, from both sides of Equation (2.12). Note that this adjustment is country
specific—for country j, we need to adjust by the percentage increase in the wealth of internationals—
WI —over and above the percentage increase in the wealth of locals—WL,j . To simplify the calcula-
tion of this relative shift, we consider only equity wealth. Specifically, for country j, the adjustment
is calculated as the percentage change in international’s total equity holdings, less the percentage
change in the market capitalization of country j.

      Figure 1 plots the two resulting estimates of changes in risk tolerance. The upper panel shows
risk tolerance rt under the assumption that γ = 1, while the lower panel assumes γ = 0.75—i.e.
some wealth adjustment. Both are qualitatively similar at the weekly frequency, and indeed the
weekly correlation is 0.87. The wealth-adjusted series does appear to be somewhat less volatile

     Interestingly, the series appear to reflect a number of the more volatile periods in recent years,
including the onset of the Asian crisis at end 1997, the LTCM collapse accompanied by the Russian
default in August 1998, the global equity turn-down in 2000, and more recently the global equity
market volatility of July 2002.12 This is striking given that no prices or returns are used in the
construction of the series.13




5         Risk tolerance and prices

We investigate the importance of our measure of risk tolerance in two ways. First, we undertake
the variance decompositions suggested by Equations (2.12) and (2.13). Specifically, we calculate the
share of unconditional flow and return variation that is accounted for by the (appropriately scaled)
common factor. Second we investigate whether the risk tolerance measure has any forecasting power
for returns.

         Of course, prices do affect wealth, which is a component of the second, adjusted series.

5.1    Variance decomposition

Table 3 reports the share of holdings and price variation that stems from variation in risk tolerance
at various frequencies from 1 to 26 weeks.14 In each case, the figures are the R2 statistics from
regressions using overlapping intervals. Changes in risk tolerance (scaled by local ownership share)
are seen to be quite important in accounting for variation in holdings. For the major markets, up
to one-third of the one-week change in holdings stems from a change in risk tolerance, and this
percentage rises substantially as the horizon lengthens, reaching as much as 74 per cent for the euro
region at the half-year frequency. For developing markets, the shares are generally smaller though
important nonetheless. Turning to prices, the variation accounted for by changes in risk tolerance
(scaled now by the foreign ownership shaer) is in the range of 1–2 percent at the one-week horizon,
rising to an average of 11.7 percent at the half-year frequency. These somewhat lower levels should
not be surprising: Equation (2.13) indicates that the bulk of the variation in prices will come from
variation in local wealth, and critically, variation in commonly perceived fundamentals. In fact, the
low variance decomposition numbers belie the importance of rt for forecasting returns, and it is to
this that we now turn.

     For holdings changes, we could also look at the variance decomposition for k-step ahead prediction errors based on
the state-space model set out in Section 3. The results are qualitatively similar to the simpler decomposition reported
here.

5.2    Return forecasting

To provide a baseline for the forecasting value of rt , we first estimate a naı̈ve momentum model
of equity returns. Specifically, we attempt to forecast next week’s return on the basis of the last
four weeks of returns. Whether carried out for individual countries or in a panel setting, the results
Risk tolerance of interational investors                                                           19


for this baseline model are, unsurprisingly, mixed. Table 4 displays the panel estimates. They
suggest that, for all countries, the returns over the recent four weeks are informative about the next
week’s returns, but the R2 ’s are modest, averaging under 1%. The same is true when developed
and emerging markets are separated. For emerging markets, there is some reasonable evidence of
equity return momentum, consistent with the stylized facts established elsewhere in the literature,
while for developed markets, there is some evidence of high-frequency reversal.
   Introducing lags of the estimated risk tolerance factor into the regression brings a meaningful
improvement in explanatory power. For developed markets, the change in risk tolerance recorded in
the last week has a strong, statistically significant impact on the forecast return for this week. The
effect is economically significant too: a one-standard deviation increase in risk tolerance (scaled by
foreign ownership share) translates to an increase in forecasted return of between 10 and 20 basis
points for the next week in developed markets. For emerging markets, which the coefficient on
the first lag is insignificant, the coefficients on the second and third lags also indicate a positive
relationship between returns and lagged changes in risk tolerance. Interestingly, there is evidence
that only a portion of this return effect is permanent. The coefficent on the fourth lag of the risk
tolerance measure is strongly negative for all countries, suggesting that some, but not all, of the
impact effect on returns is reversed over the course of the subsequent month. The introduction
of the risk tolerance factor causes the R2 to double in all specifications. The average explained
variation for developed markets is almost 1.5%. This is economically significant, since it implies
an (in-sample) informatio ratio moment of approximately 0.88 for each country, before transactions
costs.
   Similar results were obtained using the wealth-adjusted measure of risk tolerance. We conclude,
then, that the preference factor contains some information about future returns.

Panel regression estimates of return forecasting model without and with estimated risk tolerance factor (unadjusted
for wealth). Results are similar using wealth-adjusted factor. Estimation is carried out by OLS.




6      Conclusion

In this paper, we have proposed a methodology for measuring investor confidence by decomposing
investor demand for international assets. The framework is based on an examination of the cross-
section of international portfolio holdings and flows of international institutional investors over time.
We estimate our model using data that provides comprehensive coverage on the equity holdings of
U.S. investors across 29 countries over the period January 1996 through July 2003. Using these data,
we decompose observed shifts in aggregate investor demand into expected risk and return, wealth
and risk tolerance components. The risk tolerance component turns out to account for a substantial
portion of variation in portfolio holdings and a smaller but meaningful amount of variation in equity
returns. In addition, it appears to be informative about future returns.
