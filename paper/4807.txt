       The paper examines the effects of terms of trade movements and productivity differentials

across sectors on the behavior of the real exchange rate. We develop a simple model of a small

open economy producing exportable and nonaadable goods and consuming importable and
nontradable goods and present empirical evidence for a sample of fourteen OECD counuies. The

evidence broadly supports the predictions of the model, namely that faster productivity growth

in the tradable relative to the nontradable sector and an improvement in the terms of trade induce

a real appreciation.

1 Introduction
Sectora.l productivity differentials across countries have long been identified as a ma-
jor determinant of real exchange rate movements (Harrod, 1939; Balassa, 1964; and
Sarnuelson, 1964). In this literature, the price of tradables is pinned down by the law
of one price and—through perfect competition—equated with marginal cost. Pro.
duction relies on internationally perfectly mobile capital and internationally perfectly
immobile labor. The small open economy thus takes the world interest rate as given,
which determines uniquely the wage rate by the equalization of marginal cost and
the given world price. Perfect intersectoral factor mobility ensures factor price equal-
ization across the tradable and the nontradable sector. Given both factor prices,
the productivity in the nontradable sector then determines the price of nontradables.
Ceteris paribus, economies with a higher level of productivity in tradables will thus
be characterized by higher wages and hence by higher prices of riontradables, i.e. a
more appreciated real exchange rate.
   A second strand of literature identifies relative price movements within the trad-
ables sector, specifically, movements in the relative price of exports to imports, as an-
other major determinant of real exchange rate movements (Dornbusch, 1980; Green-
wood, 1984; Marion, 1994; Ostry, 1988; Edwards, 1989; Roldos, 1990; and Frenkel
and Razin, 1992). The main real exchange rate effect in these models derives from
the opposite income effects of export and import price changes interacting with the
substitution effect. In addition, terms of trade shocks may display direct supply side
effects if imported intermediate inputs are used in domestic production. This lit-
erature has developed mainly to understand fluctuations of real exchange rates in
developing countries, which are characterized by large fluctuations in the terms of
trade. This issues are becoming also relevant in transition economies where trade
liberalization will increase the exposure to fluctuation in the terms of trade.
    While a substantial body of empirical literature exists on both productivity and
terms of trade effects on real exchange rate determination2, the literature tends to
focus on one of the two effects, suggting ie possibility of excluded variable bias.
In this paper, we examine the joint effect of productivity differentials and terms of
trade movements on the real exchange rate.
  In the following section we present a three-goods model of a small open economy.

                                           1
Section 3 discusses the comparative static characteristics of the model under the
extreme assumptions of perfect and zero capital mobility. Section 4 describes the
data underlying the empirical evidence reported in section 5. Sections 6 concludes.


2 The Model
We consider a three good economy with two tradable and one nontradable goods.
Tradable goods consist of imports, which are produced entirely abroad and consumed
domestically, and exports, which are produced but not consumed domestically. Thus,
private agents derive utility from the consumption of the nontradable and the im-
ported goods, while the economy produces the nontradable and the exported good.3
To focus on the long run factors behind real exchange rate movements, we adopt a
simple static framework.4

2.1 Production
Production of the exportable (yr) and the nontradable (y1) good are given by:

                                    =
and
                                        =
where 0 < a     1, IC is capital in the exportable sector, and L are labor inputs in
sector i (i = x, n). The nontradable goods sector uses only labor, hence capital is
specific to the tradable sector.

2.2 Preferences
We assume that individuals consume an importable good (c,,,), available at the given
world price Pm and the nontradable good (c,1). Preferences are given by the CES
utility function:


                                        +(l. )cm' }                              (1)


                                            2
where 'y =         and v denotes the elasticity of substitution across goods. The
consumer maximizes (1) subject to the budget constraint:

                                    pncn +pc, = 1                             (2)
where I denotes after tax income and the prices of the goods are denoted by pi
(1 = m,n). The demand functions for each good are thus given by:



and



where p denotes the utility-based price inde::

                                = c6p',[' + (1 —

Pre-tax income is given by PsYx + pnyn- Individuals pay a lump-sum tax equal to
r, which is used to finance government purcases of nontradable goods of volume g.
The government budget constraints is thus given by

                                       r = pg
and after-tax income is given by:




2.3 Equilibrium
The model is closed by equilibrium conditions for the labor and nontradable goods
markets. We assume that labor is inelastically supplied at L, so in equilibrium:

                                     L=L+L                                    (3)
  Equilibrium in the nontradable goods market implies that:

                                    c,,4-g=arLn                              (4)

                                         3
   Combining the equilibrium conditions with the demand function, the joint equi-
librium in the markets for labor and nontradable goods is given by
                                    —    / 1/a              —


                    c6YZ +      (1 —4)a5()          = (1 — cb)IanL — g]             (5)

                                = Øpi1 + (1 —
3    Comparative statics under full and zero capital mobility
We now turn to a discussion of the effects of various shocks, considering separately
the cases of perfect and zero capital mobility. We begin with the extreme case of per-
fect international capitalmobility. As various authors have shown5, the assumption
eliminates a role for demand side factors in the determination of relative prices, which
depends only on productivity across sectors. We then turn to the opposite case of
zero international capital mobility to assess the potential role of demand side factors.

3.1 Perfect Capital Mobility
Denoting wages by w and the interest rate by r, we have by duality:

                                          =                                         (5)

where = a(l — )—(1.). The law of one price is assumed to hold for exported
goods, so Px is given by the world market price.6 In like manner, the price of the
nontradable good is given by:

                                                   UI
                                          Pn=_                                       (7)
   Combining the price equations, we obtain the following expression for the relative
price of the nontradable good in terms of the exportable good:
                                                            L
                                        = Pr Ia.

                                  Pit                                                (8)



                                              4
 where F is the return to capital in terms of the exportable good (r/p1) and is
                                                                                equal
to its world value by the assumption of perfect capital mobility. The relative price
of nontradable goods is thus entirely determined by technology (a1 and a) and is
independent of demand conditions.7 Equation (8) thus replicates the Harrod- Balassa-
Samuelson result that differezices in relative prices are caused by differentialproduc-
tivity across sectors.
   The intuition is straightforward. Given the price and the return to capital in the
exportable goods sector, wages are entirely determined by (6)- In turn, wages are
the only determinant of the price of nontradables. An increase in productivity in
the exportable sector (a1) increases wa&es, w;ih increases the price of nontradables.
On the other hand an increase in productivity in nontradables does not lower wages
and hence decreases the price of nontradables. The strong result relies on a number
of equally strong assumptions, including the law of one price, perfect competition in
both sectors, perfect domestic mobility of factors, perfect international mobility of
capital and constant returns to scale. We next discuss how the results are affected
by removing one of the key assumptions, the perfect mobility of capital.

3.2 Zero Capital Mobility
We now assume that capital is internationally as well as intersectorally immobile and
normalize the capital stock to one. At a point in time, the exportable good is thus
now subject to decreasing returns to scale. For a given level of production the new
cost function is given by:
                                                  i/a
                                  C = u' (h)
and hence the competitive price, equal to marginal cost, is given by:

                                 Pr
                                      —
                                      —
                                          w
                                          —I   —
                                              (j4a\a
                                          a   \
   In contrast to the previous case, the wage is no longer uniquely determined by
P. but depends on the scale of production of exportables. Again, the intuition is
straightforward: with a fixed capital stock, the marginal productivity of labor in
exportables declines with the level of production. To maintain equality betwecn


                                              5
marginal cost and the given world price, wages—and thus the price of nontradables—
have to decline with the level of production of exportables. Using equation (7) to
substitute the wage rate by the price of nontradables, we obtain:


                                                                                     (9)

   The relationship is depicted as the downward sloping schedule PP in Figure 1. An
increase in Pt or a2 implies that wages increase for a given level of production, and
hence that the nontradable good becomes more expensive, leading to an upward shift
of PP. In contrast, an increase in a reduces p,, for given production of nontradables
and wages, resulting in a downward shift of PR
   The labor and goods market equilibrium relation (5) is depicted as the upward
sloping curve NL (Nontradables and Labor market equilibria). Assuming for the
moment that is constant (i.e. that preferences are Cobb-Douglas), the positive
slope of NL reflects the need for a higher price of nontradables to reduce demand for
nontradables and thus to shift labor to exportables. An increase in productivity in
the exportable goods sector shifts NL downward since for a given level of Yt, the price
of nontradables must fall to raise demand and shift the released labor to nontradables.
An increase in Pt raises income, and hence the demand for nontradables, requiring an
increase in the price of nontradables, i.e. an upward shift in Nt to restore equilibrium.
An increase in government spending likewise shifts NL upward as an increase in p,,
is needed to shift labor from the exportables to nontradables. Finally, an increase
in the productivity in the nontradables sector requires a reduction in p, to increase
demand, resulting in a downward shift of NL.
   Under the assumption of an invariant , changes in Pm in contrast have no effect
since the substitution effect towards nontradables cancels with the negative income
effect. Changes in Pm thus only matter to the extent that they affect which in
turn depends on the value of -y. With a low degree of substitutability (7 c 1)—the
empirically relevant case—the negative income effect dominates, inducing a downward
shift of NL.
   Figure 1 can be used to derive the comparative statics effects of changes in produc-
tivities, tradable price changes and government spending. Starting from an original
equilibrium E, the resulting equilibrium for a change in the variable z is denoted as

                                           6
A7. In terms of the nontradable price, we thus obtain:

                             = f1( a, "it,     Pr, Pm,
                                      7 —+ —-1-                                    10

   An increase in the price of the exportable good unambiguously increases both the
price of nontradables and the production of tradables. A productivity increase in
the nontradable goods sector unambiguously increases the price of nontradables, but
has ambiguous effects on the production of exportables. In contrast, an increase in
the productivity in the exportable goods sector has ambiguous effects on the price
of nontradables and increases the production of exportables. We assume that the
income effects dominates for a price increase of the imported good, and hence that
the price of nontradables declines. Of course, a change in the price of exportables
has a larger (absolute) effect on the price of nontradables compared to an equal price
change of the imported good since the income md the substitution effect work in the
same direction.

                                  [Insert figure 1]
    A sizable body of empirical literature analyzes the effect of supply and demand
side 8hifts on the real exchange rate, defined as the ratio between the domestic price
level (p) and the foreign price level (ejf), expressed in the same currency. To ob-
tain comparability of our results with that literature, we also examine the effects of
productivity, government expenditure and terms of trade on conventional measures
of the real exchange rate. The price levels, domestic and foreign, are homogencous
functions of degree one in the price of imports and nontradables. Hence, the domestic
price can be written as p = p_t(pn/pm). Under the assumption that home exports
make up a negligible fraction of world imports, the foreign price level is approximated
by p = pmW(p/ep) (Greenwood, 1984). Therefore, the real exchange rate for a
small open economy is given by

                   p/ep =          = 12( r,     a,    ptfpm, g )

4 Data
The empirical work is based on a sample of 14 OECD countries from 1970 to 1985
analyzed in Dc Gregorio, Giovannini and Wolf (1994). The sample is constrained
by the availability of data on sectoral (tradables and nontradables) productivity and
prices. To construct these variables we use the international sectoral database of the
OECD which includes data on sectoral real and nominal value added, stocks of capital,
employment and factor returns for twenty sectors.9 The ratio between nominal and
real value added provides implicit sectoral price deflators.
   Most work on productivity and real exchange rates has employed labor produc-
tivity rather than the total factor productivity measure suggested by theory.1° As
De Gregorio, Giovannini, and Krueger (1993) show, this substitution is not innocu-
ous since labor shedding may introduce substantial differences between changes in
average labor productivity and changes in total factor productivity. The bias may
be particularly important in our sample given the rise in unemployment in OECD
countries during the sample period, potentially resulting in an increase in average la-
bor productivity far exceeding the growth of total factor productivity. We hence use
the data on employment, capital stock and factor returns to compute— in standard
fashion—total factor productivity as Solow residuals.
   Lacking information that would enable us to distinguish between exported goods
and import substitutes, we classify sectors into one of two groups, tradables and
nontradables. The classification is based on the export shares in output for the whole
sample of countries, using a cutoff point of 10 percent to delineate nontradables."
The criterion classifies agriculture, mining, all of manufacturing and transportation
as tradables. The remaining sectors, accounting for about 50—60 percent of GDP, are
treated as nontradables.
   We use the indices of unit export and import values from the IMF International
Financial Statistics as measures of the export and import prices. The same source
also provides the nominal exchange rate, a real exchange rate series based on trade
weighted CPI's, and an index of the world price level based on the implicit GDP
deflator of industrial countries. The IMF World Economic Outlook provides data on
the share of real government expenditure in real GDP and on per capita GDP.

5 Empirical Evidence
We estimate equations (lO)—(11) for the sample of OECD countries. All variables
are expressed in logs, and because of the high autocorrelation in the level regressions,
the equations were estimated in first differences. The results for the real exchange
rate and for the relative price of nontradables are reported in tables 1 and 2. The
regressions either use the sectoral total factor productivities as separate variables,
or use the weighted average defined in (8). The real exchange rate regressions also
include GDP per capita to permit comparisons with previous work and to allow for
additional demand side effects, arising, for example, from non-homothetic preferences
linking demand shares—and hence the real exchange rate—to the level of income.
   Regressions 1.1 and 1.2 in table I estimate the standard productivity model with
the real exchange rate as the dependent variable. In line with the previous literature
the differential in total factor productivity across sectors, per capita GDP and the
share of government expenditure in total GDP enter highly significantly with the
expected sign. The positive coefficient on the relative productivity term supports the
Harrod- Balassa-Samuelson conjectuc, whe the significant effects of government
spending and income suggest that the demand side factors do play an important role,
casting doubt on the empirical support for the perfect capital mobility case.
  Regressions 1.3 and 1.4 report regressions with only the terms of trade as regressors.
Both the terms of trade themselves and the export and import prices separately enter
highly significantly with the correct sign and the predicted difference in the absolute
magnitude of the coefficients on the export and import price.

                                   fins ert table 1]
   The inclusion of relative price shifts in the tradables sector— either in the ag-
gregate (regressions 1.5 and 1.6) or separately (regressions 1.7 and l.8)—does not
change the sign or significance of the productivity and government variables. Indeed,
the estimated coefficient on relative productivity increases substantially, suggesting
a possible excluded variable bias in regressions focusing solely on the productivity
terms. The income variable in contrast becomes insignificant, suggesting that it may
have played a proxy role for terms of trade shocks in the previous regressions. The
ternis of trade themselves come in highly significantly with the predicted sign. Re-

                                           9
gressions 1.5 and 1.6 also correspond to the theoretical prediction on the relative size
of the coefficients on import and export prices.
   Table 2 reports the results using the relative price of nontradables rather than the
real exchange rate as the dependent variable. We try out three different deflators,
the price of imports, the price of exports and a worldwide CDP deflator. In all three
cases, changes in the terms of trade are highly significant, signed in accordance to
the theoretical prediction. In line with the results from table I and the predictions
of the model the coefficient on the price of exports is greater, in absolute value, than
the coefficient on the price of imports.

                                   [Insert table 2]
   In contrast to the results obtained for the real exchange rate, the support for
the Harrod-Balassa.-Samuelson conjecture is weaker. The coefficient on productiv-
ity growth in tradables becomes generally insignificant from zero while productivity
growth in nontradables enters with a significant positive sign in contradiction to the
theory. A possible explanation for this finding could be the simultaneous effect of a
nominal depreciation on the price of final good import prices—lowering the relative
price—and on the cost of imported ntermediate goods, reducing measured Solow
residuals.


6 Concluding Remarks
Two sizable but separate empirical literatures examine the linkage between relative
price movements on the one hand and relative sectoral productivities and terms of
trade shock on the other. This paper aimed to merge the two strands, presenting
a model that allows for both productivity and terms of trade shocks and assessing
the role of both factors in the determination of exchange rates. We find that both
terms of trade fluctuations and differential productivity growth across sectors are
highly significant determinants of real exchange rate movements as well as important
factors behind changes in changes in the relative price of nontradables. The evidence
furthermore suggests that the terms of trade affect the real exchange rate mainly

    For the effects of productivity on the real exchange rate see Hsieh (1982), Marston
(1987), Froot and Rogoff (1991a, b), Bergstrand (1991), De Gregorio, Giovannini and
Krueger (1994) and De Gregorio, Giovannini and Wolf (1994), and for the effects of
the terms of trade see Edwards (1989) and Roldos (1990).

6     simplicity, we fix the nominal exchange rate at one and also normalize K2 to
    For
one. This last assumption has no effects on the ensuing discussion since we do not
analyze capital accumulation.
  While we treat f as given, it is interesting to note that according to (8) a decline
in f will prompt capital to flow to the exportable sector, increasing wages and the
relative price of nontradable goods.
