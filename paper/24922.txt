Charity Begins at Home (and at School): Effects of Religion-Based Discrimination in Education

                                          ABSTRACT

Religions often preach preferential treatment of fellow believers. This paper examines whether
one’s religious status (secular or religious) leads one to discriminate against people with a
different religious status; how this affects human capital formation; and whether this
discrimination is affected by exposure to others with a different religious orientation. We develop
a method of detecting individual religious status and apply it to study grading decisions on
national matriculation exams in Israel’s Jewish state education. Comparing grades given by
religious versus secular examiners to religious versus secular students, we find evidence of in-
group bias. This bias is almost entirely driven by male examiners. Exploiting bunching in the
grade distribution, we are able to examine who drives this observed bias: the secular or the
religious. In addition, we find that in some cases exposure at home and at work to others with
different religious beliefs may attenuate the bias. These biases in grading have long-run
implications since they affect students’ eligibility for university admission and as a result their
occupation and earnings in adulthood.

1. Introduction

Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in the economics of inter-group discrimination
and prejudice (see Charles and Guryan 2013 and Bertrand and Duflo 2017 for reviews). This
literature has largely focused on racial, ethnic, and gender-based discrimination. At the same
time, the economics of religion has long focused on understanding the causes and effects of
religious orientation and secularization (Barro and McCleary 2003; Gruber and Hungerman
2008; Iyer 2016). This paper inquires whether religious orientation itself can serve as a source
of discrimination and examines its consequences in the context of human capital accumulation.

         Even within a nominally religiously homogeneous society, people vary enormously in
their level of religiousness. While in the US non-Christian religious groups represent less than
7% of the population, 24% of Americans are currently estimated to be religiously unaffiliated
(Jones and Cox 2017; see also Hout, Fischer, and Chaves 2013). Furthermore, the share of the
religiously unaffiliated has been growing and they tend to be overrepresented among younger
cohorts.1 Inter-group discrimination across levels of religious orientation is thus potentially
widespread (and this potential may be increasing as polarization between religious and secular
segments of the population grows). This is especially plausible as many religions openly preach
preferential treatment of fellow believers, and sometimes harsh treatment of non-believers.
However, due to data limitations, such discrimination goes largely unnoticed.

         Beyond the challenges of identifying discrimination in a non-experimental setting,
there is the issue that religious status is often hard for researchers to observe. We propose a
method of inferring religious status based on a very meaningful and revealing choice: which
school to send one’s children to. This allows us to assign religious status not only to children
but also to parents. Importantly, we are able to implement this method on large-scale
administrative data involving professional decision makers making highly consequential
decisions. Specifically, we study grading decisions in Israel’s matriculation system: a
centralized, country-wide system of exams that, to a significant extent, determines both a
student’s prospects for continuing to higher education as well as her field of study (and hence

  About 85% of the unaffiliated identify as secular (the majority), agnostic, or atheist. And of course even within
the religiously affiliated Christian population, there is enormous diversity in denomination.

                                                        2
occupation). Throughout, our focus is on the Jewish population and hence we are able to isolate
discrimination across levels of religiousness within a given religion.

         We take advantage of six important features of this setting. First, the Israeli public
school system is divided into religious and secular schools. Religious schools not only stress
religious teachings but also observe various religious precepts (e.g., kosher food). Hence,
virtually all religious families send their children to religious schools while the vast majority
of secular families send their children to secular schools. This provides the basis of our
classification of religious and secular individuals. Second, due to the centralized nature of the
system, the exact same matriculation exams are taken by both religious and secular students.2
Moreover, these exams are randomly assigned to be graded by professional examiners, such
that each exam booklet is graded independently by two examiners.

         Third, while the exams are anonymous, religious Jews add a special inscription at the
top of the first page of every written document.3 This in principle allows the examiner grading
the exam to know whether the student is religious or not (and to potentially take that into
account when grading the exam). Fourth, since the examiners are themselves teachers, we have
information on their demographic characteristics. Crucially, we are able to link examiners to
their children’s schooling records and thereby to infer the examiners’ religious status.

         Fifth, we have detailed data on the grades given to each exam booklet, where the grades
range from 0 to 100. Observing the entire distribution of grades allows us to exploit bunching
at certain points in the distribution (e.g., a grade of 55 implies passing; 54 implies failing) in
order to better understand the source of grading biases, beyond what can be learned from a
difference-in-differences analysis. Finally, in addition to the grade in the state-run
matriculation exam (known as the “external” grade), each student also receives an “internal”
grade in each specific subject, given by her school before taking the state-run exam. This allows
us to rule out spurious correlations between the grader’s and the student’s religious status on
the one hand and the student’s performance in a specific subject on the other hand.

         Consider first the fundamental question: do religious and secular examiners
discriminate in favor of students with the same religious status as themselves? We exploit the

 We do not include in the analysis exams that vary across religious and secular schools.

 The inscription is BS”D, an acronym for Besiyata DiShmaya, an Aramaic phrase meaning “with the help of
heaven.” Religious Jews write this inscription (or a variation thereof) at the top of the first page of every written
document as a reminder to them that all things come from God.

                                                         3
random assignment of exam booklets to examiners to estimate a difference-in-differences
model, allowing for systematic differences across religious status both in student ability and in
examiner standards. Intuitively, we compare the mean difference in grades given to religious
versus secular students by religious and secular examiners, controlling for student and subject
fixed effects. Since in some subjects (e.g., math) the matriculation program includes several
variants (usually varying by level of proficiency), each distinguished by a questionnaire
number, we use instead a questionnaire fixed effect. Through the rest of the paper we use
“questionnaire” to refer to a specific variant of the subject. Using data from over 3.5 million
grades given in 112 questionnaires in the years 2010–2015, we find evidence of a small but
significant tendency toward religion-based in-group bias. Importantly, the bias is driven almost
entirely by male examiners: an exam grade is on average about 0.03 standard deviations higher
when assigned to a male examiner of the same (rather than different) religious status as the
student. This is a pattern we see in almost all of our results: female examiners exhibit little if
any religion-based discrimination. The estimated bias is not driven by other student
characteristics that might be correlated with student religious status. Remarkably, the bias is
just as large in math and science as it is in non-STEM subjects.

       The biases we uncover have significant effects on the probability of passing the exam
(a prerequisite for obtaining a matriculation diploma). These effects are especially meaningful
for students who come from a low-education background (i.e., both parents have 12 years of
schooling or less): if the exam is assigned to two examiners with a different religious status
than the student, the chances of passing are about one percentage point lower than if it is
assigned to examiners with the same religious status.

       A difference-in-differences analysis allows us to detect in-group bias. It does not,
however, allow us to identify the source of this discriminating behavior: whether it is due to
the secular or religious examiners (or both). The main difficulty is that we do not have a direct
measure of the quality of the exam, and there may be systematic unobserved differences
between exams written by secular and religious students. This limitation is common in studies
of in-group bias in non-experimental data (e.g., Shayo and Zussman 2011; Anwar, Bayer, and
Hjalmarsson 2012). Here, we propose a way to help address this limitation. Our approach is
based on the existence of bunching of test scores at particular thresholds: the 55 grade required
for passing and the perfect 100 grade. We can thus test whether the likelihood of just crossing
the threshold is higher when the student is religious rather than secular. Importantly, we can


                                                4
test this separately for religious and secular examiners. The results for the passing threshold
are not conclusive: it appears that secular examiners are somewhat less likely—and religious
examiners are somewhat more likely—to hike a religious student’s grade from 54 to 55 or 56.
Both estimates are very imprecise, however. The picture is much clearer for the 100 threshold.
While male secular examiners are slightly less likely to hike grades in the 98–99 range to 100
when the student is religious, male religious examiners are between 6 and 10 percentage points
more likely to do so when the student is religious.

       Finally, we find evidence that, in line with inter-group contact theory, religious-status-
based discrimination might also be affected by exposure to people from other groups: in our
case, people with a different religious status. We examine several measures of exposure both
at the community level (the neighborhoods where the examiners live) and at the workplace
level (the schools where they teach). For male examiners—who are responsible for almost all
of the observed bias—we find that in-group bias is significantly reduced when the
neighborhood or school includes more of the other group. The analysis controls for examiner
by neighborhood/school fixed effects, which helps address the concern that the results are
driven by selection of examiners who, say, move to a different neighborhood. Nonetheless,
changes in school or neighborhood composition are not random: while the results for male
examiners are consistent with the contact hypothesis, they may not be causal.

       The paper relates to four main strands of the literature. First, a vast literature studies
racial and gender discrimination in various settings such as the labor market and several aspects
of law enforcement (see Charles and Guryan 2013 and Bertrand and Duflo 2017 for reviews).
We contribute to this literature in three important ways. (i) We study discrimination across a
very salient but little-studied dimension, namely, religious status. (ii) We study discrimination
in the school system, which can have long-term implications for professional development and
lifetime earnings. (iii) We find that discrimination along religious lines is almost entirely driven
by men.

       Second, we contribute to the literature on economics of education where measures of
teachers’ grading biases are used as a measure of discrimination. Lavy (2008), Björn, Höglin,
and Johannesson (2011), Hanna and Linden (2012), Cornwell, Mustard, Van Parys (2013),
Burges and Greaves (2013 ), Diamond and Persson (2016), Botelho, Madeira, and Rangel
(2015), Lavy and Sand (2015), and Terrier (2016) use the systematic difference between non-
blind and blind assessment across groups as a measure of such discrimination, as was used

                                                 5
originally by Blank (1991) and Goldin and Rouse (2000).4 Particularly relevant to our study is
the field experiment reported by Feld, Salamanca, and Hamermesh (2015), who vary whether
or not a student’s name is revealed to graders in Maastricht University, and find evidence of
nationality-based favoritism by Dutch and German graders.

         Third, the economics of religion has long studied the effects of religiousness and
secularization at both the national and individual levels (Iyer 2016 provides a recent review).
At the individual level, the literature focuses on such outcomes as income, education, and
health-related behavior (Gruber and Hungerman 2008; Bryan, Choi, and Karlan 2018). Our
analysis provides a useful complement: while religiousness may have positive (or negative)
effects relative to secularism, the cleavage itself can have important implications as it can
generate prejudice and discrimination, leading to bad allocations.

         Finally, we contribute to the vast literature on social identity and in-group bias. Much
of this literature is based on lab experiments (in social psychology these start with Tajfel et al.
1971 and hundreds of follow-ups; in economics see Eckel and Grossman 2005, Chen and Li
2009, Klor and Shayo 2010), but a growing number of studies document in-group bias in
naturally occurring data (Price and Wolfers 2010; Shayo and Zussman 2011, 2017; Hjort 2014;
Fisman et al. 2017; Bar and Zussman 2017; Sandberg 2018). Relatedly, we provide evidence
on inter-group contact theory (Alport 1954 and hundreds of follow-ups), which has received
increasing attention from economists in recent years (see Bertrand and Duflo 2017).

         The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the institutional
background of the Israeli matriculation exam system. Section 3 describes the data and provides
descriptive statistics. Section 4 presents the empirical framework and identification strategy.
Section 5 reports the results. Section 6 offers a summary and some conclusions.

2. Institutional Background

The Israeli High-School and Matriculation Exam System


4
  Lavy (2008) finds that in high schools, male students are discriminated against in all subjects. Based on evidence
from primary schools in the US, Cornwell et al. (2013) found that boys who perform equally well as girls are
graded less favourably by their teachers and that this gap can be largely explained by these students’ non-cognitive
skills. Other papers using a similar methodology examine the existence of racial discrimination: Burgess and
Greaves (2013) find that in English public schools, black Caribbean and black African students are under-assessed
relative to their white peers while other minority groups (such as Indian, Chinese, and Asian) are over-assessed.
Botelho et al. (2015) find that black students are discriminated against relative to their white classmates in
Brazilian schools. Björn et al. (2011) report a similar attitude toward students from foreign backgrounds in
Swedish high schools.

                                                         6
Israeli post-primary education consists of middle school (grades 7–9) and high school (grades
10–12). When entering high school (tenth grade), students choose whether to enroll in the
academic track leading to a matriculation certificate (bagrut in Hebrew – to be explained
below) or in the vocational track leading to a high-school diploma.

         In this paper we focus on schools in the academic track where the language of
instruction is Hebrew. The vast majority of students in these schools are Jewish.5 Importantly,
these schools can belong to two distinct sectors, according to religious status. “State schools”
are secular and serve the secular Jewish population. “State-religious schools” serve mainly the
religious Jewish population.6 The latter are managed and supervised by an autonomous and
independent administration system within the Ministry of Education. They observe religious
practices (such as kosher food), and hence are practically the only state school alternative for
the religious population. These schools also emphasize religious teachings and in some of the
subjects follow a different curriculum. It should be stressed however that both secular and
religious state schools are public schools, funded by the state.

         The matriculation certificate is a prerequisite for university admission and receiving it
is an economically important educational milestone. Students complete the matriculation
process by passing a series of state exams administered in tenth, eleventh, and, in greater part,
twelfth grade. Students choose to be tested at various levels of proficiency: questionnaires in
each subject award one to five credit units per subject, depending on difficulty. A minimum of
twenty credits is required to qualify for a matriculation certificate. All students are tested in a
given questionnaire on the same day. Most exams are held in the summer (mid-May to early
July), and only about 15% are held in winter (January–February). Some subjects are mandatory
and, for many, the most basic level of study is three credit units. At least one elective is required
at an advanced level (of four or five credit units). Since religious and secular schools share the
same core curriculum, they also share over half the matriculation test questionnaires.

         The final matriculation score in a given questionnaire is the mean of two intermediate
scores: “internal” and “external.” The first is based on a school-level (internal) exam, graded
at the school by the student’s own teacher, before the external exam takes place. The external
exam is a state-level exam produced and supervised by the Ministry of Education. These state

5
  Schools with both Jewish and non-Jewish students exist mainly in municipalities with a minority Arab population
and even in these schools the proportion of non-Jewish students is very small.
6
  Ultra-Orthodox Jews have their own school system which is not part of our analysis since ultra-Orthodox schools
do not include an academic track leading to a matriculation certificate. There were slightly more than one thousand
Jewish high schools in 2016 (excluding ultra-Orthodox schools), of which one third were religious schools.

                                                        7
exams are “external” to the school because they are written and scored by an independent
agency.

         Importantly, each external exam booklet is graded independently by two examiners,
randomly assigned by a computer algorithm. These two examiners are expert teachers who
have been instructing the subject of the exam for at least several years. In order to reduce the
possibility that teachers will inappropriately inflate their students’ scores, the protocol
eliminates the possibility of examiners grading their own students’ exams. In addition, the
computerized process sends all exam booklets that were distributed in a specific classroom to
the same two examiners together with the seating arrangement in the classroom in order to
facilitate the detection of cheating on the exams. The final external score is the average of these
two examiners’ evaluations.



Revealing Religiousness

The external exam booklets do not reveal a student’s identity to the grader: they only include
the student’s ID number and school code. Nonetheless, while the grading process is
anonymous, religious Jews write a special inscription—BS”D—at the top of every page of
every written document. Since virtually everyone in Israel is aware of this practice, the religious
status of the student is in essence revealed to the examiners.7

         To validate the assumption that students from religious schools write BS”D on their
exam booklets, we were allowed to randomly sample 442 exam booklets. The sample contains
199 booklets from a 2-credit Hebrew questionnaire exam from 2015 (100 students from
religious schools and 99 students from secular schools) and 243 exam booklets from a 3-credit
mathematics questionnaire exam from 2014 (119 students from religious schools and 124
students from secular schools). In 83% of the cases the religious status of students’ schools
coincides with a religious BS”D notation (86% in math and 80% in Hebrew). The inconsistent
cases are mostly due to students from religious schools who do not write BS”D (26% in math
and 39% in Hebrew), while very few students from secular schools wrote BS”D (3% in math

 Figure 1 presents as an illustration of the BS”D (‫ (בס"ד‬notation, the first pages of religious students’ notebooks

English paragraphs.

and 2% in Hebrew).8 As noted above, an examiner grades all the exam booklets that are
distributed in a specific classroom and therefore if the majority of booklets from a given
classroom bear the religious BS”D inscription, the examiner will likely assume that the few
students in the room who did not write this inscription are also religious.



3. Data and Descriptive Statistics

The data used in this study includes all matriculation questionnaires taken in the summer
session by Jewish students in both the religious and secular state education system in the school
years 2010–2015.9 Since we did not have information on the matriculation exams’ language,
we excluded Arab students who attended Arab schools and foreign-born students from the
sample as their exam booklets were most likely not written in Hebrew. The basic database of
matriculation test scores in each year was merged with the student database and the school
database of the relevant year. Each matriculation test score record contains information on the
test: student, school, and class identifiers, grade, questionnaire number, number of credit units,
scores given by the first and second examiners, and school-level (“internal”) exam score.
Importantly, we also have data on both examiners’ identifiers. Merging the matriculation exam
record of each student with the student database of the same year added further information on
students’ characteristics (grades, class and school assignment and school zip code, gender,
ethnicity based on parents’ country of birth, number of siblings, and parents’ education).10 The
religious orientation of students was determined according to their schools’ religious
orientation by merging the data with the school file (containing each school’s location,
religious orientation, and whether it is a gender-segregated school).

         A crucial requirement for the analysis was obtaining information on examiners. The
fact that examiners have to teach the subject of the exam in high school for several years before
grading matriculation exams enables us to obtain information from teachers’ files for the years

8
  Appendix Table A1 presents the coefficients of balancing tests for writing BS’D. The dependent variable in each
regression is the characteristic of the student and the explanatory variable is a dummy for religious student who
wrote BS’D (the regression includes questionnaire FE). The first column includes all students and the second
column includes religious students only. Overall, the estimates indicate that writing BS”D is highly correlated
with the religious status of students (first column) and that writing BS”D among religious students (second
column) is more prevalent among female students, among students with more siblings, and among students with
low parental education.
9
  We have data on questionnaires given in the summer session only. Matriculation questionnaires are jointly taken
by both secular and religious sectors, if the proportion of religious students that take the questionnaire is in the
range [0.1, 0.9].
10
   Parents’ country of birth is in general defined by fathers’ country of birth. In case of missing values or Israeli-
born fathers it is defined by mothers’ country of birth.

                                                          9
2000–2015. The information on each examiner (main field of instruction, main school
assignment, gender, number of children, age, education and ethnicity, school assignment and
school zip code) is obtained from the teacher database of the relevant year or earlier (in case
the examiner did not teach in a certain year) and merged with the school database of the same
year in order to add schools’ religious orientation.

       The examiners’ religious status is defined according to the religious status of their
children’s school. Specifically, in order to define the religious orientation of the examiners, we
constructed a new database that defined the religious orientation of each parent who had a child
enrolled in high school during 1998–2016. This new parent database was obtained by merging
students’ files (which contain parents’ identifiers) for the years 1998–2016 with the same year’s
school databases containing schools’ religious orientation. Parents were defined as religious if
at least one of their children attended a religious school. Since we have students’ files for many
years (1998–2016) we were able to determine the religious status of most of the examiners in
our sample according to this definition (about 85% of the examiners and 87% of the graded
exam booklets). According to a series of balancing tests (see Appendix Table A2), students
who were assigned to examiners who had missing values for religious status did not differ
significantly in their characteristics from the other students.

       We developed several measures of examiners’ exposure to different environments each
year at school: the proportion of religious/secular peers at school, the proportion of same-
subject religious/secular peers, and the proportion of same-gender religious/secular peers.
These variables were constructed at the examiner level in each year by merging the information
on examiners’ peers at school from teachers’ files in each year with the parents’ files. The
teacher database contains information on all teachers in each school, including their
demographic information and main fields of study. Therefore, merging it with parents’ files
enables us to compute for each teacher in a given year the proportion of peers at school from a
religious background, the proportion of peers at school from a religious background who teach
the same subject, and the proportion of peers at school from a religious background who have
the same gender.

       Similarly, we also computed a geographical measure of examiners’ exposure to a
different religious environment each year in his/her neighborhood, using the proportion of
religious/secular students within the examiners’ zip code. Since both students’ and teachers’
files contain neighborhood zip codes, we were able to characterize for each teacher’s zip code


                                                10
in a given year the proportion of students who attended religious schools according to students’
files, and merged it with teachers’ files for the relevant year.

       The final merged panel dataset consists of data for six years of matriculation exams
between the years 2010–2015. The dataset includes matriculation test characteristics (student,
school, class, both examiners identifiers, questionnaire number, number of credits, scores given
by the first and second examiners, school-level (“internal”) exam score), students’
characteristics (grades, class, and school assignment and school zip code, gender, ethnicity,
number of siblings, and parents’ education), school characteristics (location, religious
orientation, and whether it is a gender-segregated school), and the information on the two
examiners of each exam booklet (main field of instruction, gender, age, education and ethnicity,
main school’s characteristics, and peers’ and neighbors’ religious orientation).



Descriptive Statistics

Table 1 presents descriptive statistics at the student level, for all students and by students’
religious orientation. The total number of students who took at least one “summer session”
matriculation exam in Hebrew during the years 2010–2015 is 423,002 students. One-quarter of
these students came from religious schools. Comparing students’ background by religious
orientation reveals that the proportion of girls and the number of siblings are higher among
religious students (the proportion of girls is 62% versus 51% and the average number of
siblings is 2.25 versus 0.9). Other characteristics are similar for both sectors. Additional
statistics on students’ test scores by students’ religious orientation are presented in Appendix
Table A3. On average, secular students have external test scores similar to those of religious
students (70.5 versus 70), as well as a similar probability of passing the exam.

       Table 2 presents descriptive statistics of examiners, by gender and religious orientation.
There are about 2.5 thousand examiners in our sample, most of whom are female examiners
(82.7%) and one-third of whom are religious examiners (33.8%). Of the religious examiners,
one third are Ultra-Orthodox (11.1%) and about 10% teach at schools located in segregated
religious areas (religious settlements). Except for being a bit less educated than their secular
counterparts (the proportion of secular examiners with an M.A. or a Ph.D. is 67% while the
corresponding proportion of religious examiners is only 57%), secular and religious examiners
have similar observed characteristics. Comparing examiners’ characteristics by gender reveals
that female examiners are less likely to teach science (44% versus 65%), are more likely to be

                                                11
Ultra-Orthodox (12% versus 5.5%), are younger (51 years old versus 55), and are less educated
than their male peers (the proportion of female examiners with an M.A. or a Ph.D. is 65%
versus 69%).

        Descriptive statistics on examinations are presented in Appendix Tables A4 and A5.
The data are based on around 4 million exam booklets, from one thousand schools. Since we
have 2.5 thousand examiners, the mean number of booklets graded by each examiner is 1650
(std.=1443), and the mean number of booklets per school graded by each examiner is 12.3
(std.=5.33). The mean number of exam scripts per school graded by each examiner in each year
is 9.37 (std.=7.44). This is due to the fact that all exam booklets that are distributed in a specific
classroom are graded by the same examiner and the maximum number of students who are
allowed to be examined in the same classroom is 20. Since all booklets that are distributed in
a specific classroom are graded by two examiners, the mean number of exam booklets per
school graded by the same two examiners in each year is almost the same (8.78, std.=6.453).
In addition, the mean number of booklets taken by each student is 4.88 (std.=2.77) and the total
number of questionnaires is 112.11

         Appendix Table A5 presents summary statistics on the number of exams taken by
religious and secular students who were graded by religious and secular examiners. The
proportion of secular booklets graded by religious examiners out of the total of graded secular
booklets (28.7%) is a bit lower than the proportion of religious booklets graded by religious
examiners out of the total of graded religious booklets (30.5%) because some subjects are
studied more extensively than others within a sector. This is the reason why the assignment of
booklets to examiners is random only within a given questionnaire (as will be shown in Section
4).

        In addition, summary statistics on the examiners’ exposure to different religious
environmental are presented in Appendix Table A6. Overall, the means and medians of secular
examiners’ exposure measures are lower than those of religious examiners and the variances
are higher for all different types of exposure. This might be due to the fact that the proportion
of secular individuals in the total population is much higher and more religious individuals live
and work in secular areas than the other way around. The fact that there is a relatively high
variation in examiners’ exposure measures, which is also prevalent in the within-examiners’

11
  This is due to the fact that the sample includes only matriculation exams that are taken by students from both
the secular and religious sectors. The mean total number of exams taken by each student is twice the mean number
of exams taken by each student in the sample.

                                                      12
exposure measures (as reflected in the percentage of the variance of the dummies for high
exposure measures that results from within-examiners’ variance), enables us to test whether
examiners’ in-group biases are affected by their exposure to others with different religious
beliefs, comparing the same questionnaire and the same examiners over time (and even the
same examiners by questionnaire and by zip code/school).



4. Identification and Estimation

The main goal of the paper is to estimate religion-based in-group bias. In order to identify this
in-group bias, we rely on the random assignment of students’ exam booklets to examiners
within a given questionnaire. We conduct a series of balancing tests in order to examine this
identifying assumption. Specifically, we test whether booklets assigned to religious examiners
were different from booklets assigned to secular examiners within a given questionnaire, in
terms of students’ characteristics and religious orientation. Table 3 presents the results of these
balancing tests for all examiners (column 1), and separately for male (column 2) and female
examiners (column 3). Each estimate is derived from a separate regression where the
explanatory variable is the dummy for religious examiner and the dependent variables are
students’ characteristics (students’ religious status, gender, number of siblings, father’s years
of education, mother’s years of education, and five ethnicity indicators: parents born in
Asia/Africa, Europe/America, former Soviet Union, Ethiopia, or Israel). Additionally, each
regression includes questionnaire and year fixed effects as control variables. Except for one
case, none of the estimated effects in Table 3 are significantly different from zero, indicating
that characteristics of students whose exam booklets are assigned to religious examiners are
not systematically different from those of students whose booklets are assigned to secular
examiners, within a given questionnaire. These balancing tests confirm that the computer
algorithm that assigns exam booklets of a given questionnaire to examiners is indeed random
with respect to examiners’ religious status.

   We exploit the fact that students’ exam booklets are randomly assigned to examiners within
a given questionnaire, in order to test whether examiners grade student exam booklets
differently depending on students’ and examiners’ religious profiles. We consider the
following benchmark difference-in-differences specification:
              (1)      𝑦𝑏𝑖𝑗𝑞𝑡 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑆𝑡𝑢𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖 + 𝛼2 𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝐸𝑥𝑎𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑗

                    +𝛼3 𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑆𝑡𝑢𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡 ∗ 𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝐸𝑥𝑎𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑗 + 𝛽𝑖 + 𝛾𝑞 + 𝛿𝑡 + 𝜀𝑏𝑖𝑗𝑞𝑡

                                                13
𝑦𝑏𝑖𝑗𝑞𝑡 is the outcome (e.g., test score) of exam booklet b, written by student 𝑖 and assigned to
examiner 𝑗, in questionnaire 𝑞, in year 𝑡. 𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑆𝑡𝑢𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖 and 𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝐸𝑥𝑎𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑗 are indicator
variables for religious student and religious examiner. The baseline specification includes
questionnaire ( 𝛾𝑞 ) and year (𝛿𝑡 ) fixed effects. We further include student fixed effects (𝛽𝑖 ).
𝜀𝑏𝑖𝑗𝑞𝑡 is an error term clustered within examiner.12

         Equation (1 allows for two possible differences across religious groups that do not
necessarily indicate religious bias. First, it is possible that exams written by religious students
have different unobserved characteristics (including, but not limited to, different quality) than
those written by secular students. Thus, 𝛼1 may be nonzero even in the absence of religious
bias. Second, it is possible that religious and secular examiners have different grading standards
(e.g., religious examiners may be more lenient). In other words, 𝛼2 may be nonzero even in the
absence of religious bias. Examiner religious bias is captured by 𝛼3 . This coefficient reflects a
difference-in-differences: by how much religious examiners are more generous than secular
examiners when grading an exam written by a religious student rather than a secular one.



5. Results

We start by estimating in-group bias using several alternative specifications. Table 4 shows
baseline results. The unit of observation is an exam booklet graded by a particular examiner
and the dependent variable is the (normalized) score given by that examiner. The number of
observations is twice the number of exam booklets, since each booklet is graded by two
different examiners.

         Before estimating equation (1), columns 1 and 2 estimate, separately for religious and
secular examiners, the difference in grades given to religious versus secular students. The
regressions control for questionnaire and year fixed effects. Note that both religious and secular
examiners give lower grades to religious students, with the difference being larger among
secular examiners. Column 3 in Table 4 estimates equation (1) but for comparability shows a
specification that again only includes questionnaire and year fixed effects. Religious students’


12
  Notice that while the examiner is the relevant treatment and we allow for clustering at this level, the clustering
problem is not very central in our setting since the main explanatory variable – 𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑆𝑡𝑢𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡 ∗ 𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝐸𝑥𝑎𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑟
– varies within the treatment group. Nonetheless, we allow for clustering at the examiner level to address possible
within-examiner correlations (we note that the uncorrected standard errors are much smaller, for example, the
uncorrected standard error in the baseline specification is 0.002 instead of the clustered standard error of 0.006).

                                                        14
test scores are lower by 0.05 of a standard deviation and religious examiners are marginally
more generous, their mean test score being higher by 0.019 of a standard deviation. The in-
group bias estimate is reported in the third row and equals 0.011, which is the difference
between the two religious student indicators’ estimates in the first two columns. Thus, test
scores are on average higher by 1% of a standard deviation when the exam booklet is assigned
to an examiner of the same religion as the student. This estimate is small and also imprecisely
estimated.

       In column 4 of Table 4 we add student fixed effects. The religious student indicator
drops because of perfect collinearity. The religious examiner coefficient declines almost by
half but the in-group bias estimate remains unchanged and becomes statistically significant.
This specification will be our preferred estimated equation throughout the paper. Nonetheless,
in column 5 we present a specification that includes booklet fixed effects (note that the student
and year fixed effects drop out). The estimated in-group bias in this specification is positive,
somewhat smaller, and much more precise: its standard error is the lowest of all specifications.
This last specification captures within-booklet differences in test scores given by examiners of
a different religious orientation than both types of students. Since we further on stratify the
sample to different subgroups (mostly male and female examiners’ subsamples) with fewer
exam booklets appearing twice in each subgroup, we do not address this more demanding
estimation strategy in the subsequent analysis. Finally, note that the evidence of in-group bias
in Table 4 does not allow us to tell whether the source of the bias is religious examiners, secular
examiners, or both. This is because we do not know what the unbiased grades of secular and
religious students would be. We propose a method of addressing this issue in Section 5.3 below.

       In Table 5 we present estimates based on stratified samples by gender of the examiner.
Both male and female religious examiners give on average a higher test score than secular
examiners (first row), though only the religious female estimate is significant. The striking
results emerge in the second row: the in-group bias of male examiners is 0.030 (se=0.015),
three times larger than the average effect shown in Table 4 and it is significantly different from
zero. The female in-group bias is much smaller and not significantly different from zero. The
same pattern shows up when we also include examiner by questionnaire fixed effects (columns




                                                15
2 and 4). The male in-group bias estimate in this specification is four times larger than the
female estimate.13

         One major concern related to the interpretation of 𝛼3 is that it might capture differential
treatment by religious and secular examiners of some other student characteristic, rather than
her religious status. For example, examiners might somehow be able to infer a student’s ethnic
background from her handwriting or style, and religious examiners might be more generous
toward some ethnic group than secular examiners. If religious status is correlated with
ethnicity, 𝛼3 may pick up on this tendency rather than religion-based in-group bias. In Table 6
we present a robustness check for our suggested interpretation. The table includes nine
columns, each presenting a different regression. All regressions are based on the full
specification of equation (1), which includes year, questionnaire, and student fixed effects. In
addition to the interaction 𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑆𝑡𝑢𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡 ∗ 𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝐸𝑥𝑎𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑟, each regression also includes an
interaction of the dummy for religious examiner with one of eight student characteristics. The
eight characteristics (in order of the columns of the table) are indicators for male, mother’s
education, father’s education, number of siblings, and ethnicity indicators (according to
parents’ country of birth): Israel, Europe/America, Asia/Africa, former Soviet Union, and
Ethiopia). In column 9 we present results from a regression where we include all eight of these
interaction terms jointly in the regression. The coefficients on these interactions are reported
in the third row.

         Two results stand out. First, and most remarkably, the in-group bias estimate is stable
and virtually unaffected by the inclusion of the interaction of the religious examiner indicator
and each of the student characteristics. Across all eight columns the in-group bias estimate is
0.010 or 0.011 and it is significantly different from zero. When all characteristics-interaction
terms are jointly included (column 9), the estimate is 0.012 and significantly different from
zero. The second meaningful result in the table is that 6 of the 8 additional interaction terms
are not statistically significant. These results suggest that the in-group bias based on the




13
   Appendix Table A7 presents estimations of in-group biases based on raw test scores instead of standardized
scores. The specifications are the same as in Table 5: for all examiners (columns 1 and 2) and for male examiners
(columns 3 and 4) and for female examiners (columns 5 and 6). The magnitude and significance of the estimated
in-group bias align with the results in Tables 4 and 5.


                                                       16
religious status of the student and the examiner does not capture omitted interaction bias of an
examiner who is favorable toward any of the student characteristics.14

         A second concern regarding the interpretation of our findings is that religious and
secular examiners may grade a given exam booklet differently because they differentially like
a particular feature in it, for example, the student’s writing style, the student’s way of reasoning,
or perhaps because they agree with the views the student expresses in the exam. Naturally this
is more likely when the student and the examiner share the same religious orientation. In other
words, it could be that what we identify as in-group bias reflects a coincidence of taste and
style shared by the student and the examiner and not religion-based discrimination by
examiners. To address this concern we present in Table 7 evidence based on dividing the
sample to STEM and non-STEM subjects. The latter include social studies, literature, and other
humanities subjects where the examiner might be more prone to bias grades because of writing
style or expressed views.15 It can also be argued that in STEM subjects there is less scope for
biased grading because the correct answer is more definitive. Panel A of Table 7 presents the
estimates based on the STEM subsample and panel B presents the estimates based on all other
subjects. Estimates are based on the full specification of year, questionnaire, and student fixed
effects. In-group bias estimates from the two subsamples are clearly very similar, 0.012 in the
STEM sample and 0.010 in the non-STEM sample, though only the former is statistically
significant. The stratification of the sample by examiners’ gender reveals similar patterns by
gender: the estimated in-group biases of male STEM and non-STEM examiners are of
comparable magnitude, though only the first is significant, which might be due to the fact that
the number of male examiners in STEM subjects is almost twice that in non-STEM subjects.
The estimated in-group biases of female examiners in both subgroups are much lower, and only
the estimated in-group biases of female examiners in STEM subjects are significantly different
from zero.




14
   Appendix Table A8 presents results from additional sensitivity tests by including two measures of religiousness
at the school level: a dummy that indicates whether religious schools are gender-segregated religious schools or
not, and the percentage of questionnaires per school that religious and secular students take in separate schools.
These additional sensitivity test results indicate that the level of religious status of students who go to religious
schools does not affect the estimated in-group bias, which provides further evidence for the commonness of
writing BS”D by students from religious schools.
15
   Appendix Table A9 presents the estimated in-group biases by four core subjects of instruction: literature, social
studies, English, and math. Each column presents estimates from a separated regression that includes a dummy
for the relevant subject of instruction and its interactions with the variables of the main specification. The results
indicate that in-group biases among social studies examiners are significantly higher than in-group biases in other
subjects.

5.1 Implications of In-Group Bias for Final Matriculation Outcomes

In-group bias in grading behavior may have longer-term implications on students if its effect
adds up to meaningful effects on the final matriculation outcomes. In particular, the composite
matriculation score and probability of getting a matriculation diploma are important as the latter
is a prerequisite for admission to universities and the former is a major factor in admission to
selective and highly demanded fields of study such as medical school, computer engineering,
etc.16

         The composite matriculation score is an average (weighted by credit units) of all
subject-specific final scores. Recall that the final score in each subject is an average of the
external exam score and the internal score. The external score is the average of the grades given
by the two examiners, which we have been analyzing thus far. The internal score is based on a
school exam that is graded by the student’s own teacher and is filed prior to the external exam
taking place. Therefore, while the internal score represents an evaluation of the student in the
particular subject, it should not be affected by the religious status of the examiners who are
assigned to grade the external exam, and as such it can serve as a useful placebo outcome.

         Table 8 presents evidence of the impact of in-group bias on the average external score
and on the internal scores in each subject (the placebo outcome), as well as on the average final
grade. Both internal and external scores are normalized. The last three columns estimate the
effects on the probability of passing the exam. Since an external score is the average score of
the two examiners, we use as a treatment measure the proportion of religious examiners for
each exam booklet (which can be either zero, 0.5, or 1) times the indicator of religious student.
The number of observations in these regressions is the number of exam booklets (rather than
twice the number of exam booklets). All regressions include year, questionnaire, and student
fixed effects. The standard errors are clustered at the student level.

         Column 1 presents the estimated effect on the average external score. The in-group bias
estimate, reported in the second row, is positive (0.020) and significant. When the treatment


16
   Ebenstein, Lavy, and Roth (2016) report that random transitory disturbances that affect cognitive performance
during matriculation exams have permanent consequences. Exploiting variation across multiple exams taken by
the same student, the study finds that transitory exposure to air pollution is associated with a significant decline
in both student’s performance on the exams and postsecondary educational attainment and earnings. For example,
an additional point in the average matriculation score is worth between 45 and 66 shekels in monthly earnings.
Relative to the average wage in their sample, this implies that each additional point is worth roughly a full one
percent of monthly salary. These estimates imply that even modest declines in scores can have significant
consequences on adult income. This conclusion is relevant as well to the findings we present in this paper,
especially when noting the results below on the effects on students from a disadvantaged background.

                                                        18
indicator is equal to 0.5 (one of the two examiners is of the same religious orientation as the
student), the in-group bias effect is equal to 0.01, identical to the respective estimate that we
report in Table 4 (which corresponds to a treatment effect of one examiner having the same
religious orientation as the student). By contrast, the placebo treatment effect on the internal
grade (column 2) is an order of magnitude smaller, negative (-0.002), and not significantly
different from zero. This result therefore confirms the absence of in-group bias, as expected
for this outcome, and supports the validity of the natural experiment difference-in-differences
estimate of the in-group bias that we report in Table 4.

       Column 3 reports the impact of in-group bias on the final grade, which is an average of
the external and internal scores. This estimate is 0.010 (se=0.004), close to the average of the
estimates reported in columns 1 and 2.

       Columns 4–6 in Table 8 present in-group bias effects on the likelihood of passing the
exam. In column 4 the estimated effect of the treatment variable is 0.005, meaning that when
the examiners and the student share the same religious status, the probability of passing a
matriculation exam increases by half a percentage point and this effect is statistically significant
(the mean probability of passing an exam in the sample is 89%). Column 5 presents an estimate
based on a sample of students from low-education families. The estimate is 0.009, and the mean
probability of passing an exam in this group is 83%. In contrast, column 6 reports the estimate
for a sample of students from high-education families and it is practically zero. This is as
expected since students in this sample have a much lower likelihood of being at the margin of
failing or passing a matriculation exam. These estimates therefore imply that in-group bias can
have distributional consequences, increasing the education gap between high and low
socioeconomic status students, which later in life is likely to be reflected in higher income gaps.



5.2 In-Group Bias: Evidence from Test Score Bunching

The analysis so far has shown that, on average, an exam receives a higher grade when assigned
to an examiner of the same level of religiousness as the student, and that this in-group bias is
mainly driven by the male examiners. This section looks more closely at the grade distribution.
Figures 2 and 3 present the distributions of religious and secular students’ test scores for exam
booklets graded by secular and by religious examiners, respectively. For both, we observe
substantially larger mass at two points in the distribution: at 55, the passing score in a
matriculation exam, and at 100, the highest score possible in these exams. This bunching can

                                                19
be viewed as evidence that examiners systematically adjust grades to be just enough to pass
the exam or, for the best students, to get a perfect score. In this section we examine whether
there exists in-group bias in the likelihood of making such adjustments. In the next section we
will use these patterns to identify who is responsible for the bias: the religious or the secular
examiners.

        As in our baseline regressions, we continue to allow religious examiners to
systematically display more (or less) of this bunching behavior. We also allow religious
students to systematically receive more (or less) of these upward adjustments. This may be due
to a general bias for or against one of the groups, but in the case of the bunching at 100, it might
in principle also be due to one group having a higher proportion of students who write
outstanding exams that get censored at 100. However, as we will see below, religious students
have the same likelihood as secular students to score 100 rather than any score in the range 90-
99. Note that from the baseline regressions (columns 1–3 of Table 4), we cannot infer that
religious students receive unjustified lower grades, as they may be systematically weaker.
However, being more (or less) likely to receive an upward adjustment, especially at the passing
threshold, might indicate general discrimination against one group, beyond any preference for
one’s own group.

        Focusing first on the passing grade threshold, examiners may push up a grade within a
close range of the passing grade and not necessarily from 54 to 55. In Table 9 we estimate a
variant of equation (1) where the dependent variable is the probability of passing the exam
(getting a grade higher than or equal to 55). We estimate these regressions using four different
subsamples according to test scores: the estimates presented in column 1 are based on a sample
that includes all exam booklets with test scores between 50 and 60; in column 2 the range is
54–60; in column 3 it is 54–57; and in column 4 it is 54–56. The estimates in each column are
obtained from a separate regression that includes questionnaire fixed effects.17 Columns 1-4
include all examiners. We find little consistent evidence of general discrimination in favor (or
against) religious students (first row). The in-group bias estimates, however, are consistently
positive. They are statistically significant only in the second column, partly due to the loss of
precision arising from smaller sample sizes as we move to tighter ranges. These estimates imply




17
  We do not include student fixed effects in these regressions because of the small sample of students with more
than one test score in these ranges.

                                                      20
that the probability of passing the exam increases by close to one percentage point when the
examiner has the same religious status as the student.

       Remarkably, the in-group bias estimates and their precision are more definitive when
the sample is stratified by examiner’s gender. The estimates for male examiners are presented
in columns 5–8 and for female examiners in columns 9–12. The picture is very clear and
consistent with the patterns in Table 5: male examiners discriminate in favor of students from
their own group by increasing exam scores around the passing threshold while female
examiners appear quite neutral in this respect. In terms of size, in-group bias among male
examiners is particularly large when focusing on the two ranges closest to the passing
threshold: the likelihood of “bumping” a student from one’s religious group from 54 to 55/56
or from 54 to 55-57 is 4.3 and 3.2 percentage points, respectively. This effect is sizeable, about
5–6% of the mean passing rate in the whole sample. By contrast, the estimated in-group bias
of female examiners in these two ranges is zero.

       Table 10 presents in-group bias estimates at the margin of scoring 100. The table reports
estimates of a linear probability model where the dependent variable equals 1 for scoring 100,
based on samples restricted to exam booklets with test scores within the following ranges: 90–
100, 95–100, 98–100, and 99–100. Columns 1–4 pool all examiners. Note that there is no
evidence that religious students are overall more likely to receive a grade of 100 rather than
any grade in the 90-100 range (first row of first column). More importantly, all four estimates
of in-group bias are positive, but those derived from the first two ranges are small. The
estimates based on the two ranges nearest to 100 are larger but both are still only marginally
statistically different from zero. They imply that the probability of getting a score of 100 versus
98 or 99 is higher by 2.5 percentage points when the examiner has the same religious status as
the student.

       Columns 5–12 of Table 10 present estimates based on the separate samples of male and
female examiners. Again, sharp differences emerge between the two sets of estimates of in-
group bias. The male estimates are positive and significant in all four ranges but they are again
largest where bunching is from 98 or 99 to 100. These estimates suggest that among male
examiners the test scores at the top of the distribution are inflated sharply when the student and
the examiner have the same religious orientation. In this case the likelihood of getting 100
versus 99 is higher by almost 11 percentage points. Strikingly, in-group bias estimates among
the female examiners in all four ranges are zero.


                                                21
       Before continuing, it is important to note that the overall in-group bias is not limited to
these ranges. The in-group bias estimate (based on the preferred specification reported in
column 4 of Table 4) remains 0.10 (SE=0.06), even when we remove from the sample test
scores in the range 55–60 and 95–100.



5.3 Identifying Who Discriminates: Secular or Religious Examiners?

The difference-in-differences estimate that we obtain for our natural experiment is a relative
measure of in-group bias. We cannot tell whether the sources of this discriminating behavior
are secular or religious examiners. The difficulty of identifying the relative contribution of
religious and secular examiners to the in-group bias is due to the lack of an objective test score
for each exam. For example, it may be the case that secular students do in fact perform better
on exams and hence the extent to which secular examiners give them higher grades is no
indication of bias, and the bias is entirely due to the religious examiners. But, of course, the
reverse is also possible: exams written by religious students might not be as bad as the grades
indicate and the bias might be entirely due to the secular examiners. This limitation is common
in studies that attempt to identify in-group bias in naturally occurring (non-experimental) data.
For example, Shayo and Zussman (2011) find evidence of in-group bias among Arab and
Jewish judges in Israel, but in the absence of an objective measure of the strength of the cases,
they cannot definitively determine whether the bias is driven by Jewish judges, Arab judges,
or both. Similarly, Anwar Bayer and Hjalmarsson (2012) find that in Florida, the presence of
a member of one’s race in the jury pool for the trial entails a better outcome for the defendant,
but again absent information on the relative strength of the evidence brought against white and
black defendants, they cannot pin down whether the bias detected is due to black or white jurors
(or both).

       In the present paper, however, we propose a way to help address this limitation. Our
approach is based on the evidence of bunching of test scores near the 55 and 100 scores. In
particular, we examine whether the likelihood of increasing test scores above the failing grade
or to the 100 score is higher among, say, religious examiners when they grade exam booklets
of religious students versus secular students. Note that while secular and religious students may
well write different quality exams on average, it is less likely that they systematically vary in
the likelihood of writing an exam worth 99 versus 100 (or 54 versus 55). This allows us to test
for discrimination separately for secular and religious examiners in these ranges.


                                               22
       We use the same ranges of test scores around the passing threshold and the 100 score
that we defined in the previous section. In Table 11 we focus on the probability of passing the
exam. The dependent variable is an indicator for scoring 55 or higher and the main explanatory
variable is a dummy for religious student. We stratify the sample by secular examiners (top
panel) and religious examiners (bottom). In Table 12, we present similar estimates at the
margin of scoring 100.

       Consider first the male examiners. Looking at the passing threshold regressions in Table
11, Columns 5-8, we note that among secular examiners (panel A), the coefficient on religious
student is negative in all four columns, consistent with discrimination against religious
students. However, all the estimates are imprecisely measured and, for the most part, are not
statistically different from zero. At the same time, the estimated coefficients on religious
examiners (panel B) are all positive, implying a pro-religious student bias, but again only one
of the estimates is statistically different from zero. Note that the difference between the
estimated pro-religious bias of the religious and secular examiners equals the in-group bias that
we reported in Table 9. For example, the difference between the estimates for the 54–56 range
(0.027 - (-0.016)) is equal to 0.043, the estimate reported in Table 9, which is significantly
different from zero (p=0.101). The plausible conclusion here is that both the religious and the
secular examiners contribute to the in-group bias that pushes students from own group above
the failing grade.

       The evidence in Table 12 regarding in-group bias toward the best students is remarkably
different: the estimates in columns 5-8 are positive, high, and significant for male religious
examiners, while negative, much smaller, and less significant for male secular examiners. The
bias toward religious students among male religious examiners is positive and large in all four
ranges, but it is highest in the 99–100 range. The probability of a score of 100 is higher by
almost 10 percentage points when it is a religious student. The respective in-group bias of a
male secular examiner is much lower, 0.017 (se=0.021). Clearly, the religious examiners drive
most of the in-group bias at this bunching of test scores.

       Next consider the female examiners. The evidence presented in columns 9–12 of Tables
11 and 12 show little evidence of religion-based in-group bias. This is true both in the passing
threshold and in the upper end of the test score distribution. These results complement the
evidence presented in Table 5, based on which we concluded that on average female examiners
do not discriminate their grading on the basis of the religious status of students. Not only is


                                               23
there no evidence of overall bias among women, but the results in both tables suggest that this
is true for both religious and secular women. Thus, the lack of overall bias among women in
Tables 5 and 7 is unlikely to be masking differences between religious and secular women
(e.g., due to in-group bias in one group and out-group bias in the other).

         We note that our result regarding the impartiality of women with respect to religious
orientation is similar to the finding reported in Gneezy and Fershtman (2001): based on an
experimental trust game in which students in Israel participated, women’s trust in their game
partners was not based on ethnic affiliation or on gender while men clearly discriminated in
favor of men and women of Western ethnic origin (Ashkenazi) and against men and women of
Eastern ethnic origin (Sephardi). Similar evidence is documented in Angerer et al. (2017) who
find that girls tend to discriminate less than boys when having to allocate a fixed endowment
between two other children where only one speaks the same language as the child making the
allocation (see also Croson and Gneezy 2009 for a review of the literature on gender differences
in social preferences).

         A remaining question about the nature of the discrimination of male religious examiners
is whether they increase the grades of students from their own group (“in-group love”) or
whether they lower the grades of students from the other group (“out-group hate”). The surplus
mass at test scores 55 and 100 and the “hole” in the test score distribution at 54 and 99 suggest
that male religious examiners inflate test scores of religious students and do not lower test
scores of secular students.18

5.4 Examiners’ Characteristics and In-Group Bias

In this section we briefly discuss results (shown in the appendix) on the sensitivity of the in-
group bias estimates to examiners’ characteristics. The evidence presented in Appendix Table
A10 relates to the following characteristics: STEM subjects’ examiners, examiner’s age, and
examiner’s education (M.A. or Ph.D.). The effect of STEM subjects is very small, negative,
and not significantly different from zero. This is consistent with the evidence presented in Table
7 where we estimate a similar in-group bias in STEM and non-STEM subjects. Older examiners
have zero in-group bias, which suggests that the estimate presented in Table 4 reflects the
behavior of younger examiners. The estimate regarding the examiner’s education is perhaps

18
  Feld, Salamanca, and Hamermesh (2016) use a field experiment that assigns examiners randomly to students’
examinations that did/did not contain the students’ names, and find that the examiners’ favoritism toward their
own group, rather than discrimination against the other group, explains their estimates of relative in-group bias
by nationality and by gender.

                                                       24
surprising, as it indicates that the average in-group bias estimate presented in Table 4 is mainly
a result of the behavior of examiners with a high academic education (M.A. or Ph.D.).

         Perhaps more interesting are the results on differences across religious orientation
within the religious group. Some of the examiners in our sample are “Ultra-Orthodox” Jews
(Haredim). Their children attend special schools that belong to an independent education
system.19 We are therefore able to distinguish Ultra-Orthodox Jewish examiners from other
religious examiners by the type of school their children attend. We can thus examine whether
the in-group bias of the former group is different from that of the latter group. This is an
interesting distinction because there exists a major rift between the Ultra-Orthodox and the
“Religious-Zionist” Jews in Israel, which may lead Ultra-Orthodox examiners not to favor (or
even to disfavor) students from the latter group. The Religious-Zionist population is different
from the Ultra-Orthodox. On the one hand, Religious-Zionists share common values with the
Ultra-Orthodox such as dedication to the family and observance of religious holidays, dietary
laws, and prayers. But, on the other hand, they have a strong commitment to the general society,
secular education, and work. These values bring them closer to the secular population than to
the Ultra-Orthodox.20 The results presented in Appendix Table A11, column1, show that in-
group bias of Ultra-Orthodox examiners is small and not significantly different from zero. This
implies that Ultra-Orthodox examiners are neutral between religious and secular students, and
it is consistent with the often expressed opinion that Ultra-Orthodox Jews do not view the
Religious-Zionist Jews as “truly” religious.



5.5 Does In-Group Bias Decline When Exposure to the Out-Group Increases?

The hypothesis that intergroup contact might reduce intergroup prejudice dates back to at least
the 1940s, and has been studied intensively ever since (see Pettigrew and Tropp 2006 for a
review and a meta-analysis of 515 studies). The thrust of this literature suggests that, at least


19
   These schools are semi-private and receive partial funding from the government. While under the authority of
the Ministry of Education, they have a deputy Minister of Education who is from an Ultra-Orthodox political
party whenever such a party participates in a government coalition. While none of the students in this system are
part of our analysis, some of our teachers are Ultra-Orthodox.
20
   The Religious-Zionists are also generally averse to the poverty that characterizes the Ultra-Orthodox and
oppose their extremism. They also oppose the control that the Ultra-Orthodox groups have exercised over state
religious institutions for over three decades. These tensions are very much alive, and have perhaps even
intensified since the Israeli evacuation of settlements in the Gaza Strip in 2005, which had been predominantly
populated by religious Zionists, as the ultra-Orthodox political parties were part of the coalition government at
the time.


                                                       25
under favorable conditions, such effects do in fact exist and that they extend beyond racial and
ethnic groups.21 In this section, we examine whether religious-orientation-based bias decreases
with examiners’ exposure to people of different levels of religiousness at home (the
neighborhood where they live) and at work (the school where they teach). The analysis in this
section should be taken as suggestive, since we do not have a random assignment of peers.

         In addition to studying separately in different schools, Israeli secular and religious Jews
often live in separate neighborhoods within large cities or in separate localities such as
kibbutzim, moshavim (farming communities), or in small towns. All teachers in religious
schools are religious and only a small proportion of teachers in secular schools are religious.

         We examine first the hypothesis that in-group bias varies with the extent of exposure
to the other group by allowing the in-group bias estimates to be different for examiners who
teach in totally segregated religious localities. Ninety percent of the Jewish settlements in the
West Bank are such communities and three percent of the examiners teach in one of them. In
the second column of Appendix Table A11 we augment the baseline estimation of in-group
bias with interactions with an indicator for religious examiners who teach in a religious
settlement in the West Bank. The main effect of the in-group bias estimate is 0.005 (se=0.006).
The interaction term of the main effect term (Religious Student x Religious Examiner) with this
indicator is 0.038 (se=0.016). Both estimates are positive but the interaction term is large and
significantly different from zero. The net in-group bias of examiners from religious
communities in the West Bank is 0.038 (se=0.016), about four time larger than the mean effect
of 0.010. We also note that leaving both types of religious groups discussed in the table out of
the sample (i.e., Ultra-Orthodox examiners and examiners who teach in segregated religious
localities in the West Bank) yields an estimated in-group bias of 0.011 (se=0.0068), which is
very similar to the baseline in-group bias of the entire examiner population. We should be
cautious in interpreting this estimate as a net effect of “contact” because people who teach in
settlements tend to have more right-wing views about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and
therefore this estimate of in-group bias may not be generalizable to all religious examiners.
Below we present estimates of exposure in regular cities and towns in Israel.




21
   Alport (1954) argued that contact between groups under “optimal conditions” would reduce intergroup
prejudice. These conditions include four features: equal status between the groups in the situation, common goals,
intergroup cooperation, and the support of authorities, law, or custom. Pettigrew and Tropp’s (2006) meta-analysis
finds support for the added benefit of these conditions.

                                                       26
         Table 13 presents results using four different definitions of exposure, measured in two
environments: the neighborhood in which one lives and the school in which one works.
Exposure is measured as a dummy variable indicating an above-median proportion of
neighbors or peers in the environment with a different religious status (see Appendix Table A6
for descriptive statistics). In Appendix Table A12 we report results when exposure is measured
as the proportion of neighbors or peers with a different religious orientation. We start, in panel
A, with neighbors within the examiner’s home zip code. The next three panels examine
exposure to peers (other teachers) at school. Panel B looks at the overall proportion of peers
with a different religious orientation at school, whereas panels C and D look at peers at school
with the same gender or who teach the same subject.

         The regressions include year and student fixed effects as well as, importantly, examiner
by environment (zip code or school) by questionnaire fixed effects. Thus for example, in panel
A the interaction picks up the variation in in-group bias for a given examiner living in the same
neighborhood, whose neighborhood’s religious composition changed over time.

         The estimates presented in the first column of Table 13 are based on the full sample
and show no clear pattern for the association between exposure and bias. However, the
estimates for male examiners (column 2) suggest that in-group bias declines sharply when
examiners encounter high numbers of the other group in their neighborhood. To some extent
this is also the case for peers at school, especially when the peer group includes teachers who
teach the same subject or are of the same gender. In panel A the main effect of in-group bias is
0.064 (se=0.021) and the interaction estimate when the proportion of “others” in the
neighborhood is above the median is -0.074 (se=0.030). In other words, in-group bias is
positive and large when the examiner is not highly exposed to neighbors with a different
religious orientation the, but drops to zero when the examiner is highly exposed to the other
group in the neighborhood.22

         Male in-group bias is also associated with changes in exposure to “others” at work,
especially to teachers who teach the same subject or are of the same gender. In the second
column of panel C, for example, the main in-group bias estimate is 0.050 (se=0.020) and the
interaction term with high exposure to same-subject teachers is -0.050 (se=0.032); thus, they
offset each other. Similarly, in panel D, the main in-group bias estimate is 0.052 (se=0.022)


22
  The estimates in panel A suggest that at a very high level of exposure, the in-group bias estimate even
reverses sign, meaning that an examiner might even show some out-group bias.

                                                       27
and the interaction term with high exposure to same-subject teachers is -0.050 (se=0.030); thus,
they too offset each other.

       For female examiners, the estimates in column 3 show an interesting pattern. The main
in-group bias in all four panels is small and not significantly different from zero. However, in-
group bias appears to emerge among female examiners when they are in the minority in terms
of religious orientation at school, and in particular among female teachers at school. In both
cases the in-group bias is positive and significant, around 0.021 with a t-statistic of about 2.
This is inconsistent with a simple version of the contact hypothesis that ignores the importance
of the conditions under which contact takes place.



6. Conclusions

Religious doctrine often favors believers over non-believers. While secularization—and its
opposite, resacralization—have drawn enormous attention, the economic effects of religion-
based discrimination have gone largely unnoticed. Using data from Israel’s high-stakes
matriculation exams we are able to identify the religious status of both students and examiners,
and thus study discrimination across religious and secular groups within the same religion.

       We have three main findings. First, we document the existence of significant in-group
bias in grading decisions. This bias is detectable among professional graders who are making
highly consequential decisions. Second, we find that the bias is almost entirely driven by male
examiners: female examiners show little if any bias. One possibility is that females are in
general less prone to group-based behavior, across different cultural, situational, and contextual
domains (Sidanius et al. 2000). Another possibility, however, is that this result is more specific
to religious discrimination. Religion and its precepts are possibly more salient for (religious)
Jewish men—who are required to pray three times each day, and to engage in a lifelong study
of religious teachings—than for women. This brings us to our third result. Using bunching in
the grading distribution we find evidence that bias, at least at the top of the distribution, is
largely driven by religious examiners. Male religious examiners are six to ten percentage points
more likely to bump a grade to 100 when the exam is written by a religious student, while male
secular examiners are between one and three percentage points less likely to do so when
grading a religious student.

       Such biases can have significant long-term implications for the allocation of talent and
human capital formation. However, we do find suggestive evidence that contact across

                                               28
religious and secular groups may attenuate these biases. Even though our study looks within a
given religion and emphasizes the implications of a rift between secular and religious groups,
it sheds light on the potential consequences of conflict across different religious groups. Such
heterogeneity surfaced recently in many European countries where immigration flows brought
groups with a different religion (and probably also different degree of religiousness) than the
native population.

Notes: The first two columns of the table present the difference in grades given to religious and secular students, separately by religious (column 1) and secular examiners
(column 2). The estimates of the religious student indicator are from a specification that includes questionnaire and year fixed effects. The other columns present the
difference-in-differences in-group bias estimates, from different specifications: in column 3 the specification includes only questionnaire and year fixed effects; in column 4
the specification includes also student fixed effects; and the last specification includes only exam booklet fixed effects. The number of observations is twice the number of
exam booklets, since each exam booklet appears twice (once for each examiner). Dependent variables are standardized scores. Standard errors are corrected for clustering at
the examiner level and are presented in parentheses.

Notes: The table presents the estimated effect of in-group bias of examiners on additional outcomes: 1) the average external exam grade (the average of the two examiners’
normalized scores); 2) the normalized internal exams, which are exams examined by students’ school teachers; 3) the final exam score (the average of the external and
internal exams’ normalized scores); 4) probability of passing the exam (if final grade >=55); 5) probability of passing the exam from a subsample of students with low
parental education (low parental education is equal to one if both parents have 12 or less years of schooling); 6) and the probability of passing the exam from a subsample
of students with high parental education. The proportion of religious examiners is measured in each exam booklet. The number of observations is the number of exam takers,
since each exam appears only once. All columns present the results from separated regressions based on the preferred specification (which includes year, questionnaire, and
student fixed effects). Standard errors are corrected for clustering at the student level and are presented in parentheses.

Notes: The coefficients in each column and panel are from separated regressions that include a dummy for different types of exposure and its interactions with the variables
of the main specification. Each regression additionally includes year and student fixed effects and examiner by questionnaire and zip code/school fixed effects. The
proportion of neighbours with a different religious orientation is based on the proportion of religious students in the examiner’s zip code in each year. The proportion of
peers at school with a different religious orientation is based on the proportion of peer teachers at school in each year. The dummy variable for high exposure equals one if
the proportion of the examiner’s neighbours or peers is higher than the median of each group (by religious status and gender). Standard errors are corrected for clustering
at the examiner level and are presented in parentheses.
