                       Dividend Yields and Stock Returns:
                             A Test For Tax Effects



                                    ABSTRACT



     This paper examines the empirical relation between stock returns and

dividend yields. Several equilibrium pricing models incorporating differ

ential taxation of dividends and capital gains are nested as systems of

time series regressions. Estimates of these models and tests of parameter

restrictions implied by the models are conducted within the context of

Zellner's seemingly unrelated regression. It is concluded that the data

fail to support these models as well as the hypothesis that dividends are

neutral. The inability to distinguish between these competing hypotheses

suggests the need for further research before definitive conclusions are

reached regarding the tax impacts of dividends.

                                   Introduction
      Th ffect of dividends on stock returns is a major issue in finance, with a
 rich historical bacr'und. It has been argued (see Graham and Dodd [19511)
 that low yield stocks require iigher returns because investors value dividends
 more than retained earnings. Miller and Modigliani [19611 demonstrated that in
a world of no transaction costs, equal tax treatment of dividends and capital
gains, and investor rationality, the dividend policies of firms have no impact on
the welfare of security holders (given investment policies). Miller and Modigliani
pointed out, however, that the heavier taxation of dividends than capital gains
might lead to higher before-tax returns on shares with high dividend yields. But
they wained that such a relation would be weakened and possibly completely
offset by clientele effects. One important class of investors, pension funds, pay
no taxes and, therefore, have no reason to require higher returns on dividend
paying stocks. Other investors, notably corporations and casualty insurance
companies, face lower statutory tax rates on dividends than capital gains. On
the othe1 hand, some investors consuming wealth may find the tax penalties of
dividend paying stocks offset by lower transaction costs if part of their returns
are received as dividends. Recently, even the proposition that dividends are
taxed at higher rates than capital gains has been challenged. Miller and Scholes
[1978] have pointed to features of the tax code and currently available financial
instruments that investors could use to blunt any tax disadvantages of dividends.
     Attempts to establish which of these hypothesized relations between
dividends 'and stock returns holds empirically have not resulted in a consensus.

 Early tests of the general effects of dividends, such as Friend and Puckett
 [1964], relied on cross sectional regressions of common stock prices on
dividends per share, and various alternative measures of earnings or retained
earnings per share. Friend and Puekett found little evidence of yield effects, but
their tests are subject to serious limitations. Black and Scholes (19741 also
tested for the general impact of dividends on common stock returns, using time
series methods that avoided many of the estimation difficulties of the earlier
cross sectional regressions of stock prices on dividends and retained earnings.
On the basis of their test, Black and Scholes [1974] found themselves unable to
reject the hypothesis that dividend yields have no significant effect on stock
returns.
      Several authors have tested for the tax effects of dividends by comparing
returns on eum and ex days. Elton and Gruber [1970], in a well known study,
claim documentation of both a tax effect and a dependency between tax rates of
marginal investors and dividend yields (a clientele effect reflected in asset
prices). With a longer sample period and more appropriate statistical procedure,
Black and Scholes [1973] are unable to confirm either of these conclusions.
However, Black and Scholes do find evidence of unusual behavior in security
returns for several days surrounding ex dividend days.
      Recent work, notably by Litzenberger and Ramaswamy [1979] and Blume
[19781, has sought to improve the efficiency of the Black—Scholes [1974] tests.
Both papers claims to have found evidence supporting the importance of
dividends. Litzenberger and Ramaswamy, at least, argue that the importance of
dividends is best explained by differential taxation of dividends.
     In this paper I present a different estimation method that avoids some of
the shortcomings of the Litzenberger-Ramaswamy and Blume tests. I conclude

Black arid Scholes [1974]
       Black and Scholes [1974] compare two motels of the relation between
civiciends yields and expected returns:

                          +   .[E(R) -         +
                                                     (o        )/o               (1)

where E(R;) is the expected return of security i,          is the covariance of security
is return with the return of the market portfolio divided by the variance of the
return of the market portfolio,           is the dividend yield of security i,   m
                                                                                       the
dividend ieId of the rnarke portfolio, E(Rm) is the expected return of the
market portfolio, and y,y are parameters of the pricing equation.

         Black and Scholes estimate            1' as the average return of the minimum
 variance portfolio satisfying the restrictions,

 where N is the number of assets and w is the proportion of asset i in the
 portfolio. To reduce the impact of errors in variables, Black and Scholes solve
 (4) with twentyfive portfolios constructed from all New York Exchange stocks
 that were listed for at least five years. These portfolios are constructed to
 maintain dispersion in both beta and dividend yield. The ij elements of the
                                                                                   " "2

estimated variance of the equally weighted index of all New York Stock
Exchange common stocks and a is the estimated residual variance of portfolio i
in the regression of portfolio i's return on the returns of the equally weighted
index.

        Black and Scholes estimate -y1 as the average monthly return of the
portfolio. For their overall sample period, January, 1939 to December, 1966, the
average return is .09 percent.                During three ten year subperiods, the                1

estimates range from .02 percent to .16 percent. None of the estimates are
statistically significant.
Litzenberger and Ramaswamy [19791
        Litzenberger and Ramaswamy begin by deriving an after—tax capital asset
pricing model of the form,

                         E(R) - rf = a + b           .     + c(d1            rf)                 (4)

 market ortfoio, and drn                is   the dividend yield of   the   market portfolio. The
 model (5)   is   a more general form of Brennans [1970] after tax pricing equation,


                               E(R.)-rf = b . + i(d1 - rf)                                    (5)

and    -r represents a tax differential between dividends and capital gains.               While

(4)   arid (5 differ from the Black and Scholes model, a portfolio satisfying the

constraints of Black and Scholes would have an expected return equal to
                                                                                         Cdff1 or

        In estimating equation (4), Litzenberger and Ramaswamy consider the
  stochastic version of their model,


                                           Rt     = E(Rt)       +



                       it - rf = a +              b   it + c(dt - rft) + U.                       (6)


 for securities 1      1,2 ...N and periods t               1, 2 ...T.4 If all thets, dt's, and ri's
 in (6) could be estimated without error, the model could be estimated by pooling
 cross sectional regressions over time. Litzenberger and Ramaswamy use three
 different, although closely related techniques to estimate (6).
       The first technique is a regression of individual securities' risk premiums
 (returns less than one month T-Bill rate) on a constant, the securities' betas
estimates in the previous sixty months, and a measure of anticipated dividend
yield of the securities for the month less the one month T-Bill rate. The
securities' betas are estimated with the following regression,

                            ii - rrt
                           R.          =    a.
                                             it       +   .iT(Rmi - r ft )   + e.it            (7)

for securities i =   1,2   ...N and T =    t—60   ...     t-l, where RmTis the return in month r
of a value weighted index of all New York Stock Exchange common stocks. The
measure of anticipated dividends for any month equals the taxable dividends paid
in the month if the dividends were announced prior to the beginning of the
month. If the taxable dividends were unannounced and nonrecurring, anticipated
dividends were assigned a value of zero and if dividends were unannounced but
recurring, anticipated dividends were set equal to the last recurring payment.5

      The third estimation techni uc seo     b   Litzenherg€i nad Ramaswamy is
motivated by the errors in variables probien siooiaed with individual secur—
ities beta estimates. The estimation technique icndes an explicit adjustment
foi errors in the beta estimates. Lit.senberger and Ramasamv argue that their
method     dealing with errors in cariables is superior to the portfolio rouping
procedure of Black—Scholes because it does not destroy cross sectional dis
persion. Moreover, the authors claim that the estimator is consistent and is a
maximum likelihood estimator if the joint distribution of security returns is
orrnal. These are remarkable claims since the errors in variables problem has
severely limited the ability to rnai<e reliable inferences in financial economics as
weil as onomics in generaL Litzenberger and Ramaswamys adjusted estimator
is analyied in Appendix A and it is shown there that this estimator is neither
consistent nor is it maximum likelihood.
     Litzenberger and Ramaswamy derive estimates from each of these tech-
niques b averaging estimates over time. The standard errors of the estimates
itre estimated from the time series of monthly estimates. The resulting
estimates ot c are all quite close. turing the sample period January, 1936 to
Deeember 1977, they are .227, .234 and .236 for the OLS GLS, and adjusted

 estimator. The t-values of these estimates relative to zero are 6.33, 8.24, arid
 8.62 for the OLS, GLS, and adjusted estimator.6 The adjusted estimator is
 computed for six subperiods. Litzenberger and Ramaswamy note that during the
 overall sample period of Black and Scholes, January, 1936 to December, 1966,
 the dividend yield of the market was .048 per year. Interpreting the Black—
 Scholes          as equivalent to cdm they infer an estimate of c equal to .225 from
 the Black and Scholes estimate of y1 (.0009 x 12/.048). On the basis of this
 calculation, they claim to have documented roughly the same effect as Black and
 Scholes, but in a more precise way.7
 B1urie [1978]

      Blume [1978] proposes the following model,

                                              at + b 8it + Ctd1t +                            (8)

for i =   1,   2 ...   N   and t =   1,   2 ...T. The coefficients of (8) are each assumed to be
normally, independent1y and identically distributed with means a, b, and c and
variances a , a            ,   and   a,     respectively.     Equation (8) closely resembles the
stochastic version of Litzenberger and Ramaswamy's model, equation (6). The
major differences are supression of the risk-free rate and the interpretation of
random coefficients period by period.
      Blume estimates (8) by regressing quarterly returns of twenty-five port-
folios on a constant, the estimated portfolio betas, and a measure of the
portfolios' quarterly dividends yield. Portfolios are used to reduce the errors in
variables associated with estimated betas.                      Like Black and Scholes, Blume
attempts to maintain dispersion in both the portfolio betas and dividend yields.
     The portfolio betas are estimated with sixty months of data prior to the
quarterly estimates. Although monthly data are available, Blume uses quarterly
  'eturns o avoid smudging of tax effects across e and                       noc months.      Blum

overlooked important testable properties of models which assume differential
taxation of dividends.

Litzenbe'er and Ramaswamy
        Recall that Litzenberger and Ramaswamy's model takes the form,

                            E(R.t)        rf     a+b        + c(d1t - rf)
where   r+ is the riskiess        rate of   interest in period   t and   d1t is the dividend yield

  of   security i in period t. The stochastic version of their model is,

 The  authors assume that the parameters a, b, and c are constant and they use
 five years of data to estimate betas, Implicitly, then, they assume that betas
 are constant for five year periods. Combining the assumptions of constant
 parameters and betas with the stochastic version of their model results in the
 equations,

where (9) holds for all securities and periods consistent with the assumption of

constant betas. The intercept of (9) is free across securities, but constant over
sixty month periods for each security.
        The model (9) makes very precise predictions about securities' returns.
First, the model predicts that securities' risk premiums are constant over time,
except for changes in the riskiess rate and the securities' dividend yields. If the
dividend yield of a security, less the riskiess rate, is constant over time, the risk

Equation   (10) holds across securities and over time periods consistent with
constant betas. Like (9), equation (10) involves restrictions on parameters for
each security, as well as restrictions on parameters across securities. The
restrictions implied by (10) are more difficult to incorporate than the restric-
tions of (9), because equation (10) includes restrictions on products of para-
meters. More important, estimation of (10) requires identification of the market
portfolio and this imposes an untestable restriction on the data. Nor can much
comfort be taken on the latter count from evidence that suggest particular
implications of asset pricing seem to be insensitive to alternative specifications
of the market portfolio.9 The concern of this study is with a particular problem
and generalization of results obtained with other problems is inappropriate.
Since determining the effects of alternative market portfolios is beyond the
scope of this paper, equation (10) is used only as a check on the sensitivity of
some of our tests.

         As was the case for Litzenberger and Ramaswamy, a market return can be

  explicitly incorporated into Brennan's model. The b parameter of his model is,

Notice, however, that the disturbance of (9h),                                   is a composite disturbance,
and one of the terms included in the disturbances depends upon dividend yield,

d:t       beeause dividend yields vary over times, Ue variance of the disturbances
and the covariances across securities are not constant. But because. most
quarterly dividend yields are small in absolute value (typically ranging from .0
.02), the departure from standard assumption are of little importance and will be
ignored Lor purposes of estimation. (A more detailed analysis is presented in
Appendix B.)
      The coefficients , 6, and                       can be readily expressed in terms of the
market portfolio. If (8) holds for all assets, it holds for the market portfolio.

       Both formulations of Blume's model, (9b) and (lob), closely resemble the
 empirical formulations proposed for Litzenberger and Ramaswamy, (9) and (10),
 and Brennan, (9a) and (lOa). In particular, the models share the implication that
 the dividend yield coefficient is common across securities.

                               Synthesis of Formulations

      Two fundamental equations have been proposed for testing the models of
 Litzenberger and Ramaswamy, Brennan, and Blume. The equations are,

                               Alternative Formulations

     Equations (11) and (12) are systems of time series regressions with a
regression equation for each security. To estimate the systems properly and to
test the model's implications, the cross sectional dependence in security returns
must be taken into account. Zeilner [1971] has called systems like (ii) and (12)
"seemingly unrelated regressions" (SUR). The regressions have different in-
dependent variables, but are related by the contemporaneous correlation of the
disturbances. The disturbances are presumed to be contemporaneously cor-
related across equations, but the non-contemporaneous covariances and auto-

 where k is the number of equations (securities), T is the number of observations,
 and 1T is the TxT identity matrix. The Gauss—Markov estimator of the system is,

                               =   [t (E' ® 1)            X

       The   estimator of this system exploits the cross sectional information that
 is ignored by single equation estimators. For example, if the independent
 variables are orthogonal across equations and if the disturbance are multivariate
 normal the SUR estimator say for equation (1) equals,11

Alternatively, if b is the multiple regression coefficient for U. when            is the
dependent variable and the remaining k—i disturbances are the independent
variable, the estimator may be expressed as,

              6* =   6   +
                             (' x1) x(u - bu         -

The   estimator adjusts the disturbances for any linear dependence with the
remaining disturbances in the system.
      Although the orthogonality condition does not hold for our problem, the
spirit of the adjustment is similar.      Thus, if the market portfolio can be
approximated with the securities included in the system, the loss in efficiency
from not including the market portfolio in equation (11) is reduced. More
generally, if security returns are linear in other unobservable factors, the
seemingly unrelated estimator partially adjust for the excluded variables.
      If the disturbances of the system are normally, independently, and iden-
tically distributed over time, the SUR estimator is the maximum likelihood
estimator. The feasible estimator involves an estimated covariance matrix

 rather .han the true one, In general, the estimator has the same asymptotic
 distribuun as the maximum likelihood estimator.12

       Equation (ha) and (hib) are estimated for a broad cross section of firms.
 These firms are classified into systems of securities (equations) on the basis of
 average dividend yields. These classifications are meant to control for any
 dependency of effective tax brackets on dividends of the kind reported by Elton
and Gruber [1970], and by Litzenberger and Ramaswamy [1980]. If tax
induced clienteles effect asset prices, the tax parameters of (ha) and (lib)
would not be constant across securities, hence, our tests would be more likely to
reject a common effect across securities the larger the dispersion in dividend
yields.

                    Periods of Analysis and Samples of Firms

      The empirical tests are conducted over nine sample periods between
January, 1926 and December, 1978. The sample periods include substantially
different statutory treatment of dividends and capital gains. During the first
sample period--January, 1926 to December, 1931--the statuory limit on dividend
income was 20 percent and the statutory limit on long term capital gains (two
year holding period) was 12.5 percent. Between 1935 and 1940, the statutory
limit on dividends increased from 54 to 75 percent, while the statutory limit on
long term capital gains (one to ten year holding periods) ranged from 30 to 60
percent. By 1945, the statutory limit on dividend income had risen to 90
percent, and 50 percent of the gain on assets held for more than six months were
excluded from taxable income subject to a maximum tax of 25 percent. Between
1945 and 1978, the statutory limit on dividend income decreased to 70 percent,
while the limits on long term capital gains have ranged between 25 and 30
percent.
                                        —23—



      For each of the nine sample periods, systems of thirty securities are
  formed on the basis of average dividend yields over the sample periods. None of
the firms included in the systems have nontaxable cash distributions during the
period.
      The securities are all sampled from the Center for Research in Security
Prices (CRSP) ionthly return file and include only those firms with complete
data during the period. Each system includes thirty securities.

                         Data and Defuitioris of Variables

      Monthly returns from the CRSP return file are used in estimating the
models. After 1931 the riskless rate of interest is approximated with the one
month Treasury Bill rate. Prior to 1931, the shortest Government Bcnds with a
maturity of at least one month are used to proxy for the riskiess rate. The
source of this data is Ibbotson and Sinquefield [1977].
      The dividend yield variable is actual cash dividends paid in the ex dividend
month divided by the closing price in the previous month. Note that this differs
from the definitions of Litzenberger and Ramaswamy and Blume (cf. pages 6 and
8). It is unclear on prior grounds which of the definitions is more meaningfuL
Blume's quarterly measures of dividend yields and returns are not used since our
primary interest is detection of tax effects. With this objective, it is unwise to
destroy time series variation in dividend yields, i.e., the variation due to dividend
yields being zero in months when no dividends are paid.

                       Estimates and Tests with Equations
                                  (ha) and (hib)

     The empirical results for equations (ha) and (lib) are reported in Tables 2
                                         -24--


 through 10. The first column of each table shows the range of average dividend
 yield for each system. The second column lists the restricted estimates and
 their asymptotic standard errors in parentheses. The third column shows an "F-
 statistic" for the hypothesis that y ii is equal across securities, and the final
column lists the approximate probability levels conditional on 11i being equal for
all securities in the system. The "F—statistic" reported in these tables are
distributed as F, with degrees of freedom equal to the number of restrictions and
thirty times the degrees of freedom per equation if the covariance matrix is
known.14 For an unknown covariance matrix, the asymptotic distribution is chi-
squared with the same degress of freedom; however, the F approximation is more
conservative with respect to the equality hypothesis.15'      17

      The constants in equations (ha) and (hib) implicitly include a beta (times a
market risk premium). Since other authors have assumed stationary beta for
sixty month periods, a dummy variable is included in the estimated equations to
allow for shifts in beta. The dummy variable is assigned a value of zero for the
first half of the sample periods and one otherwise. 18
      The results of Table 2 thorugh 10 tell a very convincing story. The
restriction that the tax parameter 11i is equal across securities is badly violated
for virtually all the sample periods and yield groups. Since the restriction fails
to hold, it is not clear what, if any, interpretations can safely be drawn from the
restricted estimates. For what it may be worth, the behavior of the restricted
estimates across the dividend yield classification does appear roughly consistent
with the existence of clientele effects. The restricted estimates do appear to be
negatively related to dividend yield, though the relation is not strong or uniform.

allows the risidess rate of interest i.o be f?ee. Referring to Table 1, on pages 20
and 21, ;ve see that (11) implies that          =        and       =       for all three

models, that 11i +         for Litzenberger and Ramaswamy and Brennan, and
that ye,.  0 for Blume. With equation (11) we thus can separate the hypothesis


that       is equal across securities from the other hypotheses.
       Equation (11) is estimated with a sample selected from the securities
included in the Dow Jones Industrials during the January, 1926 to December,
1978 period. The sample always consists of thirty securities but the composition
of the sample changes over time. For purposes of comparison, the same thirty
securities used for estimating (11) are also used to estimate (lie) for each of the
                                        —35—




 nine periods. These results are reported in Table 11. Table 12 reports test
 statistics, restricted estimates, and unrestricted estimates for three of the
 periods, along with their standard errors.
       From the results of Tables 11 and 12, it appears that our earlier
 conclusions are insensitive to the specification of the riskless rate. Generally,
 the restricted estimates of equations (11) and (ha) are quite close and our
 inferences regarding the equality of 11i across equations are unaffected. As for
 the riskiess rate, the hypothesis of a common coefficient appears to be a
 reasonable approximation for periods after 1960. Prior to 1960, we are generally
 able to reject this hypothesis. The unrestricted estimates of Table 13 show a
 wide variation in all sample periods but are predominately negative, consistent
 with the Fama-Schwert findings. Given the observed variation, it is surprising
that the hypothesis of a common effect of the riskiess rate is not rejected in all
periods. But the smaller variation in the riskiess rate makes precision of these
estimates much lower than that of estimates for the dividend yield coefficient.
      An additional check on the sensitivity of the test to model specification
can be obtained from equation (12) which differs from (11) by inclusion of the
market return and dividend yield as separate variables (cf. Table 1). These
estimates are reported in Table 13 for the same time periods and for the sample
of Dow Jones Industrials. Including the market return and yield as separate
variables seems to have little impact on the results. The probability levels,
restricted estimates, and unrestricted estimates are very similar to those of
equation (11).

                   Definition of Anticipated Dividend Yields

     The results presented in Tables 2-13 provide little support for the simple
                                       —36--



 nx effec. models of dividends. We can reject y model predicting a common
c-.e cie on dividend yield, including the case of neutrality of dividends. it
2ossible that our results are due to the perfect foresight definition of dividend
yields,   !iany dividend payments nre announced during the cx month, and
therefor announcement and tax effects may be convoluted in our estimates nf
the dividand i1,d coefficients. There is, of course no reason to suppose that
such announcement eieets would be the same across securities or across time
for the arne securities and because f this our tests may unfairly reject the
hypothesis of a common dividend yield ffec.. To control f or this possibility, we
consider a definition of anticipated dividend ioici tfat relies only upon
information announced prior to the ex month, namely the dnnition oC Litzen—
berger ane Ramaswamy. This choice allows us to make direct cornpaions
their results and may also be regarded as a naive definition from the set ct

possible definitions, i.e., many alternative definitions relying upon information
announced prior to the ex month will have forecasting errors that lie somewhere
between. those of the perfect foresight definition and the Litzenberger and
Ramaswamy definition.

      UH .g Litzenberger and Ramaswamy's definition of anticipated dividend
yields, :atiorIs (11) and (12) are estimated with two groups of thirty securities:
the Dow Jones lndusttials sample and a sample of utilities and railroads. The
utility—railroad sample provides a check against peculiarities of the Dow Jones
IndustriaLs, ad this s;:mpie can be presumed to have been identified by investors
as high—yield stocks. The test with these securities are conducted for the same
periods as the previous tests are remrted in Tables 14 and 15. These results
indicate that the earlier conclusions rc;arding th dividend yield coefficient are
basically unaffected by the definition of atcipaed dividend yields. The F-
statistics and restricted estimates change somewhat, but the changes, on
balance, are not large enough to alter our conclusions. Further, the utility-
railroad sample exhibits the same pattern as our earlier samples of high—ield
stocks, and the variation of the unrestricted estimates for the Dow Jones sample
is similar to those earlier under the perfect foresight definition. In sum, the
failure to find a common tax effect cannot plausibly be attributed to an
obscuring of the tax effect by announcement effects impounded in the perfect
foresight definition.

                  Dividend Yields and Shifts in Expected Returns

     Tables 2 through 15 reveal a complex relation between expected returns
and dividend yields. The unrestricted estimates highlight this complexity. In
many reseets, our results are unsettling since we have rejected the two simplest
models of the impact of dividends: neutrality and common tax effects. In fact,
the data   11 us both of these are bad approximations. But not why.
      One pcssible explanation is that dividend yields are proxying for other
 factors that affect returns. Imagine, for example, a world where dividends are
 "steady" in the sense of not being adjusted immediately by firms to maintain
 constant dividend yields. A decrease in the price of a firm's shares, on average,
 will thus imply a higher dividend yield and an increase in price will, on average,
imply a lower dividend yield. For leveraged firms, changes in stock prices may
also result in changes in the riskiness of the firm's stock. Unless firms make
compensating adjustments in leverage, a decrease in the price of common stock
implies a higher leverage ratio and an increase a lower, leverage ratio. As a
result, both dividend yields and expected returns may be increasing or decreasing
simultaneously. Stated differently, equations have been omitted, namely, the
ones determining expected returns, and dividend yields are proxying for the
omitted equations.
      To see the possible impact of this relation, consider equation (11). The
intercept of equation (11) may be expressed as,
                                 oit —   oi + "it
whereu it is the difference between the expected return of security i in period t
and its average during the sample period (ignoring taxes).       Substituting this
expression into eqution (11),
                     Rit =yoi +yiidit +y2irft+Eit v it                       (lic)
The disturbance term in equation (11) consists of the true disturbance plus the
deviation of the expected return in period t from its average during the sample
period.
     Our previous discussion suggests that, on average,      it and d1t are both
negatively related to stock prices and, therefore, positively related to each
other. Further, the relation is not easily modeled. The best that we can do is
 present videnee that establishes the plausibility of the connection. Never-
 theless, this evidence had important implications for intercepting tests of the
relation   between dividend yields and expected returns (and perhaps also other
anomalies of asset pricing).
      To test for this relationsip, we generalize equation (ii) to,
            R
                I 01   + v     r
                             ii ft

                                                                                      it       (lid)
where   dt is the diiiiend yield     in month t. The     Litzenberger and Ramaswamy
definition of anticipated dividend yields is used in estimating (lid). In                  effect,

(lid) includes the dividend yield terms of (ii) in both the cum and cx months,
Since the cum month dividend yield is taken from the previous ex month, there
can be no information effects in the coefficient                and a fortiori in the two—
month lag coefficient y4. Clearly, there are no tax effects of the kind
hypothesized by Litzenberger and Ramaswamy in these coefficients since the
dividend has already been paid. If the ex month is included, the cum month
effects are purely statistical artifacts from their point of view. The tests
conducted with (lid) are tests of no effect of current or lagged dividend yields.
If both lagged and current dividend yields turn out to be non-zero, there is reason
to believe that dividend yields are proxying for shifts in expected returns. The
results of these tests for the Dow Jones Industrial sample are reported in Table
16.

   As can be seen both the lagged and current dividend yields appear to be non-
zero in all time periods. It would be difficult, on the basis of these results, to
conclude either that the current values dominate the lagged value or vice-versa.
The current and lagged values both contribute to the explanation of expected
returns, thus warning again of the perils of attaching too much economic
significance to the observed relations between expected returns and dividend
          19
yields.

                                   Cone lusions


     The purpose of this paper has been to test certain hypotheses on the
relation between dividend yields and expected stock returns, using a methodology
that is more powerful in a number of respects that those that have so far been
used in that context. The method employs systems of time series regressions
with the competing hypotheses taking the form of cross equation restrictions.
     The major finding of this paper is that the relation between dividend yields
and stock returns is not constant across securities. In almost all cases examined,
the hypothesis that dividends have a common effect on expected returns can be
decisively rejected. This conclusion is inconsistent with the tax effect models of
Litzenberger and Ramaswamy and Brennan or the similar model of Blume. But
the results are also inconsistent with the hypothesis that dividends have no
effect on expected returns. Stated differently, the tests show a statistically
significant relation between yields and returns, but one that is not well described
either by dividend neutrality or by tax effect models. The unresolved question is
what does explain the results? The observed structure of dividend payments
suggests that dividend yields may be proxying for changes in the expected return
of securities over time. This possibility was tested by including the lagged
dividend yield in cum months along with ex month dividend yield. The cum
month dividend yields have no impact on' investors' tax liabilities and have no
informaitonal content since they are lagged values.       Nevertheless, the cum
month dividend yields appear to be as important statistically as the ex month
dividend yields. The cum month results emphasize the need for greater caution
in interpreting the dividend tests here and more generally.          They should
especially discourage attempts to appeal to existing empirical tests for justifying

                  ERRORS IN VARIABLES:
                                            A GENERAL DISCUSSION

           Errors in estimation
                                     of beta are critical
                                                               for two of the
   estimation techniques used by

   the effect of errors in

                                                          estimate of c, Consider
   the general model,




                                                                                (Al)

depend on N.

ignored. Equation (A2) may be used to evaluate the effect of errors

then,
                                                                               56

                             _J
            From equation (A3), it follows that the degree of inconsis-

tency of Litzeiberger and Ramaswaniys estimators will depend only

upon the second column of M'. For C,            it will only depend upon the
last element of the second column. To evaluate the effect of c, note

that   M equals,

                 1
                                  M1 (6)            tI1 (d_r)
       M=                         M2 (6)
                 111                                M1 (6d_rf)

                 M1 (d-rf)        M1 (6d—jrf)       M2 (d-Jrf)

where M1(13) is the ith moment of the estimated beta around zero,
M1(d-Irf)is the ith moment of the dividend yields less the         risk free

rate   around zero and t.1(6d_Jrf) is ith cross moment around zero. The
(3,2) element of the inverse of M is,

    m32      -
                 IMH [M1(d-irf) - M1() Ml(dird)]

            = - ML' M1(5-         4-a)
                                                                                    57

   where M1(-d-) is the first cross moment around the respective

   first moments of betas and dividend yields. From equation (A2) and

   (A3) it follows that,


             plim C    = c-1-Mj          M1(-id-j)]eb                          (A4)

                      =   c+     IMP'                    eb


             By assumption, M is positive definite so that M > 0.             The

   parameter b is a market after tax risk premium. If b>0, it follows

  that


         >   0 if                       > 0



plim c-c < 0     if M1(-d-a) < 0

         =   0   i f M1 (8-   id- ) = 0
  It is easy to imagine circumstances where the cross moment around the

  mean is not equal to zero. If the cross moment is positive, the

  Litzenberger and Ramaswamy estimate will be too large in a probability

  limit sense. If dividend yields
                                              are negatively related to beta, the
  probability limit of the estimate will be less than c. While the

 magnitude of this effect is unknown for the
                                                        Litzenberger and
 Ramaswamy sample, a serious suspicion is cast on the results

 obtained with the '0LS and 'GLS' estimation
                                                         techniques.

         Litzenberger         and Ramaswamy propose an estimator in the form of
(AS). Their GLS estimator is calculated by
                                                                          standardizing the observa-
tions by the estimated standard
                                                errors of the beta estimates.                       Because
of this, they state that,


                                       _o           a       o

                              :=        0           1       0

and their adjusted estimator takes the form,

  Recall the Litzenberger and
                                   Ramaswamy claim that this estimator is both
  consistent and the maximum likelihood
                                               estimator if the joint distribu-

  tion of security returns is normal.


 An Examination of Litzenber9er and
 Ramaswamy's Claim of Consistency

           It is obvious that the properties of this adjusted estimator

 depond upon      taking on the value assumed by the authors.         If s is
 the estimated standard error of
                                      , it        is necessary that

                                      N v2
                           plimi            ___     =1
                           N-* N i=l s2

 for the claims of Litzenberger and
                                           Ramaswaniy to hold. Suppose that
 s' =       for   all i and each v' is normal with a mean of zero. Each

 term in the above sum then would be
                                            chi-squared with one degree of
 freedom. Further, if each of the estimation errors are independent of

all others, 1/N times the sum will converge to 1 as N goes to infinity.20

Thus, Litzenberger and Ramaswamy's claim that


                                      0       0
                             1-0

                       E
                             0        1       0

                             La       a       a


requires   two assumptions: (1) the true standard errors of all the beta

estimates must be known, and (2) each of the estimation errors must be

        These are by no means trivial

 fhe Maximum Ltei ihood Claim

              Litsenbergey'   and Ramaswamy also claim that their adjusted
 esimator, maximum likelihood and, indeed, there are conditions
                                                                     where
 fliaximrm likelihood estimators exist with errors in variables. The
 most irnportt of these conditions is prior know'edge of some of the
 parameters, If the distriHtjon of the variables are normal, it is
 well known that not all the parameters              identifiable. If
                                               are                         is
 known, the other parameters can be identified and        the   estimator will
be maximum likelihood if other conditions hold.
                                                         In particular, each
row of X must be
                 normally, independently, and identically distributed.
If X is assumed to be
                              nonstochastic, then each row of the observed
variable      will have a different mean vector (the value of each row of
X).       But the X matrix is unobservable and
                                                 there will be T unknown mean
vectors instead of one.         In short, if X is assumed to be
                                                                  nonstochastic,
there will be 1-1 more parameters
                                         to identify per independent variable.
All this must be accomplished with
                                          only T observation per independent
variable.

             In addition, it is required that each row of V and
                                                                    u be
normally, independently, and identically distributed with a mean vector
                                                                                             61

 of zero. Finally, each u. and each row of X and V must be mutually

 independent.

         The assumptions made by Litzenberger and Ramaswamy are not

 jointly consistent with these conditions. For purposes of estimating

 betas, Litzenberger and Ramaswamy assume that the market model holds,


                Rjt -
                         rft   =       +

                                                                      it                 (A6)


 In the stochastic version of their model, equation (7), the distri-

 bution is defined as,


                                   =         -
                                       R1t       E(Rt)                                (A7)


substituting equation (A6) into (A7),


                   ut =        i   mt - E(Rt)]               +
                                                                 it
If ,   Rt   and it are all normally distributed, U                     will   be the pro-
duct of two normally distributed random variables, plus a normally

distributed random variable. While sums of normals are normal,

products of normals are not normal. If                       is normal, then
                                                                                 ,   Rt,
and it can not all be normally distributed. If either                          or it are
not normal, the estimator is not maximum likelihood.
                                                                           However, Rt
simply a linear combination of the Rt and the normality of the

implies the normality of Rmt Clearly, all these conditions can not

be met simultaneously. it follows, then, that Litzenberger and

Ramaswamy's assumptions are not consistent with those required for their

adjustment estimator to be maximum likelihood.

           In summary. Litzenberger and Ramaswamy's claims regarding their

adjusted estimator are wrong. It has been shown that both the

sistency and maximum likelihood properties of this estimator depend

upon an arbitrary conditioning argument that the authors fail even to
mention.     Further, it was shown that th
                                                          assumptions made
by Litzenberger and Ramaswamv are not consistent with those required

for their adjusted estimator to be maximum likelihood. Finally,

Litzenberger and Ramaswamy ignore the fact that the betas and standard

errors of beta are parameters in the joint
                                                 distribution of security
returns. In short, there is no reason to believe that their adjusted

estimator is any better than the OLS and GLS estimators they

From (B2) it is clear that the disturbances of (Bi) are not homosced-

astic. Define the part of the variance of the disturbances that is

constant as,


                                    E ? + 2 + 2 a2

Equation (B2) may be written as,


                                E       =         +
                                                      dt G

where        =              The changes in the variance of u over time depends

upon        d. Since            is the ratio of one variance to three variances,

it is probably reasonable to approximate A1 with a value of about .33.

An average quarterly dividend yield is approximately .01; for a high

yielding stock the value would be .02. Thus, in an ex month the

variance of the disturbance would be about ? (1.000033) for an average

firm, and            (1.000132) for a high yielding firm. In a non ex month,
                                                                                        66

 the variance would, of course, be .                Differences   of this size can

 probably be safely ignored for purposes of estimation.

   1. It is possible that a relation more complicated than the ones tested here
      could exist. See, for example, Constantinides, G. [1979].
   2. Actually c is a weighted average of investors' marginal tax rates where the
      weights equal the global risk tolerance divided by the sum of the global risk
      tolerances across all investors, see Litzenberger, R., and Ramaswamy, K.,
       [1979, 171i't2].
  3. lbid.,p.2.
  4. Ibid., p. 15.
  5. Only dividends paid in the last twelve months are used to calculate the
     unannounced but recurring dividends. See Litzenberger, R., and Rama-
      swamy, K., [1979, 182].
  6. Litzenberger, R., and Ramaswamy, K., [1979, Table 1].
  7. The reliability of this calculation is questionable. First, Black and Scholes
      measure dividend yield for any year as dividends paid in the previous year,
      divided by the closing price of the previous year. Tax liabilities will depend
      upon dividends actually paid and not the previous years dividends. A
      possible differential tax liability will not be proportional to the Black and
      Scholes measure of dividend yield. Second, Black and Scholes estimate
     using both ex and non-ex months. Since tax effects only occur in ex months,
     the      estimates mixes tax effects with other dividend related effects.
     Finally, Black and Scholes use an equally weighted index and not a value
     index. In short, the relation between estimate and the presumed dividend
     tax bracket of the marginal investor is by no means clear. The most that
     can be said is that a positive estimate        in a Black and Scholes test is
     consistent with differential taxation of dividends.
 8. Blume apparently expected a negative coefficient, a preference by investors
    for dividends, see Blume, M., [1978, 1].
 9. See, for example, Stambaugh, R., [1979].
10. Gordon, R. and Bradford, D. (1979) estimate a model similar to (12).
    Unfortunately, the authors never test any of the restrictions implied by
    their model.

       statistic. Meisner has reported simulations that would

       statistic is heavily weighted toward rejecting the restriction  when the
       degrees of freedom are small per equation. As expected, as the degrees of
       freedom grows per equation (23   per equation were exsmined by Meisner) the
       bias is substantially reduced. Since the degrees of freedom
       here, the large sample aproximation will be assumed to be are quite large
