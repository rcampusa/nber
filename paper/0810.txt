                     Secular Patterns in Corporate Finance



                                   AB STRACT




     Trends in the financing of the corporate sector have been widely

discussed in both business and academic circles. It is frequently argued, for

example, that corporations' use of debt financing has increased dramatically

in recent years. These discussions have been hampered, however, by the lack

of a unified theoretical framework. In this paper, an attempt is made to

develop such a framework using existing corporate finance theory and some

extensions thereof. This theory is then used to interpret available data on

aggregate corporate financing patterns over the course of the twentieth

century.

     It is found that corporations' use of debt has undeniably increased in

the post—World War II period. vertheless, the relative corporate debt level

was unusually low in the 1940's and current debt levels are not unprecedented

when viewed in the context of the entire century. The tax system, in

conjunction with inflation, has probably played an important role in the

postwar increases in corporate debt, but these factors appear insufficient to

explain longer—term trends. it is argued, then, that supplies of competing

securities, such as federal government bonds, as well as the secular

developnent of the financial intermediary system, may also be important

determinants of long—run corporate financing patterns.

                SECULAR PATTERNS IN CORPORATE FINANCE



      For many years patterns in the corporate sector's sources of

 finance have been observed, discussed and sometimes decriedJ Yet

 there is little consensus on how to interpret these patterns and even

 some disagreement over what the patterns have been. Some studies

 argue that corporate debt ratios exhibit a secular upward trend, for

 example, while others assert that the debt—equity mix has shown re-

markable stability.2

     Apart from differences in measurement techniques, a major contri-

butor to this lack of consensus has been the absence of a theoretical

framework. With few exceptions, the trends observed in previous

studies have been discussed without reference to any detailed model

of the determinants of corporate finance.3 This state of affairs

may seem odd in view of corporate capital structure's role as one of

the central theoretical questions in finance.4 However, a number of

these empirical studies were completed before theoretical work had pro-

gressed very far, and in many cases these studies discussion of

corporate financing patterns has been a by—product of some broader

concern, such as capital formation, tax policy or the evolution of the

financial system as a whole. More important, perhaps, most theoretical

work has been aimed at the individual firm and, until very recently,

little analysis has been explicitly devoted to the determinants of

corporate finance at the aggregate level.5

     This paper attempts to improve upon the existing literature by the

first developing a detailed theory of capital structure for the corporate

sector as a whole and then using that theory as a guide in interpreting
                               —2—




empirical regularities. Existing theory is culled and extended with a

specific eye toward isolating those factors that should influence the

aggregate corporate financing mix over time.

     The paper consists of three sections the first of which develops

the theory. The major aim of that theory is to identify the forces

affecting aggregate supplies and demands for corporate securities re—

lative to competing securities in the capital market. It is argued

that 'previous theoretical work has tended to rely on extreme assumptions

about supply curves, demand curves or both, and that these assumptions

may not be appropriate when the aim is to understand secular patterns

in corporate finance. The second section presents a variety of measures

of corporate financing activities. Observations from a number of pre-

vious studies are gathered and updated in order to present the broadest

possible perspective on capital structure trends from the beginning of

this century to the present. The third section offers some preliminary

explanations for these trends based on the theoretical considerations

of Section I.

     To preview some of the major conclusions, it is found that there

has been an undeniable trend toward greater use of debt financing by

corporations in the post—World War II period. Nevertheless, the rela-

tive level of corporate debt was unusually low around the time of World

War II and current debt levels are not unprecedented when viewed in

the context of the twentieth century as a whole. The tax system, in

conjunction with inflation, has probably played an important role in

the postwar increases in corporate debt, but these factors appear in-

 sufficient to explain the trends over longer periods of time. In
 particular, it is argued that supplies of competing securities, such

 as federal government bonds, as well as the secular development of the

 financial intermediary system, may also be important determinants of

long—run corporate financing patterns.



I. A Theory of the   Aggreate   Corporate Capital Structure

     A. The Place of the Corporat- eccor It! the Overall Financial System

      One contention of the ch. o be developed in this

sectibn is that the corporate sector's financing activities

should be viewed in the context of the other sectors of the

economy. Accordingly, the paragraphs that follow offer some

prefatory remarks on the corporate sector's place in the over-

all financial system. The aim of this discussion is to develop

a general framework for understanding the determinants of the

supply and demand for corporate securities. In Section LB.

some existing theoretical contributions are briefly surveyed

with an eye toward drawing out their implications for these

supply and demand curves, while in Section I.C. an attempt is

made to flesh out the theory and provide a more complete pic-

ture of how the supply and demand curves are conditioned by the

other sectors of the financial system.

     Let us begin by considering a stylized three—sector

economy consisting of households, nonfinancial corporations and

financial institutions. If we consolidated the balance sheets

of the three sectors all financial assets would cancel, as
                       —4—




they have both issuers and holders, and we would be left

with just tangible assets on the left-hand side and household

net worth on the right. We could thus conclude that the econo-

my's ultimate wealth is its tangible assets while the house-

hold sector is the ultimate wealthholder.

     Nevertheless, this consolidation masks the role of the

financial system in reconciling the characteristics of the tan—

ible assets with households' planned consumption patterns.

That role emerges if we examine the separate balance sheets of

the three sectors, as shown in Figure 1.

    Households accumulate assets because of discrepancies be-

tween their desired consumption plans and their patterns of

labor income. To some extent tangible assets, such as houses

and consumer durables, serve this purpose by producing streams

of services that households can consume directly and by act-

ing as inflation hedges. In other respects, however, tangible

assets may not be the ideal household savings vehicle.

Productive equipment, for instance, requires special expertise

to maximize the value of its return stren. Tangible assets are

rarely traded on organized markets and may not be easily con-

vertible into cash. Moreover, their pattern of returns may not

coincide with households' desired consumption patterns.

                                                        for
 Tangible assets may provide riskier return patterns,

 example, than most households desire or may not yield suffi-

                                            that are important
 ciently high payoffs under contingencies

 to households, such as death or illness.
                        —5—




     To help reconcile these desires by households with the

tangible asset characteristics, then, the economy develops a

financial structure, consisting of nonfinancial corporations,

securities markets and financial institutions. Corporations

specialize in holding and operating tangible assets and issue

claims against these assets in the form of debt and equity

securities. Households may prefer allocating some portion

of their wealth to such securities because they require less

management than tangibles, are more easily traded and can be

combined in varying proportions to transform and rearrange

the tangible assets' return streams. Even the degree of trans-

formation possibilities inherent in corporate securities may

not be fully adequate to match households' desired consumption

patterns, however, and this creates a role for financial

institutions. Banks, insurance companies, pension funds and

mutual funds, for example, hold corporate securities and in

turn issue their own claims having different liquidity charac-

teristics and differentpatterns of return. Furthermore, some

of these institutions purchase household debt securities as

well, thus affording individuals further transformation oppor-

tunities on their own account.

     Viewing the financial system from this perspective em-

phasizes the idea that corporate capital structure in the

aggregate is ultimately a matter households' demands for asset

characteristics on the one hand and the corporate sector's
                        —6—




financial transformation technology on the other. On the

demand side, households' desires for various asset charac-

teristics will reflect such factors as their attitudes toward

risk, their expectations, their stage in the life cycle and

personal tax considerations. Moreover, the elasticities of

these demands depend on substitutability among assets, which

in turn depends on the degree of competition among corporations,

financial institutions and households themselves in performing

the desired transformations. The more highly developed the

financial intermediary system and the broader the range of

transformation opportunities possessed by households on their

own account, the less likely it is that corporate securities

will possess unique characteristics, and the more elastic the

demands for these securities will be. On the supply side,

the corporate sector's willingness to transform the return

streams from its real assets by issuing various combinations

of financial securities depends on the costs of doing so,

including transaction costs and tax considerations.

     A theory of aggregate corporate capital structure, therefore,

 should explain the interaction of both supply and demand factors

 and should illuminate the ways in which the corporate sector

 responds to changing household demands over time, in competition

 with similar responses from financial institutuions and house-

 holds themselves.6 In Section I.B., it will be argued that
                                          structure have tended to
 previous analyses of corporate capital
                              —7-.




     make extreme assumptions about either the supply or demand

     side of the market or both. Although such assumptions have

     proved useful in isolating the role of such factors as taxes

     and agency costs, they may not be appropriate if what one

     wishes to understand is the unfolding of corporate capital

     structure over time.



B.   Implications of Existing Theory for the Determinants of

     Aggregate Corporate Capital Structure

          Although much of previous theoretical work has examined

     the financing decisions of individual firms, it nevertheless

     contains implications for corporate finance in the aggregate.

     The purpose of this section is to draw out those implications.

     To provide a uniform framework, we will analyze the aggregate

     supply and demand curves for corporate debt implied by a

     number of previous contributions. Iii the diagrams that follow,

     the aggregate amount of corporate debt, B, will be measured

     along the horizontal axis, and since investment will be held

     fixed, movements along this axis represent substitutions of

     corporate debt for equity. On the vertical axis will be

     measured the certainty equivalent yields on corporate debt,

     r, and on corporate equity, r.7

         Modigliani and Miller's (MM, 1958) analysis of corporate

     capital structure is the logical place to begin, both because

     it remains the most widely—cited paper on the topic, and because
                         —8—




it represents the furthest extreme in assumptions about the

elasticities of supply and demand for corporate debt. As

depicted in Figure 2, both elasticities are assumed to be

infinite. Supply is perfectly elastic because corporations

can costlessly transform their financing mixes from all—equity

to any degree of leverage. Thus they are willing to freely

substitute one form of financing for the other as long as

both have the same certainty—equivalent cost. But demand is

likewise perfectly elastic- because households can costlessly

perform the same transformations on their own account, and

thus they will be unwilling to accept any yield differential

between the two securities.

     This configuration of supply and demand implies that

corporate capital structure is indeterminate not only at

the individual firm level but also at the level of the cor-

porate sector as a whole, since corporate and household

financial transformation are perfectly substitutable.8 ile

this analysis emphasizes the important fact that corporations

face competition from other sectors in their financial trans-

formation activities, however, it also doesn't tell us much

about factors that would cause the corporate financing mix to

change over time. As long as equilibrium in the capital

market were continuously maintained, such changes would be

largely random events.

     Following MM's (1963) correction,which took the effect

of corporate taxes into account, a theory that gained
                         —9—




considerable support took the tradeoff between bankruptcy

costs and tax savings from the deductibility of interest to

be the primary determinant of corporate capital structure.9

Under this theory the demand for corporate debt is still

perfectly elastic, because investors are willing to freely

substitute debt for equity as long as their certainty—equivalent

yields are equal.1° The supply of debt is no longer perfectly

elastic however, Because of the tax—deductibility of interest,

corporations would be willing to pay a certainty—equivalent

yield on the first dollar of debt equal to (l/l_tc) times

the certainty—equivalent yield on equity, where t is the

corporate tax rate. As more debt is issued, the probability

of bankruptcy increases, and if bankruptcy imposes costs on

firms, the premium rate that they are willing to pay to issue

debt decreases. Thus the supply curve for corporate debt

is downward sloping, as deiicted in Figure 3. Equilibrium

is reached when the corporate sector has issued that amount of

debt which drives the certainty—equivalent yields on debt

and equity into equality. Furthermore, since bankruptcy costs

are firm—specific, the optimal capital structure is determin-

ate at the individual firm level as well as at the aggregate

level.

     According to this theory, the primary determinants of

changing patterns in corporate finance would be changes in

corporate tax rates and changing perceptions of bankruptcy

costs. As corporate tax rates increase, the supply curve for
                        —10—




corporate debt shifts upward, and the equilibrium amount of

debt increases. An unappealing implication, however, is that

if the corporate tax rate goes to zero, the supplycurve for

debt will slope downward from the point r on the vertical

axis and thus no corporate debt at all should be issued. This

is clearly contrary to observed corporate capital structures

in the U.S. prior to the imposition of the income tax in 1913.

Changes in the impact of bankruptcy costs would also shift

the supply curve for debt upward or downward. This might

occur if the efficiency with which bankruptcies are resolved

increases or decreases over time or even if the perceived
                                                        the business
risk of bankruptcies changes over, say, the course of

cycle.

     The agency theory of Jensen and Meckling (1976) is dia—

grammatically similar to the tax savings —   bankruptcy   costs

theory, but some of its implications are different. Again

the demand curve for corporate debt is perfectly elastic at

the level r. Likewise the supply curve has its intercept

at a point above re, because, starting from all—equity financing,

the firm can reduce total agency costs associated with out-

side financing by substituting a dollar of debt for a dollar

of outside equity. Thus the firm would be willing to pay a

higher certainty equivalent yield on debt to reflect this

advantage. As more debt is issued, however, its ability to re-

duce agency costs at the margin declines and eventually turns
                           —11—




negative, so the supply curve is downward—sloping, as

depicted in Figure 4. The difference between this theory

and the previous one is that the curves would look like

this even in the absence of corporate taxes.11 The

primary determinants of changing patterns in corporate

capital structure would be changes in relative agency costs

of debt and equity.

       The theory that contains perhaps the most implications

for the aggregate corporate capital structure, and indeed

the only one that is explicitly aimed at the capital struc-

ture of the corporate sector as a whole, is Miller's

(1977) "Debt and Taxes" model. Here, the supply curve is

horizontal since, apart from tax considerations, corpora-

tions can costlessly split their return streams into debt

and equity portions. Furthermore, because of the tax—de-

ductibility of interest they are willing to pay a premium

yield (re/l_tc) to issue debt. Unlike the three theories

discussed above, however, personal taxes are considered,

and the demand curve is upward sloping, starting from
      12
re.
           This is because investors are arrayed in groups

subject to successively higher personal tax rates and be-

cause tax arbitrage restrictions make it costly for them to

mitigate the differing tax consequences of different

securities. Thus, since returns on corporate debt are taxed

more heavily at the personal level than returns on corporate

equity, investors in successively higher tax brackets must
                                     —12—




be enticed with successively higher yields to buy these

bonds. As depicted in Figure 5, equilibrium occurs when

enough bonds have been issued to drive the corporate bond

rate up to r /l—t c
            e
     In contrast to the tax savings—bankruptcy cost theory

and the agency cost theory, however, corporate capital

structure is determinate only at the aggregate level, not at

the individual firm level. As in the original MM model,

corporations and households compete with one another to per-

form financial transformations, but here they do not all

compete on equal terms. Corporations that issue debt reap

tax savings at the rate t per dollar of interest, and thus

they have a comparative advantage in borrowing over those

investors with personal tax rates lower than t c.   It will
thus pay corporations to keep on borrowing until the marginal

shareholder is just indifferent between buying levered shares

and borrowing on his own account to buy unlevered shares.

This will occur when the marginal shareholder's tax rate is

just equal to t. Nevertheless, this comparative advantage

applies to the corporate sector as a whole, but not to any in-

dividual firm. One corporation's debt is as good as any

other's, and thus in equilibrium capital structure is of no

consequence at the firm level.

      One appealing feature of Miller's model is that the

equilibrium condition, which may be written as


      1 —
            r
                 (l-t c   )   = o,                            (1)
             0
                              —13—




 lends itself particulary well to comparative statics

 exercises on the determinants of the aggregate amount of

 corporate debt. The equilibrium condition itself can be

thought of as an implicit function, H(B, f) = 0, of the

optimal amount of corporate debt, B, and a variety of

exogenous factors, f, such as tax tates, the inflation rate

and supplies of competing securities. Implicit differen-

tiation can then be used to determine the effect of changes

in these factors on the equilibrium quantity of corporate

debt. Because of their usefulness in interpreting the

capital structure trends described in Section II, it is

worthwhile at this point to work through the details of a

few of these exercises.

     The effect of a change in the corporate tax rate, t,

for example, holding all other factors constant, would be

given by


       *          c              L°
                                      -
                                         (l-t) )/t

                                                            (2)
           =              —
                                  -
                                      (lt))/B
The denominator is negative, since an increase in D will

increase r relative to r. Thus the whole expression will

be positive if the numerator is positive. An increase in

t, holding all security supplies constant, decreases the
                        —14—




availability of tax—exempt income from shares, and this will

induce high—tax—bracket investors to bid down r relative to r.

Nevertheless, jf tc is approximately equal to 0.5, r/r would

have to rise by about twice its original magnitude for the

whole expression in (2) to be negative, and thus there is a

strong presumption that increase in t will be associated with

increases in corporate debt. This exercise is represented

diagrammatically in Figure 6. The increase in the corporate

tax rate from t to t    shifts the supply curve upward and

brings about a higher level of corporate debt, B          .   Notice,
however, that the increase in debt is dampened by the slope of

the demand curve: the steeper is that slope, or, equivalently,

the larger is the change in relative interest rates that is

necessary to induce investors to absorb new bond issues into
                                                     *
their portfolios, the smaller will be the change in B
     If the increase in the corporate tax rate is accompanied by

an increase in personal tax rates, t, on the other hand, the

resulting change in corporate debt is given by
                                          r

 Since increases in t increase the value of tax—exempt income
 to investors, r/r would be expected to increase with t and any
                          —15—




 increase in B* would be smaller than in the previous case

where only t increased. Diagrammatically, as shown in

Figure 7, the increase in t rotates the demand curve upward

from its intercept so that its slope is everywhere increased.

If the increase in personal tax rates is of the same magnitude

as the increase in corporate tax rates, it is even possible

that the shifts in supply and demand will cancel one another out,

leavin interest rates on bonds higher, but the equilibrium

quantity of corporate debt roughly unchanged.13

      Another exogenous factor affecting B is the inflation rate.

Suppose the expected annual inflation rate suddenly jumps

from zero to some positive amount, i. The nominal expected

yields on taxable and tax—exempt securities, r and r ,

Diagrammatically, as shown in Figure 8, the onset of in-

 The demand curve also makes a parallel upward shift from

 ror to r, a difference of i(1+r )J5         Thus the supply

 curve shifts up by more than the demand curve resulting in

 an increase in B
                    *16

      In the preceding three cases, shifts in the amount of

 corporate debt outstanding have been ultimately tax—induced.

 Even in the case of inflation, it is not some sort of

 T1debtor—creditor" hypothesis17 that explains the increase in

corporate debt, but rather the interaction between inflation

and taxes. In effect, inflation—adjusted interest rates

allow some of the real principal on corporate debt to be de-

ducted for tax purposes, and this increases the tax advantage
           18
to debt.

     An additional feature of MillerTs model is that exogenous

changes in the supplies of other securities will also induce
                *
changes in B .      An increase in the supply of tax—exempt bonds,

B, for example, will result in the following change in

corporate debt:



                       r(l-t )
                              c
                          r           /Bo
                                  /
            —                                                  (10)

                        r
                           C1 /B




Since an increase in B increases r relative to r, expression
                     0            0

(10) will be positive. From a personal tax standpoint, tax—
                        —18—




exempt bonds are substitutes for equity in Millerts model,

and thus an increase in the supply of tax—exempts encourages

corporations to shift their financing mix more toward debt.

Again, from a personal tax standpoint, taxable government bonds
are a corporate debt—substitute rather than an equity—substitute,

and an increase in the supply of debt—substitutes induces cor-

porations to shift their financing mix more toward equity.

     These last two exercises emphasize the fact that the de-

mand curve for corporate debt plays a special role in Millerts

model. In the three other models discussed above, this demand

curve is perfectly elastic, and thus investors are willing

to freely substitute corporate debt for equity securities as long

as their certainty—equivalent yields are equal.   In effect,

perfect elasticity stems from the perfect substitutes for cor-

porate securities that can be created either on investors' own

accounts or through financial intermediaries acting on their

behalf. As long as perfectly elastic demands prevail, exogenous

changes in the suppliesof noncorporate securities will affect
                          —19—




 neither relative yields nor corporate financing decisions.

 In MillerTs model, by contrast, differing tax treatment im-

 plies that different types of securities are imperfect

 substitutes and that the terms on which investors are willing

 to substitute one type of security for another differ across

 investors. This implies that exogenous changes in supplies of

 other securities will cause changes in relative yields and

 will in turn induce changes in the corporate financing mix.

      Taken together, the four theories reviewed in this section

yield a number of possible determinants of changing patterns in

the aggregate corporate capital structure. These include

changes in corporate and personal tax rates and in the expected

inflation rate, shifts in the perceived agency and bankruptcy

costs associated with corporate securities, and exogenous

changes in the supplies of noncorporate securities. In two

respects, however, the picture seems incomplete.

     First, these determinants of corporate financing patterns

rely heavily on tax considerations. Apart from the tax rates

themselves, the effect of inflation depends on its interaction

with the tax system, and the effect of noncorporate security

supplies rests on the fact that the tax system renders security

demands less than perfectly elastic. While these tax—related

determinants may have been important in recent years, they are

incapable of explaining corporate financing patterns in the pre—

1913 era. In the absence of taxes, we are left with only agency

dosts to explain these patterns, and while agency costs may be
                         —20--




an important determinant of cross—sectional variation in

corporate capital structures, it is hard to imagine that

these costs have shifted enough over time to cause major

changes in the corporate financing mix.19

     Second, all of the four theories reviewed above rely

on extreme assumptions about the supply curve for corporate

debt, the demand curve, or both. In the Modigliani—Miller,

tax savings —   bankruptcy costs, and agency cost models, the
demand curve is perfectly elastic, while in the Modigliani—

Miller and Miller models, the supply curve is perfectly

elastic. This perfect elasticity implies that substitution

of debt for equity securities is costless either on the part

of corporations (perfectly elastic supply) or individual

investors (perfectly elastic demand).

     On the demand side, at least, perfect elasticity is in-

dicative of a well—developed capital market: that is one in

which trading is competitive, transaction costs are low,

investors are not subject to trading restrictions, and a full
                                  20
range of securities is available.      While this vision of a

well—developed capital market has proved to be a highly useful

abstraction, however, it may be more appropriate when applied

to short periods than to longer historical eras.      Over long

periods, economic forces would work toward making the capital

market more perfect and more complete, and if one is interested

 in corporate financing trends over such periods, one is then
                            —21—




   interested in understanding what role the corporate sector

   has played in that process of capital market development.21

   As argued in Section l.A., a theory of the aggregate corporate

   capital structure should illuminate the interaction between the

   corporate sector and the other sectors of the economy as they

   respond to investors' demands for securities. Although perfectly

   elastic demands might emerge as a limiting case toward which

   forces tend over time, the theory seems incomplete if it does

   not explain the evolving role of corporate finance as the capital

   market develops.



C. Further Development of the Demand Side of Aggregate Capital

  Structure Theory

       The effect of the security suoplies and return—stream

  transformation              afforded by other sectors of the

  economy will manifest itself primarily in the shapes and

  positions of the demand curves for corporate securities. A

  logical place to extend existing capital structure theories,

  then, is to attempt a richer development of the demand side.

  As we have seen above, demands for corporate securities are

  perfectly elastic in a complete and frictionless capital market.

  In Miller's (1977) model, on the other hand, the tax system

  and concomitant tax arbitrage restrictions on investors'

  portfolio choices cause the demand curve for corporate debt

  to be upward—sloping. Since these restrictions represent a
                        —22—




kind of transaction cost, a natural extension of Millers model

would be to explore the ways in which other types of transaction

costs would lead to upward—sloping demand curves.

     In general, the presence of transaction costs implies that

return streams from corporate securities cannot be costlessly

transformed by individuals or financial intermediaries.    To

take an extreme case for illustrative purposes, let us suppose

that return stream transformation (combining shareholdings with

personal borrowing or lending, for example) is prohibitively

costly at the individual investor level. Ignore for the time

being the possible existence of financial intermediaries and

assume that corporations start out relying solely on equity

financing. Individuals, i, have initial endowments of cash,

    as well as initial fractional shareholdings, c, in the

aggregate market value of corporate equity, V. There is no

second—period endowment, so individuals must make a consumption—
                                                          Li
saving decision that maximizes the expected utility, E (U ),
                                                          As
of first and second—period consumption, C1 and C2.
noted above, however, the only available savings vehicle is

holdings of corporate shares.

     Firms in the aggregate are assumed to be subject to the

 same uncertainty, and thus the shares of one firm are viewed

 as perfect substitutes for those of any other firm. We will

 ignore distinctions among firms, then, and simply think of the

 corporate sector in the aggregate.   The aggregate net income
                              —23—




 of firms in the second period is ®X, where ® is a random

variable. In general, individuals may differ in their views

of the distribution of C and their subjective probability

density functions will be denoted by f1(®).

        A representative individual's consumption—saving problem

is




        ma fu'(c , c)f1(C)d®,                                 (12)




where




        c = y]    + (1 - ai)V                                (13)



and



           =
                                                             (14)


The first order condition is




            =
                XE1(U   ®)   - vE1(u)   =   0,               (15)




where



      E1(UC) =     I
and
     E1(U) =                  f1(®)d®
                   (BU1/C)

Using the fact that cov(AB) — E(AB) —E(A)E(B) , where A and B

are any two random variables, (15) may be written as




                      E1(O)
        =   (E1(              +
                                  cov(U                       (16)

                 E1(U)             E1(U))


That is, each individual buys or sells shares until his personal

valuation of corporate equity is exactly equal to the market's

valuatior., V.

      As indicated by the right—hand side of (16), however,

the individual's personal valuation has two components, which

need not be equal separately for all individuals. If we

assume away differences in expectations for the moment and

let E1(e) = 1 for all individuals, the first component
                 (hereafter, tildes will be dropped for

convenience), can be thought of as a personal discount 'factor

for certain prospects and the second component can be thought

of as a personal risk—adjustment factor. From (16), those

investors with higher certainty discount factors (that is,

those who place a higher value on certain future consumption)

must have correspondingly larger (i.e., more negative) risk—

adjustment factors.22
      If we aggregate by summing (16), weighted by individual

shareholdings, over all individuals, the result is
                                      —25--

 and the cost of equity financing to the corporate sector

be expressed as

                                                   E(U)



That is, the cost of equity is determined by weighted averages

of investors' certainty discount factors and risk—adjustment

factors. Furthermore, since the second term in the denominator

of (18) can be thought of as the overall market risk—adjustment

factor, the market certainty—equivalent cost of equity, r, is

given by


              =        1
     r
         e                                                              (19)

                  :OL
                           E(U)


     If      firms    were now to begin substituting some debt financing

for equity,23 those investors with highest certainty discount

factors (that is, those placing the highest personal value on

this debt), would be the first to buy it. Since these investors
                          —26--




would have higher—than—average certainty discount factors

relative to the market as a whole, (19) indicates that

firms could sell at least an initial increment of debt at a

lower certainty—equivalent cost than that on equity. In

effect, the corporate sector is able to gain by splitting

off part of its total return stream, packaging this part in

the form of riskless securities and selling them to the most

risk—averse segment of the investing population.

     As more corporate debt were sold, it would be purchased by

investors requiring progressively higher certainty—equivalent

yields. Thus we would have an upward sloping demand curve

for corporate debt, just as in Miller (1977). In Miller's model,

the upward slope is attributable to tax arbitrage restrictions,

whereas here it is attributable to restrictions on individuals

creating their own bonds, so in both cases demand is less than

pefectly elastic because investors find it costly to transform

corporate return streams on their own account.        The supply curve,

on the other hand, would be perfectly elastic at r, since

transformation by firms is costless and thus firms would be

willing to freely substitute debt for equity financing as long

as their certainty—equivalent yields were the same. The result-

 ing equilibrium is depicted in Figure 9, with corporations
                                  *
 issuing   that amount of debt, B ,   sufficient   to drive the cost

 of debt, r, into equality with re.

      As in Miller's model, the aggregate amount of corporate debt

 is determinate, but in equilibrium the capital structure decision
                         —27—




 is irrelevant at the individual firm level. Because of

 trading restrictions on investors, there is a demand for

 transformation services on the part of the corporate sector,

 and firms compete with one another to supply these services.

 Since all firms compete on equal terms, however, profits

 from financial transformation are squeezed out, and the most

risk—averse investors reap a "bond—holders' surplus," just as

those investors in the lowest tax brackets do in Miller's

model.

     Differences in investor expectations would play a similar

role to differences in their attitudes toward risk in this

model. If we held risk—adjustment factors constant across

all investors in equation (16) but allowed expectations to

vary (as represented by differences in E'(®)), those investors

who were most optimistic about the corporate sector's prospects

(i.e., who had higher values of E1(®)) would have lower certainty

discount factors. The most pessimistic investors, conversely,

would be willing to accept the lowest return on corporate debt.

The demand curve for corporate debt would thus be upward—

sloping as before, and equilibrium would be reached when enough

debt had been issued so that the marginal bondholder were exactly

as optimistic about firm's prospects as the marginal shareholder.

     In summary, then, it is investor characteristics such as

risk—aversion and expectations, that drive the equilibrium

corporate financing mix in this model. Loosely speaking, the
                       —28—




larger is the segment of the investing population exhibiting

high degrees of risk aversion and pessimistic expectations,

the greater will be the amount of corporate debt.24 In models

with perfectly elastic demands for corporate securities,

differences in these investor characteristics are capable of

being exploited through financial transformations elsewhere

in the economy, and hence they play no role in the determination

of corporate capital structure. In the model presented in this

section, by contrast, the sole purpose of issuing a mix of corpor-

ate securities is to exploit those differences.

     The transaction costs that impart positive slope to the de-

mand curve in this model are, of course, unrealistically severe.

In practice, one would expect firms to face competition in

their efforts to overcome transaction costs through financial

transformation. Overcoming such costs and helping to satisfy

divergent investor demands, in fact, is one of the primary ration-

ales given for the existence of financial intermediaries.

     In general, then, not only the corporate sector but also

the financial intermediary and household sectors will have access

to financial transformation technologies. To the extent that

the corporate sector's technology exhibits cost advantages over

those of other sectors, the corporate sector will tailor its

financing mix to exploit these advantages. In this case, shifts

in such investor characteristics as expectations and attitudes

toward risk will be important determinants of changing patterns
                               —29—




    in corporate finance. To the extent that financial intermediar-

    ies or investors themselves can transform return streams at re-

    latively low cost, on the other hand, demand curves for corpor-

    ate securities will be highly elastic, and divergent investor

    characteristics will have little role in determining the cor-

    porate sector's financing mix. Moreover, it might be reasonable

    to suppose that the progression from the first case to the second

    would bear some relationship to the development of the capital

    market over time. In earlier times, when investors faced a

    less plentiful array of financial transformation opportunities,

    one would expect the intermediation role of corporate finance to

    be relatively important. As the capital market develops, however,

    and as investors come to rely less on corporations for financial

    transformation, this role would be expected to diminish.

           To draw together some of the threads of Section I as a

    whole, the most general representation of the supply and demand

    for corporate debt would be one in which both curves exhibited

    less than perfect elasticity. This is depicted in Figure 10.25

    The shape of the supply curve will reflect such aspects of the

    corporate sector's transformation technology as bankruptcy

    costs, agency costs and the costs of issuing and servicing

    securities. The less important are these costs, the more elastic

    the supply curve will be. Moreover, the level of the supply

    curve will be determined by such factors as corporate taxes and

-   the   expected inflation rate as well as the general level of
                       —30—




real interest rates in the economy. The shape of the demand

curve reflects the transformation technology available to

investos, either on their own   account   or through financial

intermediaries. The lower the costs of using this technology

the more elastic the demand curve will be. Conversely, the

higher the costs associated with this technology the less

willing investors will be to freely substitute one type of

corporate security for another. In this case investor expec-

tations and attitudes toward risk, personal tax considerations,

and supplies of competing securities (government bonds) will

all affect the shape and position of the demand curve for cor-

porate bonds.

     This general representation of the supply and demand for

corporate securities contains each of the theories revied in

Section 1.13. as a special case. It has the advantages that is

does not rely solely on tax considerations to explain the

corporate sector's financing patterns and that it is capable of

taking into account the evolving role of the corporate sector in

the financial system as a whole. Trends in the major determin-

ants of corporate finance implied by the theory will be compared

with the actual patterns in corporate financing over the course

of the twentieth century to see which factors may have been

most important. First, however, it is necessary to establish what

those financing patterns have been.

II. Measurement of Capital Structure Trends

          Identification of the secular trends in corporate financing

    is hampered by a variety of measurement problems. Comparable data

    series often are not available over long periods of time. Accounting

    conventions are subject to change, and fluctuations in economic

    conditions, especially the rate of inflation, may destroy the corn—

    parability of accounting numbers between periods. Market value

    numbers may be used in their stead, but these must be estimated with

    some error, and it is unclear to what extent market values reflect

    the actual financing decisions of corporations and to what extent

    they reflect other exogenous factors.

         The approach taken here will be to present a variety of different

    measures of corporate financing trends and to then try to infer the

    common patterns that emerge. Four different types of data have been

    used in previous studies of corporate financing and all four will be

    presented sequentially in the sections that follow. These include

    book value, market value, replacement cost and flow—of—funds data.

    Each type of measurement has its problems and advantages, and these

    will be discussed as the data are presented.

    ..   Book Value Balance Sheet DatA

         Perhaps the simplest approach to assessing corporate finan-

    cing patterns is to examine changes in the composition of the

    liability side of the corporate balance sheet. This was the

    approach adopted by Miller (1963), for example, in a study

   undertaken for the Commission on Money and Credit. The In-

    ternal Revenue Service compiles balance sheet data for both
                        —32—




U.S. corporations in the aggregate and for U.S. manufacturing

corporations, and Miller's study examined these data for the

period 1926—56. Using data through 1975, Table 1 presents a

variety of balance sheet ratios from this source.

     As Miller pointed out in his study, the ratios of long—

term debt to total long—term capital remain impressively stable

through the mid—1950's. They fluctuate somewhat, but virtually

no trend is evident. The ratios of total debt (including lia-

bilities of all kinds) to total assets show some tendency to

rise in the late 1930's and early l9'0's but exhibit no trend,

thereafter until at least the late '50's.26 The use of preferred

stock, on the other hand, exhibits a steady secular decline

through the early 1960's.27

     Data that was not available to Miller at the time of his

study, however, suggest that debt ratios have tended to drift

steadily upward since the late 1950's. This may indicate a

fundamental change in corporate financial policy, although Miller

(1977) has warned that at least some of this apparent trend may be

spurious. Liberalized depreciation allowance since the early

1960's, for example, would tend to depress reported equity values

and would automatically tend to increase debt ratios. By the same

token,inflation in the 1960's and 1970's may have caused reported

asset values to be understated, thus giving a misleading impression

of the size of corporate debt relative to assets.28

     If capital markets are efficient, investors should see

through these accounting changes and should also adjust for the
                             —33—




     effects of inflation.29 In an attempt to circumvent these

     problems, then, we turn next to balance sheet ratios in market

    value terms.

B. Market Value Balance Sheet Data

         Since market value data are not available for the nonfinan-

    cial corporate sector as a whole, they must be estimated.     A
    variety of estimates using somewhat different techniques is pre-

    sented in Table 2.

         The most common approach is to take dividend and interest

    payments reported by corporations and to capitalize these at

    appropriate rates to obtain estimates of the market values of

    equity and debt respectively. This approach has been followed by

    Holland and Myers (1979), using the dividend yield on the Standard

    and Poor's Composite Index and Moody's Baa corporate bond rate

    as capitalization rates. Their estimates, updated through 1979,

    are shown in column (1) of Table 2. Like the accounting numbers

    in Table 1, these estimates suggest that there has been a consi-

   derable increase in corporate debt ratios since the late l950's.

   A major portion of this increase has apparently occuned during

   the decade of the '70's. The increase is not nearly as smooth as

   the accounting numbers suggest, however, as dips occur in the

   early and late l960's and again in the early and late '70's.

   Furthermore, although the l930's and '40's might hardly be

   characterized as a normal period the estimates at least suggest

   that the debt ratios occurring in the 1970's are by no means

   unprecedented.
                        —34—




     The estimates in columns 2 and 3 are from von Furstenberg

(1977) and they differ in two respects. First, dividend pay-

ments for common and preferred stock have been separated and

capitalized at different rates. Second, von Furstenberg

argued that the weighted average rating of corporate bonds

outstanding has tended to be A or slightly better. He thus capi-

talized interest payments using the A—rated bond yield and also

attempted to take into account the maturity composition of cor-

porate debt. His estimates give consistently higher values for

corporate debt ratios than those of Holland and Myers, partly

because of the lower capitalization rate for corporate debt and

partly because the higher dividend yield on preferred stock gives

a lower estimate for the combined market value of common and

preferred stock. Nevertheless, the two series move in unison

and von FurstenbergtS estimates suggest a considerable rise in

corporate debt ratios since the mid—1950's and the same higher

plateau in the 1970's. The estimates also reveal •that the rela-

tive value of preferred stock has remained low throughout and

has generally tended to decline, with the exception of a modest

 comeback in the mid—1970's.

      A third approach has been followed by Gordon and Malkiel

 (1981), who use the sample of nonfinancial corporations for which

 data is reported on the Standard and Poor's Compustat Tapes.

 Market values of common equity can be observed directly for these

 companies. Market values of debt and preferred stock have been
                        —35—




estimated using methods similar to von Furstenbergs but with

the estimates derived from bond and preferred stock prices

sampled at the two—digit industry level. Again, the estimated

debt ratios, shown in column 4 of Table 2, move in parallel

with the other two series, with their absolute magnitudes

generally falling between the other two. The estimates suggest

the same increase in debt ratios, particularly since the late

1950's. Since both the von Furstenberg and the Gordon and

Malkiel estimates range over a shorter period than those of

Holland and Myers, however, they may give the impression that

current debt ratios are higher by historical standards than is

rlly the case.

     The last approach to estimating market values, followed

by Ciccolo (1981), uses observed market values for all securities

for samples of roughly fifty U.S. manufacturing firms. Ciccolo

has reported market value balance sheet ratios for the aggregate

of his sample firms for selected years, and these are shown in

the last two columns of Table 2. The debt ratios are generally

much lower than those in the other series and do not move in

parallel with the Holland and Myers estimates for the early

years. The fact that the debt ratios are so much lower for all

years suggests that the sample may not be representative of the

nonfinancial corporate sector as a whole. Nevertheless, Ciccolo's

figures reveal the same increase in debt ratios since the 1960's

that the other series do. Moreover, the preferred stock figures
                            36—




    confirm the secular decline in the importance of preferred

    stock that appears in the accounting data of Table 1.



C. Replacement Cost Data

         Another ratio that has been used in previous studies to

    measure corporate leverage is that of the market value of

    debt to the replacement value of total assets. On theoretical

    grounds, this ratio may be a better measure than those in

    Table 2 of how much debt firms have relative to their debt

    capacity0 Furthermore, measuring assets at replacement cost

    alleviates the overstatement in book value ratios during in-

    flationary periods that results from the understatement of

    corporate assets. In any case, estimates of the ratio of the

    market value of debt to the replacement value of assets are

    available over a long period.

         Two series of these ratios are available. One is from

    von Furstenberg's (1977) study and runs annually from 1952

     to 1976, while the other is from Goldsmith's (1963) study of

     national balance sheets. Goldsmith's estimates are available

     for selected years from 1900 to 1945 and annually from 1945 to

     1958. The two series are shown in Table 3. The figures from

     Goldsmith suggest that nonfinancial corporations' use of debt

     financing relative to the replacement value of their assets

     was markedly lower in the decade following World War II than

     it had been earlier in the century. The figures from von

     Furstenberg indicate that, after remaining essentially flat for
                         —37—




much of the 1950's, corporate debt ratios began a gradual

but steady rise that carried through the late 1970's.

     It can be seen from t1 years of overlap in the 1950's

that there are some discrepancies between the two series.

The ratios derived from Goldsmith's data, for example, are con-

sistently somewhat lower than von Furstenberg's.31 Moreover,

Goldsmith's series itself may not give comparable da between

pre—war and postwar periods.    Balance sheets from the pre—war

period are from Goldsmith's A Study of Saving in the United

States (1958) while the annual data from 1945 to 1958 are from

his Studies in the National Balance Sheet of the United States

(1963). Some changes in sectoral definitions and estimation

methods occurred between these two studies, and the only year

of overlap, 1945, indicates that these changes may have caused

some differences in the debt ratios.

     Nevertheless, some tentative conclusions can be drawn.

Between 1952 and 1958, Goldsmith's and von Furstenberg's series

move quite closely together, and it may be that they would exhibit

similar trends throughout the whole period 1900—1978. If so, it

appears that even though corporate debt ratios increased substan-

tially in the postwar period, particularly from the mid 1950's

to the mid 1960's, the debt ratios of recent years are not un-

usual by historical standards. Even if it is argued on the basis

of the two 1945 estimates that the pre—war figures are overstated

by a third, the debt ratios of the 1960's and 1970's would still
                               —38—




      represent a return to roughly the levels that prevailed over

       the pre—war period. The replacement value data, then, provides

       some further support for the impression gained from market value

      data that, while debt ratio have increased in recent decades,

      after a relatively flat period in the 1940's and '50's, they are

      nevertheless not unusual by prewar standards.



ID.   Flow of Funds Data

           The final method for measuring corporate financing patterns

      makes use of flows of funds over periods of time as opposed to

       stocks at particular dates. While this method does not take into

       account valuation changes, as market value and replacement value

       estimates do, it may nevertheless come closest to recording the

       actual decisions made by corporations. Furthermore, since capi-

       tal consumption allowances are included as a component of in—

       ternalequity financing, this method is not subject to Miller's

       criticisms about understatement of equity financing in the wake

       of changes in depreciation accounting.

            Between Goldsmith's Study of Saving data, which run from

       1900—45, and the Federal Reserve Flow of Funds Accounts which

       cover the period 1946 to the present, it is possible to put to-

       gether a fairly lengthy record of corporate financing flows.

       The data are shown in Table 4. Since the emphasis of this

       paper is on secular patterns in corporate finance, the flows

       are divided into periods covering roughly a decade each.
                         —39—




     The same data have previously been examined by Kuznets

(1961), Sametz (1964) and Friedman (1980). Kuznets and

Sametz were limited to the period 1900 through the late 1950's.

Both were struck by the sharp decline in the use of stock

issues as a financing source and both argued that internal funds,

disregarding the aberrant years of the Depression and World War II,

had shown at least a modest upward trend relative to other finan-

cing sources. Both authors also pointed out that, although

short—term liabilities fluctirated considerably, they generally

increased relative to both total financing sources and total debt

through the late 1950's. Finally, Sametz emphasized that des-

pite trends in internal funds and external equity and in short—

term and long—term debt, the use of total debt financing rela-

tive to total equity financing appeared to have remained roughly

constant over long periods of time.

     Friedman, confining his attention to the postwar period,

pointed Out that internal funds first increased relative to

total sources in the 19501$ and then decreased in the '60's

and '70's. He also emphasized the continued decline in stock

issues, an increased use of debt, and in the late '60's and '70's

an increase in the use of short—term debt.

     Looking at the whole period, as shown in the data in

Table 4, the trends discussed by all three authors are evident,

and at the same time some longer—run trends come into sharper

focus. It is clear, for example, that the use of debt finan-

cing has increased in the 1960's and 1970's after recovering in
                           —40—




the years following World War II to pre—Depression levels.

Use of long term debt, however, is by no means unusual, even

after steady postwar increases, relative to the levels pre--

vailing in the first decade of the century and in the 1920's.

The increased use of debt, then, seems largely attributable

to an increase in short—term liabilities. It should also be

noted that short—term liabilities have shown considerable

fluctuations over time, with substantial increases occurring

in the 1913—22 period and again during the World War II years.

Although it cannot be denied that short—term liabilities have

been much higher in the postwar period than in the pre—war

years, it is not clear if the recent surge represents a tem-

porary phenomenon or the continuation of a trend.

     On the equity side, the greatly diminished use of stock

issues appears to be a long—term trend. Stock issues staged a

modest comeback in the 1970's, compared with the 1960's, but

they remain very low by pre—war standards. As has been widely

noted, fnternally generated funds have also declined relative

to total sources during the postwar period. The data indicate,

however, that the depressed levels of internal funds experienced

in the 1970's are not unusually low relative to the levels of

the first decade of the century and the 1920's. It might be

inferred, instead, that the use of internal funds was unusually

high during the period 1930—1960 and that the past two decades

have witnessed a return to roughly the levels experienced during

 the pre—Depression era.
                            —41—




E. Common Trends

         Viewing the different measures of corporate financing

    patterns simultaneously, some common threads appear .   First,
    the use of debt financing has increased considerably in the

    postwar period, particularly in the 1960's and '70's. This

    trend emerges regardless of the method of measurement employed.

    There is considerably more doubt, however, as to whether current

    debt levels are unusually high relative to those of the pre-

    war period. The accounting—based data of Tables 1 and 4

    suggest that they are, but the measures that make some attempt

    to correct for valuation changes, as shown in Tables 2 and 3,

    indicate that this may not be true. At the very least, the

    trend in corporate debt ratios has not been unindirectional.

    Rather, these ratios appear to have been somewhat low in the 1920's

    and especially in the years surrounding World War II. Thus the

    postwar surge in corporate debt does not appear to be as dramatic

    when viewed in the light of the whole century's experience as

    it does when the postwar period is considered in isolation.

         Second, some changes have occurred within the debt and equity

    components of corporate finance. Although it is traceable only

    in the sources and uses of funds data, there appears to be

    little doubt that short—term liabilities have increased in im-

    portance over time. Again, however, the trend is not unidirec-

    tional. Within the equity component, there is no doubt that

    issues of both preferred and common stock have declined con-

    siderably in relative importance. Internally generated equity
                                  -42-




    on the other hand is currently low relative to the previous few

    decades, but whether it is unusually low when a longer—run view is

    taken is far less clear.



III. Interpretation of Capital Structure Trends

         Having reviewed the secular patterns in various measures of cor-

    porate financing activity, the remaining step is to interpret these

    patterns in the light of the theory developed in Section I. This

     interpretation will be drawii from a comparison of the trends in

     corporate capital structure's determinants, as suggested by the theory,

    with the capital structure trends themselves. The primary deter-

    minants that can be readily traced are corporate and personal tax

     rates, the rate of inflation, the relative supplies of substitutes

     for corporate securities, and the extent of financial intermediation

     in the economy. These will be examined in turn in the paragraphs

     that follow.

          This paper should be regarded as a preliminary attempt to link

     theory and evidence, and this secti9h does not contain a rigorous

     empirical test of the theory. It is hoped, in fact, that the em-

     pirical regularities discussed here will stimulate further refinement

     of an aggregate corporate capital structure theory.   Nevertheless,

     existing theories are assessed in terms of their ability to explain

     these regularities.



     A. Corporate and Personal Tax Rates

          As was seen in Section I, tax considerations are an important

     element of capital structure determination in both the tax
                        —43—




savings—bankruptcy costs and Miller (1977) models. They

would also play a role, though not necessarily the preeminent

one, in the more general supply—and—demand model with which

Section I concluded.

     Movements in marginal corporate and personal tax rates

from 1913 to the present are shown in Table 5. Personal tax

rates for those investors in the lowest and highest marginal

brackets are shown in columns (1) and (2), respectively, while

the corporate tax rate is shown in column (3).

     The implications of these rates for corporate financing

decisions may perhaps be drawn mcre sharply if we compute what

Grier and Strebel (1980) have referred to as the "net debt

incentive tax ratios," 5, for investors in the lowest and

highest tax brackets. This ratio is defined as


             1—t
                                                              (20)
                pB


where tc is the corporate tax rate and tB is the personal

tax rate on ordinary income.33 Columns (4) and (5) of Table

5 give time series for L' the debt incentive tax ratio for

investors in lowest tax bracket, and cSH, the ratio for

investors in the highest bracket, respectively.

     Expression (20) indicates that   will be positive for

investors in tax brackets lower than t and negative for
                                      C

investors in tax brackets higher than t. In effect, low tax—
                        —44—




bracket investors will prefer to borrow through corporations

so as to maximize the tax advantage of debt, and conversely,

high tax—bracket investors will prefer to borrow on their own

account.34 Looking at values of    for investors in the

lowest and highest tax brackets, then, gives some idea of the

strength of the demand for corporate leverage from low tax—

bracket investors and of the aversion to corporate leverage on
                                          35
the part of high tax—bracket investors.        Inferences must be

limited, of course, without further knowledge of the distri-

bution of wealth generally and shareholdings in particular

among investors in different tax brackets. Nevertheless, one

would expect that if   values tend to increase over time for

both high and low tax—bracket investors, the demand for cor-

porate leverage would also increase. In addition, during times

when S values are small, even for low tax—bracket investors,

one would expect that any tax advantage to corporate debt would

be more easily offset by such factors as bankruptcy and agency

costs.

     Turning to the values of   in Table 5, the tax code

apparently gave little or no incentive for corporate leverage

in the early years of its existence. Until the early 1920's,

even investors in the lowest tax brackets had little incentive,

purely from a tax standpoint, to hold shares in levered firms,

while high tax—bracket investors often incurred a substantial

tax disadvantage from corporate leverage. During the 1920's

this tax disadvantage for high tax—bracket investors grew much
                           .45...




smaller, but at the same time the tax advantage for low tax—

bracket investors remained small. It was not until the 1940's,

when corporate tax rates rose dramatically, that the (5 values

grew very much for low tax bracket investors. From 1940 to

1954, these (5 values for low tax—bracket investors approximately

doubled, whereafter they have remained essentially unchanged to

thepresent. Since top—bracket personal tax rates were very

high in the 1940's and l950's, the (5 values for high—bracket

investors were also very negative during this period. These (5

values have become less negative in the 1960's and 1970's.

     Overall, then, it can be inferred that the tax system should

have given rise to a demand for corporate leverage on the part

of at least a segment of the investing population. This demand

should have shown particular growth, moreover, between the

1920's and the early 1950's. In addition, the less negative

values of       from the mid—1960's to the present may indicate

an atmosphere more conducive to corporate debt in recent years.

     Comparing these trends with those discussed in Section II,

however, it is apparent that tax considerations are not the sole

determinant of patterns in corporate sector financing. Although

the values of     were small iuunediately following the advent

of the income tax system, they roughly doubled in the 1920's,

again in the 1930's and again in the 1940's. Despite the

apparent increase in the demand for corporate leverage, however,

the tables in Section 2 indicate that corporate debt usage

fell for at least the first two decades following 1913 and that
                            —46—




    it remained low at least through World War II. The increases

    in both     and     that have occurred since the 1940's are

    broadly consistent with increased corporate leverage that has

    occurred since that period, but the two trends are not closely

    synchronized.36 According to Tables 2 and 4, the largest

    increases in corporate debt financing appear to have occurred

    during the 1970's, for example, whereas the debt tax incentive

    ratios have been relatively flat during that time.



B. Perceived Bankruptcy Costs

         If the tax system alone is not sufficient to explain the

    patterns in corporate financing, some supplementary determinants

    must be invoked. One possibility is perceived bankruptcy costs.

    There is some plausibility, for example to the notion that in-

    creased tax incentives for corporate debt in the late 1930's

    and early '40's were overwhelmed by a tremendous increase in

    perceptions of bankruptcy risk in the wake of the Depression.

     In a similar vein, Gordon and Malkiel (1981) point to the

     figures in Table 2 and argue that increased economic instability

     since 1974 has again increased perceptions of bankruptcy risk,

     causing corporations to retreat somewhat in their use of debt

     financing. Bankruptcy costs have the disadvantage, however, that

     they cannot ben measured with any precision, and the timing of

     any shifts is especially hard to pin down. One might wonder why

     bankruptcy ars would not have been allayed sooner following the

     Depression, especially in view of the increased tax incentives
                             —47—




    for debt. Moreover, one might ask why corporate debt financing

    was apparently relatively small in the 1920's, even though tax

    incentives increased and investors are generally believed to have

    been unusually optimistic about firms' prospects.



C. Inflation

         Another supplementary factor is the inflation rate. As dis-

    cussed in Section I, inflation can enhance the real tax advantage

    to debt, and thus the interaction between taxes and inflation

    may produce an explanation of corporate financing patterns that

    is superior to that of taxes alone.

         Some idea of inflation trends can be gained from the yearly

    percentage changes in the implicit GNP price deflator, shown in

    Table 6 for the years 1901 to the present.37 From these it might

    be concluded that the relatively high inflation rates of the

    late 1960's and the 1970's interacted with relatively high debt

    tax incentive ratios to produce an increase in corporate debt

    financing during this period. There was also a temporary in-

    crease in corporate debt usage coinciding with both the increase

    in debt tax incentive ratios and the inflationary burst of the

    immediate post—World War II years.38 Earlier, however, the

    years surrounding World War I were also years of relatively high

    inflation rates coupled with rising debt tax incentive ratios

    (at least for investors in low tax brackets) .   The data in

    Section II indicate, though, that corporate debt financing was

    therefore, although the interaction between taxes and inflation

    probably contributed to increased debt usage in recent years,

    it does not appear to be the sole determinant of corporate

    financing patterns.



D. Supplies of Substitute Securities and the Evolution of the

    Financial Intermediary System

         It will be recalled from Section I that changes in relative

     security supplies or in the extent of financial intermediation

    played no role in models with perfectly elastic demands for

     corporate securities. In the more general model with costly

     financial transformation, however, these factors can affect

     the portfolio opportunities available to investors and hence

     the equilibrium yields and quantities of corporate securities.

         Some idea of the relative position of corporate debt in the

     economy may be gained from Table 7, which shows the total

     liabilities of the nonfinancialcorporate, federal government,

     state and local government and financial institution sectors as

     well as the mortgage liabilities of the household sector, all

     expressed as percentages of total domestic liabilities

     outstanding. Data are available from Goldsmith (1963) for selected

     years from 1900 to 1945 and annually from 1945 to 1958. Annual

     data are also available from the Federal Reserve Flow of Funds

     Accounts for the years 1945—'78. The series for U.S. government

     debt and household mortgage debt are intended to reflect supplies

     of securities that might act as close substitutes for corporate
                         —49—




                                 39
 debt in investors portfolios.        As indicated in one of

 the comparative statics exercises in Section I, the supply

 bf state and local government debt acts, from a tax standpoint

 at least, as a substitute for corporate equity. Finally, the

 series on financial institution liabilities is intended to

serve as a rough index of the strength of the financial inter-

mediary system. As indicated in Section I, the importance of

corporate finance as an intermediation device may be conditioned

by the development of this system.

     The data suggest that in the post—World War II years, cor-

porate liabilities have been much smaller relative to total

liabilities than in the pre—Depression era. There has also

been little if any trend in the share of corporate liabilities

since the 1950's. While the data in Tables 1—4 indicate that

corporate debt financing has increased relative to equity

since that time, therefore, corporate debt has still only kept

pace with the postwar expansion in liabilities for the economy

as a whole. The share of corporate liabilities dropped sharply

during the Depression and World War II before recovering some-

what during the years 1945—'50. Since that time a modest up-

ward trend seems to have occurred through the mid—l970's

followed by a mild decline.

     Liabilities of the federal government by contrast, were

quite small at the beginning of the century and remained so

until the Depression, even including the increase surrounding

World War I. During the Depression and especially during World
                          —50—




War II, however, federal government debt mushroomed relative

to that of the other sectors of the economy. Thereafter,

it declined steadily before reaching an apparent plateau around

1970.

        On the whole, state and local government and household

mortgage liabilities have been smaller than those of the corpor-

ate and federal government sectors. State and local government

debt has remained relatively small throughout, with the highest

plateau being reached in l96OTs and early 170's. Household

mortgage debt hovered around five percent of total liabilities

in the pre—Depression era, before falling somewhat by the end

of World War ii.° Since then it has increased at a slow but

steady pace and in recent years household mortgage debt has been

larger than that of the federal government and only slightly

smaller than corporate liabilities.

        Finally, the share of financial institution liabilities

appears to have followed a secular upward trend. An increase

seems to have occurred in the late l9aO's, although there is

 some conflict between the Goldsmith data and the Flow of Funds

 data as to whether this represented a dramatic upward shift.

 After remaining steady between 1945 and 1960, the share of fin-

 ancial institution liabilities again appears to have begun

 increasing in recent years, albeit at a relatively slow pace.

         The theory in Section I suggests that if the demand curve

 for corporate debt is not perfectly elastic, exogenous in-

 creases in the supplies of substitute securities will reduce
                                 —51—




 the equilibrium amount of corporate debt.         Broadly speaking,

 this proposition appears to receive some support from the

 data in Table 7. Particularly in the first half of this century,

 the share of corporate liabilities has tended to move in the

 opposite direction from that of federal government liabilities.

At the same time that federal government debt was taking its

great upward leap during the Depression and World War II, for

example, the share of corporate liabilities declined dramatically,

as did the share of debt in total corporate financing. Similarly,

in the immediate postwar years the share of corporate liabilities

staged a modest recovery, and corporate debt financing increased

relative to equity, at the same time that the share of government

liabilities was declining. Corporate debt financing generally

continued to increase relative to equity from the 1950's through

the present at the same time that the share of federal government

liabilities has continued to fall.

       There are some points at which the data and the theory do

not coincide exactly. Little can be inferred, for example,

about the relationship between corporate financing patterns and

movements in state and local government liabilities or household

mortgage liabilities. If anything,the share of corporate

liabilities seems to have moved in the same direction as that
                            41
of   household mortgages.                                   .

                                  Moreover, corporate debt financing

has shown its largt increases of the postwar years during the

1970's, a time when the relative supply of government securities

has been essentially flat.
                        —52—




Nevertheless, the effect of relative security supplies shows at

least enough promise to warrant further investigation in future

work.42 The potential explanatory power of this factor seems

particularly great during the early decades of the century when

tax considerations were non—existent or of lesser importance.

In addition, substitution relationships may have some bearing on

aspects of corporate finance, such as the maturity structure of

debt, that are unrelated to tax considerations.43

     It is more difficult to formulate precise hypotheses about

the effect of financial intermediation on corporate finance.     It

seems clear that the development of the financial intermediary

system facilitates corporate external financing by making it

easier for new issues of corporate securities to be absorbed by

the capital market. It is less obvious, however, whether the

system's capacity to absorb these issues would favor debt finan-

cing over equity by corporations or vice versa.

     To the extent that corporate securities themselves play

the role of an intermediary between the characteristics of firms'

real assets and investors' portfolio needs, the scope for that

role would seem greatest when the system of financial intermediar-

ies is less highly developed. In particular, investors may have

limited access to relatively safe securities at such times and

 thus their demand for corporate debt may be high. A tentative

 interpretation of the data in Table 7 that is consistent with

 corporate securities playing an intermediary role, then, is as

 follows: In the earlier decades of the century, corporations
                             —53—




     may have played a more substantial intermediary role than has

     been true in recent decades. Investors' demands for relatively

     safe, fixed—dollar claims were not met to such a degree in the

     earlier decades by either the government or financial institu-

     tions as has been the case in more recent times. These factors

     may help account both for the relatively high proportion of

     debt in total corporate financing and for the relatively high

     proportion of corporate debt in total domestic liabilities in

     the early part of the century. In the years following the

     Depression, however, this intermediary role of corporate debt

     has probably been reduced, both by increased relative supplies

     of federal government and household mortgage debt and by the

     increased extent of financial intermediation.

          By the present time, both the market for corporate debt and

     for corporate stock have become heavily institutionalized and

     it would be much more difficult to describe convincingly an overt

     intermediary role played by these securities. Still, certain

     shifts in corporate financial structure may at times be linked

    to shifts in the costs of financial intermediation. It is

    widely held, for example, that recent interest rate volatility

    has made it increasingly dangerous for financial institutions

    to intermediate between long—term financial assets and short—

    term liabilities. This may account in part, then, for the shift

    in corporate liabilities toward increasingly short maturities.45



E. Summary and Conclusions

         Overall, it has been argued in this paper that in order to

    explain the secular patterns in aggregate corporate financing,
                        —54—




it is necessary to employ a theory explicitly aimed at the

aggregate corporate capital structure. The outline for such a

theory has been developed here, building on previous theoretical

contributions, and containing those contributions as special

cases. The feature of this theory that is somewhat novel is

the emphasis on the costs of financial transformation and hence

on the role of corporations as intermediaries. It has been argued,

then, that in addition to such factors as taxes, inflation and

perceived bankruptcy costs, the supplies of substitute securities

and the development of the financial intermediary system may

exert an important influence on corporate financing behavior.

     A preliminary examination of available data confirms the

trend cited in other studies toward greater use of debt financing

by corporations in the post—World War II period. Nevertheless,

the evidence suggests further that corporate reliance on debt

financing was unusually low around World War II and that current

debt proportions may not be entirely out of line with those exper-

ienced in the earlier decades of the century.

     Since the study encompasses periods when the tax system was

non—existent, tax considerations alone seem incapable of ex-

plaining these overall trends. Rather, the explanation suggested

here is that nonfinancial corporations played a more substan-

tial intermediary role in the early decades of the century and

that corporate debt helped satisfy investors' demands for relatively

safe securities. That intermeidary role diminished by the end of

World War II in the face of rising federal government debt and

the continued development of financial institutions, and
                         —55—




corporations as a whole may now have relatively little com-

 parative advantage in performing financial transformations.

 Nevertheless, tax rates and inflation in the postwar years have

 combined with the declining relative size of federal government

debt to stimulate corporate debt financing again. Although

corporate debt has never approached its earlier importance re-

lative to total domestic liabilities, corporations' reliance on

debt financing relative to equity has returned, by some measures

at least, to roughly the proportions experienced in the early

part of the century.

     It is clear that many details remain to be filled in here.

In particular, if the costs of financial transformation are an

important element in the corporate sector's financing behavior,

one would like a better understanding of these costs and of

where, specifically, corporations might be expected to possess

a comparative advantage over financial institutions and indi-

vidual investors. In addition, hypotheses should be developed

about the ways in which technological and regulatory changes

affect these comparative advantages.46 On the basis of the

data examined in this paper, further development of an aggregate

capital structure theory along the lines suggested here appears

to offer some promise for explaining the secular patterns in

corporate finance.

                                   FOOTNOTES



 1. Academic studies of aggregate corporate financing patterns include Kuznets
     (1961), Goldsmith (1958, 1963), Miller (1963), Sametz (1964), Friedman
     (1980) and Gordon and Malkiel (1981). Business journalists have also
     surveyed trends in corporate finance particularly in conjunction with the
     "capital s.hortage" discussions that were popular in the mid—1970's. See
     for example Business Week (1974).

2. Discussions that emphasize the postwar period fall primarily into the
    former category. Examples include Friedman (1980) and Gordon and Malkiel
    (1981). More popular discussions have also tended to emphasize
    deterioration in corporate balance sheets by pointing to increases in debt
    ratios. Business Week (1974) is a goad example. Studies emphasizing
    stability in debt—equity proportions have tended to take a longer run
    view. These include Miller (1963) and Sametz (1964). Updated versions of
    these arguments also appear in Miller (1977) and Sametz and Keenan (1981).

3. An exception is Gordon and Malkiel (1981).

4. The literature on the topic is v.ast and no attempt will be made here to
    provide a complete list. Some of the more important contributions will be
    discussed in Section I below.

5. Miller's (1977) paper was perhaps the first to provide a theory explicitly
    aimed at the aggregate corporate capital structure.

6. Although a government sector is not included in this stylized economy, it
    will be seen in subsequent sections that securities issued by the
    government my also have an important impact on the demand for corporate
    securities.

7. In keeping with most previous literature, corporate capital structure will
    be taken to represent the mix of debt and common equity financing. The
    framework employed is more general than that, however, and could also be
    used to include preferred stock and a variety of other hybrid financing
    instruments.

8. The financial institution sector is introduced in Stiglitz's (1974)
    generalization of MM. Even if financial transformation were costly for
    households on their own account, their demand for corporate debt would
    still be perfectly elastic if financial intermediaries could costlessly
    perform these services.

9. Examples of this theory may be found in Robichek and Myers (1966) and
    Kraus and Litzenberger (1973).

10. Implicitly, there are no personal taxes, or at least corporate debt and
    equity securities are subject to identical tax treatment at the personal
    level.
11. The vertical intercept of the supply curve in Figure 4 thus cannot be
    identified precisely as it can be in Figure 3. Corporate tax
    considerations could of course be grafted onto the analysis, resulting in
    an upward shift of the supply curve. An example of work in this vein is
    Myers (1977), in which debt is subject to an agency cost but equity is
    not. In the absence of taxes, the supply curve for debt would slope
    downward starting from re and in equilibrium no debt would be issued (in
    Myers' simple example, at least). When corporate taxes are introduced,
    however, the supply curve shifts upward and there is a positive
    equilibrium quantity of debt.

12. In the simplest version of Miller's model, equity is assumed to be free
    from personal taxation. Thus re, the certainty—equivalent return on
    equity, is the same as the certainty equivalent return, r0, on tax—exempt
    bonds.

13. Suppose, for example, that initially r0 = .05 and t = .5. Corporations
    will be willing to freely substitute debt for equity financing at an
    interest rate r = .10. At this rate the marginal bondholders will be
    those for whom t = .5. If tc then rises to .6, corporations i1l be
    indifferent between debt and equity financing at r = .125. If the
    personal tax rate of those formerly in the 50% bracket also rises to .6,
    however, investors may wish to hold roughly the same amount of debt that
    they did before, but now with r = .125. This ignores, however, any wealth
    effects on portfolio choice caused by the increase in personal tax
    rates. Asymmetric changes in personal tax rates may also yield extreme
    results. If all investors were suddenly pushed into tax brackets higher
    than tc for examp'e, there would be no advantage to corporate debt for
    any investor and B would fall to zero.

14. Note that at the initial equilibrium, r =   rr,   and r0 =   rOr.
15. The assertion that the demand curve makes a parallel upward shift is
    contingent upon personal tax rates remaining the same in the face of
    inflation.
                                                            — bankruptcy costs
16. Inflation would have the same effect in the tax savings
    model of capital structure. Referring to Figure 3, an increase in
    expected inflation would shift both the supply and demand curves upward,
    wth the supply curve rising by more. This would result in an increase in
    B . The Gordon — Malkiel (1981) model, which is essentially a tax savings
    — bankruptcy costs model, reaches this same conclusion about the effects
    of inflation.

17. See Hong (1977) and the references therein for a discussion of this
    hypothesis.

18. See Modigliani and Cohn (1979) for an elaboration of this point. A
    somewhat related point has been made by DeArigelo and Masulis (1980) who
    argue that inflation reduces the real value of tax shields such as
    depreciation, and thus induces firms to issue more debt in order to
    further shelter their real income.
19. The Ross (1977) signalling model, not included among the theories
    reviewed, is another model of capital structure that does not rely on tax
    considerations. It is a kind of agency model, in that corporate capital
    structures are determined by a combination of information and managerial
    incentive problems. It is hard to see a definitive theory of the
    aggregate corporate capital structure emerging from the Ross model either,
    because, although firms would be continually trying to re—sort themselves
    in the eyes of investors, there seems to be no basis for linking this
    activity to changes in the aggregate mix of corporate securities.

20. The widely—used "complete" market model would be one in which these
    conditions are satisfied. Weaker conditions than market completeness (the
    "spanning" assumption, for example) would also be sufficient to generate
    perfectly elastic demands for securities if corporate financing choices
    were confined to traditional debt and equity securities.

21. A considerable literature exists, tracing this process of capital market
    development with particular emphasis on the role of financial
    institutions. See, for example, Davis and North (1971), Silber (1975) and
    James (1978).

22. A similar model of the firm valuation process is discussed in Senbet and
    Taggart (1981). It is shown there that the risk—adjustment factor,

     covG ')/E(), is negative for risk—averse individuals.

23. It will be assumed that this substitution is costless for firms.

24. Some qualification would be in order if corporate debt were subject to
    default risk or interest rate risk.

25. Barnea, Haugen and Senbet (1981) forniilate a similar diagram to depict the
    equilibrium quantity of corporate debt. Their theory ultimately rests
    solely on tax considerations, however. In the absence of taxes, the
    agency costs associated with debt would dictate a zero—debt equilibrium in
    their model.

26. The total—debt—to—total—assets ratio was not examined by Miller,

27. After 1961, the I.R.S. generally stopped reporting separate figures for
    preferred stock.

28. Some factors would tend in the opposite direction, however. The run—up in
    interest rates accompanying inflation would depress the market value of
    corporate debt and book values may thus tend to overstate the burden of
    this debt. In addition book value debt ratios may be understated by the
    omission of such off—balance—sheet" financing sources as leases and
    unfunded pension liabilities. The use of these sources is believed to
    have grown tremendously in the 1960's and 1970's. One indication of the
    possible magnitude of this understatement is given in Gordon and Malkiel
    (1981). They calculate the ratio of debt to debt plus equity for the
    aggregate of firms included on the Compustat tape. Since 1973 the data on
    the tape include lease and pension liabilities. The ratios with and
   without these liabilities are as follows:
                      Debt Ratio Without      Debt Ratio Including
                      Leases and Pensions      Leases and Pensions

29. See Modigliani and Cohn (1979) for an argument that the market does not
    properly adjust for inflation in determining equity values. By their
    argument, market value debt ratios would be substantially overstated.

30. Myers (1977), for example, has argued that a firm's capacity to issue debt
    is closely related to its assets—in--place. The total market value of
    assets, on, the other hand, reflects not only assets—in—place but also
    future investment opportunities and Myers points out that firms may not
    find it advantageous to borrow against these opportunities. Thus the
    replacement value of assets, which reflects only assets—in—place, may be a
    better measure of debt capacity.

31. One problem is that von Furstenberg's measure of debt is different from
    Goldsmith's. In von Furstenberg, non—interest bearing liabilities have
    been netted out against the asset side of the balance sheet, while
    interest—bearing financial assets have been netted Out against the
    liability side in computing this ratio. To make the figures as closely
    comparable as possible, the same procedure has been used in calculating
    debt ratios from Goldsmith's data. Nevertheless, the detail in
    Goldsmith's data is not the same as that in the Flow—of—Funds accounts,
    from which von Furstenberg worked, and thus ratios would not be expected
    to be identical.

32. To the extent that some investment expenditures, such as research and
    development, are expensed immediately, however, the extent of equity
    financing may still be understated somewhat. There are also other
    problems inherent in flow—of—funds data. Von Furstenberg and Nalkiel
    (1977) argue that these data are misleading in inflationary times because
    they fail to recognize the reduction in the real value of previously
    outstanding debt caused by inflation. In addition the Flow—of Funds
    Accounts published by the Federal Reserve System lump preferred stock
    financing together with common equity financing.

33. In general, as discussed in Miller (1977), the expression should be
       = 1 — (1 —
                  tc)(1
                        — t  )/(1 — B where t is the personal tax rate
    applicable to income frm corporae stock. This latter rate should be
    some mixture of the ordinary income tax rate (for dividend income) and the
    capital gains rate. In keeping with Miller, t is ignored here, on the
    argument that deferral of capital gains will make the effective tax rate
    on stock income quite small. To the extent that t    is positive, however,
    it will increase somewhat corporations' incentive o substitute debt for
    equity.
34. See Kim, Lewellen and McConnell (1980) and Taggart (1980) for discussions
    of how investors in different tax bracketE sort themselves into clienteles
    with respect to their preferences for corporate leverage. At Miller's
    equilibrium, the marginal investor will have tpB t and        0.
    Furthermore, this investor will be just indifferent between holding
    taxable and tax—exempt bonds, so for him r(1 —      =
                         t                         tpB) — r0. In equilibrium,
    then,    = 1 —(1 —   )/(1 —         I —r(1 —
                                                 t)/r(1    tPB)
     = 1 — r(1 —
                 t)/r0  £ 0 and thus (20) is consistent with (1).

35. The presence of tax—exempt investors might also add to the demand for
    corporate leverage. Restrictions on the riskiness of individual
    securities in their portfolios, however, might limit the ability of tax—
    exempt institutions to purchase stock in highly—levered corporations.

36. The upward trend in corporate tax rates is also broadly consistent with
    the secular decline in preferred stock financing.

37. In principle, expected rates of inflation would be preferred. Over long
    periods, one might expect at least a rough correspondence between expected
    and realized inflation rates.

38. This increase in debt financing is particularly apparent if one examines
    yearly Flow of Funds data, In 1946 and 1947, for example, the years of
    greatest inflation around that period, total debt accounted for 52% and
    49%, respectively, of total sources of funds for the corporate sector. In
    large part this increased debt financing was accounted for by heavy
    reliance on short term liabilities, which made up 33% and 29%,
    respectively, of total sources.

39. The supply of. government debt might reasonably be viewed as exogenous to
    the system. Observed amounts of household mortgages, on the other hand,
    will presumably be more affected by prevailing capital market yields.

40. The decline is much more dramatic in Goldsmith's data than in the Flow of
    Funds data.

41. To the extent that tax considerations and inflation have affected
    corporate liabilities and household mortgages in the same direction, this
    may not be surprising.

42. Recent work by Friedman (1981) bears a relationship to this idea.
    Friedman observes that the ratio of total debt to GNP has been remarkably
    stable for the U.S. economy, even though the ratio of any one sector's
    liabilities to GNP may have shown considerable trends. There appears to
    be some sort of substitution relationship, then, between the liabilities
    of the economy's various sectors.

43. One cannot look to federal government securities on this score, however.
    The maturity structure of both federal government and corporate debt has
    generally been shortened over the postwar period, so it is difficult to
    make any broad argument that issues of long—term government debt have
    pushed corporations to the short end of the market. Since 1975, though,
    it is true that the average maturity of government debt has lengthened
    considerably. See Friedman (1980).
44. In the immediate post—Depression years, of course, investors may have
    become increasingly skeptical about the safety of corporate debt.

45. Ultimately, this involves a shift in the bearing of interest rate risk
    from shareholders and other owners of financial institutions and from
    liability insurance agencies to the shareholders of nonfinancial
    corporations. A more complete explanation would detail the mechanism by
    which such a shift might take place. In particular, the stance of
    financial institution regulators might be an important factor.

46. See Greenbaum and Haywood (1971) for a discussion of the role of
    technology and regulation in the intermediation possibilities open to
    financial institutions.
