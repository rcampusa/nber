                                       ABSTRACT

We formulate a generalization of the traditional medium-of-exchange function of money in
contexts where there is imperfect competition in the intermediation of credit, settlement, or
payment services used to conduct transactions. We find that the option to settle transactions
directly with money strengthens the stance of sellers of goods and services vis-á-vis
intermediaries. We show this mechanism is operative even for sellers who never exercise the
option to sell for cash, and that these "latent money demand" considerations imply monetary
policy remains effective through medium-of-exchange channels even if the share of monetary
transactions is arbitrarily small.

1. Introduction

We formulate a generalization of the traditional medium-of-exchange function of money in
contexts where credit, settlement, or payment services involve financial intermediaries with
some degree of market power (e.g., banks, broker-dealers, credit card companies). The option
to settle transactions directly with money strengthens the stance of sellers of goods, services, or
assets, vis-`
            a-vis intermediaries. This mechanism is operative even for sellers who never exercise
the option to trade in cash: the mere threat of monetary exchange restrains the market power of
the financial intermediaries they face. From an aggregate perspective, the mechanism operates
even if the volume of transactions settled with cash is very small (e.g., because most traders
opt for the credit-based settlement alternative to money). Thus, in these contexts, money
functions as a latent medium of exchange. This latency, or off-equilibrium role of money,
is distinct from the traditional medium-of-exchange function that money performs when it is
actively exchanged to overcome trading frictions, such as double-coincidence-of-wants problems,
lack of commitment, and lack of enforcement.
   The role of money as a discipline device for imperfectly competitive financial intermedi-
aries opens a novel conduit for the monetary transmission mechanism that operates through
the effect that changes in the opportunity cost of holding money have on money demand, and
ultimately on prices and allocations. We show that, unlike the traditional medium-of-exchange
role that emphasizes buyer-side incentives to carry money, the seller-side benefits of the option
of monetary exchange as safeguard against intermediary market power remains relevant even in
cashless limiting economies where credit and settlement are so developed that the transaction
velocity of money is arbitrarily large. The changes in incentives to hold money that mone-
tary policy imposes on a negligible-sized population of cash-only sellers can have nonnegligible
macroeconomic impact. The logic is that it is the money-demand behavior of the few cash-only
sellers that the larger population of sellers who use credit-based settlement threaten to mimic
in order to keep the financial intermediaries' market power in check. Because money functions
as a latent medium of exchange, changes in the value of money influence the terms of trade of
everyone with a credible option to trade for money--even those who end up choosing to settle
transactions through the intermediary rather than use money.
   A large body of work in macroeconomics rests on the premise that artificial economies
without money are well suited to study monetary policy. In fact, most of the work in modern



                                                2
monetary economics that caters to policymakers, abstracts from the usefulness of money alto-
gether: there is typically no money in the models, or if there is money, it is merely held as a
redundant asset (see, e.g., the textbook treatments of the New Keynesian model in Woodford
(2003) or Gal´
             i (2008)). What underlies this moneyless approach to monetary economics is the
received wisdom that the medium-of-exchange role of money is essentially irrelevant for the
transmission of monetary policy in the context of advanced economies whose credit-based set-
tlement mechanisms have developed sufficiently to make the inverse velocity of some monetary
aggregates very small. Our theoretical results suggest that, in general, any attempt to assess
the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy without medium-of-exchange money-demand
considerations is at best incomplete.
   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the economic environment,
presents the solution to the social planner's problem, formulates the individual optimization and
bilateral bargaining problems, and defines equilibrium. Section 3 characterizes the equilibrium
of the nonmonetary economy. Section 4 characterizes monetary equilibria: stationary (Section
4.1), dynamic (Section 4.2), and sunspots (Section 4.3). For each type of equilibrium, Section
5 derives prices and allocations in the cashless pure-credit limit. Section 6 concludes. The
appendix contains all proofs.

2. Model

2.1. Environment

Time is represented by a sequence of periods indexed by t  T  {0, 1, ...}. Each period is
divided into two subperiods where different activities take place. There are three types of
infinitely lived agents: bankers, consumers, and producers, denoted B , C , and P , respectively.
An agent of type i  {B, C, P } is identified with a point in the set Ii = [0, Ni ], with Ni  R++ .
There are two consumption goods in each period: good 1 and good 2.
   In every subperiod, each producer has a time endowment that can be used as labor input.
Each consumer also has a time endowment that can be used as labor input, but only in the
second subperiod. In the first subperiod, producers have access to a linear technology to
transform labor into good 1, which is only consumed by consumers. Production of good 1 takes
place at the beginning of the first subperiod, before agents engage in any trading activity. In
the second subperiod, consumers and producers have access to a linear production technology
to transform labor into good 2, which is consumed by all agents. Good 1 and good 2 cannot be

                                                3
stored across periods, but there is within-period storage: producers can transform every unit
of unsold inventory of beginning-of-period good 1 into   R+ units of end-of-period good 2.
    A monetary authority issues a financial security called money, which is durable and intrin-
sically useless (i.e., it is not an argument of any utility or production function, and it is not
a formal claim to goods or services). The quantity of money outstanding at the beginning of
period t is denoted Mt , with M0  R++ given, and distributed uniformly among consumers.
In the second subperiod of every period, the monetary authority injects or withdraws money
via lump-sum transfers or taxes to consumers, so that the money supply evolves according to
Mt+1 = µMt , with µ  R++ .
    In order to preserve a meaningful role for money as a medium of exchange, we assume
that from the standpoint of producers, consumers are unable to commit, so producers cannot
enforce consumers' promises (neither individually nor via collective punishment schemes). We
assume bankers are endowed with the ability to enforce and commit. In particular, a banker can
enforce a future payment promised by a consumer, and can commit to make a future payment
to a seller. This special ability to trust consumers and be trusted by producers makes bankers
well suited to act as financial intermediaries between consumers and producers. Specifically,
some consumers will issue bonds through bankers in the first subperiod of t, with each bond
representing a claim to one unit of good 2 to be delivered to bond holders through bankers in
the second subperiod of t.1
    In the second subperiod, all agents can trade good 2 and money in a spot Walrasian market.
In the first subperiod, consumers and producers may trade good 1, money, and private bonds,
while bankers can trade money and private bonds. Trade in the first subperiod is organized
as follows. Two Walrasian markets operate contemporaneously: a goods market and a bond
(interbank) market. All consumers and producers have access to the goods market where they
can trade good 1 and money competitively. All bankers have access to the bond market where
they can trade bonds and money competitively. Consumers and producers access the bond
market indirectly, by engaging in bilateral trades with bankers whom they contact at random.
Specifically, let i  [0, 1] denote the probability that an agent of type i  {C, P } contacts a
    1
      Absent bankers, there would be complete lack of enforcement: consumers would be unable to borrow, and
would have no alternative but to fund first-subperiod consumption of good 1 with money. The equations in the
following sections also admit an equivalent interpretation. Instead of assuming that bankers have the special
power to enforce and commit, one could assume consumers can themselves commit to repay, but that bond
trade must be intermediated by bankers for reasons other than limited enforcement of contracts and limited
commitment to honor them.

random banker. Once the agent and the banker have met, the pair negotiates the quantities of
bonds and money that the banker will buy or sell in the competitive bond market on behalf of
the agent, and an intermediation fee for the banker's service. The banker's fee is expressed in
terms good 2 and paid in the second subperiod. The terms of this bilateral trade are determined
by Nash bargaining, where an agent of type i  {C, P } has bargaining power i  [0, 1].
   The individual preferences of an agent of type i  {B, C, P } are represented by

                            t=0

where the expectation operator, Ei
                                 0 , is with respect to the probability measure induced by the
random trading process in the first subperiod,   (0, 1) is the discount factor, u : R+  R
is the consumer's utility function for good 1, I{·} is an indicator function that equals 1 if the
condition in the subscript is satisfied, and 0 otherwise,   R++ is the producer's marginal
(disutility) cost of producing good 1, yit is the agent's consumption (if i = C ) or production (if
i = P ) of good 1 in period t, xt is the agent's consumption of good 2 in period t, and ht is the
agent's disutility of supplying labor input ht in the second subperiod of period t. We assume
u < u(0) = 0 < u , v  v (0) = 0 < v ,  < , and that there exist x , y   R++ such that
v (x ) = 1 and u (y  ) = . For any   R+ , let d()  u -1 ().
   The following result characterizes the efficient allocation that solves the problem of a social
planner who maximizes the equally weighted sum of all agents' expected discounted utilities. Let

                                     is the individual production of good 1 in period t, x is
consumption of good 1 in period t, yP t                                                   it

i  {B, C, P } and all t.

2.2. Individual optimization, bargaining, and definition of equilibrium

We begin by describing the individual optimization problems in the second subperiod of a typical
                       g
period. Let Wti (am
                  t , at ) denote the maximum expected discounted payoff, at the beginning of
the second subperiod of period t, of an agent of type i  {B, C, P } who has am
                                                                             t  R+ units
of money and a claim to ag                           i  m
                         t  R units of good 2. Let Vt (at ) denote the maximum expected


                                                      5
discounted payoff of an agent of type i  {B, C, P } with money holding am
                                                                        t at the beginning of
the first subperiod of period t. Then

                                  g
                       Wti (am
                             t , at ) =        max                v (xt ) - ht + Vti    m
                                                                                   +1 (at+1 ) ,              (1)

where t is the real price of unit of money in terms of good 2, and Ttm  R is the time t
lump-sum monetary injection to an individual consumer. Next, consider the three individual
optimization problems that each agent type faces in the first subperiod of a typical period t.
    First, consider the portfolio problem of a banker at the end of the first subperiod of period
t, i.e., after the round of bilateral bond-market trades with consumers and producers. Let
 ^ tB (am    g
W       t , at ) denote the maximum expected discounted payoff of a banker who has money
                           g
holding am
         t and a claim to at units of good 2, as he reallocates his portfolio of money and
bonds in the bond market at the end of the first subperiod of period t (i.e., possibly after
having executed a trade on behalf of a client).2 Then

to trade bonds through a banker. This could happen either because the agent is unable to
contact a banker (an event that happens with probability 1 - C ), or contacts a banker (with
probability C ) but the negotiation breaks down. This agent's individual decision problem in
                                                                                         ~Ct (am

      In principle, the banker may be holding a nonzero bond position when reallocating his own portfolio at the
end of the first subperiod. However, as will become clear when we formulate the relevant bargaining problem, it
is without loss of generality to assume that the banker's portfolio after having provided intermediation services
is the same as the banker's beginning-of-period portfolio, which has zero bonds.

    Third, consider a producer who entered period t with money holding am

the beginning of the period, and is then unable to trade bonds through a banker in the first
subperiod. This could happen either because the producer is unable to contact a banker (an

The first constraint is the budget constraint the producer faces in the first subperiod when
able to trade simultaneously in the goods market and the bond market. The second constraint
states that the producer can at most sell the inventory of good 1 produced at the beginning
of the period. The third constraint ensures the trade is incentive compatible for the producer
(the restriction kt  R+ ensures the trade is also incentive compatible for the banker). Notice
that if the producer and the banker were unable to reach an agreement, the producer can still
trade in the goods market. Hence, the outcome (4), which determines the gain from selling of
a cash-only producer, acts as the cash-and-credit producer's outside option in his bargaining
problem with the banker.

     When considering individual decision problems, we assume 0 < t (this is without loss of generality, since it
will be true in any equilibrium).

relevant relative price of good 1 in terms of good 2 for a producer who sells good 1 in exchange
for a debt instrument, as well as for a consumer who issues a debt instrument to pay for good
1 (in an economy with or without money). The price ~ t will be the relevant relative price of
good 1 in terms of good 2 for a producer who sells good 1 for money, as well as for a consumer
who uses money to pay for good 1. In a monetary economy, let

is the time-t nominal yield to maturity of the bond with k periods until maturity. Throughout
we assume  < µ (but we consider the limiting case µ   ). Since there is a one-to-one
mapping between the growth rate of the money supply, µ, and the nominal interest rate , we
can regard  as the nominal policy rate chosen by the monetary authority.

      To see why it is the nominal interest rate implicit in the inside bond, notice that with 1 unit of money an
                     1                                1
investor can buy q    t
                        bonds, which in total yield q  t
                                                         general goods in the following subperiod, and this is equivalent
       1
to qt  dollars. Since the bond is repaid within the period, this is also a notion of real rate on these loans,
         t
                                                                                                             1
with loan and repayment measured in terms of the general good. To see this, notice that investing               dollars is
                                                                                                              t

equivalent to investing 1 unit of the general good. The  dollars allow to buy qt  bonds, which in total yield
                                                                 t                            t

(iii) The post-production trade of a producer who carries inventory yt and does not contact a
banker (i.e., (4)) is y

    To find an equilibrium of the nonmonetary economy, it suffices to find the equilibrium path
of {t }t=0 . Given this path, the rest of the equilibrium is immediate from Lemma 1. The
following result offers a characterization of equilibrium based on this relative price.

Proposition 2. Assume n < u (0), where

                                                    1

There exists a unique equilibrium, {n                                        n   n
                                    t }t=0 , of the nonmonetary economy, and t =  for all
t. The individual consumption allocation of good 1 (for consumers with access to bankers),
y
¯Cn =d(n ), satisfies

                                                    n
                                                u (¯
                                                   yC ) = n .                                              (14)

Consumers without access to bankers do not consume good 1. The individual production
                         n =      C N C n
allocation of good 1 is yP        P N P y
                                        ¯C .

    Notice that the equilibrium price satisfies  <   n , and n =  only if P P = 1.
Hence, consumption of good 1 is inefficiently low (i.e., y
                                                         ¯Cn  y  ) in the nonmonetary economy

as long as either not all producers have access to the credit market (P < 1), or bankers can




                                                      11
exert market power over the producers they transact with (P < 1).6 This inefficiency is due to
the fact that a producer must produce good 1 before the moment when he simultaneously sells
the good and negotiates with the banker. Given the constant-returns production technology, in
an equilibrium with production of good 1, a producer must expect to break even. Specifically,
when the producer makes the production decision at the beginning of the period, he anticipates
the relative price of good 1 will be some    > , which implies an expected profit equal to
n ()  Rn () -  = P P ( - ) + (1 - P P )( - ) per unit of good 1 produced. To in-
terpret this beginning-of-period pre-production expected profit, notice that if having produced,
the producer contacts a banker and has all the market power, then the per-unit profit is  - ,
but if the producer either cannot sell in the first subperiod (e.g., because he fails to contact
a banker, which happens with probability 1 - P ) or if he contacts a banker who has all the
market power (i.e., with probability P (1 - P )) then the per unit profit is  -  < 0. Hence,
as long as P P < 1, the zero-profit equilibrium condition n () = 0 requires 0 <  - , which
means an inefficient level of consumption and production of good 1. In the general equilibrium,
the market power that producers face in the financial market induces them to charge a mark-up
for good 1 (i.e., P < 1 implies n -  > 0, and n -  is decreasing in P ), even though in-
dividual producers have no market power in the market for good 1 (they are competitive price
takers in that market).

    The knife-edge case  = , which we rule out in our baseline parametrization, is one where producers' gains
from trade in the market for good 1 are always equal to zero, so there is never a gain from trade in a meeting
between a producer and a banker, which effectively is as if the banker had no market power.

    To characterize a monetary equilibrium it suffices to find {Zt , t , ~ t }t=0 . Given this path,
the nominal prices 1/t = Mt /Zt , pt = ~ t /t , qt = pt /t , t = (t - ~ t )/~ t , and the rest of
the equilibrium are immediate from Lemma 2. The full set of dynamic equilibrium conditions
is reported in Lemma 6 in the appendix. The following result characterizes the stationary
monetary equilibrium, i.e., a path {Zt , t , ~ t }t=0 such that Zt = Z , t = , and ~t = ~ for all
t. Without loss of generality, we focus on economies where good 1 is produced. Also, to simplify
and sharpen the exposition, hereafter we specialize the analysis to the case with C C = 1 (i.e.,
all consumers have access to the credit market and can borrow at the competitive rate).7 We
                                                                            pt d(t )NC

P P = 1, and both "" hold with "=" if  = 0. Hence, as long as P P < 1 and 0 < , we
     ¯C < y  , i.e., consumption of good 1 is inefficiently low in the monetary equilibrium. This
have y
inefficiency is due to the fact that a producer must produce good 1 before the moment when he
simultaneously sells it and negotiates with the banker. Given the constant-returns production
technology, in an equilibrium with production of good 1, a producer of good 1 must expect to
break even. Specifically, when the producer makes the production decision at the beginning of
the period, he anticipates the relative price of good 1 (in terms of good 2) will be ~ >  if he
sells the good for cash, and     ~ if he manages to sell it for bonds, which implies an
expected profit equal to

profit, notice that if having produced, the producer contacts a banker and has all the market

power, then the per-unit profit is  - , but if the producer either must sell for cash in the first
subperiod (e.g., because he fails to contact a banker, which happens with probability 1 - P ),
or if he contacts a banker who has all the market power (i.e., with probability P (1 - P )) then
the per unit profit is ~ - . As long as 0 < , we have ~ -  < 0, so the zero-profit equilibrium
condition m (~
             , ) = 0 requires 0 <  - , which means an inefficient level of consumption
and production of good 1. In the general equilibrium, the market power that producers face in
the financial market induces them to charge a mark-up in the market for good 1, even though
individual producers are competitive price takers in that market. In terms of comparative
                                                           ~                
statics, as long as P P  (0, 1), we have                         < 0 <       .   The equilibrium approaches the
equilibrium of the nonmonetary economy as   ¯
                                            . The equilibrium consumption allocation
converges to the efficient allocation as   0, or as P P  1. In the latter case, real balances,
Z , and inverse velocity, 1/V , approach zero.

   Proposition 4 reduces the task of finding dynamic monetary equilibria to finding a bounded
solution {zt }t=0 to the difference equation (17). The equilibrium prices {t , ~ t }t=0 and the
interest rate {t }t=0 are then obtained from (18), (19), and (20).


Corollary 1. In any dynamic monetary equilibrium, d (n ) -d(t ) < 0 < n - t for all t.

   Corollary 1 of Proposition 4 establishes that in any dynamic monetary equilibrium, con-
sumers face a relative price of good 1 (in terms of good 2) that is lower than the relative price
they would face in the equilibrium of the same economy without money. Thus, consumption of
good 1 (and therefore welfare) is higher in the economy with money than in the one without.

4.3. Sunspot equilibria

In this section we construct equilibria where prices and allocations are time-invariant functions
of a sunspot, i.e., a random variable on which agents may coordinate actions but that does not
directly affect any primitives, including endowments, preferences, and production or trading
possibilities. To simplify the exposition, we maintain the assumption  = 0 and NB = NC =
NP = C C = 1 (without loss, we focus on equilibria where only consumers hold money
between periods). In the appendix (Corollary 9), we provide the equilibrium conditions for
a set of sunspot states S = {s1 , ..., sN }, where st  S follows a Markov chain with  ij =
Pr (st+1 = si |st = sj ). In this context we describe equilibrium with time-invariant functions of
the sunspot state, i.e., for any st  S we use ~ (st ),  (st ),  (st ), and Z (st ), to denote ~ t,
t , t , and Zt , respectively. The following result characterizes a family of sunspot equilibria
that contains the nonmonetary equilibrium of Proposition 2 and the monetary equilibrium of
Proposition 3.

Proposition 5. Assume S = {s1 , s2 }, with  11    [0, 1], and  22 = 1. For any arbitrary




                                               16
  [0, 1], there exists a sunspot equilibrium characterized by
                                                  
                         ~ (s1 ) =

                                                1+
                          (s1 ) =                                
                                   1 + P P  - (1 -  ) (1 - P P )
                                   +1-
                          (s1 ) =
                                       
                         Z (s1 ) = (1 - P ) d ( (s1 )) ~ (s1 ) ,

                                                           1
~ (s2 ) = Z (s2 ) = 0, and  (s2 ) =  (s2 ) ~ (s2 ) = n    P  P   .

   For  = 0, the equilibrium described in Proposition 5 reduces to the nonmonetary equi-
librium of Proposition 2. Conversely, for  = 1, it reduces to the monetary equilibrium of
Proposition 3. By varying  from 0 to 1, we can generate a continuum of proper sunspot
equilibria that "convexify" the equilibrium set spanned by the monetary and the nonmonetary
equilibrium.

5. Cashless limit

In this section we consider the limit of the equilibrium as P  1, i.e., as the fraction of
producers without access to bankers vanishes.
   The following corollary of Proposition 2 characterizes the limit of the equilibrium of the
nonmonetary economy as P  1.

Corollary 2. Assume n < u (0), where

                                            yC ) = n .                                      (23)

   The following corollary of Proposition 3 characterizes the limit of the stationary monetary
                                                 1 -
equilibrium as P  1. Let ¯

economy converges to the pure-credit economy of the maximum nominal policy rate consistent
with existence of a stationary monetary equilibrium.

    From (24), (25) and (26), notice that if either  = 0 or P = 1, then as P  1, the
consumption allocation implemented by the monetary equilibrium converges to the Pareto
optimal allocation. From (24), we also see that as long as P < 1, the monetary policy 
affects the relative price  , which according to (25) and (26), in turn affects consumption and
output--even as Z  0 along the cashless limit. In terms of comparative statics, as long as
                    ~              
P < 1, we have           <0<          in the cashless limit. From (22) and (24),

Notice that n -   0 for all P  [0, 1] and all   [0, ¯
                                                     ), with "=" only if P = 1, so
consumption is larger in the cashless limit of the monetary economy than in the nonmonetary
economy. In other words, the allocation implemented by the cashless limit of the monetary
equilibrium coincides with the allocation implemented by the equilibrium of the nonmonetary
economy only if bankers have no market power over producers (i.e., P = 1). A monetary policy
that makes money more valuable only makes n -  larger, since it improves the producer's
outside option of trading good 1 for money, which reduces the banker's effective market power.8
A key insight to understand this result is that for all   [0, ¯
                                                               ),

     In contrast, lim¯  (     -  ) = 0 even if P < 1.That is, y

a background monetary policy rate  high enough to make the value of money sufficiently small. Intuitively, if
expected inflation is very high, monetary exchange ceases to be an effective outside option for producers in their
negotiations with banks.


                                                       18
That is, aggregate demand for money in the first subperiod converges to zero, but the individual
demand for money does not, in the sense that any individual producer who belongs to the
vanishing population of producers without access to a banker is willing to accept money in
exchange for good 1. Hence, when trading with a banker, the producer's threat to sell for cash
is credible everywhere along the cashless limit.
   The following corollary of Proposition 4 describes the cashless limit (as P  1) of the
dynamical system that characterizes any dynamic monetary equilibrium path.

   Part (i ) of Corollary 4 describes the set of conditions that characterize the "cashless limiting
path" to which the path corresponding to any given dynamic monetary equilibrium converges
as P  1. Part (ii ) establishes a key result that generalizes the main result in Corollary 3:
As long as bankers have market power against producers, i.e., P < 1, in the cashless limit of
any dynamic monetary equilibrium, consumers face a relative price of good 1 (in terms of good
2) that is lower than the relative price they would face in the equilibrium of the same economy
without money. Thus, consumption of good 1, and therefore welfare, is always strictly higher in

aggregate real money balances converge to zero, Zt  0) than in the economy without money.

   For every P  [0, 1], the set of equilibria (indexed by the sunspot probability  ) described in
Proposition 5 define an equilibrium correspondence that is continuous. The following corollary
of Proposition 5 characterizes the limit of the this equilibrium correspondence as P  1.

Corollary 5. Consider the set of monetary equilibria indexed by   [0, 1] characterized in
Proposition 5. For any given   [0, 1], as P  1,

                                    P

   This corollary formalizes the intuition that by carefully selecting among the set of (sunspot)
equilibria, there is a sense in which one can construct a monetary equilibrium whose cash-
less limit converges to the nonmonetary equilibrium. The nature of the selection, however,
involves decreasing the probability  toward zero as P approaches 1, i.e., intuitively, agent's
expectations that money will lose its value forever (purely due to self-fulfilling expectations)
must converge to 1 along with P . More formally, one could focus on the particular joint limit
on credit and beliefs, P (1 -  )  1, and in this case, even if  < 1, one would indeed find
limP (1-)1  (s1 ) = n . It is our view that this kind of approximation result based on an
arbitrary equilibrium selection from a large set of equilibria is too frail to offer a compelling
basis for a moneyless approach to monetary economics.

6. Discussion

The basic design of our model builds on Lagos and Wright (2005). The particular market
structure is similar to the one we have used in Lagos and Zhang (2015, 2019a,b), which in turn
adopts some elements from Duffie et al. (2005). In Lagos and Zhang (2019a) we study the
effects of monetary policy in the cashless limit of an economy where investors can settle equity
trades using money or margin loans that are intermediated by brokers with market power. That
model is calibrated to match the empirical estimates of the asset price responses to monetary
policy shocks, and used to obtain quantitative theoretical estimates of these responses in the
cashless limit. A key difference with Lagos and Zhang (2019a) is that here, monetary exchange


                                               20
is between buyers and sellers of a consumption good as in canonical monetary models (e.g.,
Samuelson (1958), Lucas (1980), or Lagos and Wright (2005)). In contrast with canonical
monetary models, which emphasize the usefulness of money for buyers with limited access to
credit, the baseline formulation of the model we develop here has buyers with unlimited access
to credit, and therefore highlights the usefulness of monetary exchange for sellers who need a
means to collect payment from buyers they do not trust. In this context, money is essential
only to sellers with no access to the intermediated credit-based settlement.
   Our main theoretical insight is that if the financial intermediaries who offer the credit-based
settlement have market power, then even sellers with access to credit who neither hold, wish
to hold, or choose to hold money on the equilibrium path, benefit from having the option to
use money to settle sales--even if they never exercise it. The value of this option is reflected
in equilibrium prices and allocations even as the measure of sellers with no access to credit
vanishes along the trajectory toward a cashless pure-credit economy. As a result, as aggregate
real money balances become negligible and the transaction velocity of money becomes arbitrarily
large along the cashless limit, the latent medium-of-exchange channel of monetary transmission
that operates through the opportunity cost of holding monetary assets remains operative, and
determines the relative price and the quantities produced of "cash goods" and "credit goods"--
even in the cashless limit. It would therefore be incorrect to infer that money and medium-
of-exchange considerations cannot matter quantitatively simply based on the observation that
monetary transactions account for a small share of total transactions.
   For P < 1, our theory provides counterexamples to the claims used to endorse the moneyless
approach to monetary economics. For example, Woodford (2003, p. 32) claims that the basic
model in his book "abstracts from monetary frictions, in order to focus attention on more
essential aspects of the monetary transmission mechanism...". Gal´
                                                                 i (2008, p. 10) claims that
"...there is generally no need to specify a money demand function, unless monetary policy
itself is specified in terms of a monetary aggregate, in which case a simple log-linear money
demand schedule is postulated." We have shown that unless financial intermediation is perfectly
competitive, disregarding medium-of-exchange considerations is not without loss--even in the
cashless limit or in near-cashless economies in which liquidity-saving mechanisms have developed
sufficiently to make the inverse velocity of some monetary aggregate very small. Any attempt
to assess the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy that ignores these considerations is
necessarily incomplete.

                      s.t. yCt NC = yP t NP and                  (xit - hit ) Ni = 0.
                                                     i{B,C,P }

The first-order necessary and sufficient conditions for optimization are u (yCt ) =  and v (xit ) =
                                                      NC

                                             =
                                              t       NP y ,   and xit = hit = x for all i  {B, C, P }
and all t.

   The following remark will be useful in the characterization of equilibrium.

B. Nonmonetary economy

Proof of Lemma 1. Consider a nonmonetary economy, i.e., Mt = 0 for all t. With a slight
abuse, we keep the notation for the value functions of the monetary economy, but simply omit
an agent's money holding as an argument in the relevant functions. For example, (32) becomes

                                         Wti (ag      g   ¯i

is a necessary condition for equilibrium, where n is as defined in (13). Hence the solution to
the producer's beginning of period production decision is

(36), and since  <  , we can write YP t = P NP y(t ). Thus the market-clearing condition
for the goods market can be written as XD (t ) = 0, where

                            XD (t )  C NC d (t ) - P NP y (t ) .                         (37)

For all t  [0, n ), 0 < XD (t ), so equilibrium requires n  t , which together with the
necessary condition (35), implies t = n must hold in any equilibrium. From part (ii ) of
Lemma 1, y                yCt ) = n (the solution is strictly positive since n < u (0)), and

   The following corollary of Proposition 2 characterizes the limit of the equilibrium of the

By using the variables  it and   m
                               ^ it (z ) we arrive at the definition of equilibrium in the statement
of the lemma.

   To characterize a monetary equilibrium it suffices to find {Zt , t , ~ t }t=0 , since given this
path we know the nominal prices 1/t = Mt /Zt , pt = ~ t /t , qt = pt /t , t = (t - ~ t )/~ t,
and the rest of the equilibrium is immediate from Lemma 2. The following result characterizes
the stationary monetary equilibrium, i.e., a path {Zt , t , ~ t }t=0 such that Zt = Z , t = , and
~t = ~ for all t. Without loss of generality, we focus on economies where good 1 is produced.

on whether  C = 1 -  B = 0 or  C = 1 -  B = 1, 0 <  or  = 0, and ~ <  or   ~ . But
from the previous observations we know  = 0 implies  C = 1 and  = ~ = , so there are
only five possible equilibrium configurations. Next, we consider each in turn. In every case, let

From (73) we know that the left side must be a nonnegative number, so for this condition to
be satisfied in equilibrium, the right side must be nonnegative, i.e., we must have

With (74), this inequality can be written as

From (85) we know that the left side must be a nonnegative number, so for this condition to
be satisfied in equilibrium, the right side must be nonnegative, i.e., we must have

Proof of Proposition 4. The proof builds on Corollary 8. Consider two cases. (i ) Suppose
t+1 = 0. Then (88) implies t+1 = , and then (87) implies
                                                         1
                                                 zt =      zt+1 .                                    (91)
                                                        1+
(ii ) Suppose 0 < t+1 , then (86), (89), and (90) imply zt+1 = h t+1 , where

                                               P  P
                               h t+1                  n - t+1 d t+1 .
                                             1 - P  P

                                                         43
Notice that h < 0, and
                                     h (n ) = 0 < h () = d () ,

so for every zt+1  [0, d ()], there exists a unique t+1  [, n ] given by t+1 = f (zt+1 ),
where f (zt+1 )  h-1 (zt+1 ). By substituting t+1 = f (zt+1 ) into (87), we obtain

                                       1 1 - P  P   f (zt+1 )
                              zt =                n
                                                              zt+1 .                        (92)
                                     1 +  P P  - f (zt+1 )

The condition for case (ii ) is 0 < t+1 , i.e.,

                                           1 f (zt+1 ) - 
                                  t+1 =                     > 0.
                                          P P n - f (zt+1 )

This condition is equivalent to 0 < f (zt+1 ) - , which is in turn equivalent to zt+1 < h () =
d(). Therefore, putting (91) (from case (i )) and (92) (from case (ii )) together, an equilibrium
path {zt }                                          
          t=0 must satisfy (17). Once the path {zt }t=0 that solves (17) has been found, the
equilibrium path for {t }          
                         t=0 , {t }t=0 , and {~ t }t=0 , are obtained from t = f (zt ), (88), and
(89), respectively.

Proof of Corollary 1. The key observation is that t = f (zt ) < f (0) = n for all t.
The equalities follow from (21). The inequality follows from f < 0, and the fact that in any
monetary equilibrium, 0 < zt for all t.

Proof of Corollary 4. The expressions (27)-(31) are immediate from (17)-(21). Next, we show
that zt > 0 holds for all t, i.e., that the quantity of real money balances per producer with no
access to a banker, remains strictly positive as we take the pure-credit limit (i.e., P  1) of
any dynamic monetary equilibrium. For this, it suffices to show that 0 < G (0), where for any
zt+1  R+ ,
                                           1 1 - P g zt+1

                                         1 +  P n - g zt+1 t+1
From (31),

                 g zt+1 =                                                       ,
                               P   n - g zt+1          d' g zt+1   - d g zt+1




                                                  44

                               1 +  P limzt+1 0 g zt+1

                        = -                                           1

                                                 (n    -g (zt+1 ))d'(g (zt+1 ))-d(g (zt+1 ))

                              1+
Suppose zt = 0 for some t. Then for (27) to hold, it is necessary that G zt+1 = 0, but this
is impossible since (27) and (93) imply 0 < G zt+1 for all zt+1  0. Thus 0 < zt for all t.
We conclude that t = g (zt ) < g (0) = n , where the equalities follow from (31), and the
inequality follows from the fact that g < 0 < zt for all t.


C.2.3. Sunspot equilibria

In this section we construct equilibria where prices and allocations are time-invariant functions
of a sunspot, i.e., a random variable on which agents may coordinate actions but that does not
directly affect any primitives, including endowments, preferences, and production or trading
possibilities. Specifically, let S = {s1 , ..., sN } denote the support of the sunspot, and assume
st  S follows a Markov chain,  ij = Pr (st+1 = si |st = sj ). The following corollary of Lemma
6 summarizes the conditions that characterize a recursive monetary sunspot equilibrium. For
simplicity, we assume  = 1 and NB = NC = NP = C C = 1 (and without loss, focus on
equilibria where only consumers hold money between periods).

Corollary 9. A recursive monetary sunspot equilibrium is a collection of functions of s,

                                               p                    m
