1. Introduction



        The growth in managed care in the United States is likely to have affected the delivery of

medical care.(1) These effects can occur both directly to patients enrolled in managed care plans, and

indirectly (“spillover” effects) to patients with fee-for-service insurance who reside in areas of high

managed care activity. Past studies indicate that spillover effects of managed care have occurred. Fee-

for-service patients residing in areas with high managed care activity have been shown to have lower

overall Medicare expenditures than patients residing in areas with less managed care.(2) Areas with high

managed care activity have also been shown to have lower availability and use of new technologies (3,

4) and lower overall hospital costs.(5)

        The spillover effects of managed care may occur by several mechanisms. Health care providers

who take care of patients in managed care plans will likely make treatment decisions based in part on

incentives and restrictions provided by the managed care organization. If these providers also treat fee-

for-service patients they may treat them similarly preferring to treat all patients equally, rather than

altering their care based on different methods of reimbursement. In addition, interaction between

managed care and non-managed care providers may lead to similar care for managed care and fee-for-

service patients.(6)

        Previous work has reported that acute MI patients enrolled in managed care organizations

receive care that is more in compliance with recommended therapies and process of care measures than

care for fee-for-service patients.(7, 8) We hypothesized that high levels of local managed care activity

will also affect the care of non-enrolled patients. To address this, we examined the effects of managed

care on recommended treatments for elderly fee-for-service patients with acute myocardial infarction.




                                                  3
2. Data and Methods



2.1. Patients

        We used data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project that is well described elsewhere.(9)

The Cooperative Cardiovascular Project identified nearly all Medicare fee-for service beneficiaries with

the principal-discharge ICD-9-CM diagnosis of 410.xx (acute myocardial infarction) excluding codes

410.x2 (subsequent care) for the period between February 1994 and July 1995. Research abstractors

employed by independent contractors entered demographic, history, physical exam, hospital course, in-

hospital and discharge treatment data into an electronic data base. Quality checks using random

reabstractions were performed on the resulting data.(10) Patients with age less than 65 years and those

not residing in one of 320 metropolitan statistical areas in the continental United States were excluded.



2.2. Treatment and Outcome Measures

        We used guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart

Association (11) and expert opinion to identify treatments recommended for patients with acute

myocardial infarction based on data available in 1994. We examine 8 different treatments here: aspirin

during hospitalization, aspirin at discharge, β-blocker during hospitalization, β-blocker at discharge,

reperfusion during the first 24 hours of hospitalization with thrombolysis of primary percutaneous

transluminal angioplasty (PTCA), coronary angiography during hospitalization, angiotensin converting

enzyme (ACE) inhibitor at discharge, and smoking cessation counseling at discharge. Not every patient

is a good candidate for every treatment. From the overall sample, we identified patients who were

good candidates for each treatment using the standard criteria listed in Table 1.




                                                4
        We also examined mortality rates. Mortality following admission was identified by linking

patient records to the Health Insurance Skeletonized Eligibility Write-off (HISKEW) file. Some

analyses incorporate measures of expected 30 day and 1 year mortality, which we computed using the

same variables and methods used in a previously published model of mortality in Medicare patients with

acute myocardial infarction from the CCP dataset.(13)



2.3. Managed Care Activity

        In principle, many forms of managed care organizations could bring about changes in care

patterns. Because we have data for health maintenance organizations (HMOs), we use HMO market

share as the measure of managed care activity. We expect this to be a reasonable indication of the

presence of organizations that make strong attempts to control utilization and influence provider

behavior.

        We used county-level estimates of the percentage of the population enrolled in HMOs that were

developed for previous studies using data from the Group Health Association of America and

Interstudy.(12) County level data for 1994 were combined to obtain HMO market share data for each

of 320 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) within the United States. MSAs are a common definition

of health care markets, and are frequently used in research on the effects of managed care. Managed

care (HMO) market share was classified as low (<10%), medium (10-30%) or high (>30%). Breaking

MSAs into three groups allows the relationship between treatment and managed care market share to

be non-linear, and will limit the effects of any misestimation of managed care market share.




                                                5
2.4. Statistical Analysis

        For each treatment, we computed the fraction of good candidates that received the treatment

for markets at each level of managed care market share (<10%, 10-30%, >30%). Differences

between treatment rates in markets with the different managed care levels were compared using χ2

tests. The relationship between managed care activity and use of recommended treatments for acute

MI among good candidates was examined using logistic regression that modeled the use of each

treatment (yes or no) as a function of managed care market share, area characteristics, U.S. census

division, patient demographic (age group, gender and race) admission clinical variables, and

characteristics of the hospital and physician caring for the patient. Certain characteristics of a

metropolitan statistical area may make it more or less attractive for HMOs to offer services, while at the

same time these characteristics may be associated with use of appropriate treatments. To control for

potential confounding factors we included per capita income (coded as <$15,000, $15,000 to

$19,999, $20,000 to $25,000 and >$25,000), population density (coded as <2,500, 2,500 to 4,999,

5,000-10,000 and >10,000 persons/square mile), and proportion with a college degree (coded as

<15%, 15% to 19%, 20% to 25% and > 25%) for each metropolitan statistical area. We controlled for

severity of illness using expected 30-day mortality from a previously published model that uses clinical

data available at admission.(13) We controlled for admission to a teaching hospital by using data from

the American Hospital Association in 1994. Hospitals with 20 or more full time residents were

considered teaching hospitals. We control for hospital volume by including indicators for high volume

hospitals, defined to be those with at least 50 admissions for acute myocardial infarction per year. We

include an indicator for whether the patient was cared for by a cardiologist based using HCFAs UPIN

file.




                                                 6
        Separate models were estimated for each of the eight recommended treatments. Logistic

regressions naturally produce odds rations, but because odds ratios are easily misinterpreted as relative

risks we converted the coefficients obtained from the logistic regression models to relative risks with

95% confidence intervals for comparisons between high and medium managed care areas with low

managed care areas.(14) We repeated the analyses after adjusting for the likelihood of being in an area

with high managed care market share using the propensity score method.(15)

        We investigated the relationship between HMO market share and mortality using a series of

logistic models. We first estimated a model that included only the managed care variables. We then

estimated models that added controls for severity of illness (expected 30 day mortality), hospital

characteristics, physician specialty, and area characteristics (population density, percent college

educated, per capita income and region of the United States). Finally, we wished to investigate the

effects of controlling for two treatments where high HMO market share areas have higher rates of use,

so we added variables indicating the use of aspirin and β–blockers.



3. Results



3.1. Patient characteristics

        The baseline data set used in this study contained information on 161,962 fee-for-service

elderly (age 65 years or older) Medicare patients with documented myocardial infarction. After

excluding patients that resided in rural areas, 112,900 patients remained and were used to determine

appropriate treatment and mortality. Patients residing in areas with high managed care activity (>30%

market share) were older and less likely to be in Killip class 1 on admission than patients residing in low

managed care (<10% market share) areas (Table 2). Patients residing in high and medium managed


                                                 7
care areas were more likely to be admitted to a teaching hospital than were patients residing in low

managed care areas. Areas with high and medium rates of managed care had higher per-capita incomes,

were more densely populated, and had a higher proportion college educated residents compared with

low managed care areas. Over half of the patients from the Pacific, New England, and Mountain

regions resided in high managed care areas compared to less than 5% for the four central census

regions.



3.2. Treatment Differences

           In unadjusted comparisons among patients who were good candidates for each treatment we

found that patients in high-managed care areas were more likely to be appropriately treated with β-

blockers during hospitalization than patients in low managed care areas (Table 3). Patients in high

market share areas were also more likely to receive β-blockers at discharge and for smoking cessation

counseling. In contrast, good candidates for coronary angiography or reperfusion were less likely to

undergo these procedures if they resided in high managed care areas.

           We then used a multivariate model that controlled for patient characteristics and demographic

and other characteristics of each metropolitan area. Some of these were associated with different rates

of appropriate treatment. For example, appropriate β-blocker use at discharge was greater in areas

with high per capita income areas (52% for incomes >$25,000 per year vs. 31% for incomes ≥

$15,000 per year, p<0.001), high population density (50% for >10,000 persons/square mile vs. 45%

for ≤2,500 persons/ square mile, p<0.001) a high proportion of college educated residents (49% if

>25% were college educated vs. 44% if ≤ 15% were college educated, p<0.001), and geographic area

(59% for residents of New England vs. 46% for residents from elsewhere in the United States).




                                                  8
Patients were more likely to receive β-blockers at discharge if they were admitted to a teaching (53%

vs 44%) or high volume hospital (48% vs 40%), or were cared for by a cardiologist (51% vs 43%, all

p<0.001).

        After adjusting for area-related characteristics, U.S. census division, age, gender, race, hospital

characteristics, physician specialty, and 30-day predicted mortality, some of the differences in use for

good treatment candidates persisted between high and low managed care areas (Figure 1). Compared

with patients residing in areas with low managed care activity, patients residing in high managed care

areas were more likely to receive β-blockers (16% greater use, 95% CI 7% to 24%) and aspirin (4%

greater use, 95% CI 1% to 6%) during hospitalization. These relative uses correspond to a number

needed to treat of 33 for aspirin and 13 for β-blockers, indicating that there was one additional patient

treated with aspirin for every 33 good aspirin candidates in high compared to low managed care areas,

and one more per 13 good β-blocker candidates. The difference in treatment between high and low

managed care areas persisted at discharge for β-blockers (18%, 95% CI 6% to 29%) and aspirin (5%

greater for high managed care areas, 95% CI 2% to 7%). These patterns are consistent with better

treatment in higher managed care areas.

        We found no significant differences in the use of reperfusion, angiography, smoking cessation

counseling at discharge, or ACE inhibitor use at discharge. Nonetheless, some of the trends we

observed in the data suggest continued attention. In particular, we observed almost statistically

significant lower use of angiography among good candidates (recurrent ischemia or shock) in high

managed care areas (-7%, 95% CI 1% to –14%). This lower use is equivalent to one less angiogram

performed for every 31 patients that were good candidates for angiography. Among all patients, high

managed care areas used significantly less angiography (-6%, 95% CI –2% to –10%). Results for




                                                9
reperfusion also suggest less use in high managed care areas, while the results for smoking cessation

counseling suggest improved care with increases in HMO market share.

        If HMO market share is correlated with other area characteristics, our results could be biased.

One method of adjusting for confounding in the estimates of the effect of HMOs is the use of propensity

scoring. For each patient, we computed the propensity for residing in a high managed care area, and

then included this propensity score in the model as a way of adjusting for potential confounding. Similar

results were observed. After adjustment for propensity to reside in a high managed care area, the

greater relative use of treatments persisted for high managed care compared to low managed care areas

for β-blockers during hospitalization (16%, 95% CI: 8% to 23%), β-blockers at discharge (17%, 95%

CI: 7% to 26%), and aspirin during hospitalization (2%, CI: 0% to 4%). Differences in coronary

angiography use for patients with recurrent angina or shock were slightly larger with the propensity

score adjustment (9% lower use in high relative to low managed care areas; 95% CI 2% to 15%).



3.3. Mortality Differences

        Mortality at 30 days among all patients in the sample was 18.6%. Unadjusted 30-day mortality

was slightly lower for patients residing in high (18.0%) and medium (18.5%) managed care areas

compared to patients in low-managed care areas (19.6%, p<0.0001). Mean expected 30-day

mortality using clinical data at admission (13), however, was higher for patients from high (19.3 ±

17.5%) than for medium (18.9 ± 17.7%) or low (18.3 ± 18.0%) managed care areas (p<0.0001).

        Figure 2 plots results from a series of models of mortality rates. The first two points are the

relative risk for high and medium market share areas from a model that uses only HMO market share

controls. Here, patients in high HMO market share areas have relative risk of mortality about 8 points

lower than those in the lowest market share areas. Relative survival differences increase after

adjustment for clinical characteristics at admission and persist after controlling for hospital characteristics

and physician specialty. But, when region of the U.S. and area characteristics (population density, %

with college education, per capita income) are included, the differences in mortality between high and

low market share areas are not longer evident (relative risk 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.10).



4. Discussion

        This analysis of elderly Medicare beneficiaries with fee-for-service insurance found differences

in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction according to the level of managed care market share.

Fee-for-service patients residing in areas with high managed care market share were more likely to be

appropriately treated with aspirin and β-blockers, consistent with better care. On the other hand, these

patients were (almost significantly) less likely to receive appropriate coronary angiography than were

patients residing in areas with low managed care market share. We found no strong differences in the

use of reperfusion at 24 hours, smoking cessation counseling at discharge, and ACE inhibitor use at

discharge.

        The differences in aspirin, β-blockers, and angiography among fee-for-service patients suggest

that the presence of managed care can have widespread effects on area treatment patterns and the

quality of care, sufficient to influence care for patients not enrolled in managed care plans. These results

are consistent with other studies that suggest that managed care can have broad effects on care delivery.

High levels of managed care have been associated with lower health care expenditures for fee-for-

service patients. In a recent study of fee-for-service Medicare patients, for example, an increase in the

managed care market share of 10% to 20% was associated with a 2% decrease in Part A fee-for-

service expenditures and a 1.5% decrease in Part B fee-for-service expenditures.(2) But, these studies




                                                 11
have not been clear about the ability of managed care to influence treatment patterns specifically, or

about the quality implications of any managed-care induced changes in treatments.

        There are several mechanisms by which managed care activity could influence the care of

patients with fee-for-service insurance. First, managed care could alter the availability of services such

as coronary angiography laboratories. If an increase in managed care activity reduced the number of

available laboratories, the overall use of angiography could decline regardless of the patient’s insurance

status. Past studies have demonstrated that increases in HMO market share are associated with

reductions in the availability of costly medical services (3, 4, 16) and changes in the number and type of

practicing physicians.(17)

        Managed care may also influence the care of fee-for-service patients by influencing physician

practice patterns. Many physicians treat both managed care and fee-for-service patients. In a survey

from 1996, managed care enrollees comprised 25% (median) of active patients treated by U.S.

physicians that had at least 1 managed care contract.(18) Physicians may find it difficult or undesirable

to vary their treatment patterns for different patients. As managed care grows and exerts more and

more influence over physician practices, even fee-for-service patients may be treated differently.

Physicians who have only fee-for-service patients may be indirectly influenced by managed care activity

if they adopt the practice patterns of other local physicians.(6)

        Managed care organizations have incentives to improve guideline compliance among physicians

and hospital personnel. One popular measure of the quality of managed care organizations is the Health

Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) developed by the National Committee for Quality

Assurance.(19, 20) The measures from HEDIS are used to aid employers in choosing health plans for

their employees. One of the new HEDIS measures (instituted after the data for our study was

collected) is the fraction of patients discharged on a β-blocker following acute myocardial infarction. In


                                                 12
a recent survey of managed care physician groups, 85% had instituted methods to improve guideline

compliance.(21)

        Our findings of managed care effects on treatment of fee-for-service patients are consistent with

past retrospective studies that directly compared patients in HMOs with those in fee-for-service for the

treatment of acute coronary syndromes. In an analysis of Medicare beneficiaries with acute myocardial

infarction from Minnesota, patients with managed care insurance received more appropriate aspirin

therapy (88% vs. 83% p=0.03) than those with fee-for-service insurance.(7) In a review by the RAND

Corporation, Medicare patients with acute myocardial infarction in three HMOs were compared to a

fee-for-service sample using process of care measures developed by an expert panel.(8) There was

greater compliance with process of care measures of the provider’s clinical assessment and treatment

for the HMO patients. However, fee-for-service patients received more appropriate procedures and

diagnostic tests. Similar findings were noted in a report of patients from the Global Unstable Angina

Registry and Treatment Evaluation (GUARANTEE) study.(22) Patients in HMO’s were 10% more

likely to be discharged on aspirin, and 14% more likely to be discharged on β-blockers (relative risk

1.14), while fee-for-service patients were more likely to receive angiography.

        A previous report of patients with acute coronary syndromes did not find a difference in survival

between Medicare patients with fee-for-service and those with managed care insurance. (22) Our

study, perhaps because of its large size, found a small difference in mortality favoring areas with high

managed care market share when no adjustments were made for clinical, hospital or area

characteristics. Because patients from high managed care areas were more ill on admission than patients

from low managed care areas adjustment for clinical variables increased the survival difference between

high and low managed care areas. Patients in high managed care areas were more likely to be admitted

to a teaching hospital, which have been shown to have better outcomes for patients in general, (23,24)


                                                13
and acute MI in particular, (25) when compared with non-teaching hospitals. Both admission to a high

volume hospital (26) and management by a cardiologist (27) have been associated with better survival

following acute myocardial infarction in studies using the same datasets as in our analysis. However,

adjustment for hospital characteristics and specialty of treating physician did not alter the relationship

between high managed care areas and survival. Past studies have documented regional differences in

mortality for acute myocardial infarction. (28) Our study also found that community characteristics

consistent with high socioeconomic status (e.g. per capita income) were associated with both more

managed care penetration and improved survival. After controlling for these area characteristics and the

region of the U.S., the differences in survival between high and low managed care areas were no longer

apparent.

        This study has several important limitations. Because the detailed clinical data used for this

study were from a single time period (1994-1995) we are unable to prove that a change in the level of

managed care market share changes the care of fee-for-service patients. Such a study would require

several observations over time that are of similar detail to the measures in the Cooperative

Cardiovascular Project. Because the metropolitan statistical areas are not randomized to different levels

of managed care activity it is possible that certain unmeasured area-related variables have confounded

the results.

        In summary, our study found that Medicare beneficiaries with fee-for-service insurance and who

resided in areas with high managed care activity were more likely to receive appropriate aspirin and β-

blockers, and less likely to receive appropriate coronary angiography following admission for

myocardial infarction than were patients residing in areas with low managed care activity. These results

suggest that effects of managed care are not limited to patients enrolled in managed care plans.

 The adjusted relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for the use of recommended treatments in good
 candidates are displayed for high and medium managed care (HMO) market share areas relative to low managed
 care market share areas. Values greater than 1.0 indicate greater use of therapies. The relative risks have been
 adjusted for age, gender, race, per-capita income, population density, mean education level, hospital
 characteristics, physician specialty, census region of the United States, and severity of illness. (13)

The relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for death at 30 days are shown for patients from high and medium
managed care (HMO) market share areas compared to low managed care areas. Values greater than 1.0 indicate
higher mortality. The unadjusted risk of death is lowest in high managed care areas. After adjustment for severity of
illness (13) the differences increase and persist after including hospital and physician characteristics. When area
characteristics are included (region, population density, % with college education, per capita income) the differences
are no longer apparent. The c statistics (measures of area under the receiver operating curve) for the five models are
0.51 (no adjustment), 0.76 (+severity of illness), 0.76 (+ hospital characteristics), 0.76 (+physician characteristics),
and 0.77 (+ area characteristics).
