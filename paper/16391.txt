                                              ABSTRACT

Over the past decades, the steel industry has been protected by a wide variety of trade policies, both
tariff- and quota-based. We exploit this extensive heterogeneity in trade protection to examine the
well-established theoretical literature predicting nonequivalent effects of tariffs and quotas on domestic
firms’ market power. Robust to a variety of empirical specifications with U.S. Census data on the population
of U.S. steel plants from 1967-2002, we find evidence for significant market power effects for binding
quota-based protection, but not for tariff-based protection. There is only weak evidence that antidumping
protection increases market power.

1. Introduction

         An extensive literature dating back to at least Bhagwati (1965) demonstrates that tariffs

and quotas that limit imports in an identical way may have nonequivalent effects on economic

behavior and outcomes. One of the most well-known examples of this nonequivalence is that

tariffs and quotas can have quite different effects on the degree of market power exercised by

domestic and foreign firms. This result was demonstrated by Harris (1985) and Krishna (1989) in

oligopoly settings where a foreign firm and a domestic firm compete for the domestic market.

The key result is that the strict quantitative limit set by a quota restricts the foreign firm’s best

response in a systematic way that facilitates collusive pricing by the firms, therefore raising

prices, market power and profits. In contrast, tariffs do not impose any binding constraints on

prices and quantities and, thus, have no predicted effects on market power.

         Despite this theoretical literature establishing the nonequivalent market-power effects of

quotas vis-à-vis tariffs, there has been virtually no work to examine this hypothesis empirically.1

A number of studies, including Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1999) and Goldberg and Verboven

(2001), have estimated significant market impacts of quantitative restrictions on exports of

automobiles in U.S. and European markets, but they do not examine whether tariffs have

equivalent effects. Winkelmann and Winkelmann (1998) use the experience of a large trade

protection liberalization event in New Zealand to estimate significant negative terms-of-trade

effects to New Zealand for products that were formerly protected by quotas, but no such effects

for those that were tariff-protected. However, since the authors do not have cost data and identify

estimates from primarily cross-sectional variation, it is difficult to connect their results to market

power effects. Kim (2000) estimates the impact of trade protection programs on productivity,


1
  A predecessor paper to this one by a subset of the authors (Blonigen, Liebman and Wilson, 2007) also considers
these issues, but with industry-level data that does not allow the precision and robustness of this paper’s results using
highly detailed plant-level data.
                                                            1
market power, and scale efficiency for the Korean industrial sectors from 1966 through 1988.

The analysis finds that quotas have a statistically significant impact on market power, whereas

price-based forms of protection do not, but cannot conclude that their impacts are different due to

the size of the standard errors.

         In this paper, we directly examine the hypothesis of nonequivalent market-power effects

of quotas and tariffs using a detailed panel of US steel plants and a control group of non-ferrous

metal plants from 1967 through 2002. The US steel industry has been the recipient of practically

every form of trade protection over this time period (see Table 1 for a timeline of events). In fact,

the steel industry accounts for over one-third of the over 1400 US AD and CVD cases since 1980,

and steel is one of only a few high-profile industries that have enjoyed quotas or safeguard

remedies. In addition, there has been significant heterogeneity in trade protection across various

steel products and at different points in time, providing a rich variation to identify our estimates.

Our plant-level data includes detailed measures of inputs, production, and prices, allowing us to

use well-established techniques to estimate market power for the population of U.S. steel-makers,

and the panel nature of the data allow us to control for unobserved plant-level fixed effects. We

are also careful to account for the potential endogeneity of trade protection and market power.

         While a primary focus of our analysis is the difference in market-power effects of tariffs

and quotas, our data allow us to also estimate market-power effects of a variety of other trade

protection programs, including antidumping (AD) duties and countervailing duties (CVD).2


2
  There is a literature that has analyzed the impacts of various trade protection programs in the steel industry, though
the frequent focus is to analyze just one type of trade protection program, rather than compare effects across trade
protection programs. Crandall (1981) and Canto (1984) examine the effect of the US VRAs from 1969-1974, finding
that these VRAs had only a very modest effect in raising import prices for US steel firms. Lenway, Rehbein and
Starks (1990) and Lenway, Morck, and Yeung (1996) provide event study analysis evidence that steel firms’
profitability was increased by the announcement of voluntary restraint agreements (VRAs) in 1982 and 1984. More
recently, Chung (1998) finds that AD and CVD duties from 1982 through 1993 had only modest impacts on import
penetration, while Bown (2004) and Durling and Prusa (2006) find that AD and safeguards significantly decrease
trade in targeted products. Liebman (2006) finds little evidence that the 2002-2003 safeguard actions affected US
steel prices. In addition to the literature cited that uses econometric techniques to evaluate trade policies ex post, there
is also a significant literature that examines these policies with computable general (or partial) equilibrium models,
                                                             2
Staiger and Wolak (1989), Prusa (1994), and Veugelers and Vandenbussche (1999) provide

models that indicate that the structure of AD investigations and duty determination can facilitate

collusion amongst domestic and foreign firms serving a domestic market and, thus, also raise

market power of these firms. Konings and Vandenbussche (2005) analyze a firm-level data set of

European firms who petitioned and received AD protection in the 1990s and find that there was a

significant increase in market power of firms after the imposition of AD duties. Similarly, Pierce

(2010) finds that U.S. manufacturing plants responded to antidumping duties by increasing prices

and markups. In contrast, Nieberding (1999) examines whether the withdrawal of 1982 US AD

cases against imported steel affected market power for three large US steel producers and finds

only mixed evidence for any positive effects.

        We are unaware of any theoretical models that suggest CVDs would increase market

power. CVDs are designed to countervail subsidization by a foreign government and, therefore,

the calculation of the CVD is unaffected by firm behavior. In contrast, the calculation of AD

duties are directly affected by foreign firm pricing behavior, and it is these well known rules by

which AD duties adjust to foreign firm pricing that allows the domestic and foreign firms to

potentially coordinate collusive pricing. Given this, we propose a second related nonequivalence

hypothesis that AD duties increase market power of domestic firms, whereas CVDs do not. Our

analysis will be able to directly examine whether there are any differential market-power effects

of AD duties and CVDs, as well as the extent to which these trade protection programs differ in

their effects from tariffs and quotas.

        Unlike AD or CVD duties, which are country and even firm-specific, safeguard tariffs

provide protection across a wide array of import sources and are applied uniformly against

foreign firms in targeted countries. Thus, individual foreign firms have little incentive to alter


including de Melo and Tarr (1990) and many US federal government agency reports. These studies also typically
                                                       3
their pricing behavior in order to reduce their tariffs, as contrasted with the previously discussed

dynamics that may arise with foreign firms facing AD duties. Thus, our expectation is that

safeguard tariffs will not have an effect on markups.

         Our paper’s econometric results provide a number of important results. First, we find

significant support for nonequivalent effects of quotas and tariffs as theory would suggest. The

various forms of tariff-based protection programs (ad valorem tariffs, CVD duties, and safeguard

tariffs) show no evidence of positive market power effects, while quantitative restrictions in the

form of voluntary restraints agreements (VRAs) in our sample (when binding) are associated with

increases in market power that are both statistically and economically significant. The evidence

suggests that the significant market power effects associated with quotas are similar for both types

of steel production plants (minimill and integrated), but do not exist for steel processing plants

where broad-based quota programs affected not only their final product, but also their purchased

primary steel inputs. The evidence for a market power effect of AD duties is less conclusive. We

estimate a significant positive effect of AD duties using one of the two main methods by which

we estimate market power effects, but not when using the other method.

         The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we briefly describe

the US steel industry and its substantial history of trade protection. Section 3 describes our

empirical methodology and data, section 4 presents our empirical results, and section 5 concludes.

2. US Steel Industry and Its History of Trade Policies

2.1. US Steel Producers

           The US steel industry is composed of two major types of producers: integrated mills and

mini-mills. Integrated mills use large blast furnaces to make pig iron from iron and coke, which

is then melted into raw steel in basic oxygen furnaces. Until recently, integrated mills accounted

for the majority of steel production in the United States. Integrated mills often include on-site or

nearby finishing and rolling mills that further finish the semi-finished steel forms, such as ingots,

slabs, and billets, into finished products, such as bars and sheets. Over time, a process of

“continuous casting”, whereby molten steel is formed directly into finished products has spread

throughout the industry. Examples of integrated steel companies include US Steel and Bethlehem

Steel.

         The past three decades have also seen an ever-increasing share of steel production due to

mini-mill steel plants which melt recycled steel scrap with electric arc furnaces (EAFs) into raw

steel and steel products.3 There are a number of cost efficiencies possible from mini-mill

production, particularly in the much smaller plant size and hence, capital costs, required for an

EAF. Historically, mini-mill producers have primarily produced lower-quality steel products,

such as wire rods and steel bar products, because of the greater impurities in steel made from

recycled scrap steel, rather than iron ore. However, over time, technologies have been developed

that have begun to allow mini-mill producers to break into higher-quality steel markets, such as

plate and sheet products. While Nucor is the well-known example of a mini-mill-based steel

company, there are scores of smaller mini-mill steel plants across the United States.

         In addition to these steel producing plants, there are also steel processing plants that

produce many of the same basic steel products as the integrated and minimill plants using




                                                    5
purchased steel. Steel processors differ substantially from integrated and minimill plants,

however, in that they do not produce raw steel and instead purchase it from steelmaking plants for

use as their primary input. Products that are made at steel processors include steel pipes and

tubes, as well as wire and related wire products.

        Since trade policies do not discriminate on the type of plant producing these products, we

include all three types of steel plants in our analysis. However, there are certainly economic

reasons to suggest that the effect of trade policies may differ across these types of plants. This is

particularly true of the processors, since steel trade policies may not only raise import protection

on their final good, but also their main input. After presenting full sample results, we will also

explore heterogeneity in trade policy impacts across these three types of steel plants.



2.2. Brief History of US Steel Trade Policies

        Prior to the 1960s, the US steel industry was far more concerned with fending off anti-

trust charges than securing trade relief from the federal government.4 A string of factors, however,

led to the industry’s permanent shift from dominant world exporter to net importer.5

In reaction to pressure from the large, integrated steel producers and the United Steel Workers

Union (USW), President Johnson negotiated the industry’s first VRA with Japan and the

European Community (EC) in 1969. While the VRA expired in 1974, a surge of imports in 1977

led to renewed calls for quantitative restrictions as well as AD and CVD petitions. In order to

avoid either outcome, President Carter implemented the Trigger Price Mechanism (TPM), which


3
  Data from various issues of the American Iron and Steel Institute’s Annual Statistical Yearbook show that percent of
US domestic steel produced by using EAFs has increased from about 15% in 1970 to around 50% today.
4
  This confrontation even led to President Truman’s unsuccessful attempt to nationalize the industry in 1952.
5
  These factors included: 1) a crippling strike in 1959 that required downstream users to seek non-domestic sources,
2) increasingly efficient, subsidized European and Japanese operations, 3) the discovery of large iron ore deposits
outside the US, and 4) a strong dollar. As such, between 1960 and 1968, US import penetration climbed from 4.7
percent to 16.7 percent of total US steel consumption. See Moore (1996) for a more detailed discussion of the history
of steel trade protection in the US through the early 1990s.
                                                          6
was implemented in 1978. Under the TPM the domestic industry agreed to refrain from filing AD

and CVD petitions as long as import prices did not fall below Japanese production costs (the

world’s lowest-cost industry) plus an 8 percent profit margin.

        The TPM was renewed in 1980, but the industry was convinced that the policy was failing

to provide sufficient protection from subsidized European imports and began filing petitions for

AD and CVD protection in January of 1982 which terminated the TPM program. In order to

avoid trade frictions that would result from significant AD and CVDs, President Reagan

negotiated VRA agreements across a wide range of steel products with the EC in October of

1982.

        Although European steel imports were not permitted to exceed 5.5 percent of the US

market, overall import penetration remained high due to a strong dollar and import diversions to

non-EC sources. This likely contributed to the industry filing a large set of AD and CVD

petitions in early 1984 and ultimately filing a safeguard petition (historically known as a Section

201 Escape Clause action in the US) in 1984. These trade protection actions led to the

negotiation of a comprehensive VRA for all finished steel products and limiting total import

market share to 18.4 percent in the last couple months of 1984. The VRAs were put into place for

a roughly five-year period to end in October of 1989.

        In late 1989, citing the industry’s strong performance, President George H. Bush decided

to renew the VRAs for only two-and-a-half additional years, rather than the full five years

requested by the industry. When the VRAs ended in early 1992, the steel industry immediately

filed a large number of AD and CVD petitions once again. While many industry observers

expected intervention by the administration, President Bush instead allowed the cases to reach

their completion. In July of 1993, affirmative AD and CVD determinations were ruled in favor of

the domestic industry in only about a half of the value of imports under review. In several

                                                 7
instances, competition from mini-mills, rather than imports, were seen as the real cause of injury

by the US International Trade Commission. The ruling was perceived as a major defeat for the

industry and was cited by Moore (1996) as an indication of the industry’s loss of political clout.

          Through the rest of the 1990s, steel producers used AD and CVD actions targeted at a

limited number of specific products to secure trade relief. One possible reason for such limited

action was the strong economy and modernized US operations. For the first time in decades,

integrated producers were globally competitive, touted by some experts as an industry that had

survived its austere, rationalization period and which was now enjoying a much-deserved

“renaissance.” (Ahlbrandt, Fruehan, and Giarratani, 1996)

          A string of unexpected shocks in 1998 brought this period quickly to an end. Most

notable were currency crises in East Asia and Russia which led to import surges and subsequent

AD and CVD filings in the late 1990s. By the early 2000s, about one-third of the industry had

fallen into bankruptcy, leading President George W. Bush to implement safeguard tariffs ranging

from 8-30% on many major steel products in 2002. However, a number of major import sources

were excluded including Canada and Mexico, as well as less-developed countries. Moreover,

downstream industries successfully lobbied for exceptions over the ensuing safeguard period

further watering down the amount of affected imports. Finally, the safeguard tariffs were

terminated prematurely in early 2004 due to a WTO dispute panel ruling against the US safeguard

action.

3. Methodology and Data

3.1. Empirical Specification

         Our focus in this paper is on the ability of US steel plants to price above marginal cost and

how this ability varies with trade policy changes.6 There are a couple standard ways in which the

previous literature estimates market power using plant- or firm-level data (see Tybout, 2003) and

we employ both of them here.

         The first method stems back to Hall (1988), which was then extended by Roeger (1995) to

overcome an endogeneity issue. Konings and Vandenbussche (2005) use this Roeger

methodology in their estimation of the effect of AD duties on mark-ups and we use their notation

here to sketch out the model and resulting estimating equation.

         Assume that each plant i producing product j in year t has a production function,

F ( N ijt , K ijt , M ijt ), that is linear homogeneous in three factors – labor ( N ijt ), capital ( K ijt ), and

materials ( M ijt ) – and that output ( Qijt ) for a plant is given by

                                                      Qijt  ijt F ( N ijt , K ijt , M ijt ),                                                (1)

where ijt is a plant- and year-specific productivity shock.

         From this set-up, Hall (1988) derives the Solow residual for plant i in product j in year t

( SRijt ) as

          SRijt  Qˆ ijt   N ijt Nˆ ijt   M ijt Mˆ ijt  (1   N ijt   M ijt ) Kˆ ijt   ijt (Qˆ ijt  Kˆ ijt )  (1   ijt )
                                                                                                                                      ˆ ,
                                                                                                                                        ijt   (2)

where the cavats denote growth rates, ’s are the associated factor shares of total revenues, and

 ijt  1  (1 / ijt ) . The variable ijt  Pijt / cijt , where Pijt is the price and cijt is the marginal cost,

and thus measures the price-cost markup for plant i in product j in year t. As in Hall (1988), one


6
 While the theory also suggests that trade policy may affect foreign firms’ market power, we do not examine this
because we do not have the data to do so.
                                                                         9
can estimate equation (2), though much care needs to be taken to control for potential

endogeneity, as the productivity shock term may be at least partly composed of anticipated shocks

that affect the plant’s choice of inputs.

          Due to the difficulty of finding appropriate instruments to control for this endogeneity

issue, Roeger (1995) derives an equation to estimate the markup that is free from this source of

endogeneity. The methodology is to simply derive a dual Solow residual and difference the

primal and dual expressions for the Solow residual to eliminate the common productivity shock

term in each. In particular, the dual Solow residual ( DSRijt ) can be derived as

     DSRijt   N ijt PˆN ijt   M ijt PˆM ijt  (1   N ijt   M ijt ) Rˆijt  Pˆijt    ijt ( Pˆijt  Rˆijt )  (1   ijt )
                                                                                                                                   ˆ ,
                                                                                                                                     ijt   (3)

where PM ijt , PN ijt , and Rijt are the factor prices for materials, labor, and capital, respectively.

Differencing equations (2) and (3) and re-arranging yields

                                                                                                               ˆ  Pˆ  (Kˆ  Rˆ )]), (4)
(Qˆ ijt  Pˆijt )  (Kˆ ijt  Rˆ ijt )  ijt { N ijt [(Nˆ ijt  PˆN ijt )  (Kˆ ijt  Rˆ ijt )]   M ijt [( M ijt M ijt ijt  ijt



This equation can easily be estimated using our plant-level data and has a number of nice

properties. First, the productivity shock term has been differenced away and, thus, is no longer a

source of endogeneity bias. Second, assuming a mean-zero error term, it is easily interpretable as

the regression of sales growth on weighted factor expenditure growth after netting out capital

expenditure growth from both sides, with the regression coefficient a direct estimate of the price-

cost markup.

          Our hypotheses in this paper concern the differential impacts that trade protection policies

imposed on foreign competitors of the plants in our sample can have on a plant’s ability to price

above marginal cost. To empirically examine this, we propose a varying-coefficients model

where the estimated markup parameter in equation (4) is a function of an intercept and a linear

combination of K product-specific trade policies ( TPjtk ),

                                                                        10
                                                  K
                                     jt   0    k TPjtk ,                                          (5)
                                                 k 1



where the ’s are parameters to be estimated. Given our earlier discussions, we would expect

both quotas and AD duties to significantly increase the markup parameter,  jt , while tariffs and

CVDs have no significant effect. An important feature of the theoretical analysis proposing

nonequivalence between tariffs and quota is that these types of protection programs have different

effects on market power for the same level of import penetration. Thus, we also include an

import penetration measure ( IM jt ) on the right-hand side of equation (5) so that we can estimate

the impact of various trade protection programs on markups controlling for the level of import

penetration.7 We expect the coefficient on import penetration to be negative. An additional

variable that we add to the right-hand side of equation (5) is a measure of downstream demand

growth ( GR jt ). Gallet (1997) finds that markups in the steel industry can vary with the business

cycle and Konings and Vandenbussche (2005) also finds this is an important control variable for

their estimation. We also include the product’s Herfindahl index of market concentration ( HI jt )

as a control variable, since market structure will affect competitiveness and, hence, markups.

Finally, we include a plant’s capital intensity ( KI ijt ), as it is typically included (especially in what

we call the PCM estimation approach described below) as a control in past studies.

        Denoting the left-hand side of equation (4) as Yijt , the term in brackets on the right-hand

side of equation (4) as X ijt , a mean-zero error term as ijt , and incorporating our varying

coefficients modeling of the effects of trade policies, import penetration, downstream demand

growth, Herfindahl index and capital intensity, we obtain the final Roeger-style estimating

equation that we will take to the data:




                                                        11

                                     k 3 ( HI jt  X ijt )   k 4 ( KI ijt  X ijt )   i   ijt .

The estimated parameter, 0 , provides a baseline estimate of the price-cost markup by plants in

our sample, while the other estimated  parameters measure how much these other variables

(trade policies, import penetration, downstream demand growth, and Herfindahl index) increase

or decrease a plant’s baseline markup. We also include plant-level fixed effects, i .

         One limitation of the Roeger derivation is an assumption of constant returns to scale.

Klette (1999) provides an extension to the approach of Hall and Roeger to relax this assumption.

However, when we implement Klette’s specification with our sample, our estimates cannot reject

constant returns to scale. Thus, we follow the simpler Roeger specification for our analysis.

         An alternative specification to the Roeger approach to estimate the effect of various

factors on a firm’s or plant’s markup (and perhaps even more common in the literature) is to

simply construct a proxy for the markup using observable accounting data and regress this on

explanatory factors. Following previous studies we construct the price-cost markup proxy

( PCM ijt ) as total revenues minus variable costs over sales and estimate the following PCM

regression equation8:

                            K
        PCM ijt   0    k TPijtk   k 1 IM jt   k 2GR jt   k 3 HI jt   k 4 KI ijt   i   ijt          (7)
                           k 1



where i are estimated plant-level fixed effects and  ijt is an assumed mean-zero error term.

         For both the Roeger and PCM specifications, endogeneity of trade policies is a concern.

One obvious source of endogeneity is the increased propensity of firms to lobby or petition for

  There is a related literature that looks at imports as “market discipline,” in that greater import penetration likely
correlates with a more competitive market, lower markups for all firms/plants (e.g., see Kee and Hoekman, 2007).

trade relief when facing a degradation of their markups. This would bias us from identifying a

positive effect of trade policies on markups. After presenting our base estimates below, we then

provide instrumental-variables (IV) estimates where we employ a number of instruments to

control for the potential endogeneity of our trade policy variables. These instruments include lags

of all our trade policy variables and exogenous control variables. We also include a dummy

variable for any year prior to the completion of the Uruguay Round, after which quota-based trade

protection programs were essentially eliminated for use by member countries, as well as

interactions of this variable with our lagged variables as instruments. Finally, we include a

dummy variable for years after the conclusion of a major General Agreement on Tariffs and

Trade (GATT) round, when specific trade protection reductions were being phased in, as well as

interactions with our lagged variables. Years after GATT rounds lead to mandated decreases in

some of the trade protection programs, but may then create increased demand for trade protection

programs not covered by the recent GATT round.



3.2. Variables and Data

         We rely on the U.S. Census Bureau’s Census of Manufactures (CM) for the data used in

this analysis. The CM is conducted every five years and collects plant-level data for all U.S.

manufacturers9 including the total value of shipments, book value of capital, raw material usage

and employment. In addition, the CM tracks the full set of products produced by each plant,

which allows us to identify the plants producing steel products that received trade protection. Our

panel dataset includes CM data from 1967, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997 and 2002.




9
  The CM collects limited data for small manufacturers, which are referred to as “administrative records.” Because
output and input data may be imputed for these plants, however, they are excluded from this analysis, as is standard
in research utilizing the CM.
                                                         13
       Our sample consists of two main groups of plants. The first is our focus group of U.S.

steel plants producing products in SIC 331 (Steel Works, Blast Furnaces, and Rolling and

Finishing Mills). A few of the steel wire-related products also have associated SIC 349

(Miscellaneous Fabricated Steel Products) product codes when the product is produced by a steel

processor, rather than a steel-producing plant. For example, wire cloth produced by a steel-

producing plant is coded as SIC 33157, whereas wire cloth produced by a steel-processor plant is

coded as SIC 34964. This distinction is what allows us to identify steel processors from steel

producers in our data.

       The second group of observations is plants producing non-ferrous metal and primary

products listed under SIC categories 333, 334, and 335 (Primary Nonferrous Metal, Secondary

Nonferrous Metal, and Nonferrous Rolling and Drawing, respectively). These non-ferrous metal

producing plants are included to serve as a control group. The level of trade protection activity in

these products is quite minimal relative to the steel (i.e., ferrous) metal industries, yet they have

analogous product categories and production processes as the steel plants in SIC 331. Having a

control group is particularly important with respect to the VRA trade policies where virtually all

of the steel categories fell under a VRA, making it problematic to identify the effect of the VRA

on steel plants from an unobserved year effect. While using the full CM as a control group might

provide an interesting robustness check, data availability and collection difficulties make this

infeasible.

        We then match trade policy and other control variables to the plants’ 5-digit SIC product

codes within the SIC three-digit categories 331, 333, 334, and 335. There are five different types

of protection programs that were applied to steel products in our database over our sample period.

The first program we examine is standard ad valorem tariffs ( Tariff jt ), which were in place for

the majority of the sample, though some had fallen to zero by the last year of the sample. The

                                                  14
relevant data were collected from the NBER Trade Database (www.nber.org/data/) and tariff

duties were calculated by dividing duties collected by the customs value of the imports for the

associated product codes.10 Tariffs by import product codes (Tariff Schedule of the United States

of Annotated (TSUSA) or Harmonized System (HS)) were aggregated to five-digit SIC (SIC5)

categories using concordances in various issues of Current Industrial Reports: Steel Mill

Products, published by the U.S. Census Bureau of the U.S. Department of Commerce.

        Second, are voluntary restraint agreements or quotas ( VRA jt ), which happened over two

distinct periods. The first was from 1969 through 1974, which were placed on all steel products,

including steel pipes and tubes. Only one year of our sample is during this period, 1972, and, thus,

we create a “1” for any product subject to a VRA in 1972 and a “0” otherwise. The second VRA

period on steel products was in effect from the end of 1984 to early 1992.11 Again, only one year

of our sample fully overlaps with this period, 1987, and, thus, we create a “1” for any product

subject to a VRA in 1987 and a “0” otherwise. A key condition for nonequivalence between

tariffs and quotas with respect to market power is that the quota truly constrains (or binds) the

total quantity imported. It is difficult to measure how much a quota binds. However, there is

anecdotal evidence that the steel VRAs in 1972 did not significantly constrain imports (see Kiers,

1980, and Scheuerman, 1986), while 1987 was a year when quota “fill rates” of the VRAs across

all covered steel products were at their peak and, thus, quite binding (see Moore, 1996). Thus,

our ex ante expectations are that it is more likely that we find significant market power effects of

VRAs in 1987 than in 1972.




10
   The NBER Trade Database currently only goes through the year 2001, and so we rely on purchased official
merchandise import data from the Foreign Trade Division of the U.S. Census for the year 2002.
11
   Products covered under the VRAs are listed in the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) publication 1729
(August 1985), Annual Survey Concerning Competitive Conditions in the Steel Industry and Industry Efforts to
Adjust and Modernize.
                                                       15
         The third and fourth types of protection programs were antidumping ( AD jt ) and

countervailing duties ( CVD jt ). Information on these investigations and duties were gathered from

relevant Federal Register notices. In particular, we gather information on affected import product

codes (TSUSA or HS), foreign country source, applied duty rates and length of time these duties

were in place, and then construct average trade-weighted AD and CVD duty rates for our SIC5

sectors using the import volume of the affected product and country source in the year prior to the

case available from the NBER Trade Database and the concordance between import product

codes and SIC5 products available in Current Industrial Reports: Steel Mill Products, mentioned

above.

         The fifth trade protection program during our sample that we examine is the steel

safeguard tariffs ( SafeTariffs jt ) that were put into place in March 2002; i.e., early in the last year

of our sample. Steel safeguard tariff rates are reported and available from the U.S. Department of

Commerce at http://www.ita.doc.gov/media/FactSheet/0303/fs_steel_ex_032103.html. We

constructed trade-weighted average safeguard tariffs for our SIC5 products in the same fashion as

our AD and CVD duties, being sure to take into account the imports from country sources that

were exempt from the safeguard remedy, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement

partner countries.

         There are a few trade protection programs applied to the steel industry during our sample

years that we do not include in our reported regression estimates. The TPM ran from January

1978 to January 1982, and thus does not overlap with any of our sample’s closest years – 1977 or

1982. Second, there were two special safeguard actions that led to trade protection in the form of

tariff-rate quotas on wire rods and circular welded line pipe from March 2000 to March 2003.

These programs overlap with our last sample year, 2002. However, they also pertain to very

specific products that comprise only a small share of one of our SIC5 products, particularly

                                                    16
circular welded line pipe. Not surprisingly, when we include dummy variables indicating the

affected SIC5 products in 2002, we estimate statistically insignificant effects on markups and

none of our other variables are qualitatively affected. Thus, we do not present results from

specifications with these variables in our empirical tables below.

       Beyond the trade protection variables, we rely on four main control variables. The first is

a measure of import penetration for a product in a given year ( IM jt ), which we construct as the

share of imports in the sum of imports plus domestic shipments. We rely on data from various

annual yearbooks of the American Iron and Steel Institute for products where there is a direct

correspondence to our SIC5 products. For a handful of our products (particularly wire-related

products), there is not a clear correspondence, and so we use data on imports from the NBER

Trade Database for imports and Current Industrial Reports: Steel Mill Products for domestic

shipment data.

       The second control variable is a real demand growth measure which we calculate as the

weighted average of real GDP growth by downstream sectors. We gather real GDP growth by

sector and year from table B-13 of the Economic Report of the President, 2006, and then weight

by the share of total shipments purchased by the downstream sector as reported in the 1992 U.S.

input-output tables. The product codes in the input-output tables are not as detailed as our SIC5

products, so we often have to apply the same demand growth values across multiple SIC 5

product codes. We construct changes in growth over the prior year, but also report estimation

results below when we calculate growth over the prior 5 years. Table 2 provides a list of the SIC5

products covered in our sample and average trade policy coverage over our sample years by

product and trade policy.

       The third and fourth variables—product-level Herfindahl index and plant-level capital

intensity—are calculated using data from the CM. The product-level Herfindahl index is

                                                 17
calculated as the sum of plant-level market shares for all plants producing the product in a given

year. Capital-intensity is defined as plant-level book value of capital divided by total value of

shipments.


4. Empirical Results

4.1. Roeger estimates

        Column 1 of Table 3 presents results from estimating equation (6) – which we term our

“base model” of estimates from the Roeger specification. The data fit the model well, with an R2

statistic of 0.91 and an F-statistic that easily rejects the null hypotheses of jointly zero

coefficients. The coefficient on the X ijt variable is highly statistically significant and also

statistically greater than 1.0, suggesting that the steel plants in our sample enjoy the ability to

price about 18.3% above cost on average.

        The next set of regressors listed in Table 3 is our main focus in this paper – the trade

policy variables. As discussed above, prior theory suggests that the VRA and AD duties will

have a positive impact on plants’ market power, while strictly tariff-based trade policy programs –

tariffs, CVDs, and safeguard tariffs – to show no effects on market power. Our estimated

coefficients in Column 1 of Table 3 largely support these predictions. Both the 1972 and 1987

VRAs show positive, statistically significant coefficients at the 10% level, while the estimated

coefficients on strictly tariff-based trade policy variables are not statistically different from zero at

standard confidence levels. The estimated effects of the VRAs are economically significant,

suggesting that VRAs were associated with a 14.6 percentage point higher price-cost markup in

1987, while the VRAs raised markups by 38.1 percentage points in 1972. The one unexpected

result in our base results is that we do not find any significant effects of AD duties on markups,

inconsistent with prior theory and empirical work. One issue with both AD and CVD trade

protection is that they can be quite targeted to narrowly defined products or a subset of import
                                                   18
sources. This may make it difficult to identify the impacts of these programs with our data. On

the other hand, such narrow targeting would also limit the ability of the trade action to have a

significant impact on the market and, thus, make our findings not unexpected.

       The final regressors listed in Table 3 control for import penetration, downstream demand

growth, the Herfindahl index, and capital intensity. While the coefficients on import penetration

and the Herfindahl index take the expected sign, they are both statistically insignificant from zero.

The coefficient on downstream demand is surprisingly negative and statistically significant. This

runs counter to Gallet (1997) that finds that market power goes up in periods of greater demand.

To explore this more, we tried alternative measures of real demand growth, including a 5-year

change in our downstream demand variable (rather than a one-year change) and get qualitatively

identical estimates.

       A more general way to control for not only demand growth changes, but any other

macroeconomic factors affecting all products and plants, is to include year dummies. We add

year dummies to our base specification and report results in Column 2 of Table 3. Coefficient

estimates are qualitatively similar to those in Column 1, though the coefficient on the 1987 VRA

falls enough (0.1464 to 0.1004) to be below standard levels of statistical significance. Relatedly,

the coefficient on the 1987 year dummy variable is statistically significant and suggests that all

plants experienced almost a 9% increase in price-cost markups that year, ceteris paribus.

       We note that it is possible that our control group of firms – non-ferrous metal producing

plants – is not ideal for identifying the impact of a broad-based trade protection program (like the

VRAs) on our focus (steel plants) from other macroeconomic events. A number of the non-

ferrous metals (e.g., aluminum and copper) are reasonably close substitute products for steel in a

number of downstream industries. Thus, when a trade protection program raises market power

broadly across steel products, it may also do so in non-ferrous substitutes from the demand shift

                                                 19
into non-ferrous products. In this way, our control group may bias our estimates from verifying a

significant positive effect of the VRAs. We think this is much less of an issue for AD and CVD

trade protection programs in our sample where only a very specific product (e.g., steel wire) is

targeted, as identification comes from a much larger set of unaffected non-ferrous and steel

products which are clearly not substitute products. However, we note that we estimate

qualitatively similar empirical results when we eliminate the aluminum, brass, and copper

products from our sample that are the closest substitutes for steel products.

       These base results ignore the possible endogeneity of trade policies and markups. For

example, as discussed above, firms may be more likely to lobby for and gain trade protection

when market power is low. This would bias us from finding positive effects of trade policies on

price-cost markups. Column 3 of Table 3 provides our IV estimates for the Roeger specifications

with year dummies included. As before, the coefficients for tariff-based measures of protection

continue to be statistically insignificant. The VRA effect in 1987 is now estimated to be

significant at the 10% level and substantially larger in magnitude than before (47.8 percentage

point increase in the price-cost markup over a base of 32.7%). In contrast, the estimated impact

of the VRA in 1972 is insignificant. This difference in the VRA impact in 1987 and 1972 may be

related to the anecdotal evidence that the VRAs were not binding in 1972, in contrast to high fill

rates in 1987.



4.2. PCM estimates

       We next turn to estimating market power effects using a PCM specification as presented

in equation (7) above. Table 4 presents results in analogous fashion to Table 3; Column 1

presents base results, column 2 presents estimates when we include year dummies, and column 3

presents our IV estimates with year dummies included. The pattern of coefficients from the PCM

                                                 20
estimates provides similar evidence on our hypotheses as those of the Roeger estimates, with a

few differences. Tariff-based trade protection programs do not have positive effects on price-cost

margins as hypothesized, though some are not insignificant, but unexpectedly negative (in the IV

estimates). Once again, the VRA effect in 1987 is positive and statistically significant at the 10-

percent level, even after controlling for year dummies in the IV estimates. The 1972 VRA effect,

however, is insignificant in all specifications in Table 4, which – again – is consistent with the

anecdotal evidence that the VRAs were not binding that year. Unlike the Roeger estimates, there

is evidence for a significant positive effect of AD duties on price-cost margins in our IV

specification.

       The estimated market power effects in the PCM specification are generally smaller in

magnitude than the Roeger estimates, though still economically significant. Using the IV

estimates, the 1987 effect of the VRAs is a price-cost markup that is 5.9 percentage points higher,

whereas each percentage point increase in the AD duty increases the price-cost margin by 0.3

percentage points. These are economically significant relative to an estimated base markup of

around 33% for the sample. The control variables have generally insignificant coefficient

estimates, except for evidence that higher capital intensity is associated with lower price-cost

markups.

       In summary, we find no significant positive effects of tariff-based trade protection

programs on market power, while finding positive and significant effects of VRAs in a year

(1987) when the anecdotal evidence suggests they were binding. Importantly, these results are

robust to calculation of markups with two different methodologies, which have been used

extensively in the empirical literature examining the effects of policy changes on market power.

The results are thus consistent with the theoretical literature that has demonstrated the non-

equivalent market-power effects of tariffs and quotas. We find some evidence that antidumping

                                                  21
duties are associated with an increase in market power, although this result is only present when

measuring markups with the price-cost margin.



4.3. Differences across integrated, minimill, and processing steel plants

         An important issue for our estimates is one of heterogeneous effects across types of steel

plants. Particularly in the beginning of our sample, the large integrated steel producers were often

the only type of firms publicly instigating petitions for trade protection. While this may suggest

they were the ones most likely to gain from trade protection, it may also be due to their relatively

large size in the industry and incentives for smaller minimill plants to free ride even though the

benefits from trade protection were proportionally as large as for the integrated plants. Also, as

mentioned, processing plants are quite different from the other two because they purchase basic

steel—their primary input—rather than produce it on-site. With trade protection often applied

simultaneously across a number of steel products, the processing plants’ reliance on purchased

steel may translate into different market power effects as well, as both their input and output

products may gain varying levels of trade protection.

         To explore this issue, we re-estimate our earlier specifications (including year dummies)

and include interactions between our regressors and dummy variables for each type of plant

(excluding one type to avoid perfect multicollinearity).12 Using these estimates we can

decompose the trade policy effects by type of plant for both the Roeger and PCM specifications,

which we present in Table 5.

         There are a number of results to highlight in Table 5. First, there continues to be no

evidence of positive market power effects from tariff-based protection. Second, the significant

12
  Minimill plants are not explicitly identified in the CM data. However, production capacities of minimill plants are
significantly smaller than for integrated plants – a fact that is well documented and can be seen in the bi-modal nature
of capacities in our sample’s distribution of plant capacities. We use this feature of the data to identify minimill
plants.
                                                          22
market power effects of the binding VRAs in 1987 are clearly for the steel-producing plants

(integrated and minimills), not for the steel-processors. This is consistent with the notion that the

VRAs are increasing costs for the primary steel products purchased by the steel-processors,

mitigating the impact of VRAs on their final product. An interesting result is that the evidence

suggests that both the integrated and minimill producers gained from the VRA in 1987. The

estimated effects for the minimill producers are smaller, but we cannot reject the hypothesis of

equal effects across integrated and minimill producers for both the PCM and Roeger

specifications. As before, there is little evidence for any market-power effects of the VRA in

place in 1972, consistent with the anecdotal evidence that they were not binding at that point in

time. Finally, our PCM estimates show the positive market power effects of AD duties to be

limited to integrated producers, while the Roeger estimates do not find significant AD duty effects

for any of the different types of steel plants.


5. Conclusion

        This paper provides one of the first empirical analyses of the hypothesis of nonequivalent

market power effects of tariffs and quotas using a more comprehensive and detailed dataset than

any previous study on this issue. We use plant-level Census data to examine changes in the

market power of U.S. steel plants as they were buffeted by a wide variety of trade protection

policies during our sample years of 1967 through 2002. We find evidence that binding

quantitative restrictions significantly increase market power, while tariff-based policies do not.

These results are consistent with a theoretical literature that predicts that binding quotas, unlike

tariffs, can facilitate collusive pricing by domestic and foreign firms. As expected, these results

hold for the steel-producing plants in our sample, but not for the steel-processing plants that rely

on purchased steel for inputs. We find only weak evidence that AD duties have positive effects

on market power, a possibility that has been discussed in a prior literature.

1969-1974   Voluntary Restraint Agreements
            (VRAs) with Japan and the EC.

1978-1981   Trigger Price Mechanism applied to
            all imports.

1982        Antidumping (AD) and countervailing
            duty (CVD) cases filed against EC
            countries. Subsequently terminated
            for VRAs on EC imports.

1984        AD and CVD cases filed against non-
            EC countries. Subsequently termina-
            ted for comprehensive VRAs.

1984-1989   Comprehensive VRAs with all signi-
            ficant import sources.

1989-1992   Extension of VRAs.

1992-1993   AD and CVD cases filed against sig-
            nificant import sources after VRAs
            expire. AD and CVD remedies
            applied to only subset of products.

1998-2000   Multiple AD and CVD cases against
            Japan and other Asian countries.

2002-2003 Safeguard remedies in form of tariffs
          placed on steel imports, excluding
          FTA partners and developing countries.
