                Measurement Error and the Flow of Funds Accounts:
                  Estimates of Household Asset Demand Equations



                                    ABSTRACT



     In the household sector of the Flow of Funds Accounts, the difference

between net acquisition of financial assets and net financial savings is

equal to a statistical discrepancy which is often quite large relative to

the reported changes in asset holdings. This means that the budget restric-

tions emphasized in the Brainard—Tobin approach to specifying asset demand

equations are not satisfied by the data commonly used to estimate such

equations. The view adopted in this paper is that the statistical discrepancy

should be thought of as resulting from measurement error in the Flow of

Funds data. By imposing a structure on the measurement error, a consistent

estimator is developed and used to estimate asset demand equations for the

household sector. The demand equations are similar in specification to

those used by others so that the results allow a direct assessment of the

effects of alternative treatments of the statistical discrepancy. The

empirical results suggest that qualitative conclusions about the effects

of financial flows and interest rates on asset demands are not affected

by the way the statistical discrepancy is treated. Quantitative conclusions

are, however, affected.

 1..   Introduction

       It i now more than a dozen years since Brainard and Tobin

pu.blished their "Pitfalls" paper warning that financial models must
be specified so as to be conistent with the underlying budget
constraints and wealth identities faced by the agents in the model.
An agent's wealth and the specification of n-i asset demand equations

completely determines the agent's asset behavior in an n asset model.
Brainard and Tobin [1963] drew attention to two important implications

of this fact. First, given wealth, no explanatory variable can
appear in only one asset demand equation. This follows since any
variable which affects the demand for one asset can only cause a

reallocation of the portfolio, since the portfolio size is given by
wealth, and must therefore affect the demand for at least one other
asset. In particular, the sum across all n               equations of
the partial derivatives in each demand equation of an explanatory

variable (other than wealth) must equal zero. From this restriction
the conclusion has been drawn that, in the absence of strong a priori
information, the same set of explanatory variables should appear in

'each equation describing an agent's asset holdings. Second, Brainard
and Tobin noted that the basic stock adjustment formulation, in

which actual asset holdings change in response to a gap between

desired and actual holdings, needs to be generalized in order to be
consistent with the restrictions implied by the budget identity.
Again, the approach followed was to assume that the change in holdings
of any one asset would depend upon the difference for every asset
between desired and actual asset holdings.
                                                                     2.



        The   budget   constraint faced by the economic agent or sector
 being modelled has thus been at the heart of the empirical financial
 nodels which have followed Brainard and Tobin. Quite commonly,1
 this   budget constraint has been stated in flow terms: net acquisi-
 tion   of assets minus net acquisition of liabilities equals the change

 in wealth. In this form, the Brainard and Tobin framework has been
 used in conjunction with data from the Federal Reserve Board7s
Flow of Funds Accounts to estimate asset demand equations for various
sectors of the economy.

        One unfortunate aspect of the Flow of Funds data is that, for
most sectors, they fail to satisfy the budget restrictions emphasized
in the Brainard-Tobin approach.2 For example, net acquisition
of financial assets minus liabilities (excluding capital gains) for
the household sector averaged 10.8 billion per quarter for the l96:l

to l978:t. period. This should equal net financial savings (basically
income minus taxes and consumer expenditures).        However, net financial
saving averaged only 7.5 billion per quarter over this same period.
The difference between savings and net acquisition of assets minus

1iabilities, the sector statistical discrepancy in the Flow of Funds
Accounts, averaged -3.2 billion per quarter,        almost half the size of
the total net flow of financial savings. Because the household sector


     1Examples of empirical work in the Brairiard-Tobin tradition will
be discussed in the next section.

         one sense it is fortunate that the Flow of Funds data are
not forced to satisfy the budget identities; the resulting discrepancies
can alert us to measurement problems which would otherwise be hidden.
                                                                   3.



 is treated a's   the   residual sector in the Flow of Funds Accounts,

 the statistical discrepancy is generally largest for this sector.
      Since one of the attractions of the Brainard-Tobiri framework is

 the set of cross-equation coeffici.ent restrictions imposed by the budget
 identity, it is somewhat inconvenient that the data themselves fail

to satisfy the underlying accounting identities. This failure forces
anyone using the Flow of Funds data to make a decision as to how the
statistical discrepancy should be treated. Usually whatever decision
has been made has been accompanied with little discussion of either

the reasons or the consequences. It will' be argued in this paper that

past treatments of the statistical discrepancy have resulted in the
use of estimators which are biased and inconsistent.

      The approach adopted in this paper is that the statistical

discrepancy should be thought of as resulting from measurement error
in the Flow of Funds data. This approach is then used to analyze the
implications of alternative treatments of the discrepancy in previous
applied work. This       will   be done in section 2. In section 3, further
assumptions which may be appropriate for the household sector are
used to impose more structure on the measurement error process. This
allows a consistent estimator to be developed that has the additional

advantage that, when all asset demand equations contain the same set
of variables, the coefficient estimates obtained by estimating each

equation separately satisfy the restrictions implied by the budget
identity.
     Once a consistent estimator, is      developed,   it remains to be seen
whether or not a proper treatment of the statistical discrepancy
leads to important changes in the parameter estimates obtained in a
model of household asset holdings. To assess then the empirical

importance of accounting in a consistent way for the measurement error
in the data, a model of household asset holdings is estimated using

quarterly data for the l96:l to 1978:)4 period. The model itself is
specified in section L. and the data used in this study are discussed.
I section ,   alternative   estimates of the model are compared. The
paper's conclusions are summarized in section 6.


2.   Previous Treatments of the Discrepancy

      In order to evaluate the implications of previous treatments of

the statistical discrepancy in the household sector accounts, it is

necessary to specify a framework of analysis within which alternative
approaches can be considered. The original Brairiard and Tobin paper
and most of the empirical models of household financial behavior using
the Flow of Funds Accounts make the basic assumption that the household

decision making process can be decomposed into two steps. In the
first step, households decide upon levels of consumption and investment
in physical assets. The result of this first step is to produce a
savings flow which must be allocated to the acquisition of financial

assets. The second step in the decision process is to then choose
desired levels of financial assets and liabilities.3 in this stage,
the net change in financial asset holdings is treated as exogenously
determined (in the first stage).


     3The joint determination of consumption, physical investment
and financial investment is considered by Walsh [1976], Purvis [1978],
and Eackus and Purvis [1980].
                                                                                 5.



     Suppose y is the net change in financial asset holdings during
period t. Let s be the net acquisition of asset i, i=l,...,k
iabilities are proceeded by a minus sign). The budget restriction is
that net acquisitions sum to the net change in financial assets:
                k
                          =y .                                                (2.1)
                1     t

The asterisk denotes that this relationship must hold between the

true, not necessarily observable, values of the variables.
     Let S      and               be the observed values, obtained from the

Flow of Funds Accounts, of s and y* respectively.                        Let dt be
the reported statistical discrepancy. The observed data then

satisfy
                      k
                      t s = yt         -
                                           dt                                (2.2)
                      1

instead of (2.1). It would seem natural to assume that dt                       arises

because of measurement error contained in the                    individual s and
in y .       Suppose then that we can write

             s =      s       +            i=l,...,k                         (2.3a)

                 =
                     y v  +                                                  (2.3b)

where u       and v are random measurement errors. Taking all
variables to be written as deviations from their sample means, we
                                                       and v have mean zero and
will assume that u =              (ult,...,ukt)
covariance matrix given by
                U                      z        a''
              EEv] [u vt] =                           ]=                      (2.)
Assume also that [u v] is asymptotically uncorrelated with
                                                           These are the assumptions
 [st' y] where s*t =
of a standard errors in variables model.
                                                                  6.



       Using (2.l)-(2.3) we can express the statistical discrepancy
 in terms of the underlying random measurement errors
         =
             y   Es =   v   -
                                Eu   .
                                                          (2.)
 With these relationships in mind, we can now consider the treatment
 accorded to dt in previous research.

      Three classes of studies have made use of the Flow of Funds

Accounts for the estimation of empirical models of household asset
behavior. The most ambitious have been the attempts to estimate
complete portfolio allocation models for all sectors of the economy.
Three such projects have been carried out: Bosworth and Duesenberry

[1973], Hendershott [1977], and Backus, Brainard, Smith and Tobin
[1980]. Next we have models of the asset holding behavior of one
sector. For the household sector such studies include Motley [1970],

Wachtel [1972], Hendershott and Lmmon [1975], Kopche [1977], Saito
[1977], and Backus and Purvis [1980]. The main focus of this paper
will be on these first two classes of studies, both of which attempt
to estimate equations to explain each    s .   A final group of papers

have studied the demand by households for one particular asset, often
as part of a model of the demand for one asset disaggregated by sectors.

Papers in this final group include Goldfeld [1973], Friedman [1977,
1980], and Roley [1980a, 1980b].
     All of the studies which have estimated complete models of

household asset holdings have proceeded along the following lines.
Assume that the net acquisition of asset i is a function of the net
change in total financial asset holdings and a set of r other variables,

x   , assumed initially to be the same for each i :
                                                                                   7.

                                       jt'        i=l,...,k                     (2.6)


where it is a random disturbance term with                              x)   and it
asymptotically uncorrelatedas are                              and (u vt). The budget
identity (2.1) implies the following restrictions on the parameters
of (2.6):
                      k                       k
                                   1 ,        z       =0                        (2.7)
                      11                      1
                                                           .




      If observations on st arid y were available, the set of
k equations in (2.6) could each be separately estimated by ordinary

least squares producing estimates                          and      with the property that
                = 1       ,              =a.                                    (2.8)

If all equations contain the same set of explanatory variables, each

equation can be estimated separately despite the cross-equation
restrictions on the coefficients implied by (2.7). This result
depends upon the inclusion of y =                     Es       as one of the explanatory
variables.

     With the actual obser,ed values of                        y and the s's, Y
does not equal the sum of the sj's. Hence, if each equation were
to be estimated separately, the resulting estimators would fail to
satIsfy the cross-equation restrictions. Theprocedure followed in
all but two of the studies cited above5 has been to use                            =


     1Letting   z =           (y*x*)   be the Txl+r matrix of T observations on y*
and x* and st be the Txl                     vector  of observations on s we have
   =

(1   0). See Denton [1978].
     5Boseworth and Duesenberry [1973] and Goldfeld [1973] are the two
exceptions. The procedure used by Bosworth and Dusenberry is discussed
below. Goldfeld estimated a basic money demand equation using Flow
of Funds data for household money holdings. His work does not fit
into the framework of equation (2.6).
                                                                                       8.


as the oristraint variable in the asset demand equation in place of
         Since when this is done the sum of the dependent variables
equals one of the explanatory variables (i.e.                                separate equation
by equation estimation yields parameter estimates which satisfy the

restrictions imposed by the budget identity.
        In other words, equations of the form

             sit =                +Y.1x        +
                                                   e.,   i1,...,k                    (2.9)

have been estimated. From (2.3a), however,
                 =
                         Zs   =
                                  y-   +
                                               uj                                    (2.10)

from which it follows that the disturbance term in (2.9) is given by
                     =
                         it u $u
                              +            -
                                                                                     (2.11)

        It is clear from equation (2.11) that equation (2.9) suffers from
a standard errors in variables problem: t =                          y Zu+        will be
correlated with the error term                            .    Thus, while it is true that OLSQ
applied to (2.9) will have the desirable property that the estimated
coefficients will satisfy the appropriate restrictions, OIJSQ is a

biased and inconsistent estimator. Hence, the estimation procedures
used in the studies cited above have been biased and inconsistent.
        Unlike the standard errors in variables model, even if                          =    0
so that s is a function only of y ,                              we are in general unable to

determine the direction in which                              is biased. The probability
limit of the least squares estimator is given by
                         + (z          -
        plim =
                              j                    jk   k)/plii4L                   (2.12)

where          is the ikth element of Z defined in (2.).

is indeterminant.

       The alternative estimation procedure followed by Bosworth and
Duesenberry amounts to using the measured value y in the regression
equation rather than        .    That is, they estimate equations of the
form
           =      + Yx +          .
                                                               (2.13)

In this case, ej =

                                 estimation procedure therefore is also
biased and inconsistent.

       Despite the measurement errors suggested by the large household
sector statistical discrepancy, all the studies of the portfolio
behavior of households of which I am aware that have utilized the

Flow of Funds data have ignored the problems introduced by such measure
ment error. Only Hendershott [1977]      has   attempted to analyze the
statistical discrepancies in the Flow of Funds accounts. He concludes
that the most likely explanation for movements in the sectorial
discrepancies is that they are due to data errors [pp. 360-361].
Hendershott does not develop the implications of this conclusion
for the estimation methods he uses in [1977] as we have done above.

       The implications of the statistical discrepancy as measurement
errór are also important for the approach to financial modelling adopted

by Friedman [1977]. In his work, financial flow variables such as
    are viewed as important in determining changes in asset holdings.
This approach has also been used by Roley [1980a, 1980b]. We can
conclude, however, that the estimation methods used in these papers
have produced biased, inconsistent estimates of the impacts of financial
flows on household asset holdings.

        In the next section, additional structure will be imposed on the
measurement error in s arid                      which will allow a consistent
estimation method for equation (2.6) to be developed.

        Suppose we are interested in estimating equations explaining
the determination of k variables,                 st ,       where         =
                                                                               y     and
is exogenously determined. If we assume that the same set of
explanatory variables appears in each of the k equations, as in
(2.9), there is no loss of generality if we assume                    y is the only
explanatory variable. We thus have k equations of the form
              =
                  S1y   +
                            it   ,   i=l,...,k                                       (3.1)

Observations are available on             5it and y which are related to
    and y by (2.3a) and (2.3b). The following assumptions are
made:


A.1: s is a kxl vector of random variables given by                            s =           +

        where           is a kxl vector of parameters,                a     kxl    random
        variable with E(€t) = 0,
                                           E(€t)         =

A.2: y and                  are asymptotically uncorrelated (pli4zy€ = 0
        for   all i).

A.3: s. =          s    +

        E(u) = 0, E(uu) =
                            u.    where      is a random measurement error.
                                          where     u =       (ult,...,ukt),
        plimZu€         =   0    and plimEyu =       0


                  section draws heavily    on sections 3 and              of Walsh [1980].
                                                                       11•



 A.1.:       =
                 y   + Vt where v is a random measurement error.

          E(v) = 0, E(v) =            pliiflEv = 0   ,   and   pii4zyv =
 14.5: (ç uv)          is distributed independently over time.

 A.6: The disturbance term             and the measurement errors (uvt)

          are jointly normally distributed. E(utv) =
 A.7: y is normally distributed with mean y* and variance

         Assumptions (A.i) -   (A.)   are standard in measurement error models

 and will be maintained throughout this paper. The remaining assumptions
 will be relaxed as the discussion proceeds. Assumptions (A.6) and (A.7)
 are necessary in order to derive the maximum likelihood estimator of

 . It     will be shown that the maximum likelihood estimator in this
 model has an interpretation, as an instrumental variable estimator. This
 result provides a motivation for the instrumental variable estimator

 that will be developed. Once having served that purpose, assumptions
 (14.6) and (14.7) can be dropped since the consistency property of the

 instrumental variable estimator does not require these assumptions.

• Assumption (14.7) is particularly undesirable, but it is necessary for
 the derivation of the maximum likelihood estimator. Hsiao [1976]
 points out the inappropriateness of this assumption for most time
 series models unless we are dealing with seasonally adjusted, detrended
 stationary series. Since the empirical papers cited in the previous
 section do not use detrended data, the emphasis here will be on
 developing a consistent esatiniator which does not require (14.7).

 To motivate the estimation procedure to be developed, however, we

 initially assume (14.1) - (14.7).

       Consider the following k±l equations:
                               =          + it U i=l,...,k
                                                    +
                                                                                        (3.2a)
                           =

In this form, we have k-i-i indicators                                     i=1,...,k, and
of the unobservable variable                            y .       The covariance matrix of the
observable indicators is given by

Goldberger [l97Ls.] discusses models of this type under the assumption
that      is diagonal. This would be the case if the measurement errors
were all independently distributed. He develops maximum likelihood
methods of estimation for •k > 2 (if k2, the system is unidentified).

In the present case, 2 is not assumed diagonal so without further
restrictions the system is unidentified for all k
       To identify the model, it is necessary to make additional

assumptions about the structure of the measurement error covariance
matrix     £       .       First        note that in (3.2a)          Ejt and        enter only in
the form (t÷u). In (3.3) then, E and                                       enter oniy in the
form           +       L       =
                                   Z.     It will be impossible, therefore, to separately
estimate                   and               The most we can hope for is to estimate their
sun,. This implies that assuming                           E is diagonal will not reduce
the number of parameters we need to estimate and will not help to
identify                   in                    The sum      +      cannot be assumed diagonal7

           THendershott [1977] makes this assumption.
                                                                    13.


since the budget constraint implies that the columns of           surri to

zero. Thus, Z cannot be diagonal, and identifying              by imposing
restrictions on        +      does not seem to be a useful approach.
     For the household sector of the Flow of Funds Accounts, each
 results from errors in allocating the net acquisition of the ith asset

 to the various sectors in the economy. Since the household sector
 is the residual sector in the Accounts, u will incorporate errors

 originating in all sectors of the Accounts. The error        v , on     the

 other hand, arises due to errors in measuring household disposable

 income and consumption expenditures. The error in        y. originates
 in the National Income and Product Accounts measurement of household

 financial savings. It would seem reasonable then to assume that
        and v are asymptotically uncorrelated. We will therefore
 ass urne



(A.8)       plimzuv = 0

    As with most maintained hypotheses, it is unlikely that (A.8)
 is strictly true. However, it would seem to be a more reasonable
 assumption upon which to base the estimation of asset demand equations
 for the household sector than the implicit assumption normally
made that the sum of the U's      is   identically zero for all t so
 that          is an accurate measure of
                                             y

structural parameters consisting of $,

Second, the budget restriction implies that

              zi =      i   .                                                      (.7)
   Equation (3.6) expresses the (k+l)(k+2) elements of 9 in
terms of                                 and the       k(k+l) elements of              .   Equation
(.9) implies that                        contains only k-l free parameters. The
total number of free parameters to be estimated is therefore
l+k-l + 1 +           k(k+l)         =
                                         (k+l)(k÷2)           so that the model is just

identified. This implies that (3.6) and (.7) place no restrictions
on 9 .       The maximum likelihood estimator which results from the

unconstrained maximization of (3.5) is
                      G=M.                                                       (3.8,)

The maximum likelihood estimators of the structural parameters can

be found by solving (3.6) and                             with     9 replaced by
                                                                                           15.



   If we let M be the sample covariance between x and z                                           ,


then setting the left side of (3.6) equal to 9 =                           M    yields
                      =
                                                                                  C3.9)

where        denotes an estimated value. Summing both sides over i
and using (3.7),

Combining (.9) and (3.10), the maximum likelihood estirriator of

         A
             = M/:M                                                               (3.11)

Reversing the order of sumgiation in the denominator of (3.11) and
recalling that y =              s      ,
                                               we can rewrite the formula for                      as

                 =   E                          .
                                                                                  (3.12)
The maximum likelihood estimator of                              is equal to the instrumental
variable estimator of                      in the regression of            5jt on                with
    used as the instrumental variable.

   When s and y are replaced by s and                                          in (3.1), the

error term, given by (2.11), becomes                          Eit +    -
                                                                           Eu      .
                                                                                           By (A.8)
this error term is asymptotically uncorrelated with                                    .
                                                                                            By (A.2) -
(A.I),   it is also asymptotically uncorrelated with                           y .         Therefore,
since pliI4Eyy =
                             ak,, yt       =
                                               y v   +    qualifies as an instrumental
variable in the regression of                            on

  Assumption (A.7) is unlikely to hold, but it is unnecessary for

the consistency of the estimator given by (3.12). This gives us a
simple, consistent estimator for a model of household asset behavior
                                                                                            16.



which has the advantage that the estimation of each equation separately

will, when the same variables appear in each equation, yield
coefficient estimates which satisfy the restrictions implied by the

budget constraint. Summing (3.12) over i shows that
              =
                  tYt/YYt                    = 1                                         (3.13)

Using y as the basic explanatory variable insures that the
adding-up restrictions are satisfied; using y as an instrumental
variable insures the consistency of the estimator.
     While        is unobservable, we do have two measures of it,
        and y .    By using only y ,                            the   informational content of
        is ignored. Using both measures of y enables the parameters
of the model to be consistently estimated.
     If each equation contains, in addition to t                                ,a   set of other

explanatory variables                            which may differ across equations, the
basic relationship among the observable                                     and y is

where x is a vector of all explanatory variables appearing in
any equation and F!         is a conformal matrix of coefficients. Each
row    of   !    has zeros corresponding to the elements of x not
appearing in that equation. In (3.15) we have a system of k-i
equations which could be estimated by the method of Zeliner C1962]
with two modifications. First, y should be used as an instrumental

variable for y. , and second, if the deleted jth equation did
not include all the elements of          x , there remain cross equation
restrictions on the k-i rows of F'.           For a more complete discussion
of this case, see Walsh [1980].

   We have so far assumed that all disturbance and measurement
error terms are serially independent. Since this is unlikely to
be the case in any model using time series data, it is necessary
to consider the additional estimation problems which arise when the

error terms are not all serially independent. In (3.lLs.), the error
term            could be serially correlated due to the presence of
serial correlation in either           €jt or any of the ujt's. However,
Brainard and Tobiri's "Pitfallst' methodology applies to the

specification of the properties of the error terms as well as to

the systematic part of each equation; the budget constraint imposes
restrictions on the serial correlation properties of              e =
since, from (3.l), Ze = 0          ,    and      is singular. Berndt and
Savin [1975]     consider   maximum likelihood estimation in a model with
a singular covariance matrix and autoregressive errors. Their method
can be easily modified to be used with the instrumental variable
estimator proposed here.

      Assume that we can write e as an autoregressive process

            e =      B(L)ei       ÷                                           (3.17)

where 3(L) is a kxk matrix of polynomials in the lag operator L,
and        is a serially independent error term. The matrix 3(L) is
a function of the time series properties of                             and u since
e is a composite disturbance term (see Pagan [1973]). Equation
(3.15) implies that EtPit = 0                    and each column of 3(L) sums to the
same constant.

   In going from (3.l1.) to (3.16), the jth equation was eliminated
so that the resulting system of equations would have a nonsingular
covariance matrix. In order to go from (3.17) to an expression for

e , the method of Berndt and Savin [1975] can be used. Letting
b(L) be the ijth element of 3(L) we can write


                    b11(L) b(L) .                 .   . b1(L)       b1.(L)

          e =               :                                                e1+

             =
                    C(L)e1      + LJJ

where    C(L) is a (k-1)x(k-1) matrix of polynomials in L. Each
column of C(L) sums to zero.

   Substituting (3.18) into (3.16)
                =       +

The unknn elements of S, F', and c(L) can be estimated by the
methods discussed in Fair [1972]. In the actual estimation reported
in section 5 below, e was assumed to follow a first order auto-

regressive process. The residuals from an initial consistent

From the estimated results, certain elements of c(L) = C were

assumed to be zero. The remaining elements along with e                                    and
F' were simultaneously estimated by the joint estimation of the
k-i equations in

1.    Model Specification and Data

     Because the purpose of this paper is to assess the implications

for the previous work discussed in section 2 of using an estimation
method which attempts to account for the measurement error problem,

a fairly standard specification of the household sector's asset
demand equations will be made. This will allow for some
confidence in relating the conclusions reached here to these
earlier studies.
                                                                                    20.


    Almost all of the          empirical       work on household asset holdings



           Ait _At_i =

where At is the stock of asset i
                                ijt
 has utilized a generalized stock adjustment framework in which
                                               -
                                                   At_i)                   (J4.i)


                                                         actually held and A
the desired stock of asset j               .       It   is also common to follow the
specification of Erainard and Tobin [1968] and include a term
          where            =
                               ww1      is the change in wealth during the
period.     I'his   last    terni is included because of the presence of

transaction costs; it is cheaper to allocate new financial flows
than   it is to reallocate existing asset holdings.

   In addition to the adjustment equations in (L..i), it is necessary
to specify the determinants of desired asset holdings. It is common
to assume desired holdings are homogeneous of degree one in wealth
and that            =            is   a linear function of interest rates (or
their logs) as well as perhaps other variables such as income.

   Friedman [1977] has modified this basic framework to allow for
interaction between the desired asset allocation for asset i,

att , arid the effect of financial flows,        , by assuming
   =      .  The coefficient of       changes as interest rate
changes affect desired holdings of the ith asset. This generalized
adjustment framework has been further developed by Roley [l980a].
   The model to be estimated in this paper will be similar to the

original Bra inard-Tobin model, but the stock adjustment model will
not be used to motivate the chosen specification. The stock adjustment

model has the desirable property that it allows certain estimated
coefficients to be interpreted as speeds of adjustment. Unfortunately,
                                                               21.



a common problem is that the empirical results usually produce

estimated speeds of adjustment which are too slow to be plausible.

Thus, while the type of equation derived from (.i) seems to "work"
well empirically, it is not necessarily due to the fact that house-
holds adjust their portfolios in the manner assumed by the stock
adjustment model.
   If we think of a household deciding upon levels of asset holdings

during period t, the household's actions will depend upon the state
variables describing the resources available to the household at the
start of the period and the set of variables, such as interest

rates, describing the characteristics of the assets the household
is considering holding. In the absence of transaction costs, the
household's initial position can be completely characterized by its
wealth at the start of the period plus the assumed exogenous financial
flow zwt •8 Asset demands would therefore depend upon      w_1 +
=w   .   With no transaction costs, the composition of         is
irrelevant.

   When transaction costs are introduced, a dollar in the form of
         is not equivalent to a dollar in the form of
                                                        A.-i
differential costs are involved in transforming holdings of

and A into any other asset. Now to describe the initial state
of the household, we need to completely specify the composition of

w_1 .    Each   Ati as well as wt will enter the demand
functions for assets in period t. In general then we would have

       the more general models considered by Walsh [1976] and
Backus and Purvis [1980], w is also a decision variable of the
household so that the initia' position is characterized by w -
alone.

demands.

       These relevant variables in                         x are assumed to be a vector of

income. It is assumed that (1-..2) can then be approximated by

net acquisition of currency and demand deposits (MaN),       time   and
savings accounts (TIME), credit market instruments (BOND), nonznarketable

assets (NONMKT), and net purchases of equities (NErP). Net
acquisition of financial liabilities is disaggregated into two

categories: net acquisition of mortgages (MORT) and net acquisition
of other liabilities (LLE). Corresponding to the variable

   Since asset stocks also appear in            they were obtained by
decumulating from the end of quarter stocks for l978: using the

seasonally adjusted quarterly flows (MaN, TIME, etc.). This produced
stock series which were consistent with the quarterly flow data.
Asset stocks are labeled SMON, STIME, etc.

   Seven interest rates appear in the asset demand equations: a
rate on time and savings accounts (RTIME), the commercial paper
rate (RcP), the Aa corporate bond rate (RBOND), the dividend yield
for the Standard and Poor's 500 (REQIJITY), the rate cn business

loans as a substitute for a consumer loan rate (RBL), the secondary
market yield on FHA insured loans (RMORT), and since asset demands
should depend upon real rates of return, the expected rate of
inflation (EXPINF). This last variable was estimated as the rate
of inflation predicted by a regression of actual inflation on a 10

quarter lag on past inflation, a 10 quarter lag on past rates of
growth of the money supply and a 5 quarter lag on past unemployment
rates.

                                     SDt                    (i.7)


where SDt is the statistical discrepancy in the Flow of Funds
Accounts for the household sector.



5. Empirical Results
   The asset demand equations were estimated over the 196:l to

1978:11. period. Each equation was initially estimated by OLSQ with
     as an explanatory variable so the estimated coefficients




         l
satisfy the constraints in (11..5). Several of the equations appeared

to have serially correlated residuals, so the procedure discussed
in section 3 was used. This involved regressing the residuals
    °'       where the equation deleted (the jth equation) was
the one for net purchases of equities. NETP was very small on
average during the sample period with little variance. The initial
OLSQ estimates of the NETP equation were imprecise with few

coefficients statistically significant. In the remainder of the
analysis, the NETP equation was deleted; estimates for this equation
can be obtained residually from the budget identity and the estimates

of the remaining k-i (in this case, 6) equations.
   The regression of      on           produced an estimate of C.
Elements less than one and one-half times their estimated standard
errors were assumed to equal zero. The remaining nonzero elements
of C were used to transform the six equations for s into the
form of (3.21). Because of the zero elements of C, not all
equations now contained the same set of explanatory variables.
                                                                25.



Consequently, the equations were estimated jointly using an iterative
version of Zeliner's method for seemingly unrelated equations. The
                                             a

resulting   estimates of the parameters of the asset demand equations
and the jointly estimated elements of C are presented in Table 1.

In interpreting these results, it should be kept in mind that the

explanatory variables are highly correlated. in light of this, it
is surprising that 62 of the 106 estimated coefficients exceeded
1.65 times their estimated standard error.

   The responses of asset demands to changes in nominal interest
rates are reported in rows 2-7 of Table 1. Most of the estimated
results conform in sign to a priori expectations, although there

are a number of exceptions. Changes in the rate on time deposits
and savings accounts (RTI), for example, do not appear to have
a significant effect on households acquisitions of currency and

demand deposits (MON), but MON does respond negatively to the
commercial paper rate (RCP) as well as to the corporate bond rate
(RBoN), The positive coefficients on the remaining interest rate
variables (BEQUITY, RBL, and RMORT) are more difficult to interpret.
It is worth noting that these results for the six nominal interest
rate variables are the opposite of those discovered by Backus and

Purvis E1980] who found only the time deposit and savings account
rate to be significant. The own rate on money, minus the expected
rate of inflation, has a negative but statistically insignificant

estimated coefficient. If households respond to real rates of
interest, the coefficient on EXPINFt. wt_i is equal to an own rate

response minus the sum of the coefficients on the other interest

    rate   terms.     -iis combined effect may be close to zero even if MON
    responds to changes in the expected rate of inflation when other real
    rates are held constant. From Table 1 the implied response of MON to

    EXPINF holding real rates constant is negative, but small (-0.067).
         Net acquisition of time deposits and savings accounts depends

    positively on the own rate variable, RTI€, and negatively on the rates
    on substitutes, RBOND and REQUITY. The coefficient on the commercial
    paper rate is small and not statistically significant. Net

    acquisition of credit market instruments (BOND) depends positively
    on the two own rates, RCP and RBOND, and negatively on RTI and
    REQUITY. The coefficient on REQUITY is not statistically significant
    (t =   i.1.o),   but it is larger in magnitude than the coefficient on
    RTIME. Backus and Purvis       found a significant positive effect of RBL
    on BOND   but    that does not show up here, although RBL does appear to
    affect TI4E.

         As might be expected, net acquisition of nonmarketables (pension fund

    reserves, life insurance reserves, savings bonds) is fairly interest
    inelastic. Only RBOND and REL have statistically significant
-   coefficients     and their values are relatively small. None of the
    interest rate coefficients are large in the equations for LIAB and
    MORT either, but several are statistically significant:      RTIr€,
    REQUITY, and RBL     in the equation for LIAB, RTI, REOND,   and RBL
    in   the equation for MORT. RBL is estimated to have a positive, rather
    than the expected negative, effect on LIAB.

         These results suggest that asset holdings of the household sector
    are responsive to changes in interest rates, but the magnitudes
    involved are small.
                                                               28.



    Turning to the coefficients on the lagged stock variables, Table 1
 shows that in only three of the six estimated equations (MON, BOND,

 and LIAB) is the coefficient on the own lagged stock negative and

 statistically significant as would be implied under a stock adjustment
 interpretation. The estimated coefficients on the lagged stocks
differ considerably within each equation which is consistent with
asset demands depending upon the household's initial portfolio
Composition and not just its size (wt_i) as would be the case in
the absence of transaction costs.

   While income (PDY) is statistically significant oriiy in the MON

and NONMKT equations, the financial flow variable w is significant
in all but the BOND equation. According to Table 1, 17 cents of a

dollar increase in wealth is initially allocated to money holdings
and 22 cents to time deposits and savings accounts although the

biggest flow (31 cents) is into the nonrnarketable category. In

addition, total liabilities are reduced by about 35 cents.

   Section 2 argued that the system of equations (.L) should be
                       =
estimated by using           + SDt   as an instrumental variable for
      Reestimating the basic model using the same correction for
autocorrelatjon as was used in Table 1 and an instrumental variable
estimator yielded the coefficient estimates presented in Table 2.

   Comparing the estimates in Tables 1 and 2, fairly sizable
changes in the coefficients on w have occurred. The effect of
a one dollar change in w on MON has dropped from 17 cents to 12
cents and on ri€ from 22 cents to 16 cents.   Neither effect is now
stacistica].ly significant. Since the sum across all equations of

the coefficients on w must equal 1, the fall in the estimated
coefficients in the MON arid TIME equations must be balanced by changes

in other equations. The coefficient on w in the equation for
NONMKT has increased from .31 to .36, but the largest change has
occurred in the equation for LIAB (.17 in Table 1 versus .26 in

Table 2). The estimated coefficient on w in the BOND equation
has doubled, but still has a t ratio less than 1.0.

   The coefficients on PDY have also changed considerably as a
result of the change in estimation methods. The estimated interest
rate effects, however, have not changed very much. RCP is no longer
statistically significant in the BOND equation whereas it is in the

MORT equation now; RBOND is no longer significant in the MORT equation.
   Since many of the estimated coefficients in Tables 1 and .2 are

small and not statistically significant, a revised version of the
asset demand equations which excludes variables from some of the

equations was estimated. Since the purpose of this paper is to
reestiniate consistently this basic type of financial model that has
been estimated in the past without regard to measurement error, the
OLSQ estimates in Table 1 were used as a guide in respecifying the
model. This revised version was then estimated by OLSQ arid by the

instrumental variable estimator.
   In general, a variable was dropped from an equation if the t ratio
for its estimated coefficient in that equation was less than 1. Two
exceptions were made: the own rate (RNORT) was left in the equation
for MaRT, and the expected rate of inflation variable was left in all
the equations. Since the coefficient on the expected rate of
inflation is a combination of the interest rate coefficients if
                                                                 31.



households' respond to real interest rates, dropping some interest
rate variables in an equation may greatly affect the estimated

coefficient on expected inflation. For this reason it was left
in each equation.

   Each equation in its modified version was first estimated

separately using OLSQ. The calculated residuals from the equations
were then analyzed to determine the zero elements of the matrix C
in (3.18). The equations were then transformed according to the
results of the residuals analysis and the six equations were jointly
e3tirnated subject to the cross equation restrictions which result
from the autocorrelation transformation. The resulting estimates

appear in Table 3.

   As might be expected, the major changes in going from Table 1 to
Table 3 occur in the coefficients of the lagged stock variables and
the autocorrelation structure of the residuals. The coefficient on
zw has fallen in the equation for NONMKT and risen in the TIfr
equation. Rather than consider further comparisons of Tables 1 and
3, we can examine the effects of reestiniating by instrumental

variables the modified specification of Table 3. The resulting
estimates are contained in Table   while   the estimated coefficients
on w from Tables 1 through Table 14 are brought together for
comparison in Table 5.
   The estimates in Table 5        show that the estimated coefficient
on w is most sensitive to the method of estimation in the
modified model in the TI and NONMKT equations. However, even here
the absolute differences are relatively small with the instrumental

variable estimates implying that an additional 7 cents out of every

dollar change in w would end up in nonmarketable assets with 6
cents less in time deposits and savings accounts and L.     cents less in
demand deposits and currency. These do not seem like very large
magnitudes. In response to a billion dollar increase in w , the
estimated impact on net acquisition of time deposits and savings

accounts during the quarter of the increase would differ by only .2.°/o
of the average level of total holdings by households and 6°/o of the
average size of net acquisitions. The conclusion to be drawn from
Table 5 then is that while the sizeable statistical discrepancy for

the household sector suggests serious measurement error problems
actual coefficient estimates are not dramatically sensitive to the
estimation method used.

   Within the context of the framework developed in section 2, both
of the estimation methods used in this paper would be consistent

        (=) was     a true observation on y .    In   this case,

using        as the explanatory variable in a least squares regression
involves no measurement error problem. As long as v is uncorrelated
with the measurement error in the individual s.
                                              it 'S (as well as with

€jt) using      as an instrumental variable also produces consistent
estimates. However this explanation for the similarity of the
coefficients in Table 5 does not seem plausible. Each s for the
household sector is measured as a residual and, while the measurement
error     5it may be correlated with that in          ,
                                                          there   is no

reason to suppose that the sum of the u's over 1, is identically
zero for all t. If Zu is no identically zero, then y is not
equal to y- for all t and using          as a regressor leads to

inconsistent estimates.

     Another possible explanation for the results in Table 5 would be
that the measurement errors in    y and y are correlated
(assumption A.8). In this case neither estimation method is
consistent. Without further restricting the model in some way, no
consistent estimator exists since the model is unidentified. The
failure of assumption A.8 to hold does not in itself imply that
similar estimates would be obtained by both estimation methods,

but, given the high correlation between      and y (0.963 over the
sample period 1956:1 to l978:), it is perhaps not surprising.


6.    Summary and Conclusions
     Previous studies of sectoral financial behavior which have utilized
data from the Flow of Funds Accounts have ignored the presence of
measurement error. This is potentially a serious problem for the
household sector due to the residual nature of this particular sector
in the Flow of Funds Accounts. If the statistical discrepancy in the
Accounts is interpreted as being the result of measurement error,

previous methods used to estimate Brainard-Tobin type models of the
financial sector can be shown to be inconsistent.

     By imposing additional structure on the measurement error, it was
possible to derive a consistent estimator which had the property that,
when all equations contain the same set of explanatory variables,

single equation estimation produces parameter estimates which satisfy
the restrictions implied by the budget identity. Consistency
depended upon the assumption that the measurement error in the
value of financial savings derived as income minus consumption (from
                                                                37.



 the National Income and Product Accounts) was asymptotically

 uncorrelated with the measurement error in financial savings derived

 as net acquisition of financial assets minus liabilities (from the
 Flow of Funds Accounts).

    in order to assess the empirical importance of using a consistent

estimator, a model of the household sector's holdings of five asset

categories and two categories of liabilities was estimated by
two methods. The first involved a straightforward application of

Zeliner's method for estimating seemingly unrelated equations.
The cross equation restrictions implied by the structure of serial
correlation in the errors were imposed in the estimation, but no

adjustments were made for measurement error. This first estimation
method corresponds to the approaches used in previous studies. The
second estimation method is an instrumental variables estimation
method which was shown to be a consistent estimation procedure despite

the measurement errors in the data.

   The results for the estimated impact of financial flows on asset
demands, summarized in Table ,   revealed some sizable differences
between the two estimation procedures when the standard Erainard-
Tobin specification was used. In this specification, the same set of
explanatory variables appears in each equation. When   the   equations
were modified, dropping variables that appeared to have zero coefficients,
the differences produced by the two estimation procedures were much
smaller.

   This difference in the results obtained in the two versions of the
model may be more an indication of the problem of multicollinearity
                                                            38.



common in models of this type than it is a result of the presence
of measurement error. The conclusions to be drawn from the results
reported in section 5 are therefore mixed. It is not clear that
attempting to correct for measurement error will significantly alter
parameter estimates. On the other hand, the estimator develoDed
here is a simple instrumental variables estimator so it would be

easy for researchers working on household financial behavior to
estimate their models using both the standard method and the one
proposed here. If they find little difference in their results, it
can only add to the confidence with which their conclusions can be
held.
