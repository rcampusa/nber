                                               ABSTRACT

We formalize the Keynesian insight that aggregate demand driven by sentiments can generate output
fluctuations under rational expectations. When production decisions must be made under imperfect
information about aggregate demand, optimal decisions based on sentiments can generate stochastic
self-fulfillng rational expectations equilibria in standard economies without aggregate shocks, externalities,
persistent informational frictions, or even any strategic complementarity. Our general equilibrium
model is deliberately simple, but could serve as a benchmark for more complicated equilibrium models
with additional features.

1    Introduction
We formalize the Keynesian insight that sentiments about aggregate demand can generate output
and employment fluctuations in a rational expectations framework. In our benchmark model each
firm must make a production decision before demand is realized, based on noisy signals about what
its demand will be. The signals, based on initial inquiries, advance sales, early orders, market
research and public forecasts about the state of the economy, provide imperfect information about
firm-level demand and aggregate demand. After production decisions are made, demand is realized
and prices adjust to clear the market. In this set-up firms have signal extraction problems that can
lead to multiple equilibria and endogenous fluctuations in aggregate output.

      Self-fulfilling stochastic equilibria in our model are not based on randomizations over fundamen-
tal certainty equilibria. Since at such equilibria firms make their production decisions based on the
correctly anticipated distribution of aggregate demand and their own idiosyncratic demand shocks,
these self-fulfilling stochastic equilibria are consistent with rational expectations. Furthermore we
obtain such equilibria even though we have strategic substitutability in firms’ actions: the optimal
production of each firm is a declining function of other firms’ total output.
      Our model is similar to that of Angeletos and Lao (2011) in that sentiments can drive output
and that our self-fulfilling equilibria are not based on randomizations over fundamental certainty
equilibria. The fundamental certainty equilibrium not driven by sentiments is in fact unique in our
model. Our informational structure is also simple: trades take place in centralized markets rather
than bilaterally through random matching, and at the end of the period all trading history is public
knowledge. Informational asymmetries exist only within the period as firms decide on how much
to produce on the basis of the signals they receive at the beginning of the period.
      Our benchmark model is of course also related to the Lucas (1972) island model and its signal
extraction problem. However unlike Lucas (1972) we obtain multiple rational expectations equilib-
ria. In the absence of aggregate shocks, we get a unique rational expectations equilibrium in which
output and aggregate demand are constant, and firms receive signals that reveal their idiosyncratic
demand shocks. This is our fundamental certainty equilibrium. If however agents believe that their
signals contain "information" about changes in aggregate demand, and that the signals attach suf-
ficient (more than one half) weight to this information, then all firms will adjust their production
in response. Furthermore there will exist an equilibrium belief about the distribution of aggregate
demand that is self-fulfilling: if firms use this distribution in making optimal decisions then indeed
this distribution of output will be realized over time.1 So we obtain an additional rational expecta-
tions equilibrium that, in contrast to the fundamental certainty equilibrium, will exhibit aggregate
fluctuations in output and employment despite the lack of any fundamental aggregate shocks. We
characterize this self-fulfilling equilibrium and show that its mean output is lower than the output
under the certainty equilibrium.
      It may also be interesting to contrast the results of our model with those obtained under global
games (see, for example, Morris and Shin, 1998). In global games multiple coordination equilibria
can become unique once agents receive a small, noisy, private signal about an economic fundamen-
tal. By contrast in our model we start with a unique equilibrium that has constant output, but
when we introduce perceived private uncertainty about aggregate demand, an endogenous vari-
able, we obtain additional equilibria with stochastic output. These additional equilibria, however,
disappear when the weight given to aggregate demand uncertainty in the noisy signal becomes
small. Our paper is related to others in the global games literature where endogenous variables
  1
      This may be interpreted as a correlated equilibrium. See footnote 4.

provide further information about the underlying fundamentals. Hellwig, Mukherji and Tsyvinki
(2006) introduce an endogenous public signal, the market clearing interest rate for bonds, into a
currency crisis model. The agents can then condition their demand for domestic bonds vs. foreign
currency both on the endogenous interest rate and their private signal about the central bank’s
commitment to the peg. Angeletos and Werning (2011) introduce a publicly traded asset into a
similar model. When the public signal is exogenous, agents rely heavily on the private signal if its
relative precision is high. Since private signals are dispersed, multiple coordination equilibria can
be ruled out. However, if the public signal, the price of the asset, is endogenous and its precision
is related to that of the private signal, coordination is facilitated and the uniqueness of the equi-
librium can be lost. In both cases the endogenous price helps disseminate information about the
underlying fundamental to restore the multiplicity of coordination equilibria. Angeletos, Hellwig
and Pavan (2006) also examine how policy choices can reveal information about fundamentals in
global games (about the type of policy maker in this instance), and destroy the uniqueness of the
equilibrium that would be obtained when policy choices are uninformative.2 In our model, how-
ever, the mechanism for the multiplicity of equilibria arises directly through the eﬀect of perceived
aggregate demand uncertainty on the optimal output of firms. There exists a distribution of the
perceived uncertainty which generates a self-fulfilling stochastic rational expectations equilibrium
in addition to the constant output certainty equilibrium.3
       In the sections below we describe first the benchmark model and derive the various equilibria.
Section 5 introduces more general signal structures. Since we abstract from capital accumulation
and avoid the persistence of informational rigidities, each period is independent of the past. We show
in section 6 that we can obtain persistence in output fluctuations using a variety of mechanisms,
including Markov sunspots across equilibria, multiple islands, productivity shocks, and time-varying
parameters. Section 7 extends our main result to more general settings. In particular, Section 7.1
provides a more abstract version of the model that captures the main forces responsible for the
existence of self-fulfilling stochastic equilibria. In section 7.2 we introduce a related competitive-
market model where firms must make investment decisions before observing their idiosyncratic
productivity shocks and the aggregate capital stock that determines the market rate of return. In
section 7.3, we modify a canonical price setting model with imperfect information. We show that
in all such models there exist self-fulfilling stochastic rational expectations equilibria in addition to
a unique certainty equilibrium. Finally in section 8 we conclude.

2     The Benchmark Model
The model has a representative household, a representative final goods producer, and a continuum
of monopolistic intermediate-goods producers indexed by  ∈ [0 1]. The intermediate-goods pro-
ducers decide on how much to produce based on their observation of a noisy signal reflecting initial
inquiries, advance sales, early orders and market research. Formally the signal is  =  +(1−)
where  is an idiosyncratic demand shock to their own good  and  is the stochastic component
of aggregate demand in the self-fulfilling equilibrium. In section 5 below, we generalize the signal
structure to introduce a firm-specific  noise to   and then a second noisy public signal on
aggregate demand based on public forecasts of the economy.

2.3   Intermediate Goods Producers
Each intermediate goods firm produces good  to meet its demand  without perfect knowledge
about either  or the aggregate demand  which could also be random. Instead, as in the Lucas
island model, they infer their demand from a signal  

                                       =  log  + (1 − ) log                                       (11)

where  reflects the weights assigned by firms to the idiosyncratic and aggregate components of
demand. The signal is based on early orders, initial inquiries, advance sales, and market research.
On the basis of its signal, the firm chooses its production to maximize profits.
   An intermediate goods producer  has the production function

                                                     =                                               (12)

So the firm maximizes expected nominal profits Π =   −                              by solving

Since aggregate output is constant in the certainty equilibrium, the firms know their idiosyncratic
shocks from their signals. Then if their demand curve shifts by  units, their optimal output will
change in such a way as to leave their prices invariant, so all firms will charge the same price. (To
see this substitute 8 into (14).) Substituting equation (20) into equation (18) gives

4    A Self-fulfilling Equilibrium

We conjecture that there exists another equilibrium, such that aggregate output is not a constant.
In particular we assume that
                                                         log  = 0 +                          (28)

                                                                   7
where  is a normally distributed random variable with zero mean and variance 2 . The noisy
signal received by each firm is
                                                 =  + (1 − )                                               (29)

so that with fluctuations in aggregate output, the firm’s signal is no longer fully revealing4 .
    We may view  as a sentiment held by agents about aggregate demand, as perceived through
their signals  . We will show that in our self-fulfilling equilibrium the distribution of the sentiments
{ } assumed by the firms will be consistent with the realized distribution of aggregate output { }
given by equation (28).5

                            (1−)2  


Proof. See the Appendix.
    If firms believe that their signals contain information about changes in aggregate demand in
addition to the firm-level demand shocks, then these beliefs will partially coordinate their output
responses, up or down, and sustain self-fulfilling fluctuations consistent with their beliefs about
the distribution of output. Both the variance of the sentiment shock  2 and  aﬀect the firms’
optimal output responses through their signal extraction problems. Given  and the variance of
the idiosyncratic shock  2  for markets to clear for all possible realizations of the aggregate demand
sentiment   the variance 2 has to be precisely pinned down, as indicated in Proposition 1.6
If however agents perceive that the signal comes with a low weight on aggregate as opposed to
idiosyncratic demand, that is if  ∈ [05 1] and the covariance of the signal with aggregate demand
is low, then a positive variance 2 that will clear the markets for every  does not exist.
    4
      Note that here we define the signal as the weighted sum of the idiosyncratic shock and the innovation to aggregate
demand. The mean of the log of aggregate demand will be absorbed by the constant 0 in equation (28) and
incorporated into output decisions of firms. So  =  + (1 − ) is equivalent to  =  + (1 − ) as 0 is
common knowledge.
    5
      Under an alternative approach, firms could simply start with the belief that their signals are correlated. They
would choose optimal outputs based on their signals and their beliefs about the distribution (that is 2 ) of aggregate
output. In a self-fulfilling equilibrium, the variance of aggregate output 2 would be restricted as in Propositions 1,
or later below in Propositions 3 or 4, to ensure that the goods market clears. With this restriction, the distribution
of shocks  and  (and also the distribution of the noise  in section 5 below) would induce a distribution on the
signals  Given their signals  the firms would optimally choose   We can interpret the self-fulfilling equilibrium
as a correlated equilibrium that follows from the optimal output choices of firms given the market clearing variance
of aggregate output  2 and the distribution of signals induced by the shocks. Such equilibria are typically defined
for finite games with a finite number of agents and discrete strategy sets, but for an extention to continuous games
see Hart and Schmeidler (1989) and more recently Stein, Parillo, and Ozdaglar (2008). We thank Martin Schneider
for alerting us to this point.

      To see this look at equations (A.10), (A.11) and (A.20) in the proof of the Proposition in the Appendix.




                                                             8
    Since  =  1− and   1, in equilibrium firm-level outputs as well as markups depend
negatively on aggregate output because intermediate goods are substitutes.7 Hence, if we ignore
firm-specific demand shocks, the certainty or fundamental equilibrium in the model will be unique
as a result of this strategic substitutability. However, the optimal supply of the firm’s output
positively depends on firm-level demand shocks. Consequently, if firms cannot distinguish firm-
level shocks from aggregate demand, informational strategic complementarities can arise, giving
rise to self-fulfilling equilibria.
    The optimal output of an intermediate goods firm declines with  2 as the firm attributes more
of the signal to an aggregate demand shock. In the self-fulfilling equilibrium,  2 is determined
at a value that will clear markets for all . In particular, note that the mean output 0 in the
self-fulfilling equilibrium will be lower than the output ̄0 under the certainty equilibrium, and the
mean markup will be higher.
    If  = 1 and the signal attaches no weight to sentiments regarding aggregate demand, the
signal fully reveals the idiosyncratic shock and the only equilibrium is the certainty equilibrium
with constant aggregate output. When  = 1 each firm produces according to its own demand
shocks, and the aggregate output is constant. If  = 0 on the other hand, then again the certainty
equilibrium is the unique equilibrium. In this case firms do not know their own demand but they
do know the aggregate demand. Hence each firm produces a constant quantity related to aggregate
demand based on the expected value of their own demand shock. This is equivalent to setting the
idiosyncratic shocks to a constant so that the certainty equilibrium is the only equilibrium.


5     More General Signal Structures

5.1    Imperfect signals with firm-specific noise

So far we have assumed that firms can get an initial signal for the overall demand for their product,
but cannot disaggregate it into its components arising from idiosyncratic and aggregate demand.
Since the signals are based on early and initial demand indications for each of the firms, they may
well contain an additional firm-specific noise component. Suppose then that the signal takes the
slightly more general form,
                                           =  +  + (1 − )                                          (30)

where  is a pure firm-specific iid noise with zero mean and variance  2 .
    As before we define
                                              log  =  = 0 + 
   7
     The marginal cost is proportional to aggregate output in the Dixit-Stiglitz model. Hence, the markup is inversely
related to the aggregate demand. Both the marginal cost and firms’ markups are constant whenever the aggregate
demand is constant.

equilibrium is  = 0. Hence, to have a self-fulfilling expectations equilibrium, we require  ∈ 0 12
and  2   (1 − 2)  2 . This pins down the equilibrium value of 2  0, the variance of  or
aggregate output as a function of  2 and  2 . Note that introducing the extra noise  into the
signal makes output in the self-fulfilling equilibrium less volatile. This is in contrast to the previous
                                                                                                                (1−2) 2

The reason for the smaller volatility of output when  2  0 is that the signal now is more noisy,
and firms attribute a smaller fraction of the signal to demand fluctuations. Note however that
this requires the additional restriction that the variance of the extra noise cannot be too big,
2   (1 − 2)  2  to ensure that  2  0

5.2        Multiple Sources of Signals

The government and public forecasting agencies as well as news media often release their own
forecasts of the aggregate economy. Such public information may influence and coordinate output
decisions of firms and aﬀect the equilibria. Suppose firms receive two independent signals, 
and  . The firm-specific signal  is based on a firm’s’ own preliminary information about its
demand and is identical to that in equation (30). The public signal in the case of the self-fulfilling
equilibrium is
                                                       =  +                                                  (32)

where we can interpret  as common noise in the public forecast of aggregate demand with mean
0 and variance  2 .
        We also assume that 2 =  2 , where   0. This assumption states that the variance of
the forecast error of the public signal for aggregate demand is proportional to the variance of 
or equilibrium output. Then in the certainty equilibrium where output is constant over time, the
public forecast of output is correct and constant as well.8

Proposition 4 If   12 , and  2   (1 − 2)  2 , then there exists a self-fulfilling rational expecta-
tions equilibrium with stochastic aggregate output log  =  =  +  + 0 ≡ ̂ + 0 , which has

                                                                                       (1−)2  

that firms place on the public signal is zero. Nevertheless aggregate output is stochastic, and driven
by the volatility of ̂ ≡  +  
        It is easy to see that the certainty equilibrium of Proposition 2 with  2 = 0 also applies
Proposition 4 since we also have  2 =  2 = 0, i.e. the public signal also becomes a constant. We
can then directly apply Proposition 2 to find the equilibrium output (see the proof in Appendix
A4).


6        Persistence
We have shown that imperfect information can lead to self-fulfilling fluctuations. By construction,
these fluctuations are iid across time. We now extend our baseline model to allow for persistent
    8
        See also the proof of Proposition 4 in the Appendix.


                                                               11
fluctuations in various ways. First, we show that it is possible to construct Markov sunspot equi-
libria. Depending on the sunspot, the agents coordinate on either the certainty equilibrium or on
the stochastic equilibrium. Second, we consider a Multiple-Island Economy, in which a fraction 
of islands are in the certainty equilibrium while the rest are in the uncertainty equilibrium. The
total output of all islands hence fluctuates persistently if  are hit by persistent shocks. Third we
introduce productivity shocks that can be persistent, and we show that output in a self-fulfilling
equilibrium inherits the stochastic properties of the productivity shock. Finally, we introduce time
variation into the parameters of the signal, or more precisely, into the weights  and (1 − ) en-
tering the sum of the idiosyncratic and the aggregate demand shocks. Such variations generate an
expected time variation or GARCH behavior in the equilibrium variance of output. In all these
cases, the persistence of output fluctuations does not require persistent imperfection information
across periods.


6.1   Markov Sunspot Equilibria

We now construct a persistent sunspot equilibrium with Markov transitions between the certainty
equilibrium and the self-fulfilling stochastic equilibrium. To construct such an equilibrium, we
introduce a sunspot  = 1 or 0 We have the transition probabilities Pr( = 1|−1 = 1) = 
                                                                                           1−
and Pr( = 0|−1 = 0) = . Then the stationary distribution is Pr(∞ = 1) =           1−+1− ,   and
                    1−
Pr(∞ = 0) =      1−+1− .   The agents observe the sunspots first and if  = 1, the coordinate on
the certainty equilibrium but if  = 0, they coordinate on the uncertainty equilibrium.

01667. Figure 1 illustrates how the economy alternates between periods of calm (the certainty
equilibrium) and high volatility (the self-fulfilling stochastic equilibrium). Of course the frequency
and duration of volatile periods can be adjusted by changing the parameters of the transition
matrix,  and . Because the self-fulfilling stochastic equilibrium has a lower mean output and
employment, an econometrician who does not believe in sunspots may incorrectly infer from the
fluctuations that the economy has been hit by a permanent negative technology shock with a higher
variance. Conversely, because the certainty equilibrium has a higher mean and a lower variance, an
econometrician may incorrectly infer that the economy has entered a period of "great moderation"
under "good luck".


6.2     Multiple-Island Economy

Now consider an economy with a continuum of identical islands of measure 1. The households on
each island have utility functions as in equation (1). Let us index each island by  ∈ [0 1]. Each
island may have one of two possible equilibria, a certainty or a self-fulfilling equilibrium, namely
log  = ̄0  or log  = 0 +  , where  is normally distributed variable with mean zero and
                  (1−2) 2
variance  2 =            .
                  (1−)2  
                                The aggregate economy is

                                             Z   1
                                       =             =  exp(log  )                    (33)
                                             0


To construct aggregate sunspot fluctuations in output, let a fraction 1 −  of islands have the
self-fulfilling equilibria in each period. So we have

                                      =  exp(̄0 ) + (1 −  ) exp(̂0 )                       (34)

where
                                      1       1 (1 − )2 + ( − 1) (2 − 3) 2
                            ̂0 = 0 +  2 =                                                    (35)

We now show that ̂0 is no larger than ̄0 . Notice that the term ̂0 ≤ ̄0 is equivalent to

                                    (1 − )2 + ( − 1) (2 − 3)    1
                                                                 ≤                                 (36)
                                          (1 − )2 ( − 1)        −1

or
                                             (2 − 3) ≤ (1 − )2                                  (37)


                                                            13
Rearranging terms, the above inequality can be written as:

                                    1 − 4 + 42 = (1 − 2)2 ≥ 0                                   (38)

                                          1
This inequality holds strictly if  6=    2.   Since  can be any stochastic sunspot process, it can
generate persistence in output according to equation (34). An increase in  allows more islands to
coordinate on the certainty equilibrium, which reduces overall uncertainty and results in a higher
aggregate output.


6.3   Productivity Shocks

If productivity  is a stochastic process that firms can observe before making production decisions,
in the self fulfilling equilibrium of our benchmark model we can express output as

                                       log  = 0 +  + log                                    (39)
                                    ¡     ¢              ¡     ¢
Using equation (17) but now setting 1 − 1 1 instead of 1 − 1  to unity, market clearing
requires the sum of log outputs of firms to equal aggregate log output for every  , as in equation
(A.10). However, as easily computed, the term log  now cancels out, so equilibrium is consistent
with any stochastic process for log  . Since preferences are logarithmic in consumption and linear
in leisure, and consumption is equal to output, optimal labor supply is constant and independent
of  . Therefore log  inherits the stochastic properties of  and exhibits the same persistence as
log  in the self-fulfilling equilibrium. Similarly, in the fundamental equilibrium log  also includes
log  as an additive term with a coeﬃcient of 1, but as before, does not depend on 


6.4   Time-varying 

Suppose  is time varying and follows the AR(1) process:

                                      = −1 + (1 − ) ̄ +                                   (40)
                                                ¡                       ¢
where ̄ = 025 and the  shock  has support − (1 − ) ̄ (1 − )̄ . It can be shown that  is
bounded between 0 and 12 . In this economy, all aggregate variables in the self-fulfilling equilibrium
are subject to additional shocks so that the variance of equilibrium aggregate demand is time-
varying across periods, with
                                                       (1 − 2 ) 2

                                                       (1 −  )2  

leading to GARCH behavior even though  2 is constant. This fits the observed behavior of unem-
ployment and inflation (where GARCH behavior was first discovered). The time variability of 

                                                        14
may reflect changes in how the signal captures the idiosyncratic and perceived aggregate demand
shocks over time. Note that  enters the "constant" term in Propositions 1-4, which in equilibrium
would also vary across periods.


7     General Models
So far we have relied on a particular general equilibrium model to generate self-fulfilling stochastic
equilibria. In this section, we show that such equilibria can exist in more general settings. We first
use a more abstract model to illustrate this point. We then construct two additional examples to
show that our approach to constructing self-fulfilling stochastic equilibria can be applied in other
economic environments, where an individual’s action depends on his/her expectation of a mix of
their idiosyncratic shock and the aggregate of actions.


7.1   A More Abstract Model
To illustrate the forces at work that produce the self-fulfilling stochastic equilibrium, we can abstract
from the household and production side of our model. Let us assume for simplicity that the economy
is log-linear, so optimal log output (or investment, price, labor, etc.) of firms is given by the rule

                                      =  {[ 0  +  ] | }                             (42)

This log-linear specification allows us to avoid any constant term in the equilibrium output, so we
can maintain a zero mean for  . The coeﬃcient  can be either negative or positive, so we can
have either strategic substitutability or strategic complementarity in firms’ actions. The signal 
is given by
                                      =  +  + (1 − )                                  (43)

where both the exogenous noise  and the idiosyncratic demand shock  are iid and normally
distributed with a zero mean. Market clearing then requires
                                                     Z
                                              =                                             (44)


In the certainty equilibrium  is constant, so equation (42) yields

                                                     0  2
                                   =  +                  ( +  )                       (45)
                                                 2 + 2  2

Substituting the above solution into equation (44) and integrating give
                                                 Z
                                           =         =                                    (46)


                                                     15
So unless  = 1, in which case there is a continuum of certainty equilibria, the unique certainty
equilibrium is given by  = 0.
    In the self-fulfilling stochastic equilibrium, assume that  is normally distributed with zero mean
and variance  2 . Based on the simple response function given by equation (42), signal extraction
implies
                                        0  2 + (1 − ) 2
                             =                                  [ +  + (1 − )  ]                          (47)
                                     2 + 2  2 + (1 − )2  2
Then market clearing requires
                                      Z
                                                          0  2 + (1 − ) 2
                                =          =                                  (1 − )                         (48)

Since this relationship has to hold for every realization of  , we need

                                              0  2 + (1 − ) 2
                                                                         (1 − ) = 1                                   (49)
                                           2 + 2  2 + (1 − )2  2

which implies
                                                    ( 0 − (1 +  0 )) 2 −  2
                                            2 =                                                                      (50)

Thus,  2 is pinned down uniquely and it defines the self-fulfilling equilibrium. Note that if   1,
                                                         ³       ´

then a necessary condition for  2 to be positive is  ∈ 0 1+   . If  0 = 1, this restriction becomes
                                                                               0

 ∈ (0 05), as in Propositions 1, 3 or 4. In particular, under the usual Dixit-Stiglitz specification
with strategic substitutability across intermediate goods, we have  = (1 − )  0. Note however
that if   1, which may correspond to a special model with externalities,  2 will be positive if
    ³         ´
        0
 ∈ 1+     1 . If   1, firm output will respond more than proportionately to aggregate demand,
           0

a situation that may in some sense be unstable. However, in the self-fulfilling equilibrium where
firms respond to the imperfect signal of aggregate demand, this more than proportionate response
                                                                                ³       ´

is moderated if the signal is weakly related to aggregate demand, that is if  ∈ 1+  1 .9
                                                                                                            0

   Uncertainty Equilibrium

Proposition 5 Under the signal log  =  log  + (1 − ) log  , there exists another equilibrium
such that  ≡ log  = ̄ +  where  represents investor sentiment and is normally distributed
                                                                        −(1−2)                                        (1−2)2

Proof. See the Appendix.

   Note in this example that, if we ignore the constant term ̄, we can rewrite equation (59) in a
log-linear form as
                                              =  [ + ( − 1) | ]                                                          (61)

and rewrite equation (56) approximately as

This is just a special case of the model in section 7.1 with  =  − 1  0,  0 = 1 and  2 = 0.
We can apply equation (50) directly to obtain  2 . Again, as in our baseline model, the investment
level in the uncertainty equilibrium is lower than that in the certainty equilibrium.


7.3    A Monetary Business Cycle Model with Imperfect Information

Our second example is based on Hellwig (2008). We introduce an idiosyncratic cost shock into the
firm’s problem in the Hellwig model. There is a continuum of firms indexed by  ∈ [0 1]. Each firm
sets its (log-) price  equal to its expectation of a target price ∗ , i.e. we have  =  ∗ . The
                                                     R
target price depends on the aggregate price  =   and its unit cost of production. The unit
cost in turn depends on an idiosyncratic cost shock  and aggregate output  (aggregate output
 aﬀects the common wage rate). Hence we have

                                                 =  ( +  +  )                                                             (63)

                                                                  18
where   0. To complete the model, we add a quantity equation as Hellwig (2008) did, so
 +  =  . Suppose there is no monetary shock, we then have  = − . We also assume that
the firm receives a mixed signal  =  + (1 − ) +  regarding its own cost shock and the
aggregate price (average of other firms’ pricing decisions). We then have

                                    =  {[(1 − ) +  ]| }                           (64)

If we assume that  are normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 2 , the certainty equilib-
rium is  = 0. However, there also exists a stochastic equilibrium where  is normally distributed
with mean 0 and variance

8     Conclusion
We often talk about the microfoundations of the macroeconomy, but seldom discuss the macro-
foundations of the microeconomy (as Keynes did in the past). In reality, the outcome of individual
agents’ optimal plans often depend crucially on macroeconomic conditions over which agents can
have significant influence collectively but little influence individually. When agents’ optimal deci-
sions must be conditioned on their expectations of such macroeconomic conditions, such expecta-
tions can be self-fulfilling when synchronized.
    We explored the Keynesian insight that changing sentiments or expectations about aggregate
demand can generate self-fulfilling output fluctuations under rational expectations when informa-
tion is noisy and imperfect. If production (or investment) decisions must be made in advance
under uncertain demand (or rates of return), optimal decisions based on sentiments can generate
self-fulfilling stochastic equilibria in simple production economies without externalities, persistent
informational frictions, or aggregate shocks to fundamentals. Our results hold even though there
is strategic substitutability rather than strategic complenentarity across the actions of agents (e.g.,
the optimal output of a firm declines with aggregate output and the optimal investment of each firm
declines with the aggregate capital stock). Although our settings are very simple, the basic logic
of our argument may be applied more generally, to richer and more complicated DSGE models.

it is derived using equations (3) and (4), it already embodies the market clearing for labor and

They constitute a market clearing stochastic rational expectations equilibrium. Now to show that
the mean of the self-fulfilling stochastic equilibrium exceeds that of the certainty equilibrium, note
that

A. 2     Proofs of Propositions 2 and 3

We start with the proof of the self-fulfilling equilibrium, Proposition 3, and give the proof of
Proposition 2 for the certainty equilibrium later below.

output is equal to

                                                                                                    ¡    ¢
is  = 0. Hence, to have a self-fulfilling expectations equilibrium, we require  ∈ 0 12 and
 2   (1 − 2)  2 . This pins down  2 , the variance of  or of output as a function of 2 and  2 .
Note that introducing the noise  into the signal makes output in the self-fulfilling equilibrium
                           (1−2) 2
less noisy: we had 2 =   (1−)2      in the previous case where the signal was  =  + (1 − )  .
The reason is that the signal is now more noisy, and firms attribute a smaller fraction of the signal
to demand fluctuations.

 A. 3     Proof of Proposition 4

In our previous case, output was equal to  =  + 0 . Now the agent receives two signals. The
first is  =  + (1 − ) +  , which is equivalent to  =  + (1 − ) +  as 0 is common
knowledge. The second signal is  =  +  , where we can interpret  as common noise in the
public forecast of aggregate demand. Conjecture that output is equal to

                                            log  =  = 0 +  +                            (A.61)



                                                           31
where 0  2 and  are constants to be determined. In that case,

                                         (   ) =  2 +  2                                       (A.62)
                       2
(Note that if  = − 2 , then this covariance term becomes zero.) The agent has two signals. The
                       

private signal is
                                    =  + (1 − )[ +  ] +                                       (A.63)

and the public signal is
                                                   =  +                                                (A.64)

Again, as in Proposition 3, if either  ≥ 12 , or 2   (1 − 2)  2 , then  2 +  2  2 ≤ 0 and there is
only the certainty equilibrium.
     Now we need to determine . Notice that

and (A.72) is satisfied. By our assumption  2 =  2 we have  = − 1 . Suppose that   12 . We

have to find out whether it is possible to have a rational expectation equilibrium satisfying 2  0

Using the relationship between  2 and  2 we have

Notice that the above equation has an unique solution for 2  0:

If  approaches zero, 2 also approaches to zero. However, since 2 =  2 and  = − 1  the variance
of output is given by

which is not aﬀected and the uncertainty equilibrium will continue to exist.
   Finally, since the public signal is not informative at all, the firm’s eﬀective signal is only the
private one. We can redefine

which then has variance

where we again use 2 =  2 and  = − 1 to derive (A.84). So output will be as in Proposition 3,

                                               =  +  + 0 = ̂ + 0                                           (A.85)

                                              ³                       ´

where the constant term is 0 =           2          (1−)   (−1)       2 −   22 (1−)2
                                                                                             .   With  redefined as ̂  the

property of output fluctuations is not aﬀected.
   We now turn to the certainty equilibrium. From (A.69) and (A.70), if  1 6= 0, we must have
 = 1. Namely aggregate output will be

                                                       = 0 +  +                                                (A.86)

If the public signal is still as  =  +  it fully reveals aggregate demand  . The private signal
would now be  =  + (1 − )[ +  ] +  =  + (1 − )[( − 0 )] +  where by construction
 − 0 will be known. If we define ̂ =  +   and attempt to define an equilibrium analogous to
the certainty equilibrium of Proposition 2 , with the diﬀerence that the aggregate demand shock

                                                                34
̂ =  + is not taken as zero but is perfectly observed each period prior to the production decision,
we reach a contradiction. Setting  = 0 the "constant" term 0 can be defined to include  and
solved as in Proposition 2 as a function of time-invariant parameters of the model. However this
will contradict the randomness of  unless  = 0 for all  The certainty equilibrium of Proposition
2 with constant output is not compatible with a time-varying public forecast of aggregate demand
since firms would forecast the constant output. The public signal  =  +  would be observed
in the self-fulfilling equilibrium, but in the certainty equilibrium the public forecast of aggregate
output would be a constant, and identical to the equilibrium in Proposition 2. If on the other hand
we use our assumption that the variance of the forecast error of the public signal is proportional to
the variance of  that is if 2 =  2  then we can recover the certainty equilibrium of Proposition
2 where output is constant: for this equilibrium we would have  =  = 0 for all ¥

                                                    1              2−1
                                                    2 Ω   +  2 2(1−)2
                                            ̄ =                                             (A.93)
                                                            2−

Finally

                                                            1 £                           ¤
                   Ω = ( − 1)2  2 +  2 −                 ( − 1)(1 − ) 2 +  2
                                                           1−
                                                            1 − 2 2
                            = (1 − )(2 − ) 2 +                
                                                            1− 
                                (1 − )(1 − 2) 2   1 − 2 2
                            =                        +       
                                     (1 − )2           1− 

hence we have

                                1      (1 − )(1 − 2) 2   1 − 2 2        2 − 1
                 ̄ =                [                      +        +  2          ]
                            2(2 − )        (1 − )2           1−          (1 − )2

                              −(1 − 2)
                       =                                                                     (A.94)
                            2(2 − )(1 − )2

Hence the uncertainty equilibrium has a lower mean than the certainty equilibrium. ¥
