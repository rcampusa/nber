                                              ABSTRACT

The politicization of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was extreme, with the popular moniker of
"Obamacare" and 54 House attempts to repeal the law in the four years after passage. Our study set
out to understand Washington state public's preferences about enrolling into ACA driven health insurance
programs, the role that political polarization may play on the chances that the uninsured would enroll
and the extent to which individual mandate may influence these choices. A representative mail survey
among the registered voters of Washington State. We find that 27% have not ruled out purchasing
insurance through the Exchange, but their ambiguity is most likely driven by conflicts between health
care needs and financial worries on one hand and their political views on the other. Overall, compared
to the insured population in 2013, uninsured are significantly more likely (OR = 2.0, 95%CI: 1.1, 3.4)
to enroll through the Exchange even after all adjustments including medical needs and financial worries.
This highlights that the individual mandate may have an independent effect on enrollment for the uninsured.
However, the individual mandate effect is found to be negligible (OR: 1.1, 95%CI: 0.50, 2.8) for the
uninsured who blamed the Democrats and/or President Obama for the 2013 governmental shutdown.
Political polarization appears to have a trickle down affect at the individual choices even beyond medical
needs and financial worries. Alternative strategies, for example bipartisan outreach, may be necessary
to convince certain groups of eligible beneficiaries to consider enrollment through the Exchange.

Introduction

Presence of health insurance is often considered the most important and mutable

determinant of access to care and the receipt of adequate health care services.1 With

the Affordable Care Act, the prospect of changing the high proportion of uninsured in the US

looks better than ever. Washington (WA) State is one of fifteen states that opted under the

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) to implement both the Medicaid expansion

and to institute their own health benefit exchange – the Washington Healthplanfinder

(www.wahealthplanfinder.org). From the State's perspective, increasing enrollment in both

Medicaid and the individual market through the public-private Exchange is critical to achieving

successful implementation of the ACA. The most recent enrollment figures (as of April 23, 2014)

for the state have been encouraging, indicating that about 587,000 Washingtonians have newly

enrolled in either private health coverage or the state's Medicaid program (Washington Apple

Health) since October 1, 2013. Of these, 164,000 residents enrolled in private health plans.


While enrollment in WA has been relatively successful, there remain questions of who, among

the eligible, are not enrolling in the exchange, and why are they opting out of coverage.

Understanding the choices people are likely to make and what influences them is an important

health policy issue. In this work we study the pre-enrollment expectations for buying health

insurance through the exchange, using data from a unique state-representative mail survey of

registered voters of age 18-64 years, conducted during December 2013 – January 2014. We

categorize voters into three categories based on their self-reported information: confident they

would buy insurance through the exchange, confident they would not buy through the exchange,

and uncertain. We then compare these groups along several dimensions, including health, past

health care use and insurance coverage and health care-related financial worries. These

comparisons can help project the likely size and characteristics of enrollees to the WA health

exchange in the future months.

                                                                                                   3
Since the reduction of the size of the uninsured population is one of the primary goals of ACA,

we also strive to learn what these uninsured (in 2013) individuals are planning to do in regards

to buying insurance from the exchange. In addition to measures of demand for health

insurance, we study to what extent political polarization may drive these beneficiaries away from

enrolling in ACA mandated health insurance through the Exchange. Specifically, this

informative analysis examines whether such political polarization dominates perceived need for

health care and for buying health insurance. Understanding these preferences is important for

enrollment efforts carried out by any state and the federal exchange.




STUDY DATA AND METHODS


In the last quarter of 2013, our research team fielded a statewide representative USPS mail

survey, the University of Washington Survey on Health-related Attitudes of Washington

Residents (UW SHARE), to understand 1) the public’s attitude toward health insurance changes

brought on by the ACA, 2) their current health insurance coverage, 3) their demand for health

care services, and 4) their self-reported health status. The survey also asked respondents

whether they plan to buy health insurance through the WA exchange in 2014. About 40,000

resident households with at least one person between 18-64 years of age were selected at

random from the publicly available list of registered voters in Washington State2 that contained

about 4 million registered voters. Households in some of the smaller counties were

oversampled. Because all household members could not be surveyed, the eldest person in the

household between the ages of 18-64 was asked to respond to the survey. The survey was

designed to be representative both at the state and the county level, and is one of the unique

surveys in the country to capture pre-ACA data. A paper-based mail survey was chosen to be



                                                                                                   4
the primary and only mode of survey in order to obtain responses from the remote corners of

the state where internet connections are not widely available. However, we were aware that the

survey may not appropriately represent the Hispanic population in the state as no Spanish

version of the survey was administered. Moreover, the survey, by design, would represent a

slightly older population as only the eldest in the household between 18-64 years of age was

asked to respond.


By January 31, 2014, we had received about 4,200 responses (10.5% responses rate). In order

to demonstrate representativeness of estimates from the UW SHARE survey, we compare key

demographic, health and insurance estimates to the latest estimates available from established

surveys such as the 2010 Washington State Population Health Survey (WASPHS) survey and

the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS). Importantly, we benchmark

estimates for the whole population and for citizens only using the WASPHS data, for better

comparisons to estimates from our survey, which only represents registered voters.


We then examine the distribution of the WA population who anticipate buying health insurance

through the WA exchange. We categorize this anticipation into three categories: “YES”, “NO”

and “Don’t Know/Not Sure”, where the last category potentially represents the fraction of the

population where further outreach could lead to added enrollment. To further understand these

population sub-groups, we compare respondents’ self-reported health, health care use and

healthcare related financial worries across these categories to see whether those who are

unsure about enrollment look more like those who are sure about enrolling or not enrolling

through the exchange. We project potential enrollment to the WA Health Exchange based on

these estimates.




                                                                                                 5
We explore the anticipated enrollment through the Exchange in 2014 between people who were

insured versus uninsured in 2013. We hypothesize that compared to the insured population in

2013, the uninsured are more likely to enroll through the Exchange in 2014 for obvious reasons.

However, to understand the impact of the individual mandate under ACA in creating

opportunities and incentives for the uninsured to enroll, we study how the anticipated enrollment

preferences among the uninsured, as compared to the insured, changes as we adjust for factors

likely correlated with the demand for health insurance: demographics, self-reported health,

health care demands and financial worries about paying medical bills. We hypothesize that even

after controlling for these factors the uninsured would be significantly more likely than the

insured to enroll through the Exchange due to the impact of the individual mandate.


Finally, we explore the impact of political polarization on anticipated enrollment through the WA

exchange by the uninsured. Political polarization is based on the question: “In your mind, who is

most responsible for the government shutdown in October 2013?” Answer to this question are

categorized as “Democrats and/or President Obama”, “Republicans and/or Tea Party

Republicans” and “All parties were equally responsible”. We explore whether anticipated

enrollment of the uninsured versus the insured are additionally influenced by political

polarization towards the Republican versus the Democratic Party. Our hypothesis is that

controlling for everything else that predicts health insurance demand, political polarization would

have no impact on the decision to enroll through the health care exchange, as the demand for

insurance among the uninsured should be similar across groups with different political views.




                                                                                                    6
RESULTS


Our final analytical survey sample consists of 4,169 respondents of age 18-64 years, after

dropping 25 observations (0.5%) due to high degree of missing values in their responses.

Survey weights were computed for this sample. As illustrated in Table 1, our estimates

benchmarked well with those from the citizens’ sample of 2010 WASPHS. Moreover the 2010

WASPHS for the entire population match well with the more recent 2012 estimates from the

BFRSS. Our survey did not underrepresent the Hispanic citizen’s population in 2013, but it

appears to underrepresent the African American and Asian population. However this may be a

manifestation of the fact that a fraction of these populations are classified as mixed race under

the “Other” category. As anticipated, our sample had lower rates of the youngest age group (18-

26 years olds). Our sample also underrepresents less than high school and up to two-year-

college educated but does not differ from population estimates of income distribution from 2010

WASPHS citizen’s sample. This may explain the fact that our sample has lower rates of

uninsured than the 2010 WASPHS citizen’s sample and are more likely to have employer-

sponsored insurance.


Figure 1(a) shows the distribution of anticipated purchase of insurance through WA exchange.

7% (95% CI: 5.5%, 8.0%) expressed that they will purchase insurance through the exchange

while nearly 20% (95% CI: 18%, 23%) were unsure. If this full 27% would enroll, it would

correspond to a total of 810,000 enrollees among the population of 3 million non-elderly adult

citizens in WA State. We discuss the implication of this number in the Discussions section.


Figure 1(b) examines the anticipated enrollment by the distribution of 2013 insurance-status.

Among people who were certain to buy insurance through the Exchange, 30% had no insurance

in 2013, while about 51% had some form of employer or private insurance. In contrast, among



                                                                                                    7
people who were certain not to buy insurance through the Exchange, 86% had some form of

employer or private insurance in 2013, which could reflect simple ineligibility for the exchange.

Forty-six percent of people who were unsure about buying through exchange had employer-

sponsored insurance in 2013, which could reflect uncertainty about the continuation of their

employment or their employer-coverage. However, a full 22% of those unsure about their

purchasing plans were uninsured in 2013, the target group for the exchange enrollment.


Many characteristics, except gender, are significantly associated with the anticipated enrollment

(Table 2). Compared to people who were not going to buy insurance through the Exchange,

people who were certain about buying were more likely to be older, be non-white, have less

than college education, have lower household income, be uninsured in 2013, demand more

health care in 2013 and have more financial worries regarding paying medical bills. This

certain-purchasing group seems to have higher demand for insurance. However, certain-

purchasers and certain-non-purchasers look similar in terms of their self-reported health status.

People who were certain they would buy from Exchange were much more supportive of

Supreme Court’s decision to uphold ACA and were more likely to blame the Republicans for the

October 2013 government shutdown.


In comparison, people who were unsure about buying from the Exchange were more likely to be

younger, be Hispanic, have less than High school education, and have self-reported poor health

compared to either group who have made up their minds about buying from the Exchange.

Interestingly, this ‘uncertain’ group’s health care demand in 2013 and financial worries about

medical bills were similar to those who would buy insurance through the Exchange and yet their

attitudes towards the Supreme Court ruling and the parties responsible for government

shutdown were similar to those who would not buy insurance through the Exchange.




                                                                                                    8
We then examine the likelihood of the uninsured in 2013 to enroll in the Exchange as compared

to the population who had insurance in 2013 (Table 3). Our study also finds that 30% of the

uninsured were certain about not enrolling through the Exchange in 2014, where nearly fifty

percent of them remained unsure. Twenty-three percent of the uninsured population blamed the

Democrats and/or President Obama for the government shutdown in 2013 compared to 14%

among the insured population (p=0.004). In contrast, the proportion who agreed with the

Supreme Court ruling on upholding ACA did not differ significantly across the uninsured and the

insured groups (45% vs 49%, p=0.39).


The unadjusted odds ratio of buying through the Exchange for the uninsured versus the insured

was 7.8 (95% CI: 5.5, 11.3). This difference between uninsured and insured populations is

largely due to demographic differences; the odds ration declines to 2.6 (95% CI: 1.7, 3.9) after

adjusting for demographics. However, further additions of other covariates related to health

insurance demand, such as self-reported health, health care demands, financial worry, ACA

perception and political polarization do not alter this odds ratio much. The final odds ratio, after

all adjustments, is 2.0 (95% CI: 1.3, 3.2) and remains significant, implying that the individual

mandate may have a significant role in making the uninsured enroll through the Exchange.


However, this potential impact of the individual mandate varies substantially across political

views (Figure 2). The odds ratio of buying from the Exchange in 2014 is significantly higher for

uninsured among people blaming all parties (OR: 1.99, 95% CI 1.1, 3.7) or only the Republicans

(OR: 3.6 95%CI 1.6, 8.2) for the governmental shutdown in 2013 versus those with any

insurance. Similar results are found when comparing uninsured to those with private insurance

in 2013. However, uninsured people were not more likely to buy from the Exchange if they

blamed the Democrats (OR: 1.1 95%CI 0.50, 2.8) for the governmental shutdown in 2013, after

controlling for all other factors. This implies that the individual mandate, as currently set, would


                                                                                                       9
have minimal effect on enrollment for the uninsured persons who are politically against the

Democrats.




CONCLUSIONS


Non-take-up of public programs among their target population has long been a policy concern.

In the context of health insurance, the non-take-up patterns are potentially even more important

since it has implications for not just the future of the policy, but also on the ability to pool risk

across individuals and the prevailing premiums in the future, and hence the viability of the entire

health insurance system envisioned under the ACA. Unlike the Massachusetts health insurance

reform signed by Governor Romney, the politicization of the ACA was extreme, with the popular

moniker of “Obamacare” and 54 House attempts to repeal the law in the four years after

passage. Therefore, our study set out to understand WA state public’s preferences about

enrolling into ACA driven health insurance programs and especially to understand the role that

political polarization may play on the chances that the uninsured would enroll.


Our analysis finds that, in terms of health and health care demand, individuals who remained

unsure of their future enrollment in Exchange plans were not significantly different from those

who were planning on enrolling. This is good news for policy makers concerned about adverse

selection in the market; the sickest do not seem to be the ones most certain to enroll in WA

State.3 As of April 23, 2014, the WA Health Insurance Commissioner’s Office reports that

587,000 (citizens and non-citizens) enrolled through the exchange (i.e. those who were not

Medicaid redeterminations). Our projections from these survey estimates that 810,000 citizens

have not ruled out enrolling through the WA exchange.



                                                                                                        10
However, we also find that public’s political views might be responsible for producing ambiguity

in their preference to enroll. People who were unsure about enrollment share similar health care

needs and financial worries with those who are certain to enroll but share similar political views

with those who are certain not to enroll. More intensive efforts may be needed convey the

benefits of enrollment in clear and non-partisan ways in order to sway these individuals to enroll.


One of the main targets of ACA is to reduce the number of uninsured. It is natural to assume

that, compared to those who had insurance in 2013, the uninsured would be more likely to take

up health insurance when they face affordable (through the individual market) or free (through

Medicaid expansion) health insurance options. Our data supports this assumption. In fact, our

findings, which suggest that even after controlling for all other factors the uninsured continue to

be significantly more likely to enroll through the Exchange, point out that on average the penalty

under the individual mandate may be effective in making the uninsured enroll.


However, our analyses also suggest that the current political rancor in our federal government,

and in the populace at large, plays a significant role in explaining these preferences among the

uninsured. Uninsured citizens blaming the Democrats and/or President Obama for the

government shutdown in 2013 are not more likely than those who were insured in 2013 to enroll

through the WA Exchange. This effect (of lack of it) is not driven by just one’s views on the ACA

that contribute to this divisiveness, since we include a measure of one’s stance on the Supreme

Court ruling on the ACA’s constitutionality as an adjustor in our analyses. This indicates it may

be difficult to enroll certain segments of the eligible population through the Exchange.

Alternative strategies, for example bipartisan outreach, may be necessary to convince these

groups of eligible beneficiaries to consider enrollment. This is especially true if such dynamics,

or possibly even more political divisiveness, persist in those states where a Federal Health

Exchange is set up.
