                                           ABSTRACT

We derive a measure that captures the extent to which overlapping ownership structures shift
managers’ incentives to internalize externalities. A key feature of the measure is that it allows for
the possibility that not all investors are attentive to whether a manager’s actions benefit the
investor’s overall portfolio. Empirically, we show that potential drivers of ownership overlap,
including mergers in the asset management industry and the growth of indexing, could in fact
diminish managerial motives. Our findings illustrate the importance of accounting for investor
inattention and cast doubt on the possibility that the growth of common ownership has had a
significant impact on managerial incentives.

    There is a growing sense among academics and practitioners that common ownership—where two
firms are at least partially owned by the same investor—is on the rise among U.S. firms and that this could
have important implications for acquisitions, executive pay, and governance, among numerous other
outcomes (e.g., see Antón et al., 2016; Harford et al., 2011; He and Huang, 2017; He et al., 2018; Kempf
et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017). Such common ownership might affect firms’ strategic choices since common
owners have an incentive to internalize how each firm’s actions will affect the value of other firms in the
portfolio (Easterbrook and Fischel, 1982; Hansen and Lott, 1996; Rubin, 2006). This observation has led

some to argue that common ownership by institutions may contribute to anticompetitive behaviors by firms
(e.g., Azar et al., 2016, 2018) and that legal and regulatory actions are needed to limit institutions’ ability

to offer index funds and hold significant stakes in some industries (e.g., Posner et al, 2016).1

    Despite the recent attention such common ownership has received, there is little discussion of when, if
at all, managers will have an incentive to internalize the preferences of common investors, and more
importantly, how one should quantify the extent to which common ownership affects managers’ incentives.
For example, while there is a sense that the rise of common ownership is driven, in part, by the merger of
asset managers (e.g., see Azar et al., 2016, 2018) and the increasing popularity of index investing (e.g., see
Harford et al., 2011), there is little discussion of whether we should expect such mergers and index-induced
overlapping ownership structures to increase managers’ motives to internalize how their actions might

affect the value of other firms. For example, if index fund investors or asset managers with larger, more
diversified holdings are less informed or attentive to firm-specific actions, then managers would have little
incentive to internalize the impact of their actions on the holdings of such investors.
    In this paper, we fill this void by deriving a model-based measure that quantifies the impact of common
owners on managerial motives. Specifically, for a given pair of stocks, we quantify the impact ownership
overlap will have on a manager’s incentive to internalize how their actions might affect the value of the

other firm. The resulting measure is simple and has a number of appealing properties. In particular, the
measure is general in that it does not depend on the nature, sign, or magnitude of the externality and is best
seen as a relative measure of how important common ownership is for manager incentives per unit of

externality. Moreover, our model shows that the impact of each common investor on managerial incentives

 Posner et al. published a condensed version of their argument as an op-ed article in The New York Times on December
7, 2016, which is available at http://nyti.ms/2gRQKhH. Similarly, Elhauge (2016) argues that existing antitrust law
can and should be used to undo horizontal shareholdings that have led to anti-competitive outcomes.

will intuitively be the product of three inputs: the extent to which the manager cares about that investor’s
preferences (which is proportional to the investor’s ownership stake), the importance that investor places
on the externality (which is proportional to their ownership stake in the other firm), and the likelihood that
investor is informed about whether the manager’s actions have improved the value of their overall portfolio
(which, among other things, is related to the importance of the firm in the investor’s portfolio).
    A key feature of our measure is that it accounts for the possibility that not all institutional investors are
fully attentive, which finds substantial empirical support (e.g., Ben-Rephael et al., 2017; Fang et al., 2014;
Lu et al., 2016; Schmidt, forthcoming). This differs from other measures of common ownership, which
assume that all investors are fully informed about the externalities that firms impose on each other [e.g.,
see the MHHID measure that was developed by Bresnahan and Salop (1986) and O'Brien and Salop (2000)
and implemented by Azar et al., (2018)]. In particular, our model assumes that less attentive investors will
not contribute as much to managers’ incentive to internalize how their choices affect other firms. This
assumption is consistent with evidence that investor inattention reduces firm monitoring and weakens the
incentives of managers to take actions that benefit their shareholders (Kempf et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017).
Our measure also differs from existing measures in that it is invariant to the specific nature of externalities,
allowing for its use in studying the effects of common ownership in a wider range of contexts.
    We then take our measure of common ownership to the data to illustrate the importance of accounting
for investor attention. In doing so, we must make specific modeling choices, including how managers
ascribe importance weights to each investor, but we show that our subsequent findings are not sensitive to
these choices. And, we begin by assuming that an investor’s likelihood of being attentive is increasing in
how important the stock is in the overall investor’s portfolio, which is both theoretically micro-founded
(e.g., Veldkamp and Van Nieuwerberg, 2010) and supported by empirical evidence (Fich et al., 2015;
Gargano and Rossi, 2018; Iliev and Lowry, 2015; Iliev et al., 2018; Ward et al., 2018).
    Accounting for investor attention is necessary to properly quantify the rise of common ownership and
its importance for managerial motives. If one assumes full investor attention, then managerial incentives to
internalize ownership overlap for the average stock pair increased between 1980 and 2012 by 2,937%. But,
if one instead allows for investor inattention, average incentives increased by 162% to 1,301%, depending
on how one models attention. The smaller increase in incentives, which is concentrated among small-cap
stocks and holds regardless of how stock pairs are weighted, occurs because the rise of common ownership
coincides with the average investor becoming increasingly diverse in their holdings, and hence, less



                                                       2
attentive as an owner. This finding highlights that investor inattention can affect how much common
ownership affects incentives, which is still much debated by academics and policy makers.
     Further highlighting the importance of investor attention, we find that managerial motives to internalize
externalities can actually be lower following asset manager mergers. Calculating the predicted changes in
managerial incentives resulting from the merger of BGI and Blackrock in 2009, we find that 39% to 56%
of stock-pairs would experience a decline in incentives to internalize externalities following the merger.
This decline also occurs for many stock pairs in the airlines industry, which is a setting where the merger
is argued to have increased such incentives (Azar et al., 2018). This decrease in incentives occurs because
some stocks become less important in the larger, more diversified portfolio of the merged entity, which can
reduce the likelihood the larger common investor is as attentive as the two previously unmerged common
investors. Only when we assume full attention does the merger necessarily increase managerial incentives.
     The importance of index investing for a possible shift in managerial motives is also questionable. When
measuring managerial incentives to internalize externalities, the relative contribution of institutions that
primarily offer index funds is no more than 50% in recent years. Moreover, we find that managers’ incentive
to internalize externalities sometimes decreases when both firms are included in the same index (e.g., the
S&P or Russell indexes). For example, we find that if both firms become members of the Russell 2000
index, managers’ incentive to internalize externalities decreases, on average, by 12% to 30%.
     The index inclusion findings highlight a key aspect of our model; ownership overlap is a necessary but
insufficient condition for shifting managerial incentives. Two stocks’ inclusion in the same index, combined
with the growing popularity of index funds, naturally increases ownership overlap, which enhances
managerial motives to internalize externalities. However, if these new common investors are less attentive,
then managers’ incentives to internalize externalities can decline. By reducing the importance of each stock
in investors’ overall portfolios, indexing decreases investors’ likelihood of evaluating whether managers
take actions to improve the overall value of investors’ increasingly diverse portfolios.2
     Given the important role of investor inattention, we also provide estimates of the association between
investor attention and portfolio weights. While theory and empirical evidence tell us this association is
positive, the exact functional form is unclear. Following Iliev and Lowry (2015), we proxy for an

2 While there is evidence that index funds and the institutions that offer them successfully influence firms’ governance
structures using low-cost monitoring techniques, like developing proxy-voting guidelines that encapsulate their view
on best governance practices and voting accordingly for all firms (e.g., see Appel et al., 2016, 2018), it is an open
question whether index funds possess the resources or incentives necessary to monitor more firm-specific policy
choices, like investment and pricing choices, that might in turn affect the value of other stocks in their large portfolios.



                                                             3
institutional investor’s attention by examining whether its votes follow the recommendations of the proxy
advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). The underlying premise is that, all else equal,
attentive investors are less likely to rubber stamp ISS recommendations. We confirm earlier findings in the
literature that institutional investors are more likely to disagree with ISS’s recommendations for stocks that
represent a larger proportion of their portfolio, but we also find robust evidence that this relationship is
concave, suggesting that the increase in investor’s attention is diminishing as the proportion gets larger.
    The estimated concave association between investor attention and portfolio weights does not change

our earlier findings. To illustrate this, we let the “data speak for itself” by fitting the attention function
nonparametrically and using the implied estimates to construct a fitted version of our proposed measure of
common ownership. We find that our main results continue to hold with the fitted version of our measure.

    Combined, our findings illustrate the importance of accounting for investor attention and cast doubt on
the idea that overlapping ownership structures, particularly those driven by asset manager mergers and the
growth of indexing, significantly shift managers’ incentives or induce anticompetitive behaviors among

firms in the airline and banking industries (e.g., Azar et al., 2016, 2018). A bulk of the ownership overlap
documented in those industries is driven by diversified asset managers such as BlackRock, State Street, and
Vanguard. However, since these firms own large stakes in virtually every U.S. publicly-listed company, a
common ownership measure that accounts for investor attention will suggest that such diversified investors
are unlikely to provide managers with strong incentives to soften competition. Moreover, these studies

attempt to overcome endogeneity concerns using the growth of index funds and the merger between
BlackRock and BGI as exogenous increases in managers’ incentive to soften competition. But our analysis
indicates that managers’ incentive to internalize externalities (i.e., soften competition) can actually be
weaker, not stronger when two stocks are included in the same index and after the Blackrock/BGI merger.
    In further support of this argument, we also show that the main results of an important paper in this
literature, Azar et al. (2018), are not robust to using our proposed measure of common ownership. In

particular, we find no evidence that common ownership is positively associated with prices in the airline
industry under a variety of different assumptions on how investor attention is allocated. These findings
raise additional questions regarding the conclusions of this and other related studies that use MHHID as a

measure of common ownership and lend support to the argument that the documented correlations are
instead driven by the endogeneity of the MHHID measure being used (e.g., see Dennis et al., 2018).




                                                      4
     Interestingly, we do find evidence that managerial incentives to internalize externalities positively
predict target selections in acquisitions. This is particularly true when using the version of our common
ownership measure where we fit the attention function nonparametrically using voting data. While
suggestive, these findings must be interpreted with caution since they do not isolate exogenous variation in
common ownership, and we cannot exclude the possibility that omitted factors drive this correlation.
Nevertheless, our analysis of common ownership’s association with both pricing in the airline industry and
target selection in acquisitions underscores the applicability of our measure to a wide range of contexts.
     Overall, our findings contribute to the growing literature on common ownership by providing a
framework for understanding when common ownership is and is not likely to shift managerial incentives.
Quantifying the impact of overlapping ownership structures on incentives is important both for those
seeking to make policy recommendations and for those attempting to study the impact of common

ownership.3 The use of common ownership measures that fail to account for investor attention could

introduce measurement errors and induce biases that are hard to sign. To our knowledge, we are also the
first to document time series and cross-sectional patterns of common ownership and its impact on
managerial incentives across the entire universe of U.S. publicly-traded firms.
     We also provide a general way to measure common ownership that can be used in future studies. While
we make specific modeling choices when taking our proposed measure to the data, our model is flexible in
that future researchers can easily change the importance weights that managers assign to different investors
(e.g., by instead assuming that managers only care about their largest five investors) or how one models
investor attention (e.g., by instead assuming economies of scale in monitoring and adding investors’ assets
under management (AUM) as another input for an investor’s likelihood of being attentive). Additionally,
we show that it is possible to construct versions of our measure that capture a manager’s incentive to
internalize the impact of their actions on an entire set of firms (e.g. all product-market competitors), which

may be useful in studying whether common ownership induces anti-competitive behaviors.4

  E.g., recent work evaluates the impact common ownership might have on firm competitiveness (Azar et al., 2016,
2018; Dennis et al., 2018; Gramlich and Grundl, 2017; O’Brien and Waehrer, 2017), governance (Azar, 2012; He et
al., forthcoming; Jung, 2013; Kang et al., 2013; Kempf et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017), corporate outcomes (Matvos and
Ostrovsky, 2008; Gompers and Xuan, 2009; Harford et al., 2011; Masulis and Nahata, 2011; Cici et al., 2015; He and
Huang, 2016), executive pay (Antón et al., 2016; Kwon, 2016), stock price movements (Jotikasthira et al., 2012; Anton
and Polk, 2014; Bartram et al., 2015; Hau and Lai, 2016), credit risks (Massa and Žaldokas, 2016) and weekly return
predictability (Gao et al., 2016).

  To facilitate future research in this area, we will be posting versions of our proposed measure on WRDS so that other
researchers can more readily study the potential determinants and effects of common ownership.



                                                          5
      Finally, our paper contributes to the theoretical literature on common ownership (e.g., see Azar, 2017;
Edmans et al., 2018; Hansen and Lott, 1996; Kraus and Rubin, 2010; Lopez and Vives, forthcoming;
O’Brien and Salop, 2000; Rubin, 2006). Similar to these papers, we study how common ownership might
affect corporate outcomes by shifting managerial incentives. The key distinction between our model and
these papers is our assumption that investors may not pay full attention to actions taken by managers. As a
consequence, managers in our model do not fully internalize the preferences of their inattentive investors,
which can have important implications for understanding of the importance of common ownership. This

feature also differentiates our approach from Lewellen and Lewellen (2018), who argue that common
owners themselves may not have incentives to internalize externalities.

1.    Measuring common ownership

      In this section, we construct a simple model that captures key features that are important for how
investors affect managerial motives and use it to propose a novel measure of common ownership that
captures the impact of ownership overlap on managers’ incentives. A key feature of the model is an
assumption that not all investors are fully attentive to managers’ actions. We then compare our proposed
measure against other measures of common ownership used in the existing literature.


1.1    The model and proposed measure, GGL
      The main premise of the model is that firms impose externalities on one another, and managers have
an incentive to internalize these externalities when shareholders benefit from this and are attentive to
whether the manager has done so. In the model, managers will care about these attentive common investors
since a decline in shareholder support (e.g. via voting, negative public statements, or the selling of shares)
adversely affects managers’ utility. Since the magnitude of externalities and how their internalization
affects the likelihood of shareholder support is not observed, the measure we develop captures the relative
effect of the ownership overlap on managerial incentives per unit of the unobserved externality.

      Preliminaries: We consider an economy with 𝑁 ≥ 2 public firms, indexed by n, where each firm has

its own manager. The manager of firm n chooses a policy 𝑥& ∈ {0,1}, and the value of firm n is given by

𝑉& (𝑿) = 𝑣̅& + 𝛥& (𝑿) where 𝑣̅& > 0 and 𝑿 = (𝑥7 , … , 𝑥9 ). Parameter 𝑣̅& can be considered the market

value of firm n absent the effect of policy choices, while 𝛥& (𝑿) captures the effect of policy choices (from

both manager n and the managers of all other firms) on firm n’s value.




                                                      6
    The externalities from managerial actions are given by 𝛥& (𝑿) = ∑9
                                                                     ;<7 𝛥&,; (𝑥; ). If 𝛥&,; (𝑥; ) > 0

(𝛥&,; (𝑥; ) < 0) then firm m imposes a positive (negative) externality on firm n by adopting policy 𝑥; .

We do not make any restrictions on 𝛥&,; (𝑥; ), and the externalities can be asymmetric between two firms,

such that 𝛥&,; (∙) ≠ 𝛥;,& (∙). To ensure that we only measure the direct effect of common ownership on

managers’ incentives, we assume that there are no complementarities or substitution effects across firms
with respect to the externality, which implies that there are no strategic interactions between managers (i.e.,
the optimal decision of manager n is independent of actions taken by other managers).

    Ownership structure: We assume there are 𝐼 ≥ 1 large investors in the economy, where the fraction

of firm n’s shares held by investor 𝑖 is given by 𝛼C,& ∈ [0,1]. Short sales are not allowed (because 𝛼C,& is

non-negative), and we allow for the possibility that ∑FC<7 𝛼C,& < 1, since shares that are not owned by any

of the large investors can be owned by retail/noise investors. The value of investor i's portfolio is given

by 𝑊C (𝑿) = 𝑌C + ∑9
                  &<7 𝛼C,& 𝑉& (𝑿), where the term 𝑌C ≥ 0 captures non-traded assets, T-bills, or any other

asset which has no externalities with any of the other N firms. The weight of firm n in the portfolio of

investor i before policies are chosen can then be defined as 𝛽C,& = 𝛼C,& 𝑣̅& /(𝑌C + ∑9
                                                                                     ;<7 𝛼C,; 𝑣̅; ).

    Voting and shareholder voice: We assume one share one vote, where each investor casts her votes
either for or against the manager of each of her portfolio companies. This can be interpreted literally as a

vote during director elections or on a given proposal, or it can simply be an expression of discontent or
support of the incumbent manager. In other words, while we model shareholders as expressing their views
to managers and exerting influence via votes, one can view our model more generally as capturing any
influence that shareholders might exert that is proportional to their ownership share. Such influence might
occur through a variety of channels including public statements or the threat to exit one’s position.
    Investors can either be attentive to the manager’s policy choices or inattentive to such choices. An

investor is attentive with probability 𝑔 ∈ [0,1] and inattentive with probability 1 − 𝑔. This assumption

captures the limited attention of investors and that some investors are more likely pay attention to a firm

(and its manager’s actions). An inattentive investor votes for management with probability 𝛾C ∈ [0,1],

which is an investor-specific parameter and unaffected by manager policy choices. An attentive investor,

however, votes for management with probability 𝜌𝑤C,& (𝑿), where 𝑤C,& (𝑿) is defined as the improvement

in the value of investor i’s portfolio from manager n’s policy choice relative to the worst possible policy

that manager could have chosen, and parameter 𝜌 > 0 ensures 𝜌𝑤C,& (𝑿) ∈ [0,1]. Specifically,



                                                      7
𝑤C,& (𝑿) = 𝑊C (𝑥& , 𝑿P& ) − 𝑚𝑖𝑛S 𝑊C (𝑥& , 𝑿P& ), where 𝑿P& is the policy choices of all managers, except

manager n. Intuitively, an attentive investor is more likely to support the manager if the action taken by the
manager increases her portfolio value.

     The function used to capture an investor’s likelihood of being attentive, 𝑔, is quite flexible and could

conceivably depend on a number of factors. For illustrative purposes, we begin by assuming that 𝑔 only

depends on how important a stock is the overall portfolio of the investor. Specifically, we assume 𝑔 is an

increasing function in 𝛽C,& , such that investors are more likely to be attentive for stocks that comprise a

larger proportion of their overall portfolio, which is both theoretically micro-founded (e.g., Veldkamp and
Van Nieuwerberg, 2010) and supported by empirical evidence (e.g., Fich et al., 2015; Iliev et al., 2018).
However, as discussed later, it will be easy for future researchers to modify our proposed common

ownership measure by putting more structure on the functional form of 𝑔 or by adding inputs into the 𝑔

function to capture other potentially important factors (e.g., see Iliev et al., 2018).

     Given this setup, the probability 𝑝C,& (𝑿) that investor i votes in support of manager n is given by

                               𝑝C,& (𝑿) = U1 − 𝑔V𝛽C,& WX 𝛾C + 𝑔V𝛽C,& W𝜌𝑤C,& (𝑿).

And, assuming retail investors vote for manager n with probability 𝛾Z[\]C^,& ∈ [0,1] and all votes are

conditionally independent across investors, the total expected fraction of votes in support of manager n is

                            𝑃& (𝑿) = 𝛾Z[\]C^,& V1 − ∑FC<7 𝛼C,& W + ∑FC<7 𝛼C,& 𝑝C,& (𝑿).

     Managerial objective and decisions: Manager n maximizes

                                          𝑈& (𝑿) = 𝐵& (𝑥& ) + 𝜆& 𝑃& (𝑥& , 𝑿P& ).

Intuitively, when the manager chooses a policy for his firm, she trades off the expected support from the

shareholders of her firm, 𝑃& (𝑥& , 𝑿P& ), with the private benefits (if 𝐵& (𝑥& ) > 0) or costs (if 𝐵& (𝑥& ) < 0)

from choosing policy 𝑥& . Parameter 𝜆& ≥ 0 is the weight the manager puts on getting shareholder support,

which reflects the strength of the corporate governance in firm n.

     Model solution: Manager n chooses 𝑥& = 1 if and only if 𝑈& (1, 𝑿P& ) ≥ 𝑈& (0, 𝑿P& ). Letting 𝜶𝒏 =

{𝛼C,& }𝑰𝒊<𝟏 and 𝜷𝒏 = {𝛽C,& }𝑰𝒊<𝟏 , we show in the Appendix that this inequality holds whenever

Intuitively, the incentive of manager n to choose policy 𝑥& = 1 depends on the expected increase in the

shareholder support, as given by ∑FC<7 𝛼C,& 𝑔V𝛽C,& Wo∑9
                                                      ;<7 𝛼C,; 𝜌o𝛥;,& (1) − 𝛥;,& (0)pp, and on the

normalized change in the manager’s private benefits, as given by [𝐵& (1) − 𝐵& (0)]/𝜆& .

    Definition of common ownership’s effect on incentives: We define the effect of common ownership
between firms A and B on manager A’s incentives as

     𝐶𝑂(𝐴, 𝐵) = 𝛱u (𝜶𝟏 , … , 𝜶𝑵 ; 𝜷𝟏 , … , 𝜷𝑵 ) − 𝛱u (𝜶𝟏 , … , 𝜶𝑩 = 𝟎, … , 𝜶𝑵 ; 𝜷𝟏 , … , 𝜷𝑩 = 𝟎, … , 𝜷𝑵 ).

That is, 𝐶𝑂(𝐴, 𝐵) is the change in manager A’s utility when choosing 𝑥& = 1 over 𝑥& = 0 under the existing

ownership structure relative to a counterfactual in which no investor of firm A owns shares in firm B (𝜶𝑩 =

𝟎) and investors’ portfolio weights for all firms other than firm B do not change. In other words, 𝐶𝑂(𝐴, 𝐵)

captures how manager A’s incentives to adopt policy 𝑥& = 1 would change if each common investor in

firms A and B sold their shares in B and reinvested them in 𝑌C . It can be shown that

                            𝐶𝑂(𝐴, 𝐵) = 𝜌o𝛥x,u (1) − 𝛥x,u (0)p ∑FC<7 𝛼C,u 𝑔V𝛽C,u W𝛼C,x .

    Several remarks are in order. First, 𝐶𝑂(𝐴, 𝐵) does not assume 𝑥& = 1 is optimal; it only measures the
effect of shareholder overlap between firms A and B on the incentives of the manager A to adopt this policy.

Second, 𝐶𝑂(𝐴, 𝐵) need not equal 𝐶𝑂(𝐵, 𝐴) since externalities between firms can be asymmetric and

because the weight of firm A in investors’ portfolios, 𝛽C,u , which contributes to investor attention, can be

different from the weight of firm B, 𝛽C,x . Third, the change in managers’ utility only depends on the change

in shareholder support since the change in private benefits from choosing 𝑥& = 1 does not depend on

common ownership. And finally, the sign of 𝐶𝑂(𝐴, 𝐵) is determined by the sign of 𝛥x,u (1) − 𝛥x,u (0).

    The expected shift in manager A’s incentives, 𝐶𝑂(𝐴, 𝐵), has some intuitive properties. If both policies

of firm A exert the same externality on firm B, then 𝐶𝑂(𝐴, 𝐵) = 0, and as expected, manager A has no

reason to factor in the effect of her policy choice on firm B. Additionally, investor i contributes more to

𝐶𝑂(𝐴, 𝐵) in absolute terms when she (1) holds more shares in firm A (because the manager cares more
about the investor’s opinion if the investor holds more shares), (2) holds more shares in firm B (because the
investor cares more about the externalities imposed on firm B when she holds more shares of firm B), and
(3) when firm A receives a larger weight in her portfolio (because the manager understands that the investor
is more likely to be an informed and attentive to firm A’s actions).
    Proposed Measure and Intuition: Since researchers cannot typically observe the sign or magnitude
of the externalities in the data, let alone how they might change the probability an informed common

investor supports the manager (as captured by parameter 𝜌), the measure we propose is invariant to these
factors and only accounts for the absolute change in shareholder support that stems from changes in the

ownership structure. Specifically, we drop the term 𝜌o𝛥x,u (1) − 𝛥x,u (0)p from 𝐶𝑂(𝐴, 𝐵), and use
                                                       F

                                      𝐺𝐺𝐿(𝐴, 𝐵) = m 𝛼C,u 𝑔V𝛽C,u W𝛼C,x
                                                     C<7

as our measure of common ownership and its impact on managerial incentives to internalize externalities.
        Defined as such, GGL is a relative measure of how common ownership affects managerial

incentives per unit of the externality. In other words, a doubling of 𝐺𝐺𝐿(𝐴, 𝐵) reflects a 100% increase in

manager A’s incentive to internalize externalities on firm B. This interpretation holds because 𝜌𝐺𝐺𝐿(𝐴, 𝐵)

reflects the marginal change in shareholder support (expressed as a proportion) due to common ownership

per unit of the externality that manager A’s action has on firm B. For example, if 𝜌𝐺𝐺𝐿(𝐴, 𝐵) = 0.0002

and the absolute change in value of firm B because of manager A’s action choice, |𝛥x,u (1) − 𝛥x,u (0)|, is

$100, then manager A’s action choice will swing shareholder support by 100×0.0002=2 percentage points

because of common ownership. However, because we do not observe the intensity by which externalities

map into the likelihood of an investor’s support, 𝜌, we use 𝐺𝐺𝐿(𝐴, 𝐵), which is proportional to this per unit

effect of the externality on shareholder support and allows one to analyze the relative importance of

common ownership across stock pairs and time. To facilitate the interpretation of 𝐺𝐺𝐿(𝐴, 𝐵) as a relative

measure, our subsequent analyses rescale 𝐺𝐺𝐿(𝐴, 𝐵) by its sample average so that a value of one indicates

the average level of incentives, a value of two represents twice the average level of incentives, and so on.
        The proposed measure, GGL, has a number of intuitive properties. Common investors that are

completely inattentive, such that 𝑔 = 0, do not shift managers’ incentives to internalize externalities,

whereas a doubling in each investor’s likelihood of being attentive, holding all else equal, doubles a

manager’s incentive to internalize externalities. Moreover, the partial derivative of 𝐺𝐺𝐿(𝐴, 𝐵) with respect

to 𝛼C,x is given by 𝛼C,u 𝑔V𝛽C,u W, indicating that an increase in investor i’s holding of stock B increases

manager A’s incentive to internalize the externalities of her actions on firm B more when investor i is

attentive (i.e., 𝑔 is higher) and holds a larger proportion of shares in firm A (i.e., 𝛼C,u is higher). Likewise,

an increase in an investor’s firm A holding, 𝛼C,u , has a bigger impact on manager A’s incentive to internalize

externalities on firm B when that investor is more attentive or holds a larger ownership stake in firm B.




                                                       10
    Flexibility and other possible modeling choices: Our model and the resulting measure of common
ownership is quite flexible. For example, our model can be easily augmented to allow managers to ascribe
importance weights to the votes of different investors. In the baseline measure, managers assign importance
weights to investors based on the proportion they own. But, if one wishes to instead assume that managers
only care about the support of investors that hold at least 5% of the firm, then our model indicates that one
should only aggregate over investors that own at least 5% of firm A when constructing 𝐺𝐺𝐿(𝐴, 𝐵).
Alternatively, if one wishes to assume that managers only care about the preferences of their largest five
investors, then one would construct 𝐺𝐺𝐿(𝐴, 𝐵) using the five investors with the largest 𝛼C,u . A solution for

the more general model that accounts for these possibilities is provided in the Appendix.
    Our measure can also be adjusted to reflect differing views regarding the importance of various
governance mechanisms. As noted earlier, our model captures any influence that shareholders might exert
that is proportional to their ownership share. Therefore, if one believes that shareholders threat to exit is the
relevant governance mechanism, then no adjustment is needed; the investor’s economic ownership is the
only factor that matters. On the other hand, if one views shareholder voice is the only relevant governance
mechanism, then managers would only care about the opinion of investors who own voting rights. In this
case, 𝛼C,u should only include the voting shares of the investor i in firm A. In our baseline measure, we

choose to measure influence by ownership shares since they will capture both the influence of exit and of
voice and because of known difficulties in accurately measuring voting rights (Dennis et al., 2018).
    Because of how an investor’s likelihood of being attentive enters the measure, one can also easily
change how one models investor attention. For example, if one believes that there are economies of scale
in monitoring, one could add investors’ assets under management (AUM) as another input to 𝑔.5 Likewise,
if one believes investors’ monitoring intensity varies with firm-specific characteristics, like size or past
profitability, one could add these as additional inputs. The model and measure can also be easily augmented
to capture differences in monitoring across types of investors. For example, if one believes that index funds
and the institutions that offer them are completely uninformed, one could set 𝑔 = 0 for such investors.

    One can also vary the functional form of 𝑔 to create different assumptions on how attention is allocated

across portfolio companies. For example, if 𝑔V𝛽C,u W is convex (concave), then firms representing a larger

share of an investor’s portfolio get proportionally more (less) attention from the investor relative to their

5 Notice that AUM already plays an important role in our GGL measure: Common investors with a larger AUM own
larger stakes, and as a result, managers internalize their preferences to a larger extent.



                                                       11
portfolio weight. To create a measure that assumes all investors are perfectly informed, one would set 𝑔 =

1 for all investors. Because theory gives us no clear guidance regarding the proper functional form for g,

we begin by assuming that 𝑔V𝛽C,u W is linear such that 𝑔V𝛽C,u W = 𝛽C,u , but for robustness, we show that our

subsequent empirical findings are not sensitive to using different functional form assumptions, including
an estimation of the attention function using voting data (see Section 5).
      Finally, the GGL measure can easily be aggregated to capture how common ownership affects the
incentives of managers to internalize the externalities their firms impose on an entire group of firms (e.g.,
industry). As we show in Section 6, such an aggregated measure might be useful when studying whether
common ownership is likely to shift the incentives of managers to consider the valuations of product market
competitors (e.g., Azar et al., 2016, 2018; Dennis et al., 2018; Gramlich and Grundl, 2017; O’Brien and

Waehrer, 2017). Specifically, if 𝛥;,u (1) − 𝛥;,u (0) is the same across all firms in a reference set Γ, then

the group-level measure is given by 𝐺𝐺𝐿(Γ) = (1/|Γ|) ∑u∈~ ∑;∈~,;•u 𝐺𝐺𝐿(𝐴, 𝑚), where |Γ| is the

number of firms in set Γ. Note that this assumption does not require the externality that firm A imposes on

any other firm in set Γ to be the same; it only requires the differential impact to be the same, which is a

weaker assumption. A derivation of this group-level incentive measure is provided in the Appendix.

1.2    Comparing GGL to existing measures in the literature
      To better understand the advantages and disadvantages of our proposed measure of common
ownership, GGL, it is useful to compare it to measures used in previous studies of common ownership.
      Harford et al. (2011) propose a measure to account for the incentives of common investors during the
merger of two firms. Harford et al. (2011) note that shareholders of a bidding firm are more likely to
internalize the effect of paying a lower takeover premium on the target firm if they also own shares of the
target. To capture this externality of common ownership, they estimate each investor’s relative ownership

stake in the target (B) to that of the acquirer (A) and aggregate these relative weights, 𝛼C,x /(𝛼C,u + 𝛼C,x ),

across investors in the bidding firm. Specifically, one such aggregation would be:
                                                                  ‚ƒ,„
                                          𝐻𝐽𝐿(𝐴, 𝐵) = ∑C∈F…,„                .
                                                                ‚ƒ,… †‚ƒ,„

      While the HJL measure is similar to GGL in that it is a bi-directional, pair-level measure of common
ownership and its potential impact on managerial incentives, there are several key differences. First, the
HJL measure only accounts for an investor’s relative holdings in the bidding and the target firms. Therefore,
it ignores the possibility that other firms in investors’ portfolios could be affected by the merger and that



                                                      12
investors’ might be inattentive when both the bidding firm and the target firms constitute a small part of
their portfolio. While these assumptions might be appropriate in the context of M&A, they may not apply

more generally. Second, the 𝐺𝐺𝐿u,x
                               C   measure increases when the relative ownership of firm A increases,

while this does not occur for 𝐻𝐽𝐿u,x
                                 C . This is because GGL assumes that managers care about shareholder

support, and hence, pay more attention to action consequences for investors that constitute a larger part of
the firm’s ownership. Third, Harford et al. (2011) aggregated the relative weights across investors in many
different ways. By contrast, the GGL measure uses a model as the guideline for how to aggregate.
     Another measure is the modified Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (MHHI) that was developed by
Bresnahan and Salop (1986) and O'Brien and Salop (2000). The MHHI is a measure of product market
concentration, like the HHI, but also accounts for the effect of cross-ownership and overlap in the
shareholder base on market concentration. The difference between MHHI and HHI is called the MHHI
delta (MHHID) and is commonly used as a measure of the additional incentives to internalize externalities
coming from overlapping ownership structures (e.g., see Azar et al., 2016 and 2018).
     There are three important differences between the MHHID and GGL. First, the MHHID is tailored to

capture a specific type of externality – those that arise in oligopolistic product market. As such, it makes
stronger assumptions on the nature of externalities (e.g., the type of competition) and requires more
information than GGL (e.g., market shares), which can introduce additional endogeneity concerns (Dennis
et al., 2018). Since the GGL measure is invariant to the specific nature of externalities, it also has a wider
scope and can account for externalities that stem from vertical relationships, innovation, M&A transactions,
etc. Second, the MHHID is measured at the industry level, while the baseline GGL measure is a bi-

directional, pair-level measure. As such, the baseline GGL measure is not sensitive to the scope of an
industry or product market, which are not always well defined. However, as noted in the previous section,
a simple aggregation of GGL can be used to capture the industry-level incentive to internalize externalities

among firms within the industry, if so desired. Third, and most importantly, MHHID assumes investors are
fully informed about the externalities firms impose on each other, and therefore, that managers fully

internalize those externalities. By contrast, GGL accounts for the possibility that some investors may not
be as attentive, which finds substantial empirical support (e.g., Kempf et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017).6


6The possibility of investor inattention also differentiates our measure from Backus et al. (2019), who drop the market
shares from the modified Herfindahl-Hirschman Index and instead use the resulting firm-level weights (which lack a
clear theoretical basis) to quantify the effect of common ownership.



                                                          13
      In addition to the above model-based measures, there are also a number of ad hoc common ownership
measures used in the existing empirical literature (e.g., see Anton and Polk, 2014; Azar, 2012 and 2016;
Freeman, 2017; Hansen and Lott, 1996; He and Huang, 2017; He et al., forthcoming; Newham et al., 2018).
It isn’t clear, however, that any of these measures represent an economically meaningful measure of
common ownership’s impact on managerial incentives, and many of them have unappealing properties.
We discuss these additional measures and their weaknesses in the Appendix.
      To conclude, the innovation behind the GGL measure is as follows: (i) it is a model-driven measure of

the effect of common ownership on the incentives of managers to internalize externalities between two
given companies; (ii) the measure is invariant to the specific nature of externalities between the firms; (iii)
the measure explicitly accounts for the limited attention that investors can pay to their portfolio companies.

This last feature is key, since managers have incentives to internalize externalities only if their shareholders
require them to do so. In other words, overlap in the shareholder base is a necessary but insufficient
condition for common ownership to affect managers’ incentives.

1.3    Limitations of GGL
      While our proposed measure of common ownership is flexible and can be easily adjusted to capture
different assumptions about managers’ preferences and factors that affect investor attention, it has some
limitations. First, our measure does not allow for strategic interactions where a shift in manager m’s
incentives to take an action affects manager n’s incentive to take an action. We intentionally shut down this
possibility because otherwise the common ownership of one stock pair indirectly affects the incentives of
managers in other companies, and this indirect effect in turn depends on the strategic environment (e.g., are
actions by different managers taken simultaneously or sequentially, are they strategic complements or
substitutes, etc.) and on the solution concept that is adopted (the notion of equilibrium). The indirect effect
also requires shareholders to be aware of the strategic environment, which may or may not be a plausible
assumption. Given these complications, we focus only on the direct effect of common ownership.
      Second, similar to existing measures of common ownership, our measure abstracts away from any
form of coordination or communication between investors. In practice, investors might coordinate their

attempts to exert influence by following the voting guidelines of proxy advisory firms such as the ISS or
by publicly communicating their views regarding the optimal policy before casting votes or talking to
management. With such coordination, managers would no longer weight the importance of each investor




                                                      14
independently, and in principle, if two investors perfectly coordinate their attempts to exert influence over
managers, they should be treated as one investor from the perspective of our measure. While our model
(and measure) can be extended along this dimension, we do not do so since it unclear how one could
measure the extent of coordination between different investors, which likely depends on the similarity of
their investment objectives, their competition for fund flows, familiarity with one another (e.g., through
joint investment in the past or being alumni of the same university), etc.
     Third, our measure ignores the possibility of a feedback from managers to investors. For example, our

measure does not account for the possibility that managers might seek to attract or avoid the attention of
certain investors. Investor inattention could be mitigated if managers choose to engage with investors,
explain their strategies, and disclose additional information. More generally, investors’ level of attention

for individual firms may depend on other firm-specific factors that are not currently being modeled.
However, to the extent these other firm-specific factors have an empirical counterpart, they could be
accounted for in the g function by adding them as additional inputs.


2.   Data construction

     To analyze the relevance of accounting for investor attention when quantifying the importance of
common ownership, we create a sample of firm-pair-year observations that includes the universe of U.S.-
listed firm pairings between 1980 and 2012.7 For each year, we include all publicly-traded firms from the

Compustat-CRSP universe. We then construct a sample of firm pairs each year based on these public firms
as of December 31 of that year. For n firms in a given year, our pair construction yields n*(n-1)/2 distinct
pairs, and each stock is paired with each other stock only once. We end up with a total of 671,012,403
pairs, and twice as many observations when calculating our bi-directional, pair-level measure, GGL.
     We construct our measures of common ownership using the Institutional 13F Holdings that have been
tabulated and aggregated by Thomson Reuters, which we access via Wharton Research Data Services. We

calculate investors’ ownership stakes using total reported shares,8 and following Ben-David et al. (2018),


7
  We do not use any post-2012 data in our current analysis because of known data problems with Thomson Reuters’
13F ownership data after 2012. While inaccuracies also exist in Thomson’s data prior to 2013, we make the standard
corrections for these, including adding the missing year end filings of Barclays in 2003 and JP Morgan in 2003.
8
  As noted earlier, we use total shares for two reasons. One, total shares likely better capture the potential influence
of each investor, and two, it is unclear whether the reported 13F data on voting rights is meaningful. When filing a
13F, institutions delineate their shares based on voting rights as “sole,” “shared,” and “none”. But as discussed in
Dennis et al. (2018), it is unclear what “shared” means, and some institutions, like Vanguard, report all their holdings
under “none” despite that they clearly maintain and exercise voting rights.



                                                          15
we combine the holdings of Blackrock’s various subsidiaries to the parent level.9 Some firms may have

multiple classes of publicly traded stock; in these instances, we aggregate ownership by the value of the
share classes (e.g., an institution needs to only be an owner of one of the class of shares in a stock to have
an ownership stake, and this overall ownership stake is reduced based on the proportion of ownership the
share class has across all publicly traded classes of the firm). The result of the merge with 13F data is that
for each pair we have a list of all institutions which own both stocks and their ownership stakes in each
stock. With these data, we then compute the GGL measure as outlined above in Section 1.
     To examine the importance of investor inattention, we construct numerous permutations of the GGL
measure. We start by constructing GGLFullAttention, which measures the impact of common ownership on

managerial incentives when investors are fully attentive (i.e., 𝑔 = 1). We then construct a variety of

measures that allow for investor inattention. GGLLinear assumes investors’ likelihood of being informed as

being given by 𝑔V𝛽C,u W = 𝛽C,u , while GGLConvex and GGLConcave change the investor attention function to
            ‡                   ˆ.‰
𝑔V𝛽C,u W = 𝛽C,u and 𝑔V𝛽C,u W = 𝛽C,u , respectively. We also construct versions of GGL that ascribe different

managerial weightings to the importance of investors. In particular, with GGL5%, we modify GGLLinear by
assuming that managers only care about investors that own at least 5% of their outstanding shares, and with
GGLTop5, we assume that managers only care about their five largest shareholders (in terms of proportion
of outstanding stock held). While this is by no means an exhaustive list of potential permutations, it does
provide a reasonable foundation from which to study how managerial incentives to internalize externalities
have changed over time, what factors are correlated with the level of these incentives, and whether these
particular modeling choices are important for answering these questions.

3.   Empirical importance of accounting for investor attention

     In this section, we provide summary statistics on managerial incentives to internalize externalities, as
measured using the different versions of GGL, and the extent to which managers’ motives have shifted over

the last 30+ years. These summary statistics highlight the importance of accounting for investor attention


9
  Blackrock reports its holdings under seven different entities, and the Thomson data aggregates these to six different
manager numbers. We follow Ben-David et al. (2018) and aggregate these holdings since Blackrock exercises its
influence and votes these shares at the parent level. Our model implicitly assumes that each investor exerts influence
independently, which is clearly not the case for Blackrock’s various entities. A spot check of MGRNAMEs did not
reveal any further obvious examples of other large institutions reporting their holdings in a disaggregated way similar
to Blackrock. While one could argue that the influence of other institutions (e.g., smaller institutions that follow the
vote recommendations of proxy advisory firms like ISS), are also not independent, we do not aggregate these holdings
since it is unclear how to identify these more nuanced violations of non-independence.

when measuring common ownership. To further highlight the importance of investor attention, we then
illustrate how the merger of two asset managers need not result in an increase in managers’ incentives to
internalize externalities. Finally, we provide evidence on the relative importance of index versus activist
investors in contributing to managerial motives.

3.1 Summary statistics, 1998-2012
    Table 1 reports summary statistics for our overlap and GGL measures. For brevity, we restrict these

summary statistics to the more recent sample period of 1998-2012, which, because of data limitations on
index constituents, is the same sample period we use in our latter regressions that analyze cross-sectional
variation in common ownership. Beyond giving us a better sense of how prevalent common ownership is

in recent years, these summary statistics are more useful in interpreting the economic magnitudes of our
later estimates. We discuss earlier trends in common ownership in the next subsection.
    The summary statistics in Table 1 show that there is substantial heterogeneity across stock pairs in the
importance of common ownership for managerial incentives. As discussed in Section 1, GGL reflects a
relative measure of managers’ incentives to internalize externalities per unit of any externality, and because
we rescale each GGL measure by its sample average, a value of one reflects the average level of incentives
to internalize externalities during the sample period. This rescaling allows us to see that there is considerable
skewness in the distribution of GGL. For example, the median stock pair has just 0% to 7.8% of the average

level of incentives to internalize externalities when one does not assume full attention by investors, and
24.1% of the average incentives when one instead assumes full attention. Moreover, for the more than 10%
of stock pairs with no common investors, each GGL measure equals zero, reflecting no incentive for

managers to internalize externalities. At the other end of the spectrum, however, managers of the 99th
percentile stock pair have 2.86 to 15.6 times the average incentive to internalize externalities, depending
on the functional form assumptions one makes when calculating GGL.

3.2 Trends in common ownership since 1980
    We next analyze how managers’ incentives to internalize ownership overlap, GGL, has varied over
time for the average pair of stocks. For this analysis, we extend our sample back to 1980.
    Under the assumption that investors are fully attentive, managerial incentives to internalize
externalities have increased substantially over the last few decades. This is shown in Figure 1 where we
plot the average percent increase in GGLFullAttention since 1980. Between 1980 and 2012, the average




                                                       17
GGLFullAttention for a pair of US stocks increased by 2,938%. If we were to instead use the average market
capitalization of stock pairs to construct a value-weighted average, the increase since 1980 would be
1,656%. Interestingly, the smaller value-weighted increase suggests that the shift in incentives is smaller
among stock pairs containing larger firms. This is confirmed in Figure 2, where we plot the average percent
increase in managerial incentives for stock pairs where both stocks are either below or above the median
market capitalization in that year. For stock pairs with above median-sized firms, managers’ average
incentive to internalize externalities increased by 2,295%, but for stock pairs with below median-sized
firms, the average increase was 14,291%.
    The assumption that all investors are perfectly informed plays a key role in the measured growth of
managerial incentives. This is seen in Figure 3, where we plot the average percent increase for each of the
different versions of our incentives measure that allow for investor inattention. The increase in managers’
incentive to internalize externalities, as measured GGLLinear, is considerably smaller at 285% for the average
stock pair. The increase in our other measures of GGL is also smaller and ranges from 162% to 835%, with
the largest increase being observed for GGLConcave, which makes the assumption that firms representing a
smaller share of an investor’s portfolio get proportionally more investor attention relative to their portfolio
weight, and the smallest increase being observed for GGLConvex, which makes the assumption that firms
representing a larger share of an investor’s portfolio get proportionally more investor attention. Value-
weighting has less impact for GGL measures that allow for inattention; in unreported estimates, the increase
in the value-weighted average of these GGL measures is similar and ranges between 1% and 751%.
    The smaller increase for measures that allow for the possibility of investor inattention highlights that
the rise of ownership overlap over the last 30 years has coincided with the average institutional investor
becoming increasingly diverse in their holdings. This diversification and the resulting average reduction in
portfolio weights is consistent with investors paying less attention to their portfolio companies (Veldkamp
and Van Nieuwerberg, 2010; Fich et al., 2015; Iliev et al., 2018) and hence, managers having weaker
incentives to internalize the preferences of investors. Measures that assume full attention among investors
(e.g., MHHID), overlook this potentially important countervailing trend in ownership structures.

3.3 Impact of assets manager mergers on managerial motives

    The importance of accounting for investor attention can also be seen by calculating how the merger of
two large asset management firms affects our measure of managerial incentives, GGL. Some existing papers
that study the impact of common ownership on corporate policies use the merger of large asset managers



                                                      18
as a positive shock to common ownership; for example, the merger of BGI and Blackrock in 2009 is argued
to have increased common ownership and managers’ incentives to internalize externalities (e.g., see Azar
et al., 2016, 2018). Conceptually, however, it is unclear whether we should expect such mergers to shift
managers’ incentives. While the mergers likely increase ownership overlap, they might also reduce investor
attention, and hence, managers’ incentive to internalize the preferences of their investors, if the larger, more
diversified portfolio of the merged entity makes it less likely the new common owner is as attentive.
     To illustrate the potential for asset manager mergers to reduce managers’ incentives to internalize
externalities, we calculate the changes in GGLLinear and GGLFullAttention that would be predicted by the merger
of BGI and Blackrock in 2009 across stock pairs if all institutions had maintained their same stock holdings
after the merger. Specifically, we recalculate the two GGL measures in 2008 under the assumption that the
portfolios of BGI and BlackRock are now owned by the same investor, the merged entity. Obviously, this
calculation changes both the size of the stake that the merged entity owns in each company, but also the
weight that each company receives in the merged entity portfolio. We then plot the histogram of the
predicted changes for both GGLLinear and GGLFullAttention in Figure 4.
     We find that an asset manager merger does not necessarily increase managerial incentives to internalize
externalities. As shown in Figure 4, all stock-pairs unsurprisingly experience an increase in GGLFullAttention
since, by construction, the merger increases ownership overlap, and when all investors are attentive, this
necessarily increases managers’ incentive to internalize externalities. Moreover, even when overlap already
existed, the higher AUM of the merged entity increases GGL by increasing the importance of the externality

in the combined portfolio (via a higher 𝛼C,x ) and the manager’s incentive to internalize the merged entity’s

preferences (via a higher 𝛼C,u ). However, when we allow for inattention, as done with GGLLinear, 56.2% of

stock pairs experience a decline in managerial incentives. This decline for GGLLinear occurs because the
relative importance of some stocks in the portfolio of the merged firm is lower than their importance in the
individual portfolios of BGI and Blackrock before the merger. This drop in portfolio weights can result in
a bigger, but less attentive common owner following the merger.10
     To further illustrate the ambiguous effect of asset manager merges on managers’ incentives to
internalize externalities, we repeat the exercise above using only stock pairs from the airline industry, which


10 Allowing for economies of scale in monitoring, by including AUM as an input for g, could mitigate this effect.
However, our analysis illustrates that this mitigating factor would need be significant in order to offset this effect and
increase managerial incentives to internalize externalities for all stock pairs.



                                                           19
was the subject of a recent study claiming to find evidence of common ownership inducing anticompetitive
behaviors (Azar et al. 2018). Doing so, we find that 16% of all airline stock pairs experience a decline in
managerial incentives as measured by GGLLinear, and for another 33% of all pairs, the increase was either
negligible (smaller than 2.5%) or zero. Importantly, the decline in GGL is also observed for stock pairs that
include the largest airlines, including American and United. These findings cast doubt on the reasonableness
of using the BGI/Blackrock merger in 2009 as a shock to the incentives of airline executives.

3.4 Relative importance of indexing versus activist investors
     In addition to asset manager mergers, the rise of common ownership is also often attributed to the
increasing popularity of index investing. We next analyze how much the growth of managerial incentives
to internalize externalities since 1980 is being driven by the growth of index funds versus activist investors.
     To quantify this, we construct two additional versions of our GGLLinear measure, GGLIndexer and

GGLActivist. For GGLIndexer, we only include the holdings of BGI, Blackrock, State Street, and Vanguard.
We focus on the latter three institutions because in 2016 they alone accounted for 80% of all indexed mutual
fund and ETF assets in the U.S., and indexed assets accounted for about 80% of each institution’s overall

assets under management.11 And, we include BGI since it was one of the largest purveyors of index funds

and ETFs prior to its acquisition by Blackrock in 2009. For GGLActivist, we instead only include hedge funds
that have engaged in some form of activism, as identified in the hedge fund activism dataset constructed by
Brav, Jiang, Partnoy, and Thomas (2008) and Brav, Jiang, and Kim (2010).
         At first blush, it looks like both activists and indexers have contributed to the growth in managerial
incentives to internalize externalities. This is seen in the top panel of Figure 5. If one plots the average
yearly proportion of our GGLLinear that is attributable to index and activist hedge fund holdings, as done in

the top panel of Figure 5, both index and activist institutions appear important for the upward trend
documented in Figure 3. In 1980, index holdings accounted for just 0.05% of a manager’s incentives to
internalize externalities but accounted for 25% by 2012. Activist hedge funds increased their proportion
from 2.2% in 1980 to about 11.7% in 2008 and fell to about 8.5% after that. (The remaining proportion of
GGLLinear each year is driven by the non-index and non-activist institutions that are not plotted.)

11
   This statistic was calculated by classifying mutual funds and ETFs as passive versus active using Thomson’s S12
mutual fund database, the CRSP mutual fund database, and the classification methodology of Appel et al. (2016,
2018). We do not use the Bushee (2001) classification of “quasi-indexer” to designate passive institutions since this
is not a meaningful classification of passive versus active: nearly two-thirds of institutions are classified as “quasi-
indexers,” while some obvious indexers, like Blackrock are not classified as a quasi-indexer.



                                                          20
        However, the relative importance of index and activist investors for the growth of GGL depends
on how one models investor attention. This is shown in the second and third panels of Figure 5, where we
break out the relative contribution of indexers and activists to both GGLConvex and GGLConcave. When using
a convex function to model an investor’s likelihood of being informed about a particular stock, indexers
contribute almost nothing to the growth in GGL (see Figure 5, middle panel), and when using a concave
function for modeling attention, they account for considerably more (bottom panel). The reason why index
investors contribute less when g is convex is that they are more diversified, such that the average weight of
a firm in the portfolio is low, and a convex function gives relatively less weight to firms which contribute
less to an investor’s portfolio. The opposite is true for the concave function.
        While the relative contribution of indexers to the GGL measure is sensitive to how one models
investor inattention, all three modeling assumptions suggest that their relative contribution is no more than
50% in recent years, and much lower earlier in our sample. This result illustrates that the link between
indexing and managerial incentives to internalize externalities is not obvious. Our later findings of how

managerial incentives shift with index inclusion, which are not sensitive this modeling choice, further
emphasize this point. We now turn to that analysis.

4.   Factors correlated with GGL
     In this section, we regress our GGL measures onto possible determinants using pair-level panel
regressions. Because we lack an exogenous source of variation for our explanatory variables, we do not
seek to identify the causal effect of any given explanatory variable on managerial incentives. Rather we
simply seek to establish and quantify basic correlations between potential determinants of common
ownership, like index inclusion and industry structure, and managerial incentives. For example, we seek
to answer questions like: “If a pair of stocks goes from both being included in the S&P 500 index to not
both being in that index, what is the average change in managerial incentives arising from this ownership

overlap (as measured by GGL) and how economically large are the observed changes?”

4.1 Empirical specification
     To analyze what stock-pair characteristics are correlated with managerial incentives arising from
ownership overlap, as measured by GGL, we estimate a bi-directional pair-level panel regression,

                                       𝐺𝐺𝐿CŠ\ = 𝛽𝑋CŠ\ + 𝛼CŠ + 𝛿\ + 𝜀CŠ\ ,

where GGLijt is our measure of manager i's incentive to internalize the impact of her choices on firm j in




                                                      21
year t, and Xijt is our time-varying explanatory variables of interest. For example, Xijt might be an indicator
equal to 1 if both firms in pair ij are listed in the S&P 500 index in year t and 0 otherwise. We include bi-

directional, pair-level fixed effects, 𝛼CŠ , to control for time-invariant differences in manager i's incentives

with respect to firm j and to ensure we only make use of within bi-directional pair variation for this analysis.
In other words, we are interested in how a change Xijt for a given pair ij is associated with the observed

change in managerial incentives for that pair, GGLijt. We also include year fixed effects, 𝛿\ , to absorb the

secular trend in common ownership. Finally, to account for potential covariance across pairs and over time,
we cluster the standard errors at the stock level, i. We cluster at the stock level, rather than at the stock-pair
level, since clustering at the stock level provides more conservative standard errors.

4.2    Index inclusion
      We begin our regression analysis by focusing on the potential importance of index inclusion. We focus
on indexing since it is often associated with the rise of common ownership (e.g., Harford et al., 2011) and
the target of policy recommendations related to common ownership (e.g., Posner et al, 2016).
      To analyze indexing, we construct a number of pair-level dummy variables that indicate whether the
two firms in a particular pairing are both included in a certain market index or not. We construct six such
indicators, one for each of the following indexes: S&P 500, S&P 400, S&P 600, Russell 1000, Russell

2000, and Nasdaq. Because of a lack of data on Russell index inclusions prior to 1998 and the absence of
some S&P indexes prior to the mid-1990s, we restrict our sample to post-1997 data. In addition to bi-
directional pair fixed effects, we control for the average share of equity held by institutions across the two
stocks, which will be positively associated with our measures since the 13F filings data only covers
institutional investors. We also include a few other explanatory variables, including whether the two stocks
are in the same industry. We discuss these other explanatory variables and their coefficients in the next

subsection, but their inclusion has little impact on the estimates. Likewise, controlling for additional stock
characteristics, like market-to-book ratio or momentum of the pair, has little impact on our estimates.
      Index inclusion is positively associated with our GGL measure of incentives that assumes full attention.

This is shown in Table 2. Inclusion of both stocks in the same index (S&P 400, S&P 500, S&P 600, Russell
1000, Russell 2000, or Nasdaq) is always associated with an increase in GGLFullAttention. The estimates are

all statistically significant at a level of at least 1% (with some t-stats exceeding 25) and economically large.
For example, moving from both stocks not being in the S&P 500 to both stocks being included in the S&P




                                                       22
500 is associated with an 89% increase in managerial incentives relative to the sample average. The
magnitudes are similarly large for inclusion of both stocks in other indexes, including the Russell 2000.
      However, once we allow for investor inattention, we find no clear association between index inclusion
and managerial incentives to internalize externalities. This is shown in Table 3. Using GGLLinear, inclusion
in some indices (e.g., S&P 500, Russell 1000, and Nasdaq) is associated with, on average, an increase in
managerial incentives to internalize externalities, while inclusion in other indexes (e.g., Russell 2000 and
S&P 600) is associated with a decrease (Table 3, Column 1). For example, relative to the sample average,

inclusion of both stocks in the Russell 2000 is associated with an average decline in GGLLinear of 26%. The
divergent association between index inclusion and incentives is robust to alternative versions of GGL,

including when we change the functional form used for attention, 𝑔, (Columns 2-3), or restrict our analysis

to the largest five shareholders (Column 4) or shareholders holding at least 5% of shares (Column 5).
      The unclear association between being in the same index and GGL again highlights the importance of
accounting for investor attention. The positive association between index inclusion and GGLFullAttention
(Table 2), but negative association between some index inclusions and versions of GGL that do not assume
full attention (Table 3), suggests that being in some indexes is associated with a shift in the composition of

owners towards less attentive investors (as measured using a lower 𝛽C,u ). This is shown formally in Table

4 where we regress sum of 𝛽C,u across investors, 𝛽uŽ•• , onto the index indicators; index inclusion often

exhibits a negative correlation with the sum of 𝛽C,u for a stock pair’s common investors (Table 4).

4.3    Industry structure and competition
      Given the potential for anti-competitive behavior by firms that have common owners, we also assess

how GGL may be linked with industry structure. To do this, we regress our GGL measures onto the average
HHI of the industries of the two companies in the pair and on an interaction variable between the average
HHI and whether or not the two companies are in the same 3-digit SIC industry. Under this specification,
a positive coefficient on the interaction variable would suggest that the GGL of two companies that are in
the same industry is larger when the industry is more concentrated, as measured by the HHI.
      Interestingly, we find little evidence that managerial incentives are higher among pairs of companies
operating in the same industry or when their industry becomes more concentrated. While always positive,
the interaction between average HHI and our indicator for being in the same industry is only statistically
different from zero for GGLConcave [Table 3, Columns 1-5]. These findings provide little evidence that




                                                     23
managerial incentives to internalize externalities tends to be higher as industry concentration rises. We also
find no difference in the incentive to internalize externalities among stock pairs from the same industry.


5.   Measuring investor inattention using voting data
     The key assumption that underlies our analysis is that investors pay more attention to companies that
are relatively more important in their portfolios. That is, 𝑔 is an increasing function of 𝛽C,u . This assumption

is both grounded in theory and backed by empirical evidence. However, the theory is ambiguous on the
form of this positive association (e.g., one can give arguments for both concave and convex shapes), and
empirical evidence does not exist to provide clear guidance. Given this, our above analysis shows the
robustness of our main findings to generic linear, convex, and concave attention functions.
     In this section, we further highlight the robustness of our conclusions using an attention function, g,
that we estimate directly from voting data. Measuring investor attention is challenging since it is typically
unobserved, and because of this, the existing literature proxies for investor attention using actions that, in
theory, are closely related to the allocation of attention. To estimate our attention function, we follow Iliev
and Lowry (2015) and proxy for investor attention using an indicator for whether an institution’s votes fail
to follow the recommendations of the proxy advisory firm ISS. If investors pay close attention to a given
company in their portfolios, then they are more likely to form an independent opinion about the merits of
various corporate proposals and less likely to outsource their voting to proxy advisors like ISS.
     To approximate the g function, we estimate the likelihood that investor’s vote on a given proposal
disagrees with the ISS recommendation as a function of the portfolio weight the underlying firm receives
in the investor’s portfolio. In particular, we regress a vote-investor-level measure for disagreement with
ISS onto dummy variables for each portfolio weight decile, and we create a fitted attention function using
a linear extrapolation between point estimates. Since the voting data is at mutual fund level but our
ownership data is at the institution level, we map the fund-level votes to the appropriate institutions. We
also include institution-by-year and company-by-year fixed effects in the estimation to account for
heterogeneity in the level of attention across investors over time and in the overall level of shareholder
support a company typically receives over time. Finally, we set the intercept of our fitted attention function

to be zero for b = 0. The point estimates of this nonparametric estimation and our fitted g function are

presented in Figure 6 and the precise details of the underlying estimation are given in the Appendix.
     As can be seen from Figure 6, the estimated attention function has a concave shape, suggesting that for
an average institutional investor, the increase in attention that occurs for more important holdings is



                                                       24
diminishing as the portfolio weight increases. This fitted attention function most closely resembles the
                                                                   ˆ.‰
attention function used to construct GGLConcave (i.e., 𝑔V𝛽C,u W = 𝛽C,u ) but exhibits less curvature at higher

portfolio weights, indicating that investors’ attention is less sensitive to small changes in weights for the
more important portfolio holdings than assumed by GGLConcave.
     None of our earlier findings are significantly affected by using this fitted attention function when
constructing GGL. To illustrate this, we use the estimated attention function plotted in Figure 6 to create a
new version of our GGL measure, GGLFitted, and repeat our earlier analyses. Doing so, we confirm that our
main findings remain robust to this alternative specification of the g function. For example, we find that
39.4% of stock-pairs are predicted to exhibit a decline in managerial incentives to internalize externalities
after the Blackrock-BGI merger (see Figure 7), and that index inclusion can still be associated with a decline
in GGLFitted (see Table 5). Moreover, while the average level of GGLFitted did increase by 1,301% since
1980, this is still 50% lower than the average increase observed for GGLFullAttention, and only 49.6% of
GGLFitted in 2012 is driven by the three large indexers, BGI/Blackrock, State Street, and Vanguard.
     Interestingly, GGLFitted is positively associated with industry HHI when both stocks are in the same
industry, suggesting that managerial incentives to internalize externalities are higher, on average, in more
concentrated industries. In particular, for stocks in the same industry, increasing HHI by one standard
deviation is associated with a 1.7% increase in GGLFitted (t-stat = 2.66; Table 5).
     While it is tempting to label GGLFitted as our baseline measure for the effect of ownership overlap on
managerial incentives, it is important to note that our nonparametric estimate of the g function has
limitations. First, there are other means by which investors may affect firms’ decisions beyond the voting
outcomes we use to proxy for investor attention (e.g., direct communications, exit decision, etc.). Second,
GGLFitted does not account for potential heterogeneity among investors in their level of attention. For
example, the voting data does not include voting by pension and hedge funds, which are both included in
the 13F data used to construct our proposed GGL measure. Therefore, if pension and hedge funds have
different associations between attention and portfolio weights, which we are not able to estimate in our
data, then GGLFitted may measure their level of attention with error. Future research that addresses these
concerns could greatly improve the precision of the GGL measure.


6.   Revisiting Azar et al. (2018) using GGL instead of MHHID

     In this section, we revisit the findings of Azar et al. (2018) to determine whether using GGL might also
affect existing findings regarding common ownership’s effect on product market competition. We choose



                                                     25
to focus on Azar et al. (2018) because it is the most well-known paper in this recent literature. Azar et al.
(2018) finds evidence that the market-level measure of common ownership, MHHID, is positively
associated with fares in the airline industry, and they interpret these findings as evidence that the rise of
common ownership is leading to anticompetitive behaviors in the airline industry.
    We begin by first replicating the main findings of Azar et al. (2018), as reported in Table 3 of their
paper. To do this, we download the Azar et al. (2018) replication package, which is found at
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jofi.12698, and the required airlines and ownership data

that are not included in the replication package. While it is necessary to make a couple of minor
modifications to their code (see the Appendix for details), we are able to obtain estimates that are very close
to those reported in Azar et al., (2018). In particular, our estimated coefficients for MHHID’s association
with airline fares are all positive, statistically significant, and match Azar et al. (2018)’s reported Table 3
estimates out to two decimal places. These point estimates are reported in the first row of Table 6, and our
point estimates for the other controls reported in their Table 3 are provided in Appendix Table 1.
    We then modify Azar et al.’s code to calculate the market-level GGL for each airline market. We
accomplish this using the market-level version of GGL, as defined at the end of Section 1.1. The market-
level measure of GGL captures how much common ownership shifts the average incentive of firms in that
market to internalize how their actions affect all the other firms operating in the market.
    Replacing the MHHID in Azar et al.’s main specification with GGL results in significant changes in

their findings. This is shown in Table 6, where we repeat the Table 3 estimations of Azar et al., (2018) using
the different market-level versions of our GGL measure and report the point estimate on GGL from each
individual regression, for a total of 42 GGL regressions. In many instances, the coefficient on GGL is
negative, and in only one estimation do we find a marginally significant positive coefficient. The economic
magnitudes are also small; moving from no common ownership (GGL = 0) to the average market-level
common ownership (GGL = 1) is only associated with a -0.7% to 1.2% shift in average fares. These findings

provide additional evidence that the measurement of common ownership can significantly affect inferences.
    Interestingly, these estimates also suggest that the findings of Azar et al. (2018) are not driven by
MHHID’s questionable assumption of full attention. As seen in Table 6, even the full attention version of
GGL is uncorrelated with airline fares, suggesting that Azar et al.’s findings are instead driven by the other
key difference between GGL and MHHID—MHHID’s inclusion of market shares as an input. As discussed
in Dennis et al. (2018), MHHID’s use of market shares in a regression that uses prices as the dependent



                                                      26
variable raises significant endogeneity concerns. Because GGL does not make assumptions about the nature
of the externality (as MHHID does), constructing GGL does not require using the potentially problematic
market shares as an input, which is another advantage of GGL.12


7.   Does GGL predict outcomes that could be associated with common ownership?

     In this last section, we assess the ability of our proposed common ownership measure to predict an
outcome that could potentially be influenced by common ownership—target selection in an acquisition. If
significant externalities exist between two firms, a common investor may wish them to merge so as to

ensure that these externalities are internalized. To conduct this analysis, we estimate the following,

                             𝐴𝑐𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛CŠ\†7 = 𝛽𝐺𝐺𝐿CŠ\ + Γ𝑋CŠ\ + 𝛼CŠ + 𝛿\ + 𝜀CŠ\ ,

where Acquisitionijt+1 is an indicator variable that equals one if firm i acquires firm j in year t+1, and GGLijt
is our bi-directional measure of how common ownership affects manager i's incentive to internalize the

impact of her actions on firm j in period t. To improve interpretation of 𝛽, we scale Acquisition by its sample

average, and to remove secular trends in mergers and ensure we are isolating variation in incentives for a

given pair of firms over time, we include both year fixed effects, 𝛿\ , and pair-direction fixed effects, 𝛼CŠ .

Following Harford et al. (2011), we also control for a variety of factors thought to influence target selection,

𝑋CŠ\ , including target market capitalization, target leverage, and the absolute difference in return on assets

across firms, among other controls (see Table 7). Finally, we cluster the standard errors by firm i. A more
complete description of the data we used to estimate this equation is provided in the Appendix.
     We find that evidence that GGL does positively predict target selections. This is shown in Table 7.

The coefficient on GGL is always positive, and is statistically significant when using GGLFullAttention,
GGLLinear, GGLConcave, or GGLFitted (Table 7, Columns 1, 2, 4, and 7; t-stats = 3.09, 1.70, 2.88, and 4.24,

respectively). Interestingly, the t-stat and economic magnitude are both the largest when using GGLFitted,
which is the version of GGL that uses the attention function estimated from voting data (see Section 5). The
point estimate on GGLFitted indicates that moving from no managerial incentives to internalize externalities


12 Despite this advantage, the non-findings in Table 6 should not be interpreted as evidence that common ownership
has no impact on product market competition. While the GGL estimations do not suffer endogeneity concerns with
respect to market shares, they do potentially suffer from biases related to the endogeneity of ownership. While Azar
et al. (2018) attempt to overcome this concern using the 2009 merger of Blackrock and BGI as a source of exogenous
variation in ownership, we do not do that here because, as discussed earlier, the merger has no clear impact on
managerial incentives to internalize externalities.



                                                        27
because of common ownership (GGL = 0) to the average level of incentives in our sample (GGL = 1) is
associated with a 23.6% increase in the likelihood of a merger (merger probability goes from 0.000206%
to 0.000253%) relative to the sample average likelihood of a merger between any two firms in a given year.
In unreported findings, we find a similar positive association between GGL and Acquisition when excluding
the pair-direction fixed effects, with GGLFitted retaining the highest economic magnitude and t-stat.

     While these findings are suggestive, they must be interpreted with caution. One possible interpretation
of these findings is that GGL, particularly GGLFitted, accurately captures managerial incentives arising from

common ownership and that these incentives influence target selection. On the other hand, it is also possible
that some other unmodeled firm characteristics are associated with both target selection and GGL, and it is
these omitted variables that drive the observed correlations. This second possibility is difficult to exclude

absent some exogenous source of common ownership.
     In general, an empirical validation of GGL, and any other measure of common ownership, is difficult
to achieve absent a setting where the impact of common investors on a particular outcome is known with

certainty (i.e., there is a known benchmark the proposed measure should uncover empirically). To the best
of our knowledge, this setting does not exist since theory gives no guidance on what levels of common
ownership should matter empirically. That aside, GGL does have some appealing properties that suggest it

will be more reflective of how common ownership impacts managerial incentives to internalize
externalities. In particular, the measure is (1) derived from a model of managerial incentives that accounts
for common ownership and the potential for some investors to be less attentive than others, and (2) it does
not require assumptions regarding the nature, sign, or magnitude of externalities.


8.   Concluding remarks
     Common ownership across US stock-pairs has been on the rise over the last few decades, but its

determinants and implications for economic outcomes are still not well understood. For example, attempts
to study whether common ownership results in anti-competitive behaviors is ongoing; some empirical work
suggests that it is linked to anti-competitive behavior by firms (e.g., Azar et al., 2016, 2018), while others

argue otherwise (e.g., Dennis et al., 2018; Gramlich and Grundl, 2017; O’Brien and Waehrer, 2017).
Despite these inconclusive findings, some have already begun discussing possible policy responses (e.g.,

Elhauge, 2016; Posner et al., 2016), many of which have the potential to significantly reshape corporate
ownership structures and the asset management industry more broadly.




                                                     28
    One challenge with studying common ownership is the difficulty in measuring its level and impact on
managers’ incentive to internalize how their actions might affect the value of other stocks held by their
investors. Existing measures of common ownership used in the literature tend to either be measures of
ownership overlap that lack any theoretical connection to managerial incentives or measures that make
strong assumptions about the nature of externalities and assume that all common investors are fully attentive
to managers’ actions and the implications of these actions for their overall portfolio, which runs counter to
existing empirical evidence regarding limited investor attention (e.g., Kempf et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017).

    Our paper addresses these measurement concerns by deriving a general measure of common ownership
that quantifies how overlapping ownership structures influence managerial incentives in a setting where not
all investors are fully attentive and does so without making strong assumptions about the structure of

externalities. In doing so, we illustrate that the assumed drivers of the rise of common ownership may have
little impact on managerial incentives. For example, we show that both index ownership and asset manager
mergers have no clear association with changes in managerial incentives because both can reduce the

attentiveness of a firm’s investors. Together, these findings cast doubt on the conclusions of previous
research that assumes asset manager mergers and the growth of index investing necessarily increase
managers’ incentives to internalize externalities, including studies claiming to find evidence that the recent
rise of common ownership is reducing competition in some industries (e.g., Azar et al., 2016 and 2018).
    Overall, our findings provide important context for recent empirical and theoretical work that argues

common ownership is important for competitiveness, corporate governance, etc. We show that accounting
for investor attention can have important implications for the impact of overlapping ownership structures
on managerial incentives, and hence, possible policy responses. The generality of flexibility of our
proposed measure will also facilitate future empirical research regarding both the importance of common
ownership for corporate outcomes and the aggregate economy and the potential determinants of common
ownership across stock pairs and industries. While much attention has been given to the effects of common

ownership, a promising direction for future research is to further explore its determinants.

Appendix A – Generalizations of GGL measure

            In this Appendix we offer two generalizations to the GGL measure. Under the first generalization

we allow the manager to weigh the votes of investors differently. Specifically, let
                                                               F             F

                                     𝑃& (𝑿) = 𝛾Z[\]C^,& ˜1 − m 𝛼C,& ™ + m 𝜂V𝛼C,& W 𝑝C,& (𝑿)
                                                              C<7           C<7


The key difference from the expression in main text is in the second term: 𝜂V𝛼C,& W replaces 𝛼C,& , where

𝜂(∙) > 0 and 𝜂′(∙) > 0. Intuitively, the function 𝜂 measures the importance that managers ascribe to a block

of votes. If managers just care about whether a proposal is passed or voted down, then 𝜂 would be the

identity function as in the main text. However, generally, managers might overweight the importance of

large blocks and underweight the importance of small blocks.13


       Using this formulation, 𝑈& (1, 𝑿P& ) ≥ 𝑈& (0, 𝑿P& ) holds if and only if


                                                                         𝐵& (1) − 𝐵& (0)

                                                        C<7

For example, if
                                                        𝛼          𝑖𝑓 𝛼C,u > 𝑧
                                            𝜂V𝛼C,u W = ž C,u
                                                         0         𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒,

then the manager of firm A is affected by the votes of his investors only if the investor’s ownership in firm

A is larger than 𝑧. In this case, the generalized GGL measure will only aggregate across common owners

of firm A and B who owns at least z percentage of the equity of firm A.14

           Under the second generalization, we consider the effect of common ownership on the incentives of
managers to internalize externalities with respect to a group of firms (e.g., industry). We start by
constructing the effect of common ownership on the incentives of each manager to internalize externalities
on a group of firms, rather than a single firm, and we then take the average of this measure across all
managers within this group to construct the group-level incentives to internalize externalities.

           Let Γ denote the set of firms with respect to which we seek to measure the effect of common
ownership. Following the same logic as in the main text, for each firm A in this group, we measure this

effect by the difference in the manager A’s incentives to take action 𝑥u = 1 under the existing ownership

structure relative to a counterfactual in which investors in firm A have no ownership in any of the other
firms in the set Γ (assuming the weights of all other firms in their portfolios remain unchanged). Recall

                                                 F                       9

              𝛱& (𝜶𝟏 , … , 𝜶𝑵 ; 𝜷𝟏 , … , 𝜷𝑵 ) = m 𝜂(𝛼C,& ) 𝑔V𝛽C,& W n m 𝛼C,; 𝜌o𝛥;,& (1) − 𝛥;,& (0)pq,
                                                C<7                    ;<7


Given the linearity of 𝛱& (𝜶𝟏 , … , 𝜶𝑵 ; 𝜷𝟏 , … , 𝜷𝑵 ), the generalized group-level measure from the perspective

of manager A is the sum of the pairwise measures from the perspective of manager A:


 𝐶𝑂(𝐴, Γ) =         m      [𝛱u (𝜶𝟏 , … , 𝜶𝑵 ; 𝜷𝟏 , … , 𝜷𝑵 ) − 𝛱u (𝜶𝟏 , … , 𝜶𝒎 = 𝟎, … , 𝜶𝑵 ; 𝜷𝟏 , … , 𝜷𝒎 = 𝟎, … , 𝜷𝑵 )].
                 ;∈~,¤•¥

Therefore,


14   Notice that 𝜂V𝛼C,u W ≠ 𝛼C,u is another reason why in general 𝐺𝐺𝐿(𝐴, 𝐵) ≠ 𝐺𝐺𝐿(𝐵, 𝐴).



                                                              36
                                F

                  𝐶𝑂(𝐴, Γ) = m 𝜂(𝛼C,u ) 𝑔V𝛽C,u W n     m      𝛼C,; 𝜌o𝛥;,u (1) − 𝛥;,u (0)pq,
                               C<7                  ;∈~,¤•¥

which can be rewritten as
                                                                   F

                  𝐶𝑂(𝐴, Γ) =        m    n𝜌o𝛥;,u (1) − 𝛥;,u (0)p m 𝜂(𝛼C,& ) 𝑔V𝛽C,u W𝛼C,; q,
                               ;∈~,¤•¥                            C<7

        If 𝜌[𝛥;,u (1) − 𝛥;,u (0)] is the same across all firms in the set Γ, then we can normalize 𝐶𝑂(𝐴, Γ)

by the term 𝜌[𝛥;,u (1) − 𝛥;,u (0)] and get the following group-level unit-free measure

                                     𝐺𝐺𝐿(𝐴, Γ) =      m      𝐺𝐺𝐿(𝐴, 𝑚).
                                                   ;∈~,¤•¥

Notice that assuming that 𝜌 [𝛥;,u (1) − 𝛥;,u (0)] is the same across all firms in the set Γ does not require

the externalities that firm A imposes on each of these firms to be the same. It only requires the difference

between the externalities when 𝑥u = 1 and the externalities when 𝑥u = 0 and its impact on the likelihood

of shareholder support to be the same. This is a much weaker assumption. For example, under this
assumption, the product market strategy employed by firm A can have different effect on each of its
competitors. However, a change in that strategy should have the same differential effect on each competitor.

Without this assumption, group-level measure cannot be unit free.

        Finally, our measure at the group-level is the average of 𝐺𝐺𝐿(𝐴, Γ) across all firms in group Γ
                                                    1
                                        𝐺𝐺𝐿(Γ) =       m 𝐺𝐺𝐿(𝐴, Γ)
                                                   |Γ|
                                                       u∈~

where |Γ| is the number of firms in set Γ. Therefore, 𝐺𝐺𝐿(Γ) is the average effect that common ownership

between firms in the set Γ has on the incentives of managers to internalize externalities between these firms.

Appendix B – Additional measures of common ownership used in the literature

     There are many additional ways to measure common ownership at the stock pair level that are currently
used in the literature. Four examples are:

                                      𝑂𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑝¨©ª&\ (𝐴, 𝐵) = m                       1,
                                                                          C∈F …,„


                               𝑂𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑝•C& (𝐴, 𝐵) = m                    𝑚𝑖𝑛«𝛼C,u , 𝛼C,x ¬,
                                                              C∈F …,„

                                                                        𝑣̅u              𝑣̅x
                         𝑂𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑝u- (𝐴, 𝐵) = m                𝛼C,u             + 𝛼C,x           ,
                                                   C∈F …,„          𝑣̅u + 𝑣̅x        𝑣̅u + 𝑣̅x

                             𝑂𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑝®¯ (𝐴, 𝐵) = m                   𝛼C,u × m              𝛼C,x ,
                                                        C∈F …,„                 C∈F …,„

where 𝛼C,& is the fraction of company n owned by investor i, 𝐼 u,x is the set of institutional investors who

own a stake in firm A and in firm B, and 𝑣̅u and 𝑣̅ x are the market values of firms A and B, respectively.

     Each variable approaches the measurement of ownership overlap from a different angle. The first
measure simply counts the number of common investors in stocks A and B, which is similar to He and
Huang (2017) and He et al. (forthcoming), which count the number of common blockholders a firm has
with other firms in the industry, where a common blockholder is defined as an investor that owns at least
5% of the outstanding shares in both the firm and one of its industry peers.15 To better capture the extent
of common ownership across the two firms, the second measure, which is used by Newham et al. (2018),

instead calculates the minimum ownership stake of each common investor and sums up these minimum
stakes across common investors. The third measure was proposed in Anton and Polk (2014) in their study
of stock price movements, and unlike the second measure, it uses market capitalization to weigh the relative

importance of investors’ ownership in each of the two firms before aggregating across investors. The fourth
measure was proposed in Hansen and Lott (1996). This measure instead sums the total fraction of shares
held by common investors in firm A and firm B and then multiples the two together. Each of the last two

measures has also been used in recent studies of common ownership (e.g., see Freeman, 2017).
     While intuitive as measures of ownership overlap, all four measures have number of downsides as
measures of common ownership. In particular, it isn’t clear any of these measures represent an economically
meaningful measure of common ownership’s impact on managerial incentives. Additionally, both


15He and Huang (2017) also construct and use an indicator for having a common blockholder with another firm in
the industry, while Azar (2012, 2016) constructs an indicator for having any common investor at the pair-level.



                                                        38
OverlapCount and OverlapAP are invariant to the decomposition of ownership between the two firms, which
leads to some unappealing properties. For example, if a common investor sells all but one share in firm B
and uses the proceeds to buy shares in firm A, the values of OverlapCount and OverlapAP would not change
although common ownership for that investor, for all intents and purposes, has effectively dropped to zero.




                                                    39
Appendix C – Additional details on how the 𝒈(𝜷) for GGLFitted is estimated

    Broadly, we follow the methodology of Iliev and Lowry (2015) with a few modifications for our

setting. Specifically, the primary data set we rely on is the same as Iliev and Lowry (2015), the ISS

compiled Voting Analytics database, which has fund-level voting data since 2003 based on Form NP-X.

However, our primary unit of analysis is at the 13-F filer or institution level. We therefore map mutual

funds to institutions (i.e. fund families) using data based on holding structure, name, and address of

institution. We only include voting data for which we could unequivocally confirm a match across the 13-

F data and the Form NP-X data. We follow the approach of Iliev and Lowry (2015) and focus only on

shareholder sponsored proposals and code vote decisions of “Against,” “Abstain,” and “Withhold” as

“Against,” and “For” as “For”. Our final sample of analysis is based on 1,331,433 votes across 11 years

and 240 institutions. The unit of observation is at the agenda item a, stock s, fund f, institution i, year t

level, and InstAgainstISSa,s,f,i,t is an indicator for whether a fund’s vote for a given agenda item is different

than the ISS recommendation for that particular vote. We then construct dummy variables based off of

deciles of institutions’ holding percentage, 𝛽. We use dummies to allow for maximum flexibility in terms

of how the 𝑔(𝛽) may look, thereby imposing minimal functional form assumptions.

    We estimate the following regression specification:
                                        7ˆ

           𝐼𝑛𝑠𝑡𝐴𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡𝐼𝑆𝑆],²,³,C,\ = m 𝛽´ 𝐻𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝐷𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑙𝑒𝐷𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑦C,²,\ + 𝛼C,\ + 𝛿²,\ + 𝜀],²,³,C,\
                                       ´<‡

    We then use the coefficients we recover on the dummy variables, relative to the omitted first ownership

decile dummy, to estimate the 𝑔(𝛽) function. The function is concave. As can be seen, these estimates

control for company × year specific factors, 𝛿²,\ . For example, if a company is doing poorly and that affects

how institutions vote for or with ISS broadly, that is controlled for. This also controls for any firm-specific

factor which may change over time and affect voting (management quality, leverage, etc). Our identification

of 𝑔(𝛽) is entirely coming from the size of the position a holding has relative to an institution’s total

portfolio. We also control for institution × year specific factors, 𝛼C,\ , meaning that if an institution has a

policy of always voting against ISS, regardless of ownership stake in firms, this is also controlled for.




                                                       40
Appendix D – Modifications made to Azar et al. (2018) code

       Below is a list of the changes made to the replication code of Azar et al. (2018), which is available

at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jofi.12698. These modifications were necessary to get

the code to run on Wharton’s HPCC using the newest versions of ownership and airlines data.

        1. Because parts of the Azar et al. code were designed to access files stored on a PC, it was

            necessary to change all back slashes (“\”) found in file paths to forward slashes (“/”).

        2. Added lines to “master.do” to install FTOOLS and OUTREG2 Stata programs that were used

            in the replication code but not already installed on Wharton’s HPCC.

       3. Opened a log file in the “master.do” file to help with debugging of Azar et al.’s code and

            changed the main directory that the “master.do” file points to so as to match where the

            replication package and data files were saved on Wharton’s HPPC.

       4. Deleted the “assert _m!=1” command after merging in the “mgrno cleaned.dta” file in the

            “Prepare Data – Ownership RP.do” file. This line was causing the Azar et al. replication to

            stop running because a small number of institution names in our 13F ownership data are

            different than what was used in Azar et al. (2018). An additional line of code was added to

            keep these unmatched institutions. Dropping these institutions instead has little impact.

       5. Deleted the “capture log close” command in “Prepare Data – Regressions RP.do” to prevent

            the program from crashing because of the earlier log file we already created and opened.

       And, below are the additional modifications made to the code to incorporate GGL and re-estimate

Azar et al.’s Table 3 regressions using a market-level GGL rather than MHHID.

       6. Inserted code into “Prepare Data – Ownership RP.do” file to construct a variable that captures

            the 𝛽 needed to later calculate an institution’s likelihood of being attentive, 𝑔(𝛽). This 𝛽 is

            calculated for each institution-stock-quarter observation and saved alongside the other

            ownership variables being constructed in Azar et al.’s code.

        7. Inserted code into “Prepare Data – Ownership RP.do” file to set the probability of attention, g,

            equal to zero for Azar et al. (2018)’s hand-collected data on non-institutions. This is necessary




                                                     41
    since we do not observe a non-institution’s full portfolio, which is required to calculate its 𝛽.

    This effectively drops these non-institutions from our GGL estimations. If we instead assume

    full attention (i.e., g = 1) for these non-institutions, there is little impact on the GGL estimates.

8. Inserted code into “Prepare Data – Deltas RP.do” to calculate the likelihood of being attentive,

    𝑔(𝛽), for each institution-stock-quarter observation. This code is modified depending on which

    version of GGL is being constructed. Then, inserted code to calculate the market-level GGL

    for each market, as defined by Azar et al. (2018), using this attention probability and the other

    ownership variables that are already constructed in the Azar et al. (2018) code. These market-

    level measures of GGL are then saved to a separate DTA file.

9. Added code to the “Prepare Data – Regressions RP.do” file to merge in the market-level GGL

    measures constructed in the earlier DO files.

10. Added code to the “Regressions – Price Baseline RP.do” file to run the regressions of Azar et

    al.’s using the market-level GGL measure instead of the MHHID.




                                              42
Appendix E – Additional details regarding acquisition data and regression

    We follow the approach of Harford et al. (2011) in constructing our merger data and control variables

with a few modifications. First, our dataset consists of all completed acquisitions during our 1998-2012

sample time period, resulting in 1,790 acquisitions. Similar to Harford et al. (2011) we rely on Thomson

Reuters SDC for our underlying raw merger data on the bidder and target identity. Second, unlike Harford

et al. (2011), we use all firm pairs in our data set, as opposed to merger pairs and a matched sample. Third,

we construct all control variables as in Harford et al. (2011), except we winsorize several ratio variables at

the 1% level for the computation of controls: return on assets (ROA), earnings to price, and market to book.

    Our comparisons in the main paper between GGL metrics and mergers relate to the GGLi,j,t as of Dec

31 in a given year (manager i’s incentive to internalize the impact of her actions on firm j in year t) and the

likelihood of firm i acquiring firm j in year t + 1.

Figure 4: Histogram of predicted changes in managers' incentives to internalize externalities following the BGI/Blackrock merger in 2009
This figure plots a histogram of the predicted percentage change in GGL Linear versus the predicted percentage change in GGL FullAttention due to the 2009 merger between
BlackRock and BGI. The predicted change is calculated by holding the ownership stakes of all institutional investors constant and recalculating the two GGL measures in 2008
under the assumption that the portfolios of BGI and BlackRock are now owned by the same investor, the merged entity.

This figure plots the proportion of GGL Linear (top panel), GGL Convex (middle panel), and GGL Concave (bottom
panel) that can be attributed to investors classified as either an activist investor or an index investor. The
remaining proportion, which is not plotted, is all other institutions. For indexers, we only use the holdings of
BGI, Blackrock, State Street, and Vanguard, while for activists, we only include the holdings of hedge funds
that have engaged in some form of activism, as identified in Brav et al., 2008 and 2010.

decile. The regression includes investor-by-year and stock-by-year fixed effects, and a linear extrapolation is applied between point estimates to construct the above figure,
where g(𝛽) is set equal to zero for 𝛽 = 0. More details of the underlying estimation are provided in Section 5 and the Appendix.

Table 1: Summary Statistics
This table reports summary statistics from 1998-2012 for common ownership variables and variables that are later used as explanatory variables. The
ownership variables are defined in Section 1 of the paper, and as discussed in Section 1, all GGL variables are scaled by their sample average. The
explanatory variables are composed of index indicator variables (coded 1 if both firms are in an index and 0 otherwise), average institutional ownership across
the pair, and average size (average log assets of the two firms). Average Industry HHI is the average HHI of the industries, based on a 3-digit SIC code
industry classification, of each of the firms in a pair. The industry dummy is 1 if both firms in a pair belong to the same 3-digit SIC industry and is 0 otherwise.

Table 2: GGL with Full Attention
This table reports regression estimates of the relationship between GGL FullAttention and
index inclusion, average institutional ownership, industry, and industry concentration.
The unit of observation is at the stock-pair-year direction level. The dependent
variable, GGL FullAttention , reflects the relative incentive of the manager of stock i to
internalize the impact of externalities on the value of stock j in year t when g = 1.
Index dummy variables are coded 1 if both stocks are in that particular index and 0
otherwise, and average institutional ownership is the average share of equity held by
institutional investors across the two stocks. Average size is the average of the log
assets of the two stocks in year t . Average Industry HHI is the average HHI of the
industries, based on a 3-digit SIC code industry classification, for the two stocks in the
pair. The industry dummy is 1 if stocks in a pair belong to the same industry and is 0
otherwise. These regressions are based on data from 1998 through 2012. All
specifications include pair-direction fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by
stock i , and t- statistics are reported in brackets below the coefficient estimates. *
indicates significance at the 10% level, ** at the 5% level, and *** at the 1% level.

Table 3: GGL Measures That Do Not Assume Full Attention
This table reports regression estimates of the relationship between our model-derived measure of common ownership that
accounts for the impact of investor inattention on managerial incentives and index inclusion, average institutional ownership,
industry, and industry concentration. The unit of observation is at the stock-pair-year direction level. The dependent variable,
GGL , reflects the relative incentive of the manager of stock i to internalize the impact of externalities on the value of stock j in
year t . Definitions of the different versions of GGL are provided in the text, and each GGL measure is scaled by its sample
average. Index dummy variables are coded 1 if both stocks i and j are in that particular index in year t and 0 otherwise, and
average institutional ownership is the average share of equity held by institutional investors across the two stocks in year t .
Average size is the average of the log assets of the two stocks in year t . Average Industry HHI is the average HHI of the
industries, based on a 3-digit SIC code industry classification, for the two stocks in the pair. The industry dummy is 1 if stocks
in a pair belong to the same industry and is 0 otherwise. These regressions are based on data from 1998 through 2012. All
specifications include pair-direction fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by stock i and t -statistics are reported in
brackets below the coefficient estimates. *, **, *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, 1% levels, respectively.

Table 4: Common Investor Portfolio Weights and Index Inclusion
This table reports regression estimates of the relationship between the sum of the betas,
      Sum
Beta      , and index inclusion, average institutional ownership, industry, and industry
concentration. The unit of observation is at the stock-pair-year direction level. The
dependent variable is the sum of portfolio weights of stock i in common investors'
portfolios in year t across all common investors in stocks i and j in year t . Index
dummy variables are coded 1 if both stocks are in that particular index and 0 otherwise,
and average institutional ownership is the average share of equity held by institutional
investors across the two stocks. Average size is the average of the log assets of the
two stocks in year t . Average Industry HHI is the average HHI of the industries, based
on a 3-digit SIC code industry classification, for the two stocks in the pair. The
industry dummy is 1 if stocks in a pair belong to the same industry and is 0 otherwise.
 These regressions are based on data from 1998 through 2012. All specifications

Table 5: GGL With Fitted Attention Function
This table reports regression estimates of the relationship between our model-derived
measure of common ownership that accounts for the impact of investor inattention on
managerial incentives and index inclusion, average institutional ownership, industry,
and industry concentration. The unit of observation is at the stock-pair-year direction
level. The dependent variable, GGL Fitted , reflects the relative incentive of the manager
of stock i to internalize the impact of externalities on the value of stock j in year t ,
based on the attention function estimated in Section 5. Index dummy variables are
coded 1 if both stocks i and j are in that particular index in year t and 0 otherwise, and
average institutional ownership is the average share of equity held by institutional
investors across the two stocks in year t . Average size is the average of the log assets
of the two stocks in year t . Average Industry HHI is the average HHI of the
industries, based on a 3-digit SIC code industry classification, for the two stocks in the
pair. The industry dummy is 1 if stocks in a pair belong to the same industry and is 0
otherwise. These regressions are based on data from 1998 through 2012. All

Table 6: Replication of Table 3 in Azar et al. (2018) using GGL
This table reports our replication of the findings found in Table 3 of Azar et al. (2018) after replacing their market-level
measure of common ownership, MHHID , with the market-level version of GGL . Each reported value represents a point
estimate from an individual regression using the same controls and specification from Azar et al. (2018). For brevity, the
estimates for the controls in each regression are not reported. The estimates are creating using the replication package
posted by Azar et al., which can be downloaded at: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jofi.12698. Details on
the modifications made to their code to create these estimates are provided in the Appendix. Standard errors are reported in
parentheses. * indicates significance at the 10% level, ** at the 5% level, and *** at the 1% level.

Table 7: Managerial Incentives Arising from Common Ownership and Mergers
This table reports regression estimates of the relationship between our model-derived measure of common
ownership that accounts for the impact on managerial incentives, GGL , and firm decisions to merge. The unit of
observation is at the stock-pair-year direction level. The dependent variable, is a 0 or 1 depending on whether
stock i acquires firm j at time t+1 . Definitions of the different versions of GGL are provided in the text, and
each GGL measure is scaled by its sample average. Control variables included in the regressions are target
institutional ownership percentage, target market capitalization, target market leverage, target market-to-book
ratio, target earnings-to-price ratio, target asset liquidity, target return on assets, target prior year stock return,
absolute difference in institutional ownership percentage across firms, absolute difference in market capitalization
across firms, absolute difference in market-to-book across firms, absolute difference in return on assets across
firms, absolute difference in prior year stock return across firms. All specifications include pair-direction fixed
effects. Standard errors are clustered by stock i , and t -statistics are reported in brackets below the coefficient
estimates. * indicates significance at the 10% level, ** at the 5% level, and *** at the 1% level.

Appendix Table 1: Replication of Table 3 in Azar et al. (2018)
This table reports our replication of the findings found in Table 3 of Azar et al. (2018) using the replication package
posted by Azar et al. on the Journal of Finance website. This replication package can be downloaded at:
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jofi.12698. The replication, while very close to the original
findings reported in Azar et al. (2018), are not exact. This is likely because of small, post-publication changes in
the underlying 13F and airlines data, which is not provided as part of the replication package. Details on the
modifications to their code that were made to create these estimates are provided in the Appendix. Standard errors
are reported in parantheses. * indicates significance at the 10% level, ** at the 5% level, and *** at the 1% level.
