                        The Theory of Optimum Deficits and Debt

                                       ABSTRACT


     The paper surveys a number of neo—classical and neo—Keynesian approcaches to
government financial policy. After reviewing the very restrictive conditions under
which financial policy is just a veil without real consequences, non—neutral financial
policy in neo—classical models is analyzed. At full employment, the substitution of
borrowing for lump sum taxes crowds out private capital formation in a closed economy.
Government financial policy can be used to implement optimal intertemporal risk
distribution schemes. In the presence of distortionary taxes, the smoothing of
tax rates over time may be optimal even where this involves systematic and predictable
departures from continuous budget balance.

     The case for deficit finance and the operation of the automatic fiscal stabilizers
in a Keynesian world with disequilibrium in labour and output markets is restated.


     The case for any kind of active financial policy rests on the presence of
capital market imperfections (including incomplete contingent forward markets
such as insurance markets), on the longevity of the institution of government and
on the government's unique ability to tax.


     Finally, certain long—run aspects of the fiscal and monetary stance are
analyzed. This includes their sustainability, i.e. the consistency of long—
term spending and taxation plans with the monetary objectives and the crowding out
targets. The concepts of the comprehensive net worth of the public sector and its
permanent income are central to this analysis. The current U.K. position appears to
be one of an unsustainable, "permanent surplus."

1. Introduction

   This paper deals with some of the issues that arise in connection with
   the optimal financing of a given progrannne of "exhaustive" public
   spending on goods and services. The determination of the size and
   composition of this real spending programme is not considered. A more
   general    view would encompass the optimal joint determination of the

   public sector 's consumption and investment programme   and its method of
   financing,    but even the less ambitious approach adopted here raises a

   very wide range of issues and considerations.



   Government financial policy is about the management of the public sector

   balance sheet, broadly defined. It includes the choice of taxation

   versus borrowing. It also concerns the composition or structure of

   taxes (lump-sum, direct, indirect, degree of progression, etc.) and

   the characteristics of the debt instruments issued by the government

   (interest-bearing or non-interest bearing, legal tender, maturity, degree

   of indexing, etc.). Monetary policy, exchange rate management and foreign

   exchange market intervention therefore belong to financial policy as

   much as open market operations or bond issues "to finance the deficit".

   It should be obvious that questions concerning the distribution of income

   (intra—generational as well as intergenerational) are inextricably

   intertwined   with questions relating to the financing of a given real
   spending   programme. Stiglitz (l983a,b) has emphasised the inevitable

   intertemporal and intergenerational risk-sharing attributes of financial

   policy, something I shall return to in Section II.
                                     2




        Like any other kind of government intervention in the economy,

government financial policy can be rationalised in one of two ways.

The   first is intervention for purely distributional reasons. While
they are of major importance, I shall not pay much attention in what
follows to the distributional objectives of the government. The dist-
trthutional   consequences of alternative financing rules will,however,

be central. Indeed financial policy influences real economic variables

largely by affecting the intertemporal and interpersonal (including

intergenerational) distribution of income and wealth. The second justif-

ication for financial policy is the identification of instance(s) of

market failure together with the attribution to the government of the

ability   to undertake remedial welfare-improving actions that private
agents either cannot undertake or do not find in their own perceived
self—interest to undertake.


         The market "imperfections" central to   an appreciation of the
potential welfare-improving role of financial policy are capital market
imperfections.    Included in this   are any restrictions on the ability
of   private agents to effect intertemporal transfers of purchasing power

in either direction at social intertemporal terms    of trade. In the
overlapping   generations model with finite lives and   without   operative

intergenerational   gifts and bequests, the   incompleteness of the set of

forward   markets (or the absence of a full set of Arrow—Debreu securities)
is due to the "technological" constraint that the dead cannot consume
goods and services and the    legal constraint that private agents cannot

impose binding financial obligations on the unborn. In real life this
                                     3




non-existence of certain forward    markets   is augmented by a   wide array
of    capital market imperfections. Private agents are constrained in

their spending plans by the illiquidity and non-marketability of
certain assets such as pension rights and human capital (including
expected   future income tax   cuts) . Collateral requirements limit access
to    credit. These cash flow constraints, liquidity constraints, lack

of suitable collateral, non-marketability of certain assets and a host

of similar capital market imperfections need not take the form of strict

credit rationing but may instead merely be reflected in a market price

of credit that is in excess of its shadow price.



        My inability to borrow on the same terms as the U.K. government

is of course not in and of itself evidence of market failure. Recent

applications of the theory of market equilibrium under asymmetric

Information to credit markets (see e.g. Webb [1981], Stiglitz and Weiss

[1981, 1983 1)   however, have shown how adverse selection or moral hazard

can generate privately rational but socially inefficient equilibria that

may be characterized by credit rationing, excessive spreads between lending

and borrowing rates, etc.



        Granted the existence of significant and persistent capital

market imperfections, does the "opportunity set" of the government

differ from and in certain respects dominate that of private agents?

In the overlapping generations model already referred to, there are

two   features   that differentiate private and public possibility sets.

First, the institution of government is longer-lived than the individual
                                          4



private agents. Frequently endowed with eternal life, governments can,

in these models, enter into contracts that extend beyond the life-span

of   any given generation. In this way governments can be a substitute
for some of the non—existent forward markets. Second, the authorities
have the power to tax, i.e. the power to impose unrequited charges or
payments       on   individuals. For good reasons, governments are exceedingly
jealous       of thith power   and discourage   private agents from assuming this

prerogative which is classified as theft when exercised on private

initiative.



        The    power to tax enables the government to redistribute income
between members of the same generation at a point in time, over time
for an (a group of) individual(s) and between generations.            This power

to tax is also the reason why, in an uncertain world, governments can
                                                                    1/
borrow on terms that are superior to those faced by private agents.

Total current        and future national income is, subject to political

constraints on the tax burden, the collateral for government borrowing.

The risk of default through insolvency (but not of discretionary or

dishonest      default) is therefore less for governmentbonds than for private
debt.    Most governments also have the power to determine         what shall
be legal tender. Almost all have opted for a government monopoly of
legal tender, thus adding directly to the attractiveness of those of

their liabilities designated to be legal tender (their monetary liabilities)

    The insertion of the word "most" before 'governments' and 'private

and improving indirectly the quality of all public debt. Most of the

other differences between private and public opportunity sets referred

o in the literature derive from the greater longevity of the institut-
                                                         2/
ion   of government and the government's power to tax.        The view of
government financial policy I am advocating has governments acting as
a superior financial intermediary, changing the composition of private
sector portfolios over time and altering private disposable income flows.
Well—designed policy interventions of this kind exploit the government's
"comparative advantage" in borrowing to smooth out income        streams and
facilitate risk sharing. By exploiting its position as the "natural
borrower", or borrower of first resort, governments can minimize the
extent to which disposable income, current cash flow and the portfolio
of liquid, marketable or realizeable assets become binding constraints
on private consumption, investment, production and portfolio allocation

decisions.



      This view of financial policy is at the opposite end of the spectrum

from the ancient "debt neutrality" position as restated by Barro [1974]

(see also Buiter [1979, l980a] and Carmichael [1982]). Debt neutrality,

i.e. invariance of the real solution trajectaries of the economy under-

changes in the borrowing—taxation mix, prevails if financial policy

cannot affect the intertemporal (including the intergenerational) distribution

of income and terms of trade. With infinite-lived households or,

equivalently, finite-lived   households characterized by      an operative chain

of intergenerational gift and bequest motives, with private access to



2. e.g. Webb [1981] shows how government financial policy will be non-
   neutral in a world with asymmetric information, if it is less costly
   for the government to extract taxes from reluctant taxpayers than it is
   for private lenders to compel performance by dishonest borrowers.
                                      6




capital markets on the same    terms as the   government   and with   unrestricted

lump-sum taxes and    transfers, public sector financial policy is irrelevant.

Relaxing    any or all of these exceedingly restrictive assumptions causes
this Modigliani—Miller theorem for the public sector to break down and a
potential   welfare-improving role for active financial policy to emerge.



    Active financial policy is most easily defined as the orthogonal

complement of passive financial policy. Passive financial policy I

define as balanced budget financial policy, i.e. a continuous or period—

by-period matching of receipts and expenditures. Weakly passive financial

policy permits balanced budget redistribution; strictly passive financial

policy compels taxes and taxes net of transfers and subsidies to be the

same. It is well—known that, e.g. in the over-lapping generations model

of Diamond [1965] , a balanced budget social security scheme implemented

through lump sum taxes on the young and lump—sum transfer payments to the

old will depress capital formation. Most balanced budget intertemporal

or intergenerational redistribution schemes can be reproduced in terms of

their effects on all real endogenous variables by unbalanced budget policies

involving public sector borrowing or lending. e.g. the social security

scheme   just mentioned is isomorphic to government borrowing with debt
service financed by new debt issues and by lump sum        taxes   on the young.
Without risk of ambituity I   shall   therefore identify active financial
policies   with policies that permit, under specified conditions, systematic

and predictable departures from budget balance.



   Active financial policy, as just defined, has a wide range of functions
                                               7



and. consequences, only a few of which can be considered here. By

influencing the interpersonal, intertemporal and intergenerational

distribution of income it will affect risk sharing, the extent to

which households can smooth consumption over the life cycle and capital

formation. All this can occur in models in which current goods and

labour markets clear continuously. I shall discuss this briefly in

Section II. If lump sum taxes are not feasible, the timing of distortionary

taxes will influence to total excess burden or dead weight loss imposed

on the economy. The same will hold if tax collection costs in any given

period are a more than linearly increasing function of the marginal or

average tax rate in that period. This is considered in Section III.

Again this applies in labour and output market clearing models.



    For models with a strong new classical flavour, it has been established

that various contingent or conditional financial rules (monetary or

fiscal feedback rules) which are, in general, inconsistent with continuous

budget balance, will alter the joint distribution function of real

economic variables by changing the information content of currently observed

prices when there is incomplete information about the current state (Weiss

[1980] ,   Turnovsky   [1980 1   , Buiter   [l980b, 1981 1).   While of some theoretical
interest, this financial stabilization channel appears to be of secondary

practical importance and I shall not consider it any further here.



    In a world with persistent labour market and/or output market disequil-.

ibriuin, the capital market imperfections that are the sine qua non of

financial policy spill over into the markets for output and labour.                E.g.

the existence of the multiplier, which is due to the inclusion of current
                                      8




disposable   income as an argument in the private consumption function,

over and above its contribution to permanent income, reflects a

cpital market imperfection -    the   difficulty of borrowing against the

security of anticipated future labour     income.    In a fixed price model

the operation of the multiplier amplifies the effect of demand shocks

on output and employment. Financial policy entailing temporary deficits
                                               3/
may be the appropriate government response.         The balanced budget

multiplier theorem would appear to suggest that any desired response to

demand   shocks can be achieved without deficits by varying both exhaustive
public spending and taxes net of transfers. I would argue that, to a
first order approximation, optimal budgetary stabilization policy of this
kind   would involve varying taxes and transfers in response to demand

shocks while leaving the path of public consumption and investment spending

unchanged. The intuitive reasons for this are that if public sector

consumption spending is worthwhile, it is worthwhile      regardless of the
aggregate   demand shocks that afflict the economy and that the time profile

of   public sector capital formation is dictated within rather narrow
limits by the time profile of future planned public sector production.
The government's spending programme on goods and services should be
designed to achieve the best feasible public—private consumption mix out

of permanent national income. The tax-transfer-borrowing and money

creation rules should be aimed at optimizing national permanent income,

keeping private disposable income in line with private permanent income

and ensuring an adequate share of disposable, realizable (financial)




3. First best policy would eliminate the market imperfections. The
    discussion assumes that this has been pursued as far as is possible.

private wealth in total or comprehensive private wealth, which includes

such illiquid assets as human capital.



      The above   applies to the optimai design of exhaustive spending
policies and   financing policies. If, as in the U.K. today, certain

categories of public spending (especially public sector capital

formation) have been cut to levels that are well below       most reasonable
notions of optimality and if at the same time a "Keynesian" fiscal
boost   to aggregate demand is desirable, both structural (or allocative)

and stabilization purposes can be served by a larger volume of spending

on goods and services (social overhead capital formation and investment

in some of the nationalized industries in the U.K.). In Section IV I

review briefly some of the well—known arguments .about the role of

deficits   and debt in short run stabilization policy when    there is

disequilibrium    in labour and product markets.


     Concern about debt and deficits on the part of the authorities tends
to derive from two alleged consequences of public sector deficits. First,
to the extent that deficits are monetized they are feared to lead to
inflation. Second, to the extent that they are not monetized but financed
by   issuing interest—bearing debt, they are feared to "crowd out" interest-

sensitive private spending, especially private capital formation. This

"crowding out" can occur either through uard pressure on real interest

rates caused by additional borrowing or by displacing private capital

formation at given real interest rates, as in Sargent and Wallace [1981 1

(see also Buiter [1982a, b; 1983 1   ). Section    V considers in   some depth the
                                         10



      "eventual monetization" implied by the government's fiscal and financial
                                                     4/
                                                     —
      plans and the long-term financial crowding out    implications of the
      government'sbudgetary and monetary policy. While these issues belong

      to the domain of positive rather than normative fiscal and financial

      policy, they are of considerable practical interest. On the principle

      that feasibility is a prerequisite for optimality Section V therefore

      analyses the sustainability, consistency and credibility of fiscal,

      financial and monetary policy. The comprehensive net worth and permanent

      income of the public sector are two central concepts in this analysis.




II.   Financial policy with lump—sum taxes and transfers when goods markets

      and factor markets clear.



           Using the analytical framework of the simple overlapping generations

      model without intergenerational gift and bequest motives, Stiglitz [1983a,b

      establishes the following propositions for the case where unrestricted

      lump sum   taxes and transfers are possible   and output and factor markets

      clear.



      Proposition I (Stiglitz 1983a)


           An increase in the government deficit has neither real nor inflationary
      effects so long as the associated changes in (lump sum) taxes are distribution


      4.   I only consider the familiar financial crowding out issue. Other forms
           of "direct" crowding out due to compleinentarity or substitutability
           between private and public consumption and investment etc. are not
           dealt with (see Buiter [1977] ).
                                  11




neutral and so long as the debt will eventually be reduced to its

original level.



Proposition II (Stiglitz 1983b)



    A temporary change in the structure (maturity composition, nature

and degree of index linking, etc.) of the public debt has no real or

price level effects provided it is accompanied with the appropriate

lump sum taxes/subsidies to avoid any distributive effects.



Proposition III (Stiglitz 1983a, b)



    A change in the interest rate paid on (unindexed) government debt

financed by a change in the supply of such debt has price level effects

but no real effects.



    Note that all these propositions apply to an economy in which there

is no explicit or implicit transactions technology. Government debt has

a store of value function only; there is no special medium of exchange or

means of payment function for a subset of the public sector's financial

liabilities, i.e. there are no monetary assets. "Inflation" in Stiglitz's

models is a decline in the price of public debt in terms of real output.

The first two propositions give the conditions under which the Modigliani-

Miller theorem for the public sector holds in this economy. The third

propositionis the familiar classical dichotomy.
                                   12




     The interest of Propositions I —   III lies   in the extreme restrict-

iveness of the conditions under which financial policy will be neutral.

Stiglitz goes on to show that



Proposition IV (Stiglitz 1983a)



    Any anticipated changes in financial policy other than those

described in propositions I, II and III have both real and price level

effects on the economy. Any unanticipated change has no real effects

on the economy only if   it doesn't change individual's subjective
probability distributions concerning future government financial policy

and if all changes in debt are accompanied by changes in lump—sum taxes

and subsidies to neutralize any distributional consequences.



    Having established the non-neutrality of "almost all" financial

policy actions or rules, the design of optimal financial policy can

be tackled. Since the class of models under consideration is rather

far removed from practical applications, I shall limit the discussion

to two aspects of optimal financial policy.



Government   debt and private capital formation


    In the Diamond version of the overlapping      generations model, debt

issues   involve redistribution from the young to the old. This depresses
saving   and capital formation in the short run and lowers the steady—

state capital-labour ratio. In such economies private decentralized

decision making can result in equilibria in which the real interest rate
                                         13




is below the natural growth rate. This dynamic inefficiency can be

eliminated by issuing government debt to absorb excessive private

saving. If the real interest rate exceeds the growth rate such Pareto—

improving financial policies are not feasible. Given the government's

social welfare function (which would typically be strictly increasing

in the welfare of each generation), social welfare improving financial

policy actions may still exist. E.g. budget surpluses and government

lending can boost capital formation. The welfare loss this imposes on

those currently old may be more than compensated for by the welfare gains

of   the young and   of   future generations.


Optimal intertemporal risk distribution schemes


     The effects of    financial policy on private capital formation occur

even without uncertainty. In a stochastic environment government financial

policy   can generate changes in the intertemporal (and specifically the
intergenerational)     distribution of risk. In the   two period overlapping
generations model, individuals of different generation cannot trade risks
in the market place. The longevity of the institution of government

permits intergenerational risk sharing through the public debt—tax-transfer
mechanism. A detailed analysis can be found in Stiglitz (1983a, b) who
shows that the optimal (in terms of an individualistic social welfare
        5/
function ) intertemporal distribution of wealth and risk can be implemented,
at a constant price level, through financial policy involving only a single

5. Stiglitz [1983a] uses a social welfare function that is the discounted
    sum of each generation's utility. The proposition about optimal inter-
     generational    risk sharing transcends this specific parameterization.
                                           14




     financial instrument provided the government can impose age—differentiated

     lump—sum   taxes and transfers. When lump—sum taxes       and transfers cannot

     be   fully adapted to individual characteristics, the existence of a
     variety   of public sector debt instruments is potentially welfare improving.



          The time profile of debt and deficits under optimal financial policy

     will be a function of all taste and technology parameters in the economy,

     of the stochastic shocks disturbing it and of the authorities' objective

     functional. Generalizations are impossible other than the rather self—

     evident one that a policy of continuous budget balance is likely to be

     optimal under a set of conditions of measure zero.




III. Financial policy with distortionary taxes and transfers when goods markets

     and factor markets clear.



          Recently Barrow [1979, 1981] and Kydland and Prescott [1980] have

     applied a well known "uniform taxation" theorem in public finance to

      the macroeconomic problem of optimal public sector debt       and deficits in

     an economy with continuous full employment. In the absence of uncertainty

     and given suitable symmetry, homogeneity and separability assumptions,

      it is optimal to levy wage taxes at a constant proportional rate throughout

     an individual's lifetime. (See Sandmo [1974, 1976] , Sadka [1977] and

     Atkinson   and Stiglitz [1980 1).   The   argument   assumes the   non-availability
     of lump sum taxes and subsidies. The original public finance literature
     was formulated in terms of the deadweight loss or excess burden of fiscal
                                         15



programs involving distortionary taxes, whose minimization (under fairly

strict conditions) required the equalization of planned tax rates over

the present and the future. Barro's papers consider the possibility of

tax collection costs being an increasing and strictly convex function
                                                           6/
of the ratio of the net total tax take to the tax base.          Even in non-

stochastic models, a rigorous statement has not been given of the

conditions under which the result holds true that the optimal total tax

take as a proportion of GDP (or of labour income?) is constant over time,

for an economy with the real—world plethora of direct and indirect taxes,

taxes on labour and capital income and taxes on wealth. For a stochastic

environment,     Barro [1981] has argued that the deterministic constant
planned tax      rate solution translates approximately into a Martingale

process for the tax rate T ,      i.e.

(1)        E(Tt÷.l2t) = Tt         i>0

           E is the conditional expectation operator and        the information

           include   Tt)




Equation    (1) follows from its deterministic counterpart only by abuse

of certainty equivalence. For (1) to be strictly correct, a LQG         (linear—
quadratic—gaussian) model structure is required. Given quadratic dead-

weight losses, linear constraints and additive white noise disturbances,




6. A non—fatal flaw in his analysis is the absence of collection costs
    in the government budget constraint and the independence of the tax
    base from collection costs and the time path of taxes. (See Kremers
      [1983] )

equation (1) follows. An important (and implausible) restriction this
                                                    7/
imposes is that of non-stochastic discount rates.        -




    Many empirical as well as conceptual problems stand in the way of

a direct application of (1) to normative or positive policy design.

How does one approximate the "average marginal tax rate" that belongs

in equation (1)? What is the proper tax base to relate the tax rate

to? Should one use taxes or taxes net of transfers and subsidies, as

the theory suggests?



    In spite of these and other objections to the strict "uniform

expected tax rates over time" proposition, the notion that it is

optimal to smooth planned tax rates relative to planned exhaustive

public spending because collection costs and/or excess burdens increase
                                                             8/
more than linearly with the tax rate, is likely to be robust.    In

the strict   version of equation (1) the theory implies that a temporary
increase in public spending unaccompanied by a matching increase in
real output (the tax base) should be financed at least in part by
borrowing. A transitory increase in real output will, given public
spending, be associated with a budget surplus. The "countercyclical"
behaviour   of the deficit that will characterize the economy if the

exogenous level of output follows a regular cyclical pattern and public
                    9/
spending is constant   has nothing to do with Keynesian fiscal stabilization

forever. This would cause the last term on the right-hand side of

(iii a, b) to vanish if n <     r.   If n >   r,   however, Ponzi games can

work   forever. Governments can forever service their debt by further
borrowing without    any risk of debt service requirements outstripping

the government's collateral. A competitive, decentralized over-

lapping generations economy can have temporary and stationary

solutions with n >   r.    Indeed, Carmichael [1982] and Buiter [19801

show   that if there are   intergenerational gift and bequest motives and

if there is   a stationary equilibrium in     which the child-to-parent gift

motive   is operative, then such an equilibrium is necessarily dynamically
inefficient with n > r. Like Barro, I make use of a government wealth
constraint such as (1) in Section V. This means that unless n <
the "no Ponzi game" restriction is imposed in an ad—hoc manner.

    policy     or   the   operation of the automatic stabilizers, however. These

    are    considered in the next section.


IV. Optimal debt and deficits when labour and output markets don't clear


           The Keynesian arguments for running larger deficits (smaller
    surpluses) when        effective   demand is depressed and smaller deficits
     (larger    surpluses) when effective demand is buoyant are familiar.

    Tax cuts in the face of negative demand shocks (or the "automatic"

    decline of taxes and rise in transfer payments when economic activity

    falls, that is written into most existing tax and benefit laws) help

    maintain disposable income. To the extent that disposable income rather

    than permanent income is the binding constraint on private demand, such

    active financial policy helps dampen fluctuations in output and employment.



           In Keynesian models, with workers off their notional labour supply

    schedules and possibly also firms off their notional demand curves for

    labour, avoiding demand—induced swings in real activity is sensible

    policy.



           By reducing taxes (net of transfers) and increasing borrowing during

    the downswing, exhaustive public spending during the downswing will be

    financed to a larger extent by private agents who are not constrained by

    current disposable income —         the   purchasers of the bonds.   Total consumption
    demand will      therefore decline by less than if taxes, which I assume to

    fall   equally on disposable-income—constrained and permanent income—constrained
                                       20




 private   agents, had been kept constant during the downswing.    When the

 economy recovers, the additional debt incurred during the downswing can

be repaid out of higher than normal taxes. The demand effects of

cyclical tax cuts during the downswing and    tax   increases during the

upswing may not be symmetric if, as seems likely, more private agents

are constrained in their spending by current disposable income during

the   downswing than during the upswing.


      The smoothing out of consumption over the cycle permitted by counter-
cyclical financial policy would be   desirable because of its intertemporal

allocative effects even if product and factor markets cleared. Its

virtues are enhanced by the initial demand—disturbance-amplifying presence

of labour and output market disequilibrium.



      when used for cyclical stabilization, successful financial policy

should not imply any trend increase in the real stock of debt or in the

debt—output ratio. If real interest rates are increasing functions of

current and anticipated future deficits,the transitory and reversible

deficits that are associated with countercyclical policy should have but

minor effects on real interest rates. Thus, by raising the level of

activity, countercyclical deficits absorb private saving in the short run

without lowering the capital stock in the long run. If real interest rate

determination is more myopic, even short run and reversible increases in

deficits and debt may lead to significant crowding out of interest-

sensitive private spending. In most existing macromodels such crowding

out can be avoided by monetizing part of the deficit. Provided this
                                      21



monetization is reversed (and is expected to be reversed) in proper

 countercyclical fashion during the upswing, it   should   have no effect

on trend monetary growth and thus on inflationary expectations.



      For the sake of completeness, I will conclude this section with the

familiar reminder that there are no "model—free' measures of the short—

run   effect   of fiscal or financial policy on aggregate demand. Neither

the uncorrected or raw deficit, nor the cyclically corrected deficit,

nor the cyclically and inflation—corrected deficit nor the permanent

deficit of Section V are proper measures of fiscal impact. The "demand-

weighted" (i.e. marginal-propensity-to-spend-on-domestic-output_adjusted),

cyclically corrected deficit calculated e.g. in the U.K. by the National

Institute of Economic and Social Research, as well as the "demand-

weighted", cyclically adjusted and inflation corrected deficit calculated

for the U.K. by Buiter and Miller [1983] are appropriate indices of the

short—run demand effect of fiscal policy only in a static, rather old-
                                           10/
Keynesian and expectations—innocent model.     The first best approach

would be to simulate one's preferred model of the economy under different

values of fiscal and financial policy parameters and to call the difference

between the solution trajectories (or the statistics describing them)

the measure of fiscal impact. These fiscal stance measures will therefore

a) be model—specific, b) have time subscripts attached to them and c) be

functions of when a particular fiscal or financial action (or rule change)

was first anticipated, of its anticipated degree of permanence and of the

degree of confidence with which these expectations are held.


10. In the case of Buiter and Miller [1983] the "inflation correction",
     or more appropriately, the debt service correction, presupposes that
     private financial intermediaries transform current interest payments
     from governments into permanent (disposable) real interest income flows
     to households.

V. Longer—run aspects of the fiscal and monetary stance:

    sustainability, consistency and credibility               -




       Preoccupation with the current budget deficit or public sector
   borrowing   requirement (PSBR) can be criticized for a variety of

   reasons. First, the budget deficit is likely to be a poor or even

   perverse indicator of the short—run cyclical demand effects of

    spending and taxation policy. Second the size or change of the deficit

   bears no straightforward relation to the allocative or structural

   effects of government spending and tax programmes. A third major

   reason for not paying too much attention to the PSBR is that it

   conveys little or no information on the          sustainability of the

   fiscal stance, i.e. on the consistency of long—term budgetary spending—

   taxation plans, monetary targets and financial crowding out objectives.

   The level or change in the current deficit are uninformative as to

   the credibility of the government's budgetary, debt and        monetary policy.


       In what follows I combine the comprehensive accounting framework

   developed in Buiter [19831 with the permanent cost of debt service

   approach of Miller (Miller 11982] ,    Miller   and Babbs [1983 1).   With this

   apparatus one can address the following issues. First, can previously

   planned spending programmes be financed, given projected real output

   growth, without raising explicit tax rates or increasing seigniorage

    (the inflation tax)? Second, what is the "eventual monetization"

   implied by the fiscal stance, i.e. is the government's anti-inflationary

   monetary stance fiscally compatible and credible? Third, given the
                                              23




spending and taxation plans and the monetary target, is there likely to

be financial "crowding in" our "crowding out", i.e. is there a tendency

for the real stock of interest bearing debt to fall or to rise (relative

to trend output)?



        To evaluate.sustainability and consistency we complement the govern-

ment budget constraint given in (2) by a comprehensive public sector

balance sheet in (3):

of   tangible real assets, K and R, financial liabilities M, B, C and _F* and

intangible assets T and TI.      The capital value of the note issue monopoly

TI is found by discounting the future income derived from the assets

that    are held to "back" the note circulation.


        The public sector capital stock is valued not at replacement cost
but   as the present value of its future returns on the assumption that

it remains in the public sector. The value of a publicly owned unit of

capital         need therefore not be the same as its value in alternative

(private) use or replacement cost which is set equal to 1.        (See equation

(2).)     Indeed       could be negative. Without loss of generality the total

(public +   .private)   stock of natural resource property rights is treated
                   >
as constant. R < 0         therefore means public sector acquisitions (sales)

of natural resource rights. Oil discoveries as well as changes in the price

of oil, are represented by changes in      For simplicity expected rates

of return on all assets are assumed to be equalized.     This heroic use

of certainty equivalence is a serious limitation of the current presentation

of the comprehensive wealth and permanent income approach. Index-linked

bonds (short and/or long) could be added to the framework without complic-

ations. For expositional simplicity the entire maturity distribution of

the public debt is represented by the shortest and longest maturities.



        The PSBR in Britain is measured by the right-hand side of (2). Sales

of existing public sector assets (natural resource rights and public sector

capital)    are put "above the line" and cet. par. reduce the PSBR where they
involve the ending of majority public ownership. The public sector financial

          The   rate of change of public sector net worth W(t) can be
decomposed into an anticipated                     part, W1(t,t), and an unanticipated part

W2(t,t). It is easily checked that the anticipated change in W is

given by

          For   ex ante or planning purposes only the expected change in W(t) is

          relevant       and we shall focus on this.


12.       Unanticipated changes in W are due to unexpected changes in K' R' T, TI,
          p , c and p. E.G. the unexpected change in T is given by

                                  —f5r(u,t)du
          T2(t,t) =       f   e                   [T2(s,t) - T(s,t)            5    r2(u,t)     du] ds.


          The present value of future taxes net of transfers increases if there is
          an unexpected increase in future values of T and if there is an unexpected
          reduction in future discount rates (if T(s,t) > 0).

        When          1, public sector        net worth decreases if and        only if there
 is a "real"        deficit, i.e. if public sector consumption expenditure exceeds
 the   instantaneous (short run) real return on comprehensive public sector

net worth, r(t) W(t). Public sector capital formation does not affect

public sector net worth if the shadow price of capital in the public sector,

K' equals its opportunity cost, 1, but will raise (reduce) net worth if

      > 1    (<1)


       One characterisation of a sustainable fiscal plan requires public

sector net worth to grow at the natural rate of growth of output, n, i.e.



(6)         W1(t,t) = n W


            or


(6')        g(t) =   r(t)   W(t) +
                                     (PK(t)
                                              —

            where    r =    r   n.

            and      n=y/y

If g(t) were to exceed (fall short) of the right—hand side of (6'), public

sector comprehensive net worth would be falling (rising) ex ante relative

to trend GNP. If pKK, pRR, T, S and —
                                                         CF*

the entire decline (increase) in the public sector net worth-GNP ratio would

come about through an increase (reduction) in the interest—bearing debt—GNP

ratio. In most models not exhibiting debt neutrality, such an increase

(decrease) in the "debt burden" causes financial crowding out (crowding in).

The degree arid time pattern of this financial crowding out (in) will of

course be model specific. A simple model with full crowding out is given in

       Even if PK(t) = 1, a programme satisfying (6') which would keep the

expected public sector net worth-trend GDP ratio constant, implies

anticipated variations in the share of public consumption in trend net

output, if the short real interest rate varies over time. An alternative

and more desirable approach, following Hicksian permanent income notions,

starts from the constraint (assumed to hold with strict equality) that

the present value of public consumption must not exceed W(t), i.e.

increase    in the (average) future rate of            monetary growth and thus in the rate
                   13/
of    inflation.

       Other   ways of raising public sector net worth discontinuously,

at a point in time, to finance a costlier public consumption programme

are by improving the productivity of public sector capital (an increase

in       or, if K < 1, by a sale of public sector capital (at its

replacement value) to the private sector, using the proceeds to reduce
B+pC
          say. Finally, default is an option, either de jure, by formally

repudiating debt, or de facto, by engineering an upward jump in the price

level (which is a possibility in most New Classical models), a downward

jump in the price of long—dated bonds or, if F* >                0,   a real depreciation

of the currency.



       Note that there are certain to be mechanisms at work in the economy

that link the various items in (7) together. E.g. in a Keynesian world,

a cut in the spending programme (G(t)) may lower the tax                base   and thus

T(t)   even at given tax rates. If the economy exhibits financial crowding

out(the displacement of private capital by public sector interest—bearing
                         E(t)+p(t)C(t)
debt) a larger value of                  might reduce T(t), etc.

R(t)   is the coupon yield on a real consol, when the instantaneous real

rate of return is r(t) —n and the strict expectations hypothesis holds,

i.e. investors equate anticipated real rates of return.



       Thus a share of public sector consumption in trend GDP in excess

of {( ]
         (t'
                    is    unsustainable: it would lower permanent income. One

way in which this unsustainability could show up would be through a steady

through increasing financial crowding out pressure. Two useful indicators

of the (un)sustainability of the current fiscal stance are therefore the

excess of current consumption over the value consistent with a constant

ratio of net worth to trend output or "constant net worth deficit"

14. This is by abuse of language, since this deficit can by construction
     not be permanent.

(lib)                     D(t)     g(t) —   R(t)   W(t)




         The two indices coincide when the real rate of return is expected

to be constant (r(t) =    R(t))   and the public sector uses its capital

with the same degree of inefficiency as the private sector           =   1).


        The direct approach to evaluating DW or           is, from (lla,b),

by the construction of an empirical proxy for W. For DW(t) we multiply

this by the short real rate interest net of the natural rate of growth;

for D(t) the real consol coupon yield net of the natural rate of growth

must be estimated. Even more informative would be a complete calculation

of both sides of (7). As this involves projecting the entire course of

future public consumption spending, it is also more difficult in practice.

Recent   government pronouncements in the U.K. about the need for medium
and long—term cuts in spending programmes to stop the tax burden from          rising,

can   be evaluated using this framework, however.



      At this stage, a piecemeal approach to the calculation of          and DW,

involving a series of ticorrectionsli to the conventionally measured PSBR

seems convenient. The various corrections required to go from the PSBR

to the permanent and constant net worth deficits are summarised in

        Since D(t) is probably the more interesting of the two measures, we

shall       concentrate on it. Taking the corrections to the PSBR in (12a) in

deficit (PSFD) on a national accounts basis.



— K     :      g(t) in (12 a,b)                               is public sector consumption spending. Many

consumption and capital formation. In the illustrative figures for the

U.K. given in Table 1 I finesse these problems by following standard

national income accounting conventions. On this basis, estimates of

public sector net capital formation (at replacement cost) which should

be subtracted from the PSER and PSFD as one of the steps to get to

are available in the U.K.

reflected in the use of the long real interest rate.     (This last step

is omitted in (l2b).) In public sector permanent income, debt service

on the bond debt should be evaluated by multiplying the real long run

(consol) rate of interest net of the natural growth rate, R(t), into the

market value of all bonds. Estimates for this correction for the U.K.

and a discussion of its methodological foundations are given in Miller

[1982] and in Miller and Babbs [1983] .                    They are reproduced here in Table I,

                               This   corrects for changes in the domestic currency

value of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as

for domestic inflation, real growth and                       permanent income smoothing.

It is very important for a number of LDC's which have borrowed externally

in dollars or other hard currencies. (See Buiter [1983] .)                   Its   significance

for the U.K. and U.S. is likely to be quite minor.

               — pK :            It is difficult to assess the size and magnitude of

the excess of current income from public capital over permanent income

expected peak value. While                  in   the mid and late seventies current oil

revenue fell short of its permanent value (as perceived at the time) this

situation is now reversed. The figures in Table 1 are merely illustrative

but    are quite conservative, in the sense that they are more likely to
understate permanent oil revenue.


—
    (RT       —
                  T)    :        It should be clear that current taxes net of transfers

T(t)     is       likely to be a poor proxy for R(t)        T(t). The most important
"corrections"               to T(t)   required to obtain a better   approximation to R(t) T(t)

are the following:



(a) "Cyclical" corrections to tax receipts and transfer payments.

         The yield from several major taxes (income taxes, national

         insurance contributions, VAT, corporation tax) varies inversely

         with cyclical deviations of economic activity from its full

         employment, trend or natural level. The opposite correlation

         holds for such transfer payments as unemployment benefits. Cyclical

         corrections to the conventionally measured deficit are, from

         this          perspective, desirable not because they provide a better
         approximation to the short—run demand effect of the budget, but as
         one step           towards   the calculation of public sector permanent income
         or       of the permanent deficit.
                                        35

                                                                               16 /
      In   Table 1 I use the IMP's   estimates   of the cyclical correction.

      These are very conservative in that they do not assign a zero

      cyclical correction to 1979 but instead assume the cyclically

      corrected deficit to be 2.3% of GDP larger than the actual deficit

      in 1979 and 1.4% of GDP in 1980.



      This seems to indicate an expectation of a normal unemployment

      rate in the U.K. of 8 or 9 per cent. The Institute of Fiscal
               17/
      Studies,     on the other hand, while coming up with very similar

      year—to—year changes in the cyclical correction, puts its level

      2 to 2½ percentage points of GDP higher. What matters for the

      sustainability   calculation is that a reasonable proxy for the
      expected average future levels of capacity utilization and unemp-
      loyment be used. These levels may well be functions of the fiscal

      policies adopted by the authorities and need not be equal to any

      "natural" or "full employment" values.



(b)   There may be planned, projected or expected changes in the scale

      and scope of certain tax and benefit programmes. E.g. under existing

      legislation governing contributions and benefits, the greying of

      the U.K. population implies a growing excess of pension payments

      over contributions. Similar concerns have been voiced in the U.S.

      While one could try to make some further rough structural or demographic

      corrections to the "cyclically corrected" tax and transfer total,

      I have not done so in Table I.

- RS        The perpetuity value of future seigniorage revenue is not

so easily determined. Following the definition of S(t) given in (7),

one must estimate future government plans for monetary base growth

and future dnands for real high—powered money balances

If both the rate of monetary growth and the income velocity of circul-

ation of money are expected to be constant, then

                                        permanent seigniorage income relative

to trend output equals its current value. I will make this assumption,

but the overall outcome is not very dependent on it as the amounts involved

are fairly small.

        Adopting   the IFS cyclical correction instead of the one calculated

by the IMP would lower the permanent deficit by 2 to 2½ per cent of GDP

compared to the figures in the last column of Figure II. Together with

a slightly more generous estimate of the permanent income from North Sea

oil this would generate a 5 or 6 per cent of GDP permanent surplus in

1982. This would leave room for a sizeable sustainable increase in the

share of public consumption spending in trend GDP over its current level

and/or a cut in taxes or increase in transfer payments. Alternatively

the government could choose to indulge in a bout of financial "crowding

int',   using its "permanent" surplus to reduce the real stock of interest—
bearing debt. The U.K. economy, unlike the USA, would appear to have
lots    of fiscal elbow room.



Eventual Monetization



        The apparatus developed here can be applied to the calculation of

the "long—run" monetary growth rate implied by the fiscal stance.



        From (5) and (7) it follows that




              M1(s,t) M(s,t)        _Sr(u,t)du
                                e              ds=G(t)

          t

                                                  (B(t) + pc (t)C(t) — c(t)F*(t))
         -    PK(t) K(t) + PR(t) R(t) + T(t)
                                             -
              L                                               p(t)
                                                  40


        This    'tells us what the amount of revenue to be raised through the

inflation tax is (in present value terms) given the spending programme

and. the government's tangible and intangible non—monetary assets and

liabilities. Solving this for a constant rate of monetary growth

and a' constant income velocity of circulation V                           yields




                                                                +
(13)            =   VR(t)
                                 - T(t)     -
                                                [
                                                  PK(t)t)           pR(t)R(t)
           M                - y(t)
                            G(t)                           y(t)

                                         B(t) + p(t)C(t) — c(t)F*(t)
                                                  p(t)   y(t)




        If the long—run inflation rate is governed by the rate of growth

of the money supply, say             =     - n,    and if the inflation elasticity

of velocity is less than unity, a higher monetary growth rate and a

higher rate of inflation are implied by a higher present value of public

spending relative to non—monetary assets and liabilities. Only if the

public sector's consumption and tax             proarammes, together with its non—
monetary   assets and liabilities, imply            a    high value of          is a fiscal correction

a necessary condition for achieving credibility for an anti—inflationary policy.

Eventual   monetary growth is governed in steady state by the trend public

sector current account (or consumption account) deficit, with debt service

evaluated at the real interest rate net of the natural rate of growth.

This deficit measure can differ dramatically from the conventionally

measured public sector financial deficit or PSER, which is often and

erroneously taken as an indicator to eventual monetization. (See Sargent

[1981 1   , Sargent and Wallace [1981] and Buiter [198 2a,b] and Buiter [1983 1 .)



VI    Conclusion



      Bringing   together in an integrated analytical framework the many
heterogeneous perspectives on debt and deficits that were touched upon
in   this paper is left as an exercise for the reader. What is apparent

even now is that the theory of macroeconomic policy design, as it

relates to public spending, taxation, debt management, social security,

and monetary and exchange rate policy, is a branch of the theory of

public finance, albeit a rather underdeveloped branch. Most traditional

public finance theory has been restricted to the case of Wairasian,

market—clearing economies with a complete set of markets. Most macroeconomic

analysis, except for some simple supply—side economics, ignores the efficiency

aspects of fiscal and financial policy.       The arbitrary and indeed very

harmful    dichotomy between "macroeconomic" stabilization policy — using

fiscal and financial instruments to minimize deviations from full

employment equilibrium — and "public finance" allocative or structural

policy —    altering   the full employment equilibrium — can no longer be

justified.



       Both the "classical" and the "Keynesian" approaches to financial

policy reviewed in this paper force one to conclude that a balanced

budget policy is very likely to be harmful in a wide range of circumstances.
                                 42




While mere sound economic analysis is unlikely to convince those who

are firmly committed to a balanced budget, it may help persuade a

sufficient number of uncommitted citizens of the need to ban this

spectre of false fiscal responsibility.
