The research explores the effect of industrialization on human capital formation. Exploiting
exogenous regional variations in the adoption of steam engines across France, the study
establishes that, in contrast to conventional wisdom that views early industrialization as a
predominantly deskilling process, the industrial revolution was conducive for human capital
formation, generating wide-ranging gains in literacy rates and educational attainment.

1       Introduction

The distributional consequences of technological progress have been central for the understanding
of the evolution of inequality and human capital formation in the process of development. While
it has been widely recognized that technology-skill complementarity has characterized the nature
of technological progress in advanced stages of development (Goldin and Katz, 1998), stimulating
human capital formation and fostering inequality, earlier stages of industrialization have been pre-
dominantly viewed as a deskilling process (Mokyr, 1993) which has depressed skill formation and
diminished inequality.
        This deeply entrenched view of the nature of the industrial revolution has been primarily
based on anecdotal evidence that has highlighted the adverse effect of the emergence of factories
and assembly lines on the demand for artisans and literate workers.1 Yet, as has been the case in
other technological revolutions in the course of human history, the process of creative destruction
that was associated with the emergence of the industrial technology have plausibly fostered the
demand for new skills while rendering existing ones obsolete.
        The research explores the effect of industrialization on human capital formation. In contrast
to conventional wisdom that views early industrialization as a predominantly deskilling process,
the study establishes that the industrial revolution was conducive to human capital formation,
generating broad-based gains in literacy rates and educational attainment. The research therefore
lends further credence to the emerging view that human capital was instrumental in the transition
from stagnation to growth (Galor and Weil, 2000; Galor and Moav, 2002; Galor, 2011).2
        The study utilizes French regional data from the first half of the 19th century to explore the
impact of the adoption of industrial technology on human capital formation. It establishes that
regions that were characterized by more intensive industrialization experienced a larger human
capital formation. However, this observed relationship between industrialization and human capital
formation may reflect the impact of the process of industrialization on human capital formation as
well as the effect of human capital on the advancement and the adoption of industrial technology.3
Furthermore, the potential impact of institutional, geographical, and cultural characteristics on
the joint evolution of industrialization and human capital accumulation may govern the association
between these two forces. Hence, given the potential endogeneity of industrialization and human
    1
      This view regards literacy as largely a cultural skill or a hierarchical symbol with a limited role in the production
process in the first stage of industrialization (Mitch, 1992), and is central to the findings of Allen (2003).
    2
      The human capital channel is further underlined by Lagerlöf (2003, 2006), Doepke (2004) and Galor and Mount-
ford (2008).
    3
      Indeed, human capital appears to have had an effect on development in the pre-industrial era. Boucekkine
et al. (2007) demonstrate the importance of literacy in urbanization and the transition from stagnation to growth.
Squicciarini and Voigtländer (2015) suggest that the upper tail of the human capital distribution in the second half
of the 18th century had a positive effect on urbanization and wages in some industrial sectors in the subsequent
decades. Furthermore, de la Croix et al. (2016) show the importance of apprenticeship institutions in the emergence
of industrialization.

capital formation, this research exploits exogenous regional variations in the adoption of the steam
engine across France to establish the causal effect of industrialization on human capital.
       In light of the intensification in the use of the steam engine in the early phase of industri-
alization (Mokyr, 1990; Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995; Rosenberg and Trajtenberg, 2004), the
study exploits historical evidence regarding the regional diffusion of the steam engine across France
(Ballot, 1923; Sée, 1925; Léon, 1976) to identify the impact of the intensive use of the steam engine
in the production process on human capital formation. In particular, the analysis exploits the
distances between the administrative center of each French department (the administrative divi-
sion of the French territory created in 1790) and Fresnes-sur-Escaut, where a steam engine was
first successfully used for industrial purpose in 1732, as an exogenous source of variations in the
potential exposure to the steam engine and its ultimate use in each department.4 Moreover, in view
of the hypothesis that industrialization was more pronounced in departments which experienced a
decline in the profitability of agricultural production, variations in the deviation in wheat prices
from their historical trends are exploited to identify market conditions which would be conducive
for the adoption of steam engines in each department, conditional on the distance from the local
geographical origin of the steam engine – Fresnes-sur-Escaut.
       The results establish that the intensity in the use of steam engines in industrial production in
the 1839- 1847 period had a positive and significant impact on the formation of human capital in
the early stages of the industrial revolution in the French departments. In particular, the analysis
suggests that a greater number of steam engines in a given department in the 1839-1847 period
had a positive and significant effect on: (i) the number of teachers in 1840 and 1863, (ii) the share
of children in primary schools in 1840 and 1863, (iii) the share of apprentices in the population in
1863, (iv) the share of literate conscripts over the 1847-1856 and 1859-1868 periods, and (v) public
spending on primary schooling over the 1855-1863 period.
       The empirical analysis is robust to the inclusion of a wide array of exogenous confounding
geographical, institutional and pre-industrial characteristics swhich may have contributed to the
relationship between industrialization and human capital formation. First, the study accounts
for the potentially confounding impact of exogenous geographical characteristics of each French

     An Englishman named John May obtained in 1726 a privilege to operate steam engines that would pump water
in the French kingdom, with John Meeres, another Englishman. They set up the first steam engine in Passy (which
was then outside but is now within the administrative boundaries of Paris) to raise water from the Seine river to
supply the French capital with water. However it appears that this commercial and industrial operation stopped
quickly or even never took off. Indeed, when Forest de Bélidor (1737) published his treatise on engineering in 1737-
1739, he mentioned that the steam engine in Fresnes-sur-Escaut was the only one operated in France (see, e.g., Lord
(1923) and Dickinson (1939)). Moreover, as established below, the diffusion of the steam engines across the French
departments is orthogonal to the distances between each department and Paris, the capital and economic center of
the country. If anything, this pattern is very similar to what happened in England: Nuvolari et al. (2011) indicate
that the first industrial use of the steam engine was in the Wheal Vor tin mine in Cornwall in 1710, but stopped
quickly, and that the first successful commercial use of a steam engine took place in 1712 in England, in a coal mine
near Wolverhampton (see also Mokyr (1990, p.85)).

department on the relationship between industrialization and investments in education. It captures
the potential effect of these geographical factors on the profitability of the adoption of the steam
engine and the pace of its regional diffusion, as well as on productivity and human capital formation,
as a by-product of the rise in income rather than as an outcome of technology-skill complementarity.
Second, the analysis captures the potentially confounding effects of the location of departments (i.e.,
latitude, average temperature, average rainfall, border departments, maritime departments, share
of carboniferous area in the department, and the distance to Paris) on the diffusion of the steam
engine as well as the diffusion of development (as captured by the levels income and education).
Third, the study accounts for the differential level of development across France in the pre-industrial
era that may have had a joint impact on the process of industrialization and the formation of human
capital. In particular, it takes into account the potentially confounding effect of the persistence of
pre-industrial development and the persistence of pre-industrial literacy rates. Finally, the results
are robust to the inclusion of additional potentially confounding factors, such as the presence of
raw material, measures of early economic integration, past population density and past fertility
rates.
      The remainder of this article is as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of schooling and
literacy in the process of industrialization in France. Section 3 presents our data. Section 4 discusses
our empirical strategy. Section 5 presents our main results and Section 6 our robustness checks.
Section 7 provides concluding remarks.


2     Schooling and Literacy in the Process of Industrialization in
      France

France was one of the first countries to industrialize in Europe in the 18th century and its indus-
trialization continued during the 19th century. However, by 1914, its living standards remained
below those of England and it had been overtaken by Germany as the leading industrial country
in continental Europe. The slower path of industrialization in France has been attributed to the
consequences of the French Revolution (e.g., wars, legal reforms and land redistribution), the pat-
terns of domestic and foreign investment, cultural preferences for public services, as well as the
comparative advantage of France in agriculture vis-a-vis England and Germany (see the discussion
in, e.g., Lévy-Leboyer and Bourguignon, 1990; Crouzet, 2003).


2.1      Schooling in France before and during the Industrial Revolution

Prior to the French Revolution in 1789, the provision of education in the contemporary French
territory was predominantly left to the Catholic Church, reflecting the limited control of the cen-
tral government and the lack of linguistic unity across the country (Weber, 1976). However, the


                                                   3
evolution of state capacity, national identity, and linguistic uniformity over the centuries intensified
the involvement of the state in the provision of education while diminishing the role of the church
during the 19th century.


2.1.1    Education Prior to the French Revolution

Until the rise of Protestantism in the 16th century, the Catholic Church mainly provided education
to the privileged members of society (Rouche, 2003). However, the spread of Protestantism, and
the rise in the emphasis on literacy as a means to understand the Holy Scripture, had altered the
attitude of the Catholic Church with respect to the provision of education. The Catholic educational
system had progressively become intertwined with its mission of salvation. As such, several religious
orders viewed education as their principal mission. The Jesuits had gradually focused their efforts
on the education of children from the aristocratic classes while the Frères des Ecoles Chrétiennes
(Brothers of Christian Schools) led by Jean-Baptiste de la Salle (1651-1719) sought to provide
free education to the masses. Moreover, female religious communities (e.g., Ursulines, Filles de la
Charité) provided schooling for girls
       The nature of the education provided by the Church over this period was not subjected to
interference from the central government. In fact, except for the universities which were controlled
by the State from the late 16th century onwards, the various Catholic orders had built an education
system which was independent from the French kings.5 However, the monopoly of the Church in
the provision of education ended abruptly during the French Revolution in 1789.


2.1.2    Education in the Aftermath of the French Revolution

The transformation of the French society during the Revolution in 1789 affected the provision of
education as well. In particular, article 22 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen
in 1793 explicitly stated that education is a universal right. Nevertheless, the Constitution of the
First French Republic (1792-1799) did not underline the role of state-funded secular education.
The demise of the Catholic Church (e.g., the confiscation of its property and the imprisonment and
execution of priests) during the French Revolution impinged its ability to remain the provider of
education, but secular education was nevertheless slow to emerge (Godechot, 1951; Tackett, 1986).
       The rise of Napoleon Bonaparte to power (1799-1815) and his interest in preventing hostile
relationships with Rome, permitted the Church to regain a prominent position in the provision
of education in France.6 In particular, according to the 17 March 1808 decree on education, the
   5
      Nevertheless, some conflicts over the nature of schooling took place between the Jesuits and the Universities as
well as between various religious Congregations. In particular, the Jesuits were expelled by King Louis XV in 1764
and their school network was overtaken by the Oratorians.
    6
      This state of affairs suited Napoleon Bonaparte because the Concordat (the 1801 treaty which he had signed
with Pope Pius VII and which structured the relationship between the French State and the Church), provided him


                                                          4
Frères des Ecoles Chrétiennes were left in charge of primary schooling and of training teachers
while school curriculum was to be conform to the teachings of the Catholic Church. However this
decree also created a secular body – the Université – that was assigned the management of public
(secular) education. Throughout the 19th century, the Université would try to counter the Church’s
influence in the education system (Mayeur, 2003).
      After Napoleon’s fall in 1815 and the accession to power of King Louis XVIII (1815-1824),
from the senior branch of the Bourbon family, strengthened initially the educational monopoly of
the Church. In particular, the 29 February 1816 law required local priests to certify the morality
of primary school teachers. However, after the 1827 parliamentary election of a more liberal gov-
ernment, primary school teachers were placed under the authority of the Université, against the
wishes of the Church.
      The 1830 Revolution which overthrew King Charles X (1824-1830), Louis XVIII’s brother
and successor, installed King Louis-Philippe I (1830-1848), from the cadet Orléans branch of the
Bourbon family and put in power members of the liberal bourgeoisie who were rather hostile to
the Catholic Church. This led Catholics to lobby for an educational network of their own outside
the control of the State, under the guise of “freedom of education”. Ultimately, François Guizot,
King Louis-Philippe I’s Prime Minister, enacted the 28 June 1833 law which reshaped schooling
in France and enabled the Church to organize its own private education system. In addition,
the Church retained its influence over the curriculum of public schools (e.g., religious instruction
remained mandatory while the Frères des Ecoles Chrétiennes were often employed as teachers in
public schools). The organization of secondary schooling then became the main point of contention
between the Church and its opponents, and it was only after the fall of Louis-Philippe I in 1848 and
the establishment of the Second Republic (1848-1851) that the Church was allowed to organize its
own network of secondary schools while obtaining subsidies from the State and local governments
(15 March 1850 law enacted by Education minister Alfred de Falloux). Moreover towns were not
compelled to fund a public primary school if there was already a private (i.e., Catholic) school
in their jurisdiction, and teachers had to fulfill the religious duties prescribed by the Church (27
August 1851 regulation).
      Interestingly enough, technical education was less of a battleground between the State and
the Church than general primary schooling. This might have been due to the lesser importance
of technical education in a period where training on the job was widespread. Nonetheless the
28 June 1833 law which reshaped schooling in France also established “schools of higher primary
education”that provided the basics of technical education (Marchand, 2005). But it took another 18
years before the 22 February 1851 law formally established schools for apprentices. Still, a decade
later, few students attended these technical schools and most of those who did were enrolled in
public schools, not in religious schools (Ministère De l’Instruction Publique, 1865). Conversely, in
control over the appointment of bishops.


                                                 5
the 1850s and early 1860s, enrollment in Catholic primary schools, especially for girls, was growing
at the expense of enrollment in public primary schools. This led Victory Duruy, the education
minister of Napoleon III (1851-1870) after 1863, to counter the decline in public schooling, thereby
initiating a conflict between Catholics and secular politicians which would reach its climax after
the establishment of the Third Republic.


2.1.3     Education From the Establishment of the Third Republic to World War I

Following the demise of the Napoleon III’s Empire in 1870 and the establishment of Third Repub-
lic (1875-1940), France became divided between Republicans and Monarchists. The latter received
most of their support from the Catholics who associated the Republicans with the 1789 French
Revolution and the anti-religious policies of the revolutionaries. This political stance was shared
by the clergy and the laity, as well as by liberal and intransigent Catholics alike. But the Catholic
opposition to the Republic was matched by the Republicans’ hostility to the Church and their de-
termination to turn France into a more secular society (Franck, 2016).7 In particular, in an attempt
to crowd out Catholic schooling, the Republicans increased spending on primary schooling by the
central state in the 1880-1890 period. Moreover, in 1881 and 1882, the Republicans passed laws
promoting free, secular and mandatory education until age 13.8 However enrollment in Catholic
schools, especially in primary schools for girls, remained high (Mayeur, 1979).
       At the turn of the 20th century, the Republicans realized that their attempt to crowd out the
schooling system of the Church had failed and used their legal power to renew their attacks (Franck
and Johnson, 2016). They passed the 1 July 1901 law which, de facto, prevented monks and nuns
from teaching, thereby forcing many Catholic schools to close. Four years later, the Republicans
separated Church and State (Franck, 2010): the French state protected freedom of conscience but
stopped recognizing official religions and ended subsidies to religious groups. In theory, Catholic
schools had become private institutions outside the scope of the French government’s reach. In
practice, however, the Republicans wanted to control the curricula of Catholic schools. This would
be the main point of contention between Republicans and Catholics until World War I. Thus the
bishops’ opposition in 1909 to the imposition by the State of governmental manuals led Republicans
to rally around the “defense of secular education”. They passed additional laws pertaining to public
schooling attendance and enabled prosecutions against priests who instructed parents not to enroll
their children in state-funded secular schools. After World War I, political debates dealing with
   7
     For instance, the 27 July 1882 law re-legalized divorce.
   8
     Before the 20 June 1881 law, all parents but the poorest ones who wanted to enroll their children in school
had to pay fees called rétribution scolaire which had been established by the 3 Brumaire An IV (25 October 1795)
law. The 20 June 1881 law reestablished free education, which had been first instituted by decrees of the Convention
during the French Revolution but had been reversed by the 3 Brumaire An IV law. It should be noted that by the
1870s, the rétribution scolaire only remained significant in rural areas and had been replaced by local taxes in urban
areas.



                                                          6
private religious schooling and public secular schooling have periodically resurfaced in France.
However they did not stir passions as much as in the 1870-1914 period.

                                 Figure 1: Pre-industrial literacy rates of French departments


          The evolution of literacy and its distribution across French department is rather notable in the
course of industrialization. In 1686-1690, prior to the onset of the industrial revolution in France,
25.9% of grooms could sign their names, reflecting substantial variations in literacy across France
as depicted in Panel A of Figure 1.9 In particular, literacy rates were higher in the regions in the
North and East of France.10
          Literacy rates had steadily increased in the subsequent century and 42% of grooms could sign
their names in 1786-1790 and 50.61% in 1816-1820, in spite of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic
wars. As depicted in Panels B and C of Figure 1 regional variations across France remained and
the domination of the Northern and the Eastern regions persisted. However, literacy rates in some
departments had evolved faster than in others, notably in the South (e.g., Aveyron) and the South
East along the Mediterranean Sea (Bouches du Rhône, Var). Moreover, the potential association
between industrialization and literacy is rather apparent. In particular, Aveyron, Bouches du
Rhône and Var were among the most industrialized departments in the South of France.
          The increase in literacy rates continued throughout the 19th century so that the share of
French conscripts (i.e., 20-year old men reporting for military service in the department where

      Data on literacy in France before the mid-19th century is scarce and incomplete. There is however data on the
number of Frenchmen who could sign their marriage license in 1686-1690, 1786-1790 and 1816-1820 (Furet and Ozouf,
1977).
   10
      For a discussion of the cultural, religious and economic factors which potentially explained the regional differences
in the share of literate grooms, see notably Furet and Ozouf (1977), Grew and Harrigan (1991) and Diebolt et al.

their father lived) who could read and write grew from 54.27% in 1838 to 84.83% in 1881. Thus, a
significant fraction of Frenchmen were literate even before the adoption of the 1881-1882 laws on
mandatory and free public schooling (Diebolt et al., 2005).


3        Data and Main Variables

This section examines the evolution of industrialization and human capital formation across the
85 mainland French departments, based on the administrative division of France in the 1839-1847
period, accounting for the geographical and the institutional characteristics of these regions. The
initial partition of the French territory in 1790 was designed to ensure that the travel distance
by horse from any location within the department to the main administrative center would not
exceed one day. The initial territory of each department was therefore orthogonal to the pre-
industrial wealth levels and literacy rates while the subsequent minor changes in the borders of
some departments reflected political forces rather than the effect of industrialization, the adoption
of the steam engine and human capital formation. Table A.1 reports the descriptive statistics for
the variables in the empirical analysis across these departments.


3.1       Measures of Human Capital

The study explores the effect of industrialization on the evolution of human capital in the early
stages of the industrial revolution. It takes advantage of the industrial survey conducted between
1839 and 1847 to assess the short-run impact of industrialization across France on several indicators
of human capital accumulation.


3.1.1      Teachers, Pupils and Apprentices

The impact of early industrialization on human capital during the early phase of the industrial
revolution is assessed by the effect of the differential level of industrialization across France on the
number of teachers, pupils and apprentices in each department.11
         First, the research examines the effect of industrialization on the number of teachers in each
department. Surveys undertaken in 1840 and 1863 by the French bureau of statistics (Statistique
Générale de la France) indicate that the average number of teachers per department rose from 742
in 1840 to 1243 in 1863. The surveys also show that there was considerable variation in the number
of teachers across departments.
    11
     The effect of industrialization on the pupils-to-teacher ratio is not necessarily indicative of the effect on human
capital formation. In the face of resource constraints, changes in this ratio may reflect the local decision-makers’ view
about the trade-off between the quality and the quantity of education.

        Second, the study explores the impact of industrialization on the number of pupils enrolled in
the primary schools of each department (per 10,000 inhabitants). Surveys carried out in 1840 and
1863 by the French bureau of statistics (Statistique Générale de la France) show that the average
number of pupils in each department (per 10,000 inhabitants) grew from 874 in 1840 to 1179 in
1863, with substantial variation in the number of pupils across France.
        Third, the research analyzes the effect of industrialization on technical education as captured
by the number of males enrolled in apprentice schools (per 10,000 inhabitants). The data (Ministère
De l’Instruction Publique, 1865) show that in 1863, the average number of apprentices in each
department (per 10,000 inhabitants) was equal to 2.71 and was therefore an order of magnitude
smaller than the number of pupils in primary schools.


3.1.2     Literacy

The impact of early industrialization on literacy during the first phase of the industrial revolution
is captured by its effect on the share of French army conscripts (i.e., 20-year-old men who reported
for military service in the department where their father lived) who could read and write. The
analysis focuses on the share of literate conscripts over the 1859-1868 decade, i.e., individuals who
were born between 1839 (when the industrial survey began) and 1848 (a year after the survey was
completed).12 As reported in Table A.1, 74.0% of the French conscripts were literate over the
1859-1868 period.


3.2      Steam Engines

The research explores the effect of the introduction of industrial technology on human capital. In
light of the pivotal role played by the steam engine during the first industrial revolution, it exploits
variations in the industrial use of the steam engine across France. Specifically, the analysis focuses
on the number of steam engines used in each French department as reported in the industrial survey
carried out by the French bureau of statistics (Statistique Générale de la France) between 1839 and
1847 (Chanut et al., 2000).13
        As shown in Figure 2, and analyzed further in the discussion of the identification strategy in
Section 4, the distribution of the steam engines across French departments in 1839-1847 suggests
a regional pattern of diffusion from Fresnes-sur-Escaut (in the Nord department, at the northern
   12
       As a robustness check, we explore in the Appendix the impact of industrialization on the literacy rate of French
conscripts over the 1847-1856 decade: these 20-year old men were born between 1827 and 1836.
    13
       As discussed by Chanut et al. (2000), the survey started in 1839 and was nearly completed in 1841 when it was
halted under popular pressure, amid growing fears that the survey data would be used to support the governmental
fiscal reforms. It was only in 1844 that the central government restarted the survey which was eventually completed
in 1847. It is however unclear whether local administrators began data collection anew in 1844 or simply sent to the
central administration in Paris the data collected between 1839 and 1841 with minor or no updates.

tip of continental France) where the first steam engine in France was successfully used for indus-
trial purposes in 1732. The largest number of steam engines was indeed in the northern part of
France. There were fewer in the east and in the south-east, and even less so in the south-west.
Seven departments had no steam engine in 1839-1847 (i.e., Cantal, Côtes-du-Nord, Creuse, Hautes-
Alpes, Haute-Loire, Lot and Pyrénées-Orientales). The potential anomalies which are associated
with these departments, and in particular regarding the distance of these departments from the
threshold level of development which enables the adoption of steam engines, are accounted for by
the introduction of a dummy variable that singles them out.
     In Table A.2, we report descriptive statistics for the number of steam engines in each of
the 16 sectors listed in the 1839-1847 survey: ceramics, chemistry, clothing, construction, food,
furniture, leather, lighting, luxury goods, metal objects, metallurgy, mines, sciences & arts, textile,
transportation and wood. The data show that the five sectors with the largest average horse power
from steam engines per department are textile, food, mines, metallurgy and metal objects. In this
respect, we note that the textile sector had the largest number of steam engines of all the sectors:
there were twice as many steam engines in textile than in the food industry and three times more
than in the mining sector. Moreover the descriptive statistics on the number of workers in each
of the 16 sectors reported in Table A.2 indicate that the chemistry and wood sectors had a larger
ratio of steam engines per worker, most likely because the textile sector employed many individuals
whose work did not require steam engines.

3.3       Confounding Characteristics of the Departments

The empirical analysis accounts for observable exogenous confounding geographical and institu-
tional characteristics of each department, as well as for their pre-industrial development, which
may have contributed to the relationship between industrialization and human capital formation.
Geography may have impacted agricultural productivity as well as the pace of industrialization,
and thus income per capita and investments in education. Institutions may have affected jointly
the process of industrialization and the increase in literacy. Besides, geographical and institutional
factors may have affected human capital indirectly by governing the speed of the diffusion of steam
engines across departments. Finally, pre-industrial development may have affected the onset of
industrialization and may have had an independent persistent effect on human capital formation.

geographic characteristics of each French department (Figure 4) on the relationship between indus-

trialization and human capital. Specifically, it captures the potential effect of these geographical
factors on the profitability of the adoption of the steam engine, on the pace of its regional diffusion
and thus, on human capital accumulation during the first stages of the industrial revolution.
     First, the study accounts for climatic and soil characteristics of each department (i.e., land
suitability, average temperature, average rainfall, and latitude (Ramankutty et al., 2002)) that
could have affected natural land productivity and therefore, the feasibility and profitability of the
transition to the industrial stage of development, as well as income per capita and human capital in
each department. Besides, the diffusion of the steam engine across France could have been affected
by the presence of raw material required for industrialization. Our regressions thus account for the
share of carboniferous area in each department (Fernihough and O’Rourke, 2014).
     Second, the analysis captures the confounding effect of the location of each department on
the diffusion of development from nearby regions or countries, as well as its effect on the regional
diffusion of the steam engine. Namely, it accounts for the effect of the latitude of each department,
and maritime departments (i.e., positioned along the sea shore of France) on the pace of this
diffusion process.
     Finally, the research accounts for the potential differential effects of international trade on the
process of development as well as on the adoption the steam engine. In particular, it captures the
potential effect of maritime departments (i.e., those departments that are positioned along the sea
shore of France), via trade, on the diffusion of the steam engine and thus on economic development
as well as its direct effect on human capital formation over this time period.




                                                                            12
3.3.2        Institutional Characteristics

Since the empirical analysis focuses on the impact of variations in the adoption of the steam engine
on human capital formation across French departments, it ensures that institutional factors which
were unique to France as a whole over this time period are not the source of the differential pattern
of human capital across these regions. Nevertheless, one region of France over this time period
had a unique exposure to institutional characteristics that may have contributed to the observed
relationship between industrialization and literacy.
     The emergence of state centralization in France and the concentration of political power in
Paris before the industrial revolution may have had a differential impact on the political culture
and economic prosperity in Paris and its suburbs (i.e., Seine, Seine-et-Marne and Seine-et-Oise).
Hence, the analysis includes a dummy variable for these three departments to control for their
potential confounding effects on the observed relationship between industrialization and human
capital. Moreover, the analysis accounts for the effect of the aerial distance between the adminis-
trative center of each department and Paris, thus capturing the potential decline in the reach of the
central government in regions at a greater distance from Paris as well as the diminished potential
diffusion of development into these regions.

     The empirical analysis accounts for the potentially confounding effects of the level of devel-
opment in the pre-industrial period. The differential level of development across France in the
pre-industrial era may have indeed affected jointly the process of development and human capi-
tal formation. Namely, it may have affected the adoption of the steam engine and it may have

generated, independently, a persistent investment on education. First, the early level of develop-
ment, as captured by the degree of urbanization (i.e., population of urban centers with more than
10,000 inhabitants) in each French department in 1700 as shown in Panel A of Figure 5 (Lepetit,
1994), may have persisted independently of the process of industrialization.14 Second, the number
of universities in 1700 in each department as shown in Panel B of Figure 5 (Bosker et al., 2013)
may have affected the adoption of the steam engine while contributing to human capital formation
independently of the process of industrialization. Third, early literacy rates, as captured by the
share of grooms who could sign their marriage license over the 1686-1690, 1786-1790 and 1816-1820
periods as mapped in Figure 1 (Furet and Ozouf, 1977),15 may have affected the adoption of the
steam engine while contributing to human capital accumulation independently of the process of
industrialization.


4        Empirical Methodology

4.1       Empirical strategy

The relationship between industrialization and human capital formation may reflect the impact of
the process of industrialization on human capital formation as well as the effect of human capital
on the advancement and the adoption of industrial technology. Furthermore, the potential impact
of institutional, geographical, and cultural characteristics on the joint evolution of industrialization
and human capital accumulation may govern the association between these two forces. Hence, in
light of the potential endogeneity of industrialization and human capital formation, this research
exploits exogenous regional variations in the adoption of the steam engine across France to establish
the causal effect of industrialization on human capital.
         The identification strategy has two components. The first component is motivated by the
historical account of the gradual regional diffusion of the steam engine in France during the 18th and
19th centuries (Ballot, 1923; Sée, 1925; Léon, 1976).16 Considering the positive association between
industrialization and the use of the steam engine (Mokyr, 1990; Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995;
Rosenberg and Trajtenberg, 2004), the study takes advantage of the regional diffusion of the steam
engine to identify the effect of local variations in the intensity of the use of the steam engine
during the 1839-1847 period on the process of development. In particular, it exploits the distances
between each French department and Fresnes-sur-Escaut (in the Nord department), where the first
    14
      As we discuss below in Section 6, the qualitative analysis remains intact if the potential effect of past population
density is accounted for.
   15
      Some observations are missing for these variables. For the 1686-1690 period, there are no observations for
Aveyron, Bas-Rhin, Dordogne, Indre-et-Loire, Lot, Lozère, Haut-Rhin, Lot, Seine and Vendée. For the 1786-1790
period, observations are missing for for Bas-Rhin, Dordogne, Haut-Rhin, Lot, Seine and Vendée. For the 1816-1820
period, observations are missing for Bas-Rhin, Dordogne, Haut-Rhin, Lot, Morbihan, Seine and Vendée.
   16
      There was also a regional pattern in the diffusion of steam engines in England (Kanefsky and Robey, 1980;
Nuvolari et al., 2011).

successful commercial application of the steam engine in France was made in 1732, as an instrument
for the use of the steam engines in 1839-1847.17
        Consistent with the diffusion hypothesis, the second steam engine in France that was suc-
cessfully utilized for commercial purposes was operated in 1737 in the mines of Anzin, also in the
Nord department, less than 10 km away from Fresnes-sur-Escaut. Furthermore, in the subsequent
decades until the 1789 French Revolution the commercial use of the steam engine expanded pre-
dominantly to the nearby northern and north-western regions. Nevertheless, at the onset of the
French revolution in 1789, steam engines were less widespread in France than in England. A few
additional steam engines were introduced until the fall of the Napoleonic Empire in 1815, notably
in Saint-Quentin in 1803 and in Mulhouse in 1812, but it is only after 1815 that the diffusion of
steam engines in France accelerated (Sée, 1925; Léon, 1976).
        Indeed, in line with the historical account, the distribution of steam engines across French
departments, as reported in the 1839-1847 industrial survey, is indicative of a local diffusion process
from Fresnes-sur-Escaut. As reported in Column (1) of Table 1 and as depicted in Panel A of
Figure 6, there is a highly significant negative unconditional association between the number of

      This steam engine was used to pump water in an ordinary mine of Fresnes-sur-Escaut. It is unclear whether
Pierre Mathieu, the owner of the mine, built the engine himself after a trip in England or employed an Englishman
for this purpose (Ballot, 1923, p.385).

steam engines in each department and the distance of the administrative center of this department
from Fresnes-sur-Escaut. Nevertheless, this association may be partly governed by the confounding
effects of geographic, institutional and demographic characteristics on the pace of technological
diffusion, as well as on the process of development. Thus, in order to mitigate these potential effect
of unobserved heterogeneity, the analysis accounts for a wide range of these characteristics (altitude,
latitude, rainfall, land suitability, maritime and border departments, Paris and its suburbs, the
distance to Paris). Reassuringly, the unconditional negative relationship between the number of
steam engines and the distance to Fresnes-sur-Escaut remains highly significant and is larger in
absolute value when the analysis accounts for exogenous confounding geographical controls such
as land suitability, latitude, rainfall and temperature (Column (2)), as well as institutional factors
and pre-industrial development (Column (3)).

                        Figure 6: The effect of the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut on the number of steam engines in 1839-1847
Note: These figures depict the partial regression line for the effect of the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut on the number of
steam engines in each French department in 1839-1847. Panel A presents the unconditional relationship while Panel B reports
the relationship which controls for geographic and institutional characteristics. Thus, the x- and y-axes in Panels A and B plot
the residuals obtained from regressing the number of steam engines and the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut, respectively with
and without the aforementioned set of covariates.


                                 Importantly, the diffusion pattern of steam engines to each department is uncorrelated with
the distance between Paris in Column (4) of Table 1. Moreover, as reported in Column (5) of
Table 1 and depicted in Panel B of Figure 6 the highly significant negative association between the
intensity of the use of steam engines in each department and its distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut
is unaffected when a distance to Paris is accounted for. Moreover, the findings suggest that the

        The plausibility of the use of aerial distance from a department to Fresnes-sur-Escaut as
an instrumental variable for its number of steam engines is further enhanced by few additional
empirical findings. As established in Table 2, the number of steam engines in the 1839-1847 period
in each department is uncorrelated with aerial distances from this department and major economic
centers. Specifically, conditional on the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut, distances between each
department and Marseille and Lyon (the second and third largest cities in France), Rouen (a major
harbor in the north-west where the steam engine was introduced in 1796), Mulhouse (a major city
in the east where the steam engine was introduced in 1812), and Bordeaux (a major harbor in the
south-west) are uncorrelated with steam engines in 1839-1847, lending credence to the unique role
of the introduction of the first steam engine in Fresnes-sur-Escaut in the diffusion of the steam
engine across France. Moreover, as reported in Table B.1 in the Appendix, the qualitative results
are unaffected by the use of surface distances, as captured by the time needed for a surface travel
between any pair of locations Özak (2013).
        Moreover, in contrast to it pivotal role of spillovers from Fresnes-sur-Escaut in the indus-
trial era, this geographical has no importance in the pre-industrial era. In particular, economic
development across France in the pre-industrial period is uncorrelated with distances from Fresnes-
sur-Escaut. Unlike the highly significant negative relationship between the number of steam engines
in 1839-1847 and the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut, as established in Table 3, distance from
Fresnes-sur-Escaut was uncorrelated with urban development and human capital formation in the
pre-industrial era. Specifically, distances from Fresnes-sur-Escaut are uncorrelated with: (i) urban-
ization rates in 1700 (Column (1)), (ii) literacy rates in the pre-industrial period, as proxied by the

        The second component of the identification strategy is motivated by the hypothesis that, while
the potential exposure to the steam engine would depend on the distance from Fresnessur-Escaut,
the intensity of the adoption of this industrial technology would depend on the profitability of the
industrial sector relative to the agricultural sector. Thus the analysis exploits cross-departmental
variations in the deviation in wheat prices from their historical trends shortly before the 1839-1847
survey to identify market conditions which would be conducive for a production transition from
agriculture to industry and therefore for the adoption of the steam engine. In particular, exploiting
transitory deviations in wheat prices from their historical trend, permits the analysis to capture the
substitution in production (associated with a temporary rise in the relative prices of manufacturing
goods), rather than the a-priori ambiguous long-term effect of agricultural productivity on the
development of the industrial sector.18
        In light of the 1839-1847 survey about the use of the steam engine in each department, the
analysis focuses on the deviation in average wheat prices during the five-year period that preceded
the start of the survey, P̃i,1834–1838 , from their historical trend, as captured by the average prices
   18
     It should be noted that deviations from wheat prices in a given department did not only reflect weather conditions
in that department, but also weather conditions in nearby departments which would influence wheat prices because
of the process of increased market integration that occurred in 19th century France (Chevet and Saint-Amour, 1991;
Toutain, 1992; Ejrnæaes and Persson, 2000). In fact, in additional regressions available upon request, we find that
historical local weather conditions in each department, as reconstructed by Luterbacher et al. (2004, 2006) and
Pauling et al. (2006), are not correlated with the adoption of steam engines in 19th century France.

        Indeed, in line with the proposed hypothesis, the distribution of steam engines across French
departments, as reported in the 1839-1847 industrial survey, is negatively associated with positive
transitory cross-departmental deviations in wheat prices from their historical trend. As reported
in Column (1) of Table 4, unconditionally, there exists a highly significant negative association
between the use in the steam engine in 1839-1847 across French departments and the deviation
in wheat prices over the period 1834-1838 from the historical trend. Moreover, further enhancing
the credibility of this instrumental variable, falsification tests reported in Columns (2)-(5) suggest
that earlier price deviations (i.e., during the five-year time periods, 1824-1828 and 1829-1833), and
more importantly price deviations after the conclusion of the survey (i.e., during the five-year time
periods, 1848-1852 and 1853-1857), are not significantly associated with the adoption of steam

       The computation is based on the data collected by Labrousse et al. (1970).

engines in 1839-1847.20
        Accounting for the confounding effects of geographical, institutional and pre-industrial char-
acteristics, Table 5 reports the first-stage relationship between the number of steam engines and
the proposed instrumental variables: (i) the Distance from Fresnes and (ii) Wheat Price Deviation
over the 1834-1838 period from the historical trends in 1819-1833 (Column (1)), 1809-1833 (Col-
umn (2)), 1814-1833 (Column (3)) and 1824-1833 (Column (4)). In all specifications, the number of
steam engines in the 1839-1847 is negative and significant associated with (i) the distance to Fresnes
and (ii) a positive deviation in wheat price in the 1834-1838 period.21 Furthermore, instruments
clear the over-identification J-test in all specifications. The analysis suggests that considering the
strength of the instrumental variables, the desirable reference period for wheat price deviation over
the period 1834-1838 is 1819-1833, where the F-statistic is 16.7.
        In particular, as derived from Column (1) of Table 5, a 100-km increase in the distance from
Fresnes-sur-Escaut is associated with a 0.702 point decline in the log of the number of steam engines
in a given department, relative to a sample mean of 1.47. Hence, in comparison to a department at
the 25th percentile of the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut (i.e., 327 km), a departments located
at the 75th percentile (i.e., 659 km from Fresnes-sur-Escaut) will be expected to have 10.3 fewer
steam engines (relative to a sample mean of 29.2 and a standard deviation of 66.1). Furthermore, a
one-unit increase in the wheat price deviation is associated with a 1.31-point decrease in the log of
the number of steam engines in a department. As such, in comparison to a department at the 25th
   20
      Additional regressions indicate that the number of steam engines in the 1839-1847 period is uncorrelated with
deviations in yearly wheat prices during this survey, suggesting that the adoption of steam engines occurred with
some delay, or that, as discussed above in Section 3, a substantial part of the 1839-1847 survey was carried out in
the 1839-1841 period.
   21
      The interaction variable between Distance from Fresnes and the Wheat Price Deviation over the 1834-1838
period is insignificant.

percentile of the wheat price deviation over the 1834-1838 period (i.e., -0.72) a departments located
at the 75th percentile (i.e., -0.14), will be expected to have 2.1 engines fewer steam engines. Thus,
in line with historical evidence, these estimates suggest while the diffusion of the steam engine as
well the transition from agriculture to industry contributed to the adoption of steams engines, the
effect of gradual diffusion of steam engines from the North of France to the rest of the country
dominated the effect of the slower transition of French regions from agriculture to industry in the
19th century.
        Moreover, the highly significant negative association between the number of steam engines
in each department and the wheat price deviation over the 1834-1838 period as well as with the
distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut to the administrative center of each department is robust to the
inclusion of an additional set of confounding geographical, demographic and institutional charac-
teristics, as well as to the forces of pre-industrial development, which as discussed in section 6,
may have contributed to the relationship between industrialization and economic development. As
established in Table B.2 in the Appendix, these confounding factors, which could be largely viewed

                                                                           21
as endogenous to the adoption of the steam engine and are thus not considered as part of the
baseline analysis, do not affect the qualitative results.


4.2       Empirical Model

The effect of industrialization on the process of development is estimated using 2SLS. The second
stage provides a cross-section estimate of the relationship between the number of steam engines in
each department in 1839-1847 to measures of human capital formation at different points in time;

                                          Yit = α + βEi + Xi0 ω + εit ,                                         (2)

where Yit represents a measure of human capital in department i in year t, E i is the log of the
number of steam engines in department i in 1839-1847, Xi0 is a vector of geographical, institutional
and pre-industrial economic characteristics of department i and it is an i.i.d. error term for
department i in year t.
         In the first stage, E i , the log of the number of steam engines in department i in 1839-1847
is instrumented by the aerial distance (in kilometers) between Fresnes-sur-Escaut and the admin-
istrative center of department i, D i , as well as by the wheat price deviation over the 1834-1838
period in department i, P̃i,1834−1838 ;

                                  Ei = δ1 Di + δ2 P̃i,1834−1838 + Xi0 δ3 + ηi ,                                 (3)

where Xi0 is the same vector of geographical, institutional and pre-industrial economic characteris-
tics of department i used in the second stage, and ηi is an error term for department i.22


5        Industrialization and Human Capital Formation

The study examines the effect of the number of steam engines in the 1839-1847 period on human
capital formation in the short-run. As established in Tables 6 - 11, and in line with the pro-
posed hypothesis, the early phase of the industrialization process was conducive to human capital
accumulation.


5.1       The Effect of Industrialization on the Number of Teachers

The relationship between industrialization and the number of teachers in 1840 and 1863 is presented
in Tables 6 and 7. As shown in Column (1), unconditionally, the number of steam engines in
    22
     The aerial distance is a natural proxy for the regional diffusion of the steam engine. In fact, the robustness
checks in Section 6 show that accounting for the progressive development of the railroad network in the 19th century
does not change the qualitative results.

industrial production in 1839-1847 had a positive and significant association at the 1% level with
the number of teachers in 1840 and 1863. This relationship remains positive, mostly smaller in
magnitude but with the same level of statistical significance, once one progressively accounts for the
confounding effects of exogenous geographical factors (Column (2)), institutional factors (Column
(3)) and pre-industrial characteristics (Columns (4)-(7)). Finally, mitigating the effect of omitted
variables on the observed relationship, the IV estimations in Columns (8)-(12) suggest that the
number of steam engines in 1839-1847 had a positive and highly significant impact on the number
of teachers in 1840 and 1863, accounting for the confounding effects of geographical, institutional,
and demographic characteristics.23
        The regressions in Tables 6 and 7 also account for a large number of confounding geographical
    23
       In the absence of pre-industrial controls, the F-statistic of the first stage is equal to 16.7. Furthermore, in each
specification, the IV estimates of the effect of the log number of steam engines are larger than the OLS coefficients,
reflecting possibly measurement errors the number of steam engines. Moreover, the positive and significant effect of
industrialization on the number of teachers in 1840 and 1863 in the IV regressions is consistent with the outcome
of reduced form regressions reported in Columns (1)-(2) of Table B.3 in the Appendix, where Distance to Fresnes
and the Deviation from Wheat Prices in 1834-1838 are negatively and significantly associated with the number of
teachers.

and institutional factors, which are discussed above in Section 2.3. First, the climatic and soil
characteristics of each department (i.e., land suitability, average temperature, average rainfall, and
latitude) could have affected natural land productivity and therefore the feasibility and profitability
of the transition to the industrial stage of development, as well as the evolution of income per capita
and its potential direct on human capital formation in each department. Second, the location
of departments (i.e., latitude, border departments, maritime departments and departments at a
greater distance from the concentration of political power in Paris) could have jointly affected the
diffusion of the steam engine and human capital formation. However, The IV estimates are rather
stable and are largely unaffected by the inclusion of controls for these variables.
        Third, the regressions in Tables 6 and 7 take into account the potentially confounding effects
of the level of human capital and economic development in the pre-industrial period, as captured
by the share of grooms who could sign their marriage license over the 1786-1790 period, the degree
of urbanization in each department in 1700 and the number of universities in 1700.24 The findings
   24
    As established in Table B.5, the qualitative results are unaffected if the share of grooms in the 1686-1690 or
1816-1820 period is used instead.



                                                                                        24
suggest that pre-industrial human capital and development (and the characteristics that may have
fostered them) had no significant impact on the number of teachers in 1840 and 1863.
        Fourth, the IV estimates in Column (8) of Tables 6 and 7 suggest that the presence of steam
engines had large quantitative effects on the number of teachers in primary schools: a one-percent
increase in the number of steam engines in a department in 1839-1847 increased the number of
teachers in the primary schools by 32.0% in 1840 and 28.2% in 1863. Hence the 675 percent
increase in the number of steam engines in 1839-1847 due to a movement from the 25th percentile
(i.e., 4 engines) to the 75th percentile (i.e., 31 engines) would have led to an increase in the number
of teachers of 216 in 1840 and 190.35 in 1863 (relative to a sample mean of 742 in 1840 and 1243
in 1863).
        Finally, the association between the number of steam engines and the number of teachers in
1840 and 1863 is not affected by spatial correlation as established in Tables E.1 and E.2 in the
Appendix, accounting for radii of 50km, 100km, 250km and 500km.


5.2      The Effect of Industrialization on the Share of Pupils in the Population

5.2.1     Pupils in Primary Schools

The effect of industrialization on the number of pupils enrolled in the primary schools of each
department (per 10,000 inhabitants) in 1840 and 1863 is reported in Tables 8 and 9. In both
Tables, the unconditional relationship between the number of steam engines in industrial production
in 1839-1847 and the share of pupils in 1840 and in 1863 is positive and significant (Column
(1)), and remains so when the confounding effects of exogenous geographical factors (Column
(2)), institutional factors (Column (3)) and pre-industrial characteristics (Columns (4)-(6)) are
accounted for.
        The IV estimates in Columns (7)-(10) in Tables 8 and 9 suggest that the number of steam
engines in 1839-1847 had a positive and significant impact on the number of pupils enrolled in
the primary schools of each department (per 10,000 inhabitants) in 1840 and 1863, accounting
for the confounding effects of geographical, institutional and pre-industrial characteristics.25 This
positive effect appears to diminish between 1840 and 1863. In addition, in the IV regressions in
Tables 8 and 9, there is a strongly positive and significant association between early literacy, as
captured by the share of grooms who signed their marriage license in 1786-1790, and the number
   25
      In the absence of pre-industrial controls, the F-statistic of the first stage is equal to 16.7 . Furthermore, in each
specification, the IV estimates of the effect of the log number of steam engines are larger than the OLS coefficients,
reflecting possibly measurement errors the number of steam engines. Moreover, the positive and significant effect of
industrialization on the number of pupils in 1840 and 1863 in the IV regressions is consistent with the outcome of
reduced form regressions reported in Columns (3)-(4) of Table B.3 in the Appendix, where Distance to Fresnes and
the Deviation from Wheat Prices in 1834-1838 are negatively and significantly associated the number of pupils in
1840 and 1863.

of pupils.26 However, the share of carboniferous area in the department, as well as the presence of
a university and the urban population in 1700, are negatively, and in some regressions significantly,
correlated with the enrollment of pupils. The other characteristics of departments, i.e., latitude,
land suitability, border departments, maritime departments as well as the distance to Paris, are
shown to have no effect on the enrollment of pupils in the IV regressions. Overall, the IV estimates
in Column (7) of Tables 8 and 9 suggest that a one-percent increase in the number of steam engines
in a department in 1839-1847 increased the number of pupils enrolled in the primary schools (per
10,000 inhabitants) by 26.8% in 1840 and 11.2% in 1863.As such, a department that would have
experienced an increase in its number of steam engines in the 1839-1847 period from the 25th
percentile (i.e., 4 engines) to the 75th percentile (i.e., 31 engines) of the steam engine distribution
across department, would have 181 more pupils in 1840 and 75.6 more pupils in 1863 (relative to
sample mean of 874 in 1840 and 1179 in 1863, per 10,000 inhabitants).

      As established in Table B.5, the qualitative results are not affected if the share of grooms in the 1686-1690 or
1816-1820 period is used instead.

5.2.2        Pupils in Technical Schools

The effect of industrialization on the number of apprentices in each department (per 10,000 inhabi-
tants) in 1863 is reported in Table 10. The unconditional relationship between the number of steam
engines in industrial production in 1839-1847 and the share of apprentices in 1863 is positive and
significant (Column (1)), and remains so when the confounding effects of exogenous geographical
factors (Column (2)), institutional factors (Column (3)) and pre-industrial characteristics (Columns
(4)-(6)) are accounted for.
        The IV estimates in Columns (7)-(10) in Table 10 suggest that the number of steam engines in
1839-1847 had a positive and significant impact on the number of apprentices in each department
(per 10,000 inhabitants) in 1863, accounting for the confounding effects of geographical, institutional

and pre-industrial characteristics. Overall, the IV estimates in Column (7) of Table 10 suggest that
a one-percent increase in the number of steam engines in a department in 1839-1847 increased the
number of apprentices (per 10,000 inhabitants) by 47.3% in 1863.
        Finally, spatial correlation does not affect the association between the number of steam engines
and the number of apprentices in 1863 as established in Table E.5 in the Appendix when one
accounts for radii of 50km, 100km, 250km and 500km.


5.3      The Effect of Industrialization on Literacy

The relationship between industrialization and literacy, as captured by the share of army conscripts
who could read and write over the 1859-1868 period, is presented in Table 11.27 In Column (1),
unconditionally, the number of steam engines in 1839-1847 had a significant positive association with
the share of literate conscripts. However, in the OLS regressions in Columns (2)-(6), this positive
association is not significant once the confounding effects of exogenous geographical, institutional
and pre-industrial factors are taken into account. Nevertheless, in the IV regressions in Columns
   27
      Regression results using the share of literate conscripts over the 1847-1856 decade are similar to those obtained
over the 1859-1868 period and are reported in Table C.1 in the Appendix.

(7)-(10) which mitigate the effect of omitted variables on the observed relationship and account for
the confounding effects of geographical, institutional and pre-industrial characteristics, the effect
of industrialization on the share of literate conscripts is found to be positive and significant.
        Moreover, the regressions in Table 11 account for the impact of confounding geographical and
institutional factors. In some of the IV regressions in Columns (7)-(10) of Table 11, land suitability
had a significant positive association with the share of literate conscripts while temperature had a
significant negative relationship, but the coefficients are only significant when the share of grooms
who could sign their marriage license in 1786-1790 is excluded from the regressions.28 In addition,
the variables which control for the location of departments (i.e., latitude, border departments,
maritime departments, departments at a greater distance from the concentration of political power
in Paris) and pre-industrial development (the number of universities and urban population in 1700)
appear orthogonal to industrialization and literacy. As could be expected, the dummy variable for
Paris and its suburbs, as well as the share of grooms who could sign their marriage license in 1786-
   28
      As shown in Table B.5, the qualitative results are not affected if the share of grooms in the 1686-1690 or 1816-1820
period is used instead.


                                                                                          29
1790, are significantly and positively associated with the share of literate conscripts in 1859-1868.
All in all, the IV estimate in Column (7) of Table 11 indicates that a one-percent increase in the
number of steam engines in a department in 1839-1847 increased the share of literate conscripts
in 1859-1868 by 11.6% percentage point.29 As such, if a department had increased its number of
steam engines in 1839-1847 from the 25th percentile (i.e., 4 engines) to the 75th percentile (i.e.,
31 engines), this 675 percent increase in the number of steam engines would have led to a 78.3%
increase in the share of literate conscripts in 1859-1868 (relative to sample mean of 73.57 per cent
and a standard deviation of 14.96).
         Finally, as we establish in Table E.6 in the Appendix, the association between the number of
steam engines and the share of literate conscripts is not affected by spatial correlation for radii of
50km, 100km, 250km and 500km.


6        Robustness Analysis

6.1       Confounding Factors

This subsection examines the robustness of the baseline analysis to the inclusion of additional
confounding geographical, demographic, institutional and pre-industrial characteristics, which may
have contributed to the relationship between industrialization and economic development. These
confounding factors could be viewed as endogenous to the adoption of the steam engine and are
thus not part of the baseline analysis.
         In what follows, the analysis focuses on the potential impact of these confounding factors on
the baseline IV regressions in Tables 6 to 11, where the dependent variables are the number of
teachers in 1840 and 1863, the share of pupils in the population in 1840 and 1863, the share of
apprentices in the population in 1863 and the share of literate conscripts over the 1859-1868 period.


6.1.1      Distance from London

Given the early industrial use of the steam engine in England and the intensive economic relation-
ship between France and England, human capital in French departments could have been affected
by their proximity to England. However, as reported in Table B.4 in Appendix B, accounting for the
aerial distance from England has no qualitative impact on the estimated effect of industrialization
    29
      In the absence of pre-industrial controls, the F-statistic of the first stage is equal to 16.7. Furthermore, in each
specification, the IV estimates of the effect of the log number of steam engines are larger than the OLS coefficients,
reflecting possibly measurement errors the number of steam engines. Moreover, the positive and significant effect of
industrialization on the share of literate conscripts in 1859-1868 in the IV regressions is consistent with the outcome
of reduced form regressions reported in Column (6) of Table B.3 in the Appendix, where Distance to Fresnes and
the Deviation from Wheat Prices in 1834-1838 are negatively and significantly associated with the share of literate
conscripts in 1859-1868.

on human capital.


6.1.2     The Presence of Raw Material

The diffusion of the steam engine across French departments could have been impacted by the
presence of raw material required for industrialization. Moreover the wealth generated by this raw
material could have affected human capital. As was shown in the baseline regressions in Tables 6 and
11, the statistical impact of industrialization on human capital remains intact when one accounts for
the share of carboniferous area in each department (Fernihough and O’Rourke, 2014) Nevertheless,
the diffusion of the steam engine across France as well as human capital formation could have been
affected by the early use of raw material required for industrialization. Nevertheless, the effect of
industrialization on human capital in the first stages of the industrial revolution remains nearly
intact, economically and statistically, when the number of iron forges in 1789 and 1811 (Panels A
and B of Figure 8) in each department (Woronoff, 1997) are accounted for in Table B.7 or when the
area covered by coal mines in 1837 (Panel C of Figure 8) in each department is taken into account
in Table B.8.

6.1.3         Early Economic Integration

Human capital formation and the number of steam engines across French departments could have
been affected by the degree of economic integration of each department into the France as a whole.
However, as established in Table B.9, the degree of early market integration of each department
(depicted in Panel D of Figure 8), as proxied by the number of firms which sold their products
outside that home department in the 1790s (Daudin, 2010), has no qualitative impact on the effect
of industrialization on human capital formation in the early phase of the industrial revolution.
Moreover, as reported in Tables B.10 and B.11, the effect of early industrialization on human
capital formation is robust to the inclusion of the share of the road network and of the water
network in the territory of each department in 1837, and the existence of a railroad connection in
1860 (Caron, 1997).


6.1.4         Population Density




       18.71 - 38.58                                                    19.94 - 40.48

       38.58 - 49.51                                                    40.48 - 52.30

       60.64 - 1033.91                                                  63.82 - 1032.35

                                             Figure 9: Population Density in 1801 and 1821


       In light of the historical evidence that steam engines were more likely to be located in urban
centers (Rosenberg and Trajtenberg, 2004), it is plausible that the potentially endogenous level of
population density could have been a factor in the adoption of the steam engine and in the formation
of human capital, and could have thus contributed to the relationship between industrialization
and human capital formation. Reassuringly, as reported in Table B.12 in the Appendix, population
density in each French department in 1801 and 1821 (as shown in Figure 9) has no qualitative impact
on the estimated effects and the statistical significance of industrialization on human capital.30
  30
     The Tarn-et-Garonne department was established in 1812 from parts of Aveyron, Gers, Haute-Garonne, Lot and
Lot-et-Garonne. Therefore, we lose one observation when population density in 1801 is included in the analysis.




                                                                  32
6.1.5    Past Level of Fertility

Human capital formation and the number of steam engines across France could have been affected
by differential fertility patterns across French departments (reflecting cultural characteristics as well
as economic incentives). In particular, conditional on pre-industrial levels of economic and human
capital development, departments in which fertility was higher prior to the 1839-1847 industrial
survey may have had characteristics that enhanced fertility and lowered the level of investment in
human capital (Galor, 2011). However, as reported in Table B.13, although the level of fertility
in 1806 has the predicted negative effect on the various measures of human capital formation in
the post-1840 period, it has no qualitative impact on the estimated effect of industrialization on
human capital formation.31


6.1.6    Investments in Education as a Consumption Good

The documented rise in human capital formation in the first phase of industrialization is not
necessarily indicative of technology-skill complementarity. The positive effect of industrialization
on income may have generated a demand for human capital as a consumption good rather than
as an investment good. Indeed, as shown in Table B.14, the intensity of industrialization was
associated with higher average wages for men and women, as well as children (below age 16), in
1839-1847. Nevertheless, as established in Table B.15, the effect of industrialization on the various
measures of human capital remains nearly intact, once one accounts for average male, female and
child wages. In particular, the rise in parental income is mostly un-associated with human capital
formation whereas the number of steam engines retains its positive impact on education. Moreover,
the wages of children are unrelated to human capital formation, perhaps reflecting the compliance
with the first limitation on child labor imposed by the 22 March 1841 law.


6.1.7    The Upper Tail of the Human Capital Distribution in the 18th century

The number of steam engines and human capital formation in the 19th century might have been
affected by the upper tail of the human capital distribution in the previous century. As reported
in Table B.16, the upper tail of the human capital distribution in the 18th century, as captured
by the number of subscribers to the Quarto edition of the Encyclopédie (Darnton, 1973), has no
qualitative impact on the estimated impact of steam engines on human capital formation. Moreover,
as established in Table B.2, it has no effect on the impact of the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut
on the intensive use of the steam engine.
   31
     1806 is the earliest year for which the level of fertility is available across French departments (Bonneuil, 1997).
Accounting for fertility in subsequent years, including the ones contemporaneous to the survey, does not affect the
results.

6.2      Alternative Measures of Human Capital

6.2.1      Public Expenditures on Education

This subsection explores the robustness of the baseline analysis to an alternative proxy of human
capital formation, i.e., public expenditures on education. The analysis examines the effect of
industrialization on total public expenditures on primary schooling per capita over the 1855-1863
period. As shown in Table D.1 in the Appendix, the OLS regressions in Columns (1)-(6) suggest
that the number of steam engines in 1839-1847 mostly has an insignificant association with total
public spending on primary schooling. However, in the IV regressions in Columns (7)-(10) which
mitigate the effect of omitted variables on the observed relationship and account for the confounding
effects of geographical, institutional and pre-industrial characteristics, the effect of industrialization
on the share of literate conscripts is found to be positive and significant. All in all, the IV estimate
in Column (7) of Table D.1 indicates that a one-percent increase in the number of steam engines in a
department in 1839-1847 increased total public spending on education by 1.36% over the 1855-1863
period.
        Moreover, Tables D.2-D.4 assess the relationship between industrialization and public spend-
ing on primary schooling per capita by distinguishing expenditures from the three tiers of the French
government, i.e., the central state, the departments and the communes, over the 1855-1863 period.
In those Tables, the IV regressions in Tables D.2-D.4 indicate a positive and significant effect of
industrialization on public spending by the the communes and the departments, but not by central
state. This is in line with the historical evidence (e.g., Mayeur (2003)). Indeed, as can be seen in
the descriptive statistics reported in Table A.1, most of the public spending on primary schooling
was undertaken by the communes in mid-19th century France. It was only after the passing of the
laws on mandatory and free schooling in 1881-1882 that the central state begun to finance primary
schooling (Franck and Johnson, 2016).


6.2.2      School Buildings

This subsection explores the robustness of the baseline analysis to an alternative proxy of human
capital formation, i.e., school buildings. The analysis examines the effect of industrialization on
the number of school buildings per commune (the lowest tier of the French government) in each
department. Surveys carried out in 1850 and 1863 indicate that the average number of school
buildings per commune increased from 1.88 in 1850 to 2.19 in 1863, with large variations in the
number of school buildings across departments.32 Since the 1850 and 1863 surveys do not provide
information on the size of the school buildings and the number of classrooms, this variable can be
viewed as a slightly imprecise measure of human capital formation.
  32
       French communes had been compelled by law to host at least one school building in their jurisdiction since 1833.



                                                           34
     The relationship between industrialization and the number of school buildings in 1850 and
1863 is presented in Tables D.5 and D.6. In Column (1) of both Tables, the unconditional OLS es-
timate between the number of steam engines in industrial production in 1839-1847 and the number
of school buildings in 1840 and 1863 is positive but insignificant. This relationship remains posi-
tive and significant when the confounding effects of exogenous geographical factors (Column (2)),
institutional factors (Column (3)) and pre-industrial characteristics (Columns (4)-(6)) are taken
into account. Finally, in the IV estimations in Columns (7)-(10) which account for the confounding
effects of geographical, institutional, and demographic characteristics, the number of steam engines
in 1839-1847 is found to have a positive and mostly significant impact on the number of school
buildings in 1850 and 1863. The IV estimates in Column (7) of Tables D.5 and D.6 suggest that
a one-percent increase in the number of steam engines in a department in 1839-1847 increased the
number of primary schools by 17.4% in 1850 and 15.4% in 1863.
     Moreover, in the IV regressions in Tables D.5 and D.6, there is a positive and significant
association between the distance to Paris and the number of school buildings. There is also a neg-
ative and significant correlation between border departments and the number of school buildings.
However other characteristics of departments such as latitude, land suitability, the share of car-
boniferous area in the department, maritime departments, as well as pre-industrial human capital
and economic development, do not have a systematically significant effect on school buildings in
the IV regressions.


7    Concluding Remarks

The research explores the effect of industrialization on human capital formation. Exploiting ex-
ogenous regional variations in the adoption of steam engines across France, the study establishes
that in contrast to conventional wisdom which views early industrialization as a predominantly
deskilling process, the industrial revolution was conducive for human capital formation, generating
broad increases in literacy rates and education attainment. In particular, the analysis suggests that
a greater number of steam engines in a given department in the 1839-1847 period had a positive
and significant effect on: (i) the number of teachers in 1840 and 1863, (ii) the share of children in
primary schools in 1840 and 1863, (iii) the share of apprentices in the population in 1863, (iv) the
share of literate conscripts over the 1847-1856 and 1859-1868 periods, and (v) public spending on
primary schooling over the 1855-1863 period.
     The research thus lends further credence to the emerging view that human capital was instru-
mental in the process of industrialization, governing the pace of the transition from stagnation to
growth and comparative economic development across the world.
