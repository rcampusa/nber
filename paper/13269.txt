Irreversible Investment, Capital Costs and Productivity Growth: Implications for Telecommunications

                                           ABSTRACT

This paper develops a model incorporating costly disinvestment and estimates the associated commitment
premium required to invest in telecommunications. Results indicate that the irreversibility premium
raises the opportunity cost of capital by 70 percent. This implies an average annual hurdle rate of
return of 14 percent over the period 1986-2002. Irreversibility creates a distinction between observed
and adjusted TFP growth. Observed growth, which omits the premium, annually averaged 2.8 percent
from 1986 to 2002. This rate exceeded the (premium) adjusted TFP growth by 0.7 percentage points,
and therefore average annual observed productivity growth overestimated the corrected rate by 33
percent.

1     Introduction
Investment in network industries such as telecommunications typically involves
industry-specific capital so that investment reversibility is virtually impossible.
Irreversible investment implies that a firm must incur substantial costs as it
attempts to disinvest, and accordingly capital cannot be shed like many other
inputs. If network investments were reversible a firm could readily disinvest
when market conditions become unfavorable and thereby avoid the financial
consequences of these adverse conditions. However, because network invest-
ments are generally not fungible (in other words they have limited alternative
uses) a firm operating in a particular network industry commits to production
in that industry. This commitment is costly. The reason is that a firm’s ability
to evolve through business conditions is relatively more constrained compared
to firms undertaking fungible investment, while otherwise facing identical con-
ditions. Therefore as a consequence of the inability to disinvest, the “hurdle”
rate of return on capital must exceed the opportunity cost pertaining to cir-
cumstances when disinvestment is viable. The first purpose of this paper is to
develop a model of production and investment that incorporates costly disin-
vestment. The model is subsequently applied to telecommunications in order
to estimate the magnitude of the commitment premium in that industry. In
telecommunications, copper and fiber optic cables are typical examples of net-
work infrastructure where reversing investment is prohibitively costly. Estimates
of a non-zero premium provide evidence of the costs associated with irreversible
investment.
    Firms in the telecommunications industry referred to as incumbent local
exchange carriers (ILECs) operate under an “obligation to serve” constraint,
which requires capital to be on hand in order to stand ready to serve customers of
basic landline telephone services.1 This obligation represents an additional cost
of investment in the context of irreversibility. If investment is reversible ILECs
could simply disinvest when basic landline telephone demand falls, and reinvest
when demand rises. An example of this behavior is found in the airline industry
where aircraft are added or subtracted as required—indeed this is why planes
are often referred to as “capital on wheels”. But with irreversible investment,
once capital is added to provide anticipated required capacity it cannot be cost-
eﬀectively resold if the additional demand does not materialize.2 Practically
though how likely is it for basic landline demand to fall and subsequently facility
utilization decreases? After all even if customers migrate to non-incumbent
carriers who lease facilities from ILECs these facilities still remain utilized as
non-incumbents provide services to their own customers. But not all customers
just migrate to other carriers, they migrate to alternative services from basic
   1 These carriers are presently Verizon, at&t, and Quest. Also long distance services and

ancillary services such as call-waiting and caller-id are not subject to the constraint.
   2 Although incumbents have an obligation to serve, investment incentives remain important

because this obligation only applies to basic landline service. Carriers still have discretion
over their investment decisions. Further it has also been argued that regulatory regimes
requiring the leasing of incumbents’ facilities add an additional burden or constraint regarding
investment decisions (see Kahn [2004], Hausman [2003] and Tardiﬀ [1999]).


                                               1
landline services. Wireless services, cable-based telephony and Internet-based
services are substitutes for basic wireline services. Thus as demands for these
substitutes grow, all other things constant, competition in telecommunications
markets reduces the basic landline customer base served by any one specific
ILEC, as well as the customer base for all ILECs combined.3
     A further complication is the problem of uncertain returns to investment.4
Future market conditions, by their very nature, are uncertain and so network
infrastructure investment will necessarily yield uncertain returns over its useful
life. Under both conditions, namely irreversibility and uncertainty, there is an
option value to waiting rather than investing. Intuitively, when a firm makes an
irreversible investment, it gives up its option to wait to see how uncertainty is
resolved.5 If business conditions turn unfavorable the firm is unable to disinvest
if such events occur and would have to bear the financial consequences of the
unfavorable conditions. It could not sell the capital and recover the undepre-
ciated original value of its investment expenditure.6 Thus the uncertain future
market value of network infrastructure requires a firm to form expectations re-
garding future prices of network facilities in order to formulate its investment
plan. This paper incorporates uncertainty as future telecommunications capital
acquisition prices are assumed to be random variables. Consistent with rational
expectations the parameters of the stochastic process are jointly estimated with
the commitment premium associated with irreversible investment. Moreover
jointly estimating the expectations and commitment parameters improves the
econometric eﬃciency of the estimates, as well as capturing the interrelationship
between uncertainty and irreversibility.
     An important indicator of dynamic performance is the eﬃciency by which
inputs are transformed into outputs. This measure is referred to as the rate of
total factor productivity (TFP) growth. TFP growth is calculated typically as
the diﬀerence between a weighted average of output quantity growth rates (with
revenue shares as weights), and a weighted average of input quantity growth
rates (with cost shares as weights). In the context of irreversible investment,
cost shares must include a possible commitment premium required to compen-
sate firms for undertaking such investment. Since this commitment premium
raises the opportunity cost of capital it will aﬀect the cost shares of the various
inputs used in the production process, and accordingly aﬀect both input quan-
tity growth and subsequent TFP growth rates. Productivity growth estimates
for telecommunications generally exclude the costs of disinvestment. Therefore
   3 To extent that existing facilities can be used for non-basic landline telephone services,

such as DSL internet services, the costs associated with the obligation to serve are mitigated
as basic landline demand falls.
   4 As previously noted even without uncertainty returns to irreversible investment require a

premium.
   5 Dixit and Pindyck [1994] provide a theoretical development of option values and invest-

ment.
   6 Economides [2002] has argued that returns to investment in telecommunications are quite

stable. This however is an empirical question that we address below in section 4 when alter-
native expectation processes are considered. Nevertheless, as noted above, even absent future
uncertainty irreversibility adds to the costs of investment.



                                              2
“observed” TFP growth actually mismeasures the “correct or adjusted” rate,
defined to include the appropriate measure of the opportunity cost of capital.
The third purpose of this paper is to calculate both adjusted and observed TFP
growth rates for telecommunication carriers and show how the two rates diﬀer
over time. An increase in the opportunity cost of capital due to the fact that in-
vestment is irreversible raises the capital cost share weight relative to the other
input cost shares, and if capital is growing relatively faster (respectively slower)
than the other factors of production then observed input growth will understate
(respectively overstate) the corrected rate of input growth. As a consequence
observed productivity growth will overstate (respectively understate) the ap-
propriately adjusted rate of TFP growth.
    This paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 develops the
model of investment which admits the possibility of costly disinvestment. This
section shows that at the margin these costs raise the capital input price (in
other words the user cost of capital) relative to the case of reversible invest-
ment. Section 3 shows the calculation and decomposition of TFP growth. Both
observed and adjusted TFP growth rates are considered in order to establish
how the irreversibility premium aﬀects the diﬀerence in productivity growth
rates. Next, section 4 contains the empirical implementation and discussion of
the findings. Results are presented on investment irreversibility margins, and
diﬀerences in the rates of observed and adjusted productivity growth. Since the
marginal cost of disinvestment aﬀects the opportunity cost of capital, this sec-
tion also provides a calculation of the hurdle rate of return to capital required to
account for the costs of investment irreversibility. The last section of the paper
provides a summary and conclusion.


2     Production and Industry-Specific Investment
This section develops a model of production and investment when investment
is irreversible or in other words it is costly for the firm to disinvest. To begin,
consider a transformation function written as:

                                   F (yt , vt , t) = 0,                             (1)

where yt is an m dimensional vector of output quantities in period t, vt is an
n dimensional vector of input quantities in period t, and t also represents the
exogenous disembodied technology index.7
   Factor accumulation is represented by

                       vit = xit + (1 − δ i )vit−1 , i = 1, ..., n,                 (2)

where xit is the addition to the ith input quantity in period t, and 0 ≤ δ i ≤ 1
is the ith input depreciation rate. Since the depreciation rates for nondurable
input quantities are defined as δ i = 1, in these cases from (2) vit = xit .
  7 The transformation function has the usual properties as described for example in Mas

Collel, Whinston and Green (1995).


                                            3
     Input accumulation typified by facility investment in network industries is
often viewed to be irreversible. For some types of investment, the physical
characteristics associated with capital utilization make recouping expenditures
through resale not financially viable. For example in telecommunications the
majority of the cost of underground cable is the cost of burying the cable and
not the cable itself, and so removing the cable for resale would be prohibitively
expensive. For other types of investment (for example switching equipment)
that presumably could be “uninstalled” and resold, the problem is that the
equipment is industry-specific and so its resale value is tied to the industrial
business cycle. Thus when conditions turn unfavorable and a firm attempts
to disinvest, there are no buyers as concomitantly all firms want to sell such
capital. This renders investment de facto irreversible.
     Irreversible investment implies the cost of disinvestment must exceed the
expected proceeds from the sale of network facilities. Further, when it is costly
to reduce capital holdings, as a firm builds up infrastructure capital it becomes
“harder” to reverse the increase. In other words the capital cost per unit of
capital exceeds the market price of the asset and this cost rises with the size of
network facilities. The cost of irreversibility can be formalized by the function
Ii (vit ), which is increasing in vit , and at any future date it is always the case
         e                        e
that qit   vit < Ii (vit ) where qit is the expected acquisition or purchase price of
the ith capital in period t. From the later inequality the proceeds obtained
through the sale of infrastructure facilities do not compensate for the cost of
disinvesting. As an example, the function Ii (vit )represents the cost of extracting
buried cable.8 9
     Input demands are determined from minimizing the expected present value
of acquisition and hiring costs. The uncertain future market value of network
capital requires a firm to form expectations regarding these future prices in order
to formulate its production and investment decisions. For example in telecom-
munications expectations involve the future prices of infrastructure capital such
as switches, and copper cable.10 Formally the expected present value at time t
(defined as the current time period) is given by the following:
                        ∞ X
                        X n
                                               e
                                  a(t, t + s)[qit+s xit+s + Ii (vit+s )],                    (3)
                        s=0 i=1
   8 The     costs of irreversibility depends on the level of the capital stock. This diﬀers from
adjustment costs, which depend on the change in the capital stock. The reason for this
diﬀerence is that if a firm decides not to invest in a particular period then adjustment costs
are zero, but the costs of irreversibility do not disappear. As long as there are positive levels
of network infrastructure there are costs to disinvesting. See Caballero [1999] for a survey on
investment models.
     9 It is possible to assume that the cost of disinvesting for any one type of capital depends

on all types. This formulation is not introduced because in the empirical implementation
there is one capital stock. In addition the irreversibility cost function could be specified as
Ii (vit−1 , xit ). Practically though the marginal cost of disinvesting undepreciated facilities
does not diﬀer from the marginal cost associated with facility additions. Thus it is assumed
that Ii (vit−1 , xit ) = Ii (vit−1 + xit ) = Ii (vit )
   1 0 Although companies enter into equipment contracts with suppliers, these contracts have

specified termination dates.

where qit+s is the expectation in the current period t of the ith factor acquisition
(or hiring) price in period t + s, and a(t, t + s) is the discount factor with
a(t, t) = 1, a(t, t + 1) = (1 + ρt+1 )−1 , where ρt+1 is the discount rate from
period t to period t + 1. The expression in (3) is minimized subject to equation
sets (1), and (2). The Lagrangian for the problem is:

where λt+s is the Lagrangian multiplier in period t + s. Diﬀerentiating (4) with
respect to vit+s , the first order condition for the ith input in period t + s is:
                                ∙                                ¸

Dividing (5) by a(t, t + s), and letting a = a(t, t + s + 1)/a(t, t + s) to be the

≥ 1, is the expected ith factor cost margin at period t + s. The term ω eit+s is
the ith expected user cost in period t + s. User costs represent the opportu-
nity cost of input utilization, and costly disinvestment causes the opportunity
cost to increase at the margin by ∂v∂I     i

∂vit+s ≥ 0), then a condition of irreversibility is µit+s > 1. From expression
(7) the value of the marginal product for the ith input equals its associated
(expected) user cost, and with costly disinvestment these marginal products
exceed levels when investment is reversible. Next, having established how com-
mitment premia aﬀect the cost minimizing conditions at each point in time, the
following section proceeds to identify the dynamic implications applicable to the
measurement of productivity growth.

3    Costly Disinvestment Margins and TFP Growth
The user cost derivation permits a recasting of the cost minimizing problem
defined by (3) into the following equivalent form:
                                           n
                                           X
                                    min           ω it vit ,                        (8)
                                     vit
                                           i=1

subject to the transformation function given by (1), for periods t = 0, ..., ∞.
The problem in (8) relates to minimizing the production cost, and leads to the
first order conditions denoted by (7). From the equivalency of cost minimizing
problems it is possible to define a cost function, which is denoted as:

                            C(ω 1t , ., ω nt , y1t , .., ymt , t).                  (9)

This function depends on user costs, and therefore on the margins associated
with costly disinvestment, expected acquisition and hiring prices, output quan-
tities and the index of disembodied technology.
    To calculate TFP growth, begin with the general cost function given by
(9). Assuming that the cost function can be approximated by a function, with
time-invariant second and higher order parameters, the cost diﬀerence between
periods s and t, defined as Ct − Cs , will consist only of first order terms (see
Denny and Fuss, [1983], Bernstein, Mamuneas and Pashardes [2004]). Thus:

is thePadjusted input quantity growth rate, where pj is the jth output price,
Rt = j pjt yjt is the total revenue, σjt = pjt yjt /Rt , is the jthe output revenue
share, and the ith cost share is defined as seit = ω it vit /Rt . The cost shares

                                              6
are defined in terms of revenue because without loss of generality it is possible
to define an artificial input such that this n + 1st input’s Pn+1price is ω n+1t =
Rt − Ct , and its quantity is vn+1t = 1, whereby Rt .= i=1 ω it vit . Moreover
(vn+1t − vn+1s ) = 0, and so the calculation of the input growth rate above does
not involve the n +1st input. The numerators of the cost shares involve the user
costs, given as ω it and so the shares include the marginal commitment premia
associated with disinvestment. The subscript m signifies the average value so
for example for output quantity, ym = .5(yt + ys ).
    From the Appendix, adjusted TFP growth equals:
                                      ³                  ´ 1
                 T F P Gan (s, t) = .5 e
                                       ξ νt Rt + e

Expression (11) shows that adjusted productivity growth represents technolog-
ical change, where e
                   ξ νt is the input-based rate of technological change in period
t.
    The diﬃculty calculating adjusted TFP growth is the unobservability of
the marginal disinvestment cost and as a consequence adjusted TFP growth is
unobservable. Thus measures of productivity growth typically use observed cost
shares to compute the input growth rate. These observed cost shares by their
very nature must exclude the unobserved marginal costs of disinvesting,     .   .
                                                                                  and
so “observed” productivity growth is defined as T F P Go (s, t) = Y /Y − V /V ,
where
                    X n     ∙                                                 ¸

where the second term on the right side of (14) reflects the marginal premia

    Measures of observed TFP growth relying on growth accounting methods,
as opposed to econometric methods based on the estimates of production or cost
functions, necessarily assume total revenue equals total (observed) cost..11 To
be consistent with growth accounting methods, introduce an n + 1 input such
that the price of this input is total revenue minus observed cost or Rt −ct , and its
quantity is unity. Label this observed TFP growth inclusive of the accounting

Notice for the n+1 st input (vit − vis ) = 0, because quantity is always unity. Ex-
pression (15) shows that observed TFP growth consists of two terms. The first
term is the rate of technological change, and the second term reflects the mar-
gins associated with the premia required by irreversible investment. Indeed for

adjusted input growth to exceed observed growth then observed productivity
growth (T F P Go ) overstates the correct or adjusted growth rate (T F P Ga ). No-
tice if investment is reversible (µit = 1) then the diﬀerence between observed
and adjusted TFP growth rates disappear and technological change accounts
for productivity growth.


4      Empirical Implementation and Results
This section of the paper contains the estimation results, and in particular
presents estimates of the margins associated costly disinvestment. In order to
estimate the marginal cost of irreversibility assume µit is time invariant so that
ω it = µi wit , and thus equation (15) becomes:
                                              n
                                              X             (vit − vis )
                   T F P Gon (s, t) = ξ t +       (µi − 1) sim                   (16)
                                         i=1
                                                                vim
                                           ³                  ´
where sim = wim vim /Rm and ξ t = .5 e       ξ νt Rt + e
                                                       ξ νs Rs R1m (t − s). Two cases
are considered for the rate of technological change. The first case assumes the
rate is constant so ξ t = ξ.12 The second case assumes the rate itself changes
over time, so ξ t = ξ + ξ T t, and therefore a time trend, t, is introduced into the
estimating equation.13
    Equation (16 ), which is the equation to be estimated, relates observed TFP
growth to the rate of technological change, ξ t , and input growth rates whose
parameters, µi , are the margins arising from costly disinvestment. Data for the
telecommunications industry are updated from Bernstein and Zarkadas [2004].
Output growth rates are defined as the growth rates of a chained Fisher quantity
index of local services, intrastate services, and interstate services. Interstate
output consists of the aggregation of access lines, interstate switched access

                                                                             ξ νt = e
                                                                                    ξ νs = ξ.

minutes, and special access lines. Access lines, measured by the sum of the
number of business, public, and residential access lines, and special access lines
provide connectivity to the network, while the volume of interstate activity
is measured by interstate switched access minutes. Local output is measured
by the number of local calls. Intrastate output consists of the aggregation of
intrastate toll minutes and intrastate switched access minutes.
    There are three input categories, labor, capital and intermediate inputs.
Labor quantity is based on annual data for the number of employees. The
quantity of intermediate inputs is calculated as intermediate input expenses
divided by a price index. Intermediate input expense is computed by subtracting
from total operating expenses the sum of labor compensation and depreciation
and amortization expense. The intermediate input price index is taken to be
the gross domestic product price index. The capital input is the accumulation
of constant dollar annual investment plus the depreciated value of the previous
year’s capital stock. The acquisition price of capital before income taxes is
defined as qK = QK (1 − ϑK − ιK )/(1 − uc ), where QK is a composite asset price
index obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), ϑK = uc zK ,
where zK is the present value of physical capital cost allowances, uc is the
corporate income tax rate, and ιK is the physical investment tax credit rate
obtained from Xanthopoulos [1991] and the BEA. The discount rate is set to 4
percent, and the depreciation rate is 7.2 percent. The sample covers the period
from 1985 to 2003.14
    Since there is one capital input then the margins associated with irreversible
investment for labor and intermediate inputs are µL = µM = 1, and from (16):

                          T F P Gon (s, t) = ξ t + (µK − 1) sKt vbKt                      (17)

where (b) denotes the growth rate.
    In addition future values of the capital acquisition price are uncertain, and
this random variable is assumed to follow a first order autoregressive process of
the following form
                          qKt+1 = φK + θK qKt + eKt                           (18)
where φK , and θK are parameters, the error eKt is identically and independently
distributed over time, and since expectations are rational, the expected value of
eKt is zero. Equation (17) and (18) are jointly estimated because the expected
value of qKt+1 forms part of the user cost of capital (from equation (6)), which
in turn enters into the capital cost share in equation (17).15
    Table 1 reports the parameter estimates. This table shows the Least Squares
estimates for static (that is qKt+1 = qKt ) and autoregressive expectations for the
capital acquisition price, and also provides Instrumental Variable (IV) estimates.
The set of instruments consists of a constant, the twice lagged values of the
input and output growth rates, the twice lagged value of the acquisition price
of capital and the lagged values of the cost shares. The estimates for each

of these three cases are also reported for constant and time varying rates of
technological change. First from the standard error of the regression (SER)
statistic, the results show that in each case the time varying rate of technological
change outperforms the constant rate version. Second, although the parameter
estimates are quite similar across models with time varying rate of technological
change, the autoregressive expectations model is preferred to the other two.
Indeed, testing the null hypothesis that expectations are static, in other words
φK = 0 and θK = 1, a Wald test shows that the null hypothesis is rejected as
the value of the test statistic is 6.59, which exceeds the critical value χ22,0.05 =
5.99.
    Next to see if the commitment premium required to undertake irreversible
investment is nonzero (or that µK > 1), the model has been reestimated with
(µK −1) replaced with a parameter α to test the null hypothesis that α = 0. The
test is based on the preferred model, which is the autoregressive expectations
version with time varying rate of technological change. The hypothesis that
µK = 1 is rejected with a t − statisic equal to 2.49.16 Therefore the estimation
results indicate that investment is irreversible with µK = 1.7 (from the preferred
model, which is the fourth column of estimation results). This finding implies
that the associated commitment premium increases the user cost of capital by
70%., and as shown in table 2 annually averages to be 0.270. Since the margin
between irreversible and reversible investment is a constant (as µK = 1.7) the
user costs inclusive of the premium are readily converted to those without the
premium by dividing the former by 1.7.
    It is also possible to restate the commitment premium in terms of the cost
of capital or equivalently
                £           the hurdle¤ rate of return. Recall from (7) that ω Kt =
                          e
µK wKt = µK qKt − aqKt+1       (1 − δ) , where a = 1/(1 + ρ) is the discount factor
and ρ is the rate of return. Let γ = 1/(1 + ρ∗ ), such that ρ∗ is the hurdle rate
of return, which makes the user costs of capital inclusive of the premium, ω Kt ,
equal to the user cost exclusive of the premium. Thus:
                                                e
                                 ω Kt = qKt − γqKt+1 (1 − δ)

                                              qKt − ω Kt
                                       γ=     e
                                             qKt+1 (1 − δ)
and therefore ρ∗ = γ1 − 1.17 The expression (ρ∗ − ρ)/ρ shows the bias in the
rate of return on capital attributable to the exclusion of the marginal cost as-
sociated with the inability to disinvest. Table 2 reports the estimates of ρ∗ .
Further to discern the eﬀect on the hurdle rate of return of inappropriately as-
suming static expectations this table also presents the calculation of ρ∗ under
the assumption of static expectations. First, our findings indicate on average
the annual hurdle rate inclusive of the commitment premium is 2.5 times greater
   1 6 Also based on the preferred model, the hypothesis that the time trend has no eﬀect

(ξ t = 0) is rejected with a t − statistic equal to -3.31. In addition the test that ξ t = 0 and
µK = 1 is rejected since the Wald test statistic is equal to 9.77 higher than the critical value
of χ22,0.05 = 5.99.
  1 7 Under                                                             1−µK [1−α(1−δ K )]
              static expectations the formula for γ simplifies to γ =       (1−δ K )



                                                11
than the assumed rate excluding the premium (with ρ∗ = 0.14 and ρ = 0.04
then 2.5 = (0.14 − 0.04)/0.04). Therefore omitting the commitment premium
arising from irreversible investment underestimates the appropriate rate of re-
turn on capital. Second, with static expectations the average hurdle rate is
estimated to be ρ∗ = 0.129. This rate is 8.5 percent below the rate based on
rational price expectations. But diﬀerences in average hurdle rates obfuscate
an important outcome. As table 2 shows, the sample standard deviation of ρ∗
under static expectations is much higher than the standard deviation associ-
ated with rational expectations. This implies considerable sample instability
with static expectations, and indeed for many years hurdle rate estimates de-
rived by mistakenly assuming static expectations are substantially less than the
rates obtained from the rational expectations model. There is little empirical
research to compare these findings. However, a paper by Pindyck [2005] using
diﬀerent methods and framework concludes that the telecommunications hurdle
rate with irreversible investment is between 14.2 and 17.5 percent. This result
is very similar to the estimates obtained in this paper.
    Table 3 reports the TFP growth rates and their decomposition. First,
the generally positive rate of technological change contributes to productivity
growth, and over the period 1986-2002 the average annual rate of technological
change was about 1.7 percent. Second, the observed TFP growth rate normal-
ized such that total revenue equals total observed cost (T F P Gon ) is generally
positive, and varies over the sample period. The average annual rate over the
years from 1986 to 2002 was 2.8 percent. The preceding concept of productivity
growth uses growth accounting methods as do many earlier studies of telecom-
munications’ productivity. For example, Bernstein and Zarkadas [2004] found
that over the period 1986-2001 productivity growth averaged either 2.7 percent
or 2.9 percent depending on the disaggregation of intrastate outputs. The re-
sults in this paper are comparable and as well provide growth rates for the most
current time period.
    For the first time this paper introduces estimates of the premium due to
irreversible investment into the measurement of TFP growth. Since the com-
mitment premium exceeds unity, and with growing capital this premium re-
duces adjusted productivity growth relative to the observed rate (that is from
equation (17), ). Therefore observed TFP growth overestimates adjusted pro-
ductivity growth. Table 3 shows this result as observed productivity growth,
T F P Go , consistently exceeds the appropriately adjusted rate, T F P Ga . In-
deed on average over the sample period observed productivity growth annually
overestimates adjusted growth by 0.7 percentage points per year. This bias is
relatively large, and represents a 33 percent productivity overvaluation when
the costs of irreversible investment are incorrectly omitted from the analysis.


5    Summary and Conclusion
A major purpose of this paper was to develop a model incorporating costly dis-
investment in order to estimate the premium on the opportunity cost of capital


                                       12
in telecommunications where investment is often perceived as irreversible. Irre-
versible investment, for example in telecommunications copper and fibre optic
cables, implies that a firm must incur substantial costs as it attempts to dispose
of its capital stocks. As a consequence, firms commit to production. This is a
costly commitment whereby the inability to disinvest raises the hurdle rate of
return on capital above the opportunity cost associated with reversible invest-
ment. The findings in this paper indicate that telecommunications investment
is indeed irreversible, and the opportunity cost of capital is 70 percent greater
than would be the case under reversible investment. In terms of the hurdle rate
of return on capital, costly disinvestment leads to an average annual rate of
14 percent, which is two and a half times the assumed return under reversible
investment.
    Because of the commitment premium, this paper distinguishes between ob-
served and adjusted TFP growth rates. The observed rate, which is the rate
typically calculated in productivity studies, omits the premium. The premium
raises the opportunity cost of capital and thereby aﬀects the input cost shares
used to compute input quantity growth. As a consequence, the revised input
growth leads to the calculation of adjusted TFP growth rates. This paper finds
calculates the average annual rate of observed productivity growth over the
years from 1986 to 2002 to be 2.8 percent. On average this rate overestimates
adjusted growth by 0.7 percentage points per year. Indeed this bias is quite
large, representing an annual 33 percent productivity overvaluation when the
significant costs of irreversible investment are inappropriately excluded.
    There are a number of avenues for future research. Probably the most im-
portant direction is to translate the capital commitment premium into marginal
costs of production for the various telecommunication services. With these mar-
ginal costs it would then be possible to discern the proper basis to set regulated
telecommunications prices, notably wholesale prices for access to the telecom-
munications network. If telecommunication carriers provided a single service, or
if they produced multiple services in a fixed proportion, or priced these services
according to a common markup (or markups in a fixed proportion to each other)
the translation from commitment premium to marginal cost would be relatively
straightforward. However in the context of multiple services and distinct mar-
ginal costs, the translation from input premium to marginal costs of production
requires knowledge of the multiple-product cost function. Estimation of this
function in the context of costly reversible investment is the next step in our
research program.

    Now adjusted TFP growth can be further simplified by recognizing that it
is always possible to write:
                                              ∂C
                                 pjt = ψ jt        , j = 1, ..., m,
                                              ∂yjt

where ψ jt ≥ 0 is called the jth output margin in period t. This relationship
does not imply profit maximization or any specific pricing rule for that matter.
It just signifies for the jth output, a number ψ jt ≥ 0 can always be found, which


                                                 15
in general diﬀers across outputs and across time periods, and equates price to
marginal cost. Multiplying the above expression by yjt and summing over j
provides:                                          ⎛               ⎞
               Xm            Xm                     X m
                                      ∂C yjt
                   pjt yjt =     ψ jt         Ct = ⎝     ψ jt η jt ⎠ Ct
               j=1           j=1
                                      ∂yjt Ct        j=1

where the left side is the total revenue and the right hand side is the total
cost multiplied by the sum of the product of output margins and output elas-
ticities of cost. Thus total
                          P cost is proportional    to total revenue such that the
proportionality factor is m        ψ
                             j=1 jt jtη  .18
                    P
    Now with κt = m   j=1 ψ jt η jt the previous expression can be written as

                                                     et
                                        Rt = κt Ct = C

where pjt = ∂ C/∂ye                                   e
                       jt . From the definition of Ct it is possible to define an
artificial input such that this n+1st input’s price is ω n+1t = Rt −Ct = (κt −1)Ct ,
and its quantity is vn+1t = 1, whereby Rt = C        et .= Pn+1 ω it vit . With this

                 et = ω it vit /Rt . Notice that for the n + 1 st input (vit − vis ) = 0,
seit = ω it vit /C
  1 8 The focus of the paper is not on output price-cost margins. Clearly there is a relationship

between the commitment premium for the user cost of capital and price-cost margins. In a
single output context the relationship is relatively straightforward, but does require knowledge
of the degree of returns to scale. This is readily seen from the right side of the previous
expression.

                  ´ is a single¡Poutput, or a common markup³P     then:´

degree of returns to scale, and ψ t is the common or single markup.
  However, in a multiple output context the relationship between the multiple price-cost
margins and commitment premium requires knowledge of the marginal costs of production,
and thereby knowledge of the general cost function.

that adjusted TFP growth consists of a technological change component where
technological change is defined as e          e
