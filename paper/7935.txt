1.       Introduction


         The phenomenon of "hot IPO markets" has been recognized for a long time in the financial

community. Ibbotson and Jaffe (1975) and Ibbotson, Sindelar, and Ritter (1988, 1994) show that there

are pronounced cycles in the number of new issues per month, cycles in the average initial return per

month, and also an apparent lead-lag relation between the two series. Specifically, periods of high and

rising initial returns tend to be followed by spurts of IPOs. Subsequent to these periods of high IPO

volume, average initial returns appear to decrease. Figure 1 shows monthly IPO volume and initial

returns between 1960 and 1997, and this pattern is repeated many times over the 38-year period. For

example, the high initial returns of early 1961 were followed by large numbers of companies going public

in late 1961 and early 1962, and then by especially low average initial returns in late 1962.

         While Ibbotson and Jaffe (1975), Ibbotson, Sindelar, and Ritter (1988, 1994), and more recently

Cook, Jarrell, and Kieschnick (1999) discuss the apparent lead-lag relations between IPO volume and

initial returns, none of these papers investigate the economics underlying these patterns.1 In contrast, our

objective is to examine the lead-lag relations between IPO volume and initial returns in more detail, with

a focus on both their statistical reliability and the economic factors that underlie these cycles.

       In contrast to the impression given in figure 1, statistical tests show only weak evidence of a

negative relation between IPO volume and future initial returns. However, consistent with figure 1, we

find a significant positive relation between initial returns and future IPO volume. As a first step towards

understanding this phenomenon, we examine the ways in which private companies time their IPOs, in

response to the initial returns of recent IPOs. We find that the timing of IPO filings and IPO withdrawals

drives the positive relation between initial returns and future IPO volume. More companies file IPOs and

fewer companies withdraw IPOs after periods of high initial returns.

  Helwege and Liang (1996) examine the reasons that certain companies choose to go public during periods of high
versus low average initial returns. However, both their dataset and the focus of their paper differ substantially from
ours. They compare one year of high average initial returns with one year of low average initial returns and contrast
the types of firms in the two groups.


                                                          1
                                      Lowry & Schwert, IPO Market Cycles


        Given the strong autocorrelation in initial returns, the finding that more companies want to go

public when IPOs are being underpriced by the greatest amount is puzzling. Assuming that firms prefer

to raise as much money in their IPO as possible, it would seem that companies would prefer to go public

when initial returns were the lowest. The observed pattern suggests that high initial returns contain

positive information for private companies considering an IPO. Perhaps periods of high initial returns

represent times when the market values IPO firms more highly than the firms and their underwriters had

previously expected.

        To learn about the information content of initial returns, we study the IPO pricing process in detail.

The empirical literature on IPOs has found many systematic factors that explain cross-sectional

differences in initial returns. For example, the size of the issuing firm, the reputation of the lead

investment bank, and the risk of the IPO stock are all factors that partially explain initial returns. In

addition, the information that firms and their investment banks learn about the demand for the IPO stock

during the registration period is strongly related to initial returns.

         By examining the predictability of individual firm initial returns, we are able to provide further

insight on the cycles in average initial returns over time. We find that the serial correlation in initial

returns is driven by the portion of initial returns that is predictable, that is, by changes in the types of

firms that go public over time and, more importantly, by certain information about firm value that

becomes available during the registration period but is not incorporated into the offer price. Notably, the

serial correlation in initial returns is not driven by a slow reaction of issuing firms or investment bankers

to market demand for IPO securities, and the level of initial returns at the time a company files to go

public contains no information about that company’s eventual underpricing. A company can neither gain

nor lose in terms of the magnitude of its underpricing by timing its IPO relative to the level of average

initial returns.

         Finally, we find that the positive relation between initial returns and subsequent IPO volume is

similarly driven by the predictable portion of initial returns, specifically by information learned during the

registration period. On the road show, the IPO firm and its underwriters glean information from informed


                                                        2
                                     Lowry & Schwert, IPO Market Cycles


investors about their valuation of this new firm. This information is a determinant of both the pricing of

that IPO, and also of the number of private companies that find it optimal to issue public equity in the

near future. More positive information in the form of higher expected valuations results in higher initial

returns and more companies filing to go public soon thereafter.

        In summary, new information learned during the registration period has value implications for

both the number of future issues and for the pricing of those issues. Notably, new information provided

by the secondary market on the first day of trading has no effect on either the pricing of future IPOs or the

number of future IPOs.

        Section 2 discusses the data that we use to examine the time-series relations in IPO volume and

initial returns. Section 3 investigates the statistical properties of the relations between IPO volume and

past and future initial returns.     In section 4, we examine the extent to which firms and/or their

underwriters manage the timing of the IPO process, conditional on the initial returns of other firms going

public. Sections 5 and 6 examine the reasons that more companies go public after observing especially

high average initial returns. Specifically, section 5 studies several firm and deal-specific factors that

influence the offer price, and section 6 employs these findings to investigate the determinants of the serial

correlation of IPO initial returns and of the lead-lag relation between initial returns and IPO volume.

Finally, section 7 summarizes the results in the paper.


2. Data


        To study the behavior of aggregate IPO market activity, we start with two basic sources of data

on initial returns and volume. These data are described below. In later sections of the paper we also

examine initial returns at the firm level, and those data will be described at that point.

2.1 Data Sources and Definitions

        The Ibbotson, Sindelar, and Ritter (ISR) data [http://bear.cba.ufl.edu/ritter/ipoall.htm] include

average, equal-weighted monthly IPO initial returns (IR EW
                                                        t  ) and the number of IPOs per month

(NIPO ISR
      t   ). The exact sample composition and the calculation of initial returns differ somewhat over the

sample period, and a more complete description of the procedures used to calculate these statistics is in

Ibbotson, Sindelar, and Ritter (1994). In general, ISR’s initial returns represent the average, across all

IPOs each month, of the percentage difference between a closing price within the first month after the

IPO and the offer price. Each IPO is weighted equally, so that IPOs of small firms have the same

influence as IPOs of large firms.

        We also use data on all firm-commitment IPOs offered or filed between 1985 and 1997 from

Securities Data Company (SDC). Unit IPOs, closed end funds, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and

American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are excluded. These data include the date the IPO was filed with

the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the range of prices within which the company expects to

price the issue as indicated in the preliminary prospectus (file range), the date each issue is offered or

withdrawn, the offer price, and the prices at the close of the first day, second day, and first week of

trading. IPO volume is defined as the number of IPOs each month (NIPO SDC
                                                                      t   ). We also measure the

number of offerings filed per month (NFILt) and the number of offerings withdrawn per month (NWDt).2

Finally, we calculate the average length of time in registration, equal to the number of days between the

filing and offer dates, weighted by proceeds raised in the IPO (REGTIME PW
                                                                        t  ).

        For the SDC sample, we measure both the initial return and the price update of each issue. The

initial return equals the percentage change between the offer price and the first closing price, weighted by

proceeds raised in the IPO (IR PW
                               t  ). To determine the first closing price of a particular issue, the first



2
  SDC records 48 withdrawals in January, 1990, compared to 4 withdrawals the previous month and 1 the
subsequent month. We strongly suspect that this data point is incorrect, and therefore omit it from the time series.


                                                         4
                                    Lowry & Schwert, IPO Market Cycles


closing price from the Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) is used if price data are available

within 14 days of the offer date. If CRSP data are not available, we try to obtain the closing price from

SDC. The SDC closing price equals the close on the first day of trading. If that is not available, the close

on the second day or otherwise the end of the first week of trading is used. The price update between the

initial filing and the final offer is measured as the percentage difference between the midpoint of the file

range and the offer price. The average price update for offers made in a particular month, weighted by

proceeds raised in the IPO, is denoted ∆P PW
                                          t  .


2.2 Descriptive Statistics

        Table 1 contains the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum of the various

data series, along with 12 autocorrelations and the large sample standard error of the autocorrelations.

Consistent with the earlier findings of Ibbotson and Jaffe (1975) and Ibbotson, Sindelar, and Ritter (1988,

1994), both the number of IPOs and the average initial returns are highly autocorrelated. Note that the

number of observations for initial returns is smaller than the sample size for the number of IPOs, since the

initial return is missing in months when no IPOs occur.

        In terms of the number of IPOs, in the 1985-97 period ISR's data include more issues, but the

general characteristics of the alternative measures NIPOISR, NIPOSDC, and NFIL are similar. The number

of issues withdrawn (NWD) is small, and the time in registration for offers that occur averages 72.1 days.

REGTIME is not highly autocorrelated, indicating that the cyclical behavior of the number of IPOs is not

the result of variation in registration times. Rather, it appears to be driven by the number of companies

filing and withdrawing offerings each month. Further empirical tests support this proposition.

        ISR's measure of initial returns (IR EW
                                             t  ) is higher on average and more volatile than the SDC

measure of initial returns (IR PW
                               t  ). This is most likely driven by two factors: first, ISR’s data weight

small issues more heavily, and second, over parts of the sample period the ISR data include best efforts

offerings and unit offerings, both of which tend to have higher than average initial returns. For the 1985-




                                                     5
                                     Lowry & Schwert, IPO Market Cycles


97 period, the autocorrelations of initial returns are highest for the first two monthly lags.             The

autocorrelations of initial returns from 1960-1997 are larger and more persistent (decaying from .60 to .11

between lags 1 and 12).

        The average proceeds-weighted price update between the initial filing and the offering (∆P PW
                                                                                                   t  ) is

–3.6 percent, and the autocorrelation is large at lag one, but is small for higher order lags (less than .25 in

absolute value for lags 2 through 12).


3. The Relation Between Volume and Initial returns


        Ibbotson, Sindelar, and Ritter (1994) use the data in figure 1 to show that both IPO volume and

average initial returns fluctuate substantially over time and are highly autocorrelated. Several possible

explanations have been suggested for the cyclical pattern in each of these series.

3.1 IPO Volume

        Lowry (2000) shows that the observed fluctuations in IPO volume are related to three distinct

factors: changes in private firms’ aggregate demand for capital, changes in the adverse selection costs of

issuing equity, and variation in investor optimism. First, when private firms’ total demands for capital

are higher, more companies tend to raise public equity for the first time. Lee and Henderson (1999) also

find that changing business conditions contribute to the variation in IPO volume. Second, a decrease in

market-wide information asymmetry causes the adverse selection costs of issuing equity to fall and

consequently more firms to go public. Bayless and Chaplinsky (1996) and Choe, Masulis, and Nanda

(1993) similarly find that adverse selection costs affect the number of companies having seasoned equity

offerings over time. Finally, when investors are especially optimistic, they are willing to overpay for IPO

firms and more firms will therefore have IPOs. Rajan and Servaes (1997), Lee, Shleifer and Thaler

(1991) and Helwege and Liang (1996) provide additional evidence that IPO volume is positively related

to the level of investor sentiment, and Pagano, Panetta, and Zingales (1998) reach a similar conclusion in

an examination of the Italian market.



                                                      6
                                      Lowry & Schwert, IPO Market Cycles


        More generally, Stoughton, Wong, and Zechner (2000) posit that IPO clustering is the result of

information effects. They develop a model in which one firm’s IPO provides information about industry

prospects, thus causing many similar companies to go public soon after.

3.2 Initial returns

        Variation in average IPO initial returns can also be caused by a number of different factors.

Ritter (1984) finds that underwriter monopsony power and differences in the average risk of companies

going public are important. Specifically, the higher average initial returns during the early 1980s were

driven by a large number of small, risky, natural resource companies going public and by the underwriters

of these IPOs systematically pricing them far below their subsequent market value. In addition, Ritter

(1991) provides evidence that investor over-reaction during certain periods contributes to the fluctuations

in initial returns. When investors are over-optimistic, they bid up the after-market price of the IPO firms,

resulting in especially high initial returns.

3.3 Information Spillover and IPO Cycles

        Neither changes in the average risk of companies going public nor time-variation in underwriter

monopsony power seem likely to cause initial returns to be positively correlated with subsequent IPO

volume or negatively correlated with lagged IPO volume. However, it is plausible that initial returns

contain some type of valuable information. For example, van Bommel and Vermaelen (2000) find that

firms with higher first-day returns spend more money on investment after the IPO. This finding is

consistent with the idea that initial returns are positively related to the market’s assessment of the firm’s

prospects, and firms respond to this information.

        More generally, average initial returns across all IPOs in a given period probably contain

information on investor sentiment or on growth prospects at that time. If high average initial returns

indicate that sentiment is especially high or market conditions better than expected, then more companies




                                                      7
                                       Lowry & Schwert, IPO Market Cycles


are likely to subsequently go public.3        To the extent that high initial returns indicate that private

companies can raise more money in an IPO than they previously thought, high initial returns will be

followed by periods of high volume.

        Similar theories can explain the negative relation between IPO volume and subsequent initial

returns. For example, as more firms go public, the uncertainty surrounding the true value of these firms

decreases, thus causing average initial returns to decrease. In a similar spirit, Benveniste, Busaba, and

Wilhelm (1999) and Booth and Chua (1996) model initial returns as compensation to investors for

learning the true value of firms. As an example, Benveniste, Busaba and Wilhelm note that Netscape’s

especially high initial return is consistent with this idea that initial returns represent compensation for

information gathering, as Netscape was one of the first internet IPOs. When IPO volume is high, these

costs are shared among many firms, causing average initial returns to be lower.

3.4 Evidence on Initial returns and Volume

        Figure 2 shows the cross correlations between initial returns in month t and IPO volume in month

t+k for several versions of these variables, for 12 months before and after the month of the IPO. Panel A

                                                                   t  and NIPO ISR
                                                                               t+ k . Consistent with the


impressions from figure 1, these data show a strong pattern of negative correlations between current

initial returns and past numbers of IPOs, along with strong positive correlations between current initial

returns and future numbers of IPOs.

        Panel B shows that the cross-correlations are somewhat sensitive to the measurement of initial

returns. Using data over the 1985 – 1997 period, we are able to measure initial returns on both an equal-

weighted and a value-weighted basis. Specifically, when initial returns are equal-weighted, the relations

are similar to those shown in Panel A over the longer time period. Initial returns are significantly

negatively correlated with past IPO volume and significantly positively correlated with future IPO

  Benveniste, Wilhelm, and Yu (1999) find that issuing firms structure their IPOs conditional on various features of
recent offerings; for example, actual proceeds raised compared to expected proceeds as stated in the prospectus.

volume. Notably, when initial returns are value-weighted, we see that initial returns are less strongly

related to past IPO volume, but the cross-correlations between initial returns and future IPO volume have

an even greater magnitude. The cross-correlations using initial returns and the number of filings, IR PW
                                                                                                      t


and NFILt+k, are similar, but shifted by about one month (so returns to IPOs filed in month t are related to

the number of IPOs filed in months t+1 and beyond). This is consistent with the lag between the time an

IPO is filed and the time of the offer.

        These cross-correlations suggest that there is a difference in the behavior of small and large IPOs.

These figures are descriptive in nature, however, and one must be cautious in drawing conclusions from

them. To test the statistical significance of these relations, we use second order vector autoregressive

(VAR) models. The VAR models allow for the substantial serial correlation in both initial returns and

volume that can make inferences about the cross-correlations in figure 2 difficult. These models enable

us to test the incremental predictive ability of lagged initial returns to predict future volume and vice

versa. Such tests are referred to as Granger (1969) F-tests, since he suggested and popularized them. The

VAR models as well as the Granger F-tests are shown in table 2.

        The left and middle panels of table 2 show results for ISR's equal-weighted data over the 1960-

1997 and 1985-97 periods, and the right panel is based on proceeds-weighted SDC data between 1985

and 1997. These tests confirm that there is a significant positive relation between initial returns and the

future number of IPOs. Using either time period and either equal-weighted or value-weighted initial

returns, Granger F-tests strongly reject the hypothesis that two lags of IPO initial returns have no power

to predict IPO volume, with p-values for these tests all below 0.01. In contrast, the relation between the

number of IPOs and future initial returns is negative, but not significant at conventional levels. Thus, the

impression from figure 2 that higher numbers of IPOs are associated with lower average returns in the

future is somewhat misleading. Also, the impression from figure 2 of a difference between the behavior




                                                     9
                                      Lowry & Schwert, IPO Market Cycles


of small and large IPOs is more apparent than real.4 The cross-correlations in figure 2 are misleading

because both initial returns and IPO volume are highly autocorrelated. Tests using 6 and 12 lags in the

VAR models yield qualitatively similar results.

        Thus, the F-tests in table 2 strengthen and formalize the impression given by the cross-

correlations in figure 2 that past initial returns have a significant positive effect on future IPO volume.

However, past IPO volume plays a weak role, if any, in predicting future initial returns.


4. Do Firms Manage the Timing of the IPO Process?


        The strong positive relation between initial returns and subsequent IPO volume suggests that

companies are timing their IPOs in response to the size of recent initial returns. High initial returns

appear to represent good news and therefore be followed by increased numbers of IPOs. In this section,

we look more specifically at the potential firm actions that could contribute to this relation.

        There are three ways that companies and/or underwriters can affect the timing of the IPO in

response to recent IPO initial returns. First, companies must file the issue. Second, they have the option

to change the planned issue date. A delay would extend the amount of time between the filing date and

the offer date. Third, they have the option to cancel the issue. This section examines the relations

between average initial returns and the number of IPO filings, the average registration time, and the

proportion of IPO cancellations.

        If high initial returns provide positive information about the market’s valuation of IPOs, then

more private companies should file IPOs after periods of high initial returns. Thus, initial returns should

be positively correlated with the number of subsequent filings. In contrast, we expect initial returns to be

negatively related to the number of subsequent cancellations. If large average initial returns represent

positive information for a company considering an IPO, then fewer firms should cancel IPOs after

 The finding of no significant relation between IPO volume and future initial returns contrasts with the results of
Booth and Chua (1996). However, their results are based on cross-sectional regressions that do not consider the
autocorrelation in either IPO volume or initial returns.


                                                        10
                                       Lowry & Schwert, IPO Market Cycles


observing such returns. Similar factors would cause initial returns to be negatively correlated with the

average registration time of subsequent IPOs. When average initial returns are high, companies have an

incentive to expedite the offering process, meaning that high (low) initial returns will be followed by

shorter (longer) registration times.

        Finally, we also examine whether filing, deferral, and withdrawal decisions forecast future initial

returns. Even though table 2 provides little evidence that the number of IPOs predicts subsequent initial

returns, the timing of the ultimate offering represents the outcome of several earlier decisions on the part

of the firm. It is possible that the behavior of firms in managing the speed of their IPOs through filing,

deferral, and withdrawal decisions could forecast future returns. For example, consider the information

spillover models of Booth and Chua (1996) and Benveniste, Busaba and Wilhelm (1999), that initial

returns compensate investors for the costly information-gathering process. When more companies go

public, the incremental costs of gathering information about each company are lower, meaning that initial

returns are lower. Thus, as more companies file IPOs and fewer companies cancel IPOs, the total costs of

learning about this class of companies is shared between a greater number of issues, meaning that the

initial returns of each will be lower. This suggests that higher numbers of filings and fewer withdrawals

will be associated with lower subsequent initial returns.

        Table 3 contains Granger F-tests from second order VAR models (similar to table 2) relating two

measures of initial returns (IR EW
                                t  and IR PW
                                          t  ) with past and future measures of IPO timing. NFIL is the

number of offerings filed per month. REGTIME PW
                                             t  is the average length of time in days between the

filing date and the offer date for all issues offered in month t. NWD* is the number of offers withdrawn

in month t, scaled by the number of issues filed in the prior four months.

        The statistical tests in table 3 (rows 1, 3, and 5) indicate that the positive relation between initial

returns and the number of IPOs is driven by the timing of firm filings, and possibly the timing of offer

withdrawals. Consistent with the evidence in figure 2, both equal-weighted and value-weighted average

monthly initial returns are significantly positively related to the number of subsequent IPO filings (F-tests



                                                      11
                                    Lowry & Schwert, IPO Market Cycles


have p-values of 0.000 and 0.003, respectively). Also, proceeds-weighted (but not equal-weighted) initial

returns are strongly related to future withdrawals (p-value = 0.008). Fewer companies withdraw offerings

following periods of high initial returns. Finally, although there is some evidence that equal-weighted

initial returns predict timing (p-value of 0.008 using IR PW
                                                          t  ), the coefficients of the VAR models (not

shown) are positive for lagged initial returns. This implies that high initial returns are associated with

longer registration times in future months, a result which seems inconsistent with the evidence that initial

returns represent good news for companies considering an IPO.

        The analysis of the various measures of IPO timing and future initial returns is shown in rows 2,

4, and 6 of table 3. There is no evidence of any significant relation between either IPO filings or IPO

registration time and subsequent initial returns. However, there is some evidence that withdrawals predict

equal-weighted initial returns (p-value of 0.009 using IR EW
                                                          t  ). Consistent with the information spillover

models, fewer withdrawals are associated with lower initial returns in future months. When more firms

go public (fewer firms withdraw offerings), initial returns are lower because investors’ incremental costs

of gathering information about each company are lower.

        In summary, the relation between initial returns and future IPO volume is driven by more

companies filing IPOs after periods of high initial returns and possibly by the likelihood of cancellation,

not by variation in the length of registration. Also, after looking in more detail at the IPO process, we

find some evidence of a relation between the frequency of issue cancellation and future initial returns.


5. The Information Content of Initial Returns


        The fact that more companies file to go public and fewer companies withdraw their offerings

after observing that recent IPOs have earned especially high initial returns suggests that initial returns

contain valuable information for private companies considering an IPO. This section, along with section

6, examines the pricing process of IPOs in more detail, in the hope of learning more about the information

content of initial returns.



                                                     12
                                     Lowry & Schwert, IPO Market Cycles


        Initial returns, by definition, equal the difference between the underwriters' valuation of the firm,

the offer price, and the secondary market's valuation. However, prior evidence shows that underwriters

do not fully incorporate all available information into the offer price. Initial returns represent some

information known ahead of time by the underwriter plus some incremental information provided by the

market. This section examines the entire IPO pricing process, beginning at the time the IPO is filed, in

the hope of identifying the various sources of information contained in initial returns. Section 6 employs

the results of this analysis to investigate which types of information private companies find most relevant

in their decisions of when to go public.

5.1 Overview of the IPO Pricing Process

        When a company files an IPO, it must file a prospectus containing a range of anticipated IPO

prices. During the registration period, the company and its underwriter go on a road show to market the

issue to institutional investors, and these investors have the opportunity to express interest in the offering.

If the investors accurately reveal their private information through these expressions of interest, then the

information exchange will contribute to a more accurate pricing of the new issue. However, these

investors can potentially benefit by not revealing positive information about a new issue, causing the offer

price to be set too low and enabling them (assuming they buy in at the offer price) to reap significant

gains. To protect themselves against this potential loss, Benveniste and Spindt (1989) hypothesize that

underwriters only partially incorporate positive information learned during the registration period into the

final offer price. This ensures the investors of some positive return as compensation for revealing their

private information, but also enables underwriters and the newly public company to share in the gains.

Consistent with this theory, Hanley (1993) finds a significant positive relation between a firm’s price

update and its initial return. Evidently, initial returns consist of some information known ahead of time,

as well as some incremental information provided by the secondary market.

        Loughran and Ritter (1999) note that Benveniste and Spindt’s model implies that underwriters

should only partially incorporate private information learned about firm value during the registration



                                                      13
                                     Lowry & Schwert, IPO Market Cycles


period, but that public information should be fully reflected in the offer price. However, Loughran and

Ritter find that there are strong positive correlations between the pre-offer market return and the price

update and also between the pre-offer market return and the initial IPO return, indicating that the price

adjustment to this publicly available information is only partial. In other words, the partial adjustment

phenomenon discussed by Benveniste and Spindt exists for observable public information, such as the

market return, even though their theory would not predict this.

        Finally, Beatty and Ritter (1986), Megginson and Weiss (1991), and Koh and Walter (1989),

among others, show that initial returns are significantly related to a variety of firm-specific characteristics,

many of which are known at the time the IPO is filed.

        In summary, prior evidence indicates that the initial return consists of information related to the

type of firm going public, private and public information learned during the registration period but not

fully incorporated into the offer price, and finally the new information that is provided by the secondary

market when the issue starts trading. This section considers these sources of information in more detail,

in the hope of discerning which information companies rely on most heavily in their decisions of when to

go public. Our finding of a significant positive relation between average initial returns and subsequent

IPO volume indicates that at least one of these information sources represents an important determinant of

the timing of firms’ IPOs.

5.2 Data on Individual IPOs and Sample Selection Bias

        To estimate the portion of initial returns that represents information known ahead of time, we

analyze the predictability of initial returns at the firm level. We use SDC and CRSP data from 1985-97 to

investigate these relations, and this section discusses these data. The empirical tests are found in sections

5.3 and 5.4.

        The variables we use include:

        (1)    IR, the Initial return, equals the percentage change between the offer price and the
               first closing price (previously described in section 2.1);
        (2)    RANK is the underwriter rank, from Carter, Dark, and Singh (1998);


                                                      14
                                      Lowry & Schwert, IPO Market Cycles


        (3)    TA equals the logarithm of real total assets before the IPO;
        (4)    NYSE equals one if the IPO is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and zero
               otherwise;
        (5)    NASDAQ equals one if the IPO is listed on the Nasdaq National Market System,
               and zero otherwise;
        (6)    AMEX equals one if the IPO is listed on the American Stock Exchange, and zero
               otherwise;
        (7)    TECH equals one if the firm is in a high tech industry [biotech, computer
               equipment, electronics, communications, and general technology (as defined by
               SDC)], and zero otherwise;
        (8)    VOL is the market-adjusted volatility of the IPO stock return, equal to the standard
               deviation of daily returns to the IPO stock in trading days 1 through 63 after the IPO
               (the first three months of secondary market trading) minus the standard deviation of
               daily returns to the CRSP equal-weighted market index during the same period;5
        (9)    ∆P is the percentage change between middle of the range of prices in the initial
               registration statement and the offer price;
        (10) ∆P+ equals ∆P when it is positive, and zero otherwise (to capture asymmetric effects
               of price updates);
        (11) MKT is the return to the CRSP equal-weighted portfolio of NYSE, Amex, and
               Nasdaq-listed stocks for the period between the initial filing date and the final offer
               date, and
        (12) MKT+ equals MKT when it is positive, and zero otherwise (again, to capture
               asymmetric effects).

5.3 Regression Models for Firm-level Initial Returns

        It is well known that the percent change between the offer price and the secondary market price

(the initial return) is large on average, but also highly variable across firms. Table 4 contains estimates of

regression models that explain this initial return,

        IRi = α + β1 RANKi + β2 TAi + β3 NYSEi + β4 NASDAQi + β5 AMEXi +

                 β6 TECHi + β7 VOLi + β8 ∆Pi + β9 ∆P i+ + β10 MKTi + β11 MKT i+ + εi,                      (1)


5
 As a robustness check, we also used a measure of market-adjusted volatility based on returns between 22 and 63
days after the IPO. The results were qualitatively similar, so they are not reported.


                                                      15
                                     Lowry & Schwert, IPO Market Cycles


where the variables have been defined above.

        The rank of the investment banker (RANK), the size of the IPO firm (TA), the exchange on

which the new issue will trade (NYSE, Nasdaq, or AMEX), and the firm’s industry (TECH) are known at

the time of the initial prospectus. The price update (∆P) is known at the time the IPO price is set, as is the

market return that occurred during the registration period (MKT). Only the after-market volatility of the

IPO stock returns (VOL) is not observable at the time the IPO is priced. This variable has often been

used to represent the risk of the IPO stock, and is generally presumed to be an unbiased estimate of

information that is available to investors (but not to econometricians) ex ante.

        The regression in column (1) of table 4 includes only independent variables that are known at the

time the IPO is filed, as well as VOL. We find that IPO firm assets, exchange listing, the technology

dummy, and volatility have significant power to explain the cross-sectional differences in the initial

return. Specifically, IPO firms that are larger, list on AMEX, are not technology firms, and have less

volatile returns after the offering have the least underpricing. Column (3) shows the same regression, but

only includes those independent variables with significant explanatory power.

        Column (5) adds two measures of price update; ∆P and ∆P+, to allow for asymmetry. We find

that the effect of the price update on initial returns is in fact asymmetric. A 10% increase in the IPO price

from the mid-point of the initial filing range predicts a 8.94% (0.207 + 0.687) higher initial return, while a

10% decrease in the IPO price predicts a 2.07% lower initial return. Thus, the initial return responds

more to positive price updates than to negative price updates. Investment bankers and issuing firms

incorporate negative information more fully into the offer price than positive information. This is

consistent with underwriters trying to avoid losses on overpriced issues while allowing informed investors

to share the gains on underpriced issues. Consistent with Hanley (1993), when we omit the variable that

measures the asymmetric effect of price updates, ∆P i+ , we obtain a significantly positive coefficient on

∆Pi (coefficient of 0.450 and a t-statistic of 20.70).




                                                         16
                                      Lowry & Schwert, IPO Market Cycles


        As discussed earlier, Benveniste and Spindt’s model says that underwriters have an incentive to

only partially incorporate private information learned during the filing or book-building period into the

final offer price. Also, Rock (1986) and Beatty and Ritter (1986), among others, posit that issues that are

subject to greater information asymmetry, such as issues by small firms and issues with lower-ranked

underwriters, will tend to be more underpriced. However, neither theory suggests that public information

about market conditions during the registration period should be predictably related to initial returns.

        Column (7) of table 4 contains estimates of eq. (1) that include the stock market return during the

registration period, MKT (and MKT+ to measure asymmetric effects of MKT, if any). Given the price

update, ∆P, and the firm and deal characteristics that are known at the time of the IPO, there is no

incremental effect of MKT and MKT+ on initial returns (t-statistics of 1.28 and –0.83). This is consistent

with the IPO price reflecting the public information about market conditions that became available during

the registration period.6

5.4 Sensitivity Analysis

        We conducted a variety of sensitivity analyses to check the robustness of our results. First, we

added return on assets to the initial return regressions to see whether prior operating performance affects

IPO pricing, but this was not significant and other results were essentially unchanged. Second, we used a

variety of different return measures to capture the effects of public information learned during the

registration period. For example, we estimated the regressions using CRSP value-weighted (instead of

equal-weighted) returns. In addition, we created three different portfolios of firms from our sample of

IPOs that had come public within the last year, and calculated the returns to these portfolios. The first

portfolio contained all of the firms available in the SDC sample. To incorporate the possibility that public

information differs across industries, the second portfolio included the subset of firms that were coded as



6
     However, Lowry and Schwert (2000) show that the relation between the price update and market returns during
the registration period is highly asymmetric, with substantial adjustments of the IPO price to decreases in market
prices, but only modest increases in IPO prices when market prices increase. This puzzling under reaction of IPO
prices to market prices was first noted by Loughran and Ritter (1999).


                                                       17
                                      Lowry & Schwert, IPO Market Cycles


technology firms by SDC, and the third contained the non-technology IPO stocks. Results using all these

alternative measures of public information were qualitatively similar.


6. IPO Cycles Controlling for the Characteristics of Issuing Firms


        In this section, we employ the results from table 4 to examine the sources of the serial correlation

in initial returns and of the positive relation between average initial returns and subsequent IPO volume.

First, we hope to shed light on the extent to which companies going public following periods of high

initial returns can themselves expect to be especially underpriced. The last section showed that initial

returns are predictably related to firm-specific characteristics and to information that is learned during the

registration period. Either of these factors could potentially induce serial correlation in the initial return

series, but neither implies that a company’s eventual underpricing will be predictably related to average

initial returns observed before the filing.

        We also examine the source of the information in average initial returns that leads companies to

file IPOs. The evidence in section 5 shows that initial returns are comprised of three parts: information

related to firm-specific characteristics, information that becomes available during the registration period,

but is only partially incorporated into the final offer price, and new information provided by the

secondary market. By investigating these three parts of the pricing process, we hope to learn what

information companies find to be most relevant in their decisions to file IPOs.

6.1 Autocorrelations of Initial returns

        The regressions in table 4 show that there are predictable relations between the characteristics of

IPO firms and the initial return. Thus, part of the autocorrelation in aggregate initial returns could be due

to cycles in the types of firms that choose to go public. If so, the autocorrelation in initial returns in table

1 could simply reflect patterns in the types of firms going public. Table 4 also showed that the initial

return was related to information learned during the registration period. Because the registration period




                                                      18
                                      Lowry & Schwert, IPO Market Cycles


averages two months, IPOs that are close to one another in calendar time will tend to have overlapping

registration periods. This could also contribute to the serial correlation of initial returns.

         We test these ideas by aggregating the predictions of initial returns that are implied by the cross-

sectional regression models in table 4 into expected components and the residuals into unexpected

components, where both are weighted by proceeds raised in the IPO. Table 5 shows the mean, median,

standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and 12 autocorrelations of the initial return, and its expected

and unexpected components from 1985-97.

         We use the predictions from column (3) in table 4 to represent the expected initial returns

(EF(IR)) for firms having IPOs in month t, conditional on information available at the time the IPO is filed

(information in the preliminary prospectus plus volatility as an estimate of firm risk). The unexpected

initial return, [IR – EF(IR)], is the proceeds-weighted residual or forecast error from the same table 4

regression and consists of information learned during the registration period plus the incremental

information provided by the secondary market when the firm starts trading.

         Looking at row 2 of table 5, the autocorrelations of expected initial returns at the time of the

filing, EF(IR), start around 0.30 and decay slowly. This indicates that at least part of the autocorrelation

in observed initial returns is attributable to the mix of firms going public. In addition, the first lag of the

unexpected initial return (row 3), [IR – EF(IR)], equals 0.33, indicating that information learned during

the registration period and/or biases in underwriter pricing also contribute to the serial correlation in

initial returns.

         To determine whether there do in fact exist biases in underwriter pricing, we again decompose

initial returns into expected and unexpected components, but this time we condition on all information

available at the time of the offer. Specifically, we use the predictions from column (5) in table 4 to

represent the initial returns conditional on all information in the preliminary prospectus, all information

learned during the registration period, and also volatility, EO(IR).          The corresponding measure of

unexpected initial returns, [IR – EO(IR)], consists only of the incremental information provided by the

secondary market when the firm starts trading. Note that if underwriters take into account all available

information when they set the offer prices of these IPOs, then these unexpected initial returns should not

be serially correlated.

        The last row of Table 5 shows that the autocorrelations of this measure of unexpected initial

returns, [IR – EO(IR)], are close to zero at all lags. This suggests that the cross-sectional models in

column (5) of table 4 capture all of the interesting dynamics in predicting initial returns. The finding that

[IR – EO(IR)] is uncorrelated through time shows that all of the serial correlation in initial returns can be

explained by the effects of firm characteristics and information learned during the registration period.

Evidently, firms and investment bankers take information about recent market conditions into account in

setting the expected IPO price of new offers being filed. The level of recent initial returns contains no

information about the expected underpricing of new IPOs being filed, meaning that a company can

neither gain nor lose by filing during a period of high versus low initial returns.

6.2 The Information Content of Initial Returns

        The results in table 5 provide strong evidence that the level of initial returns at the time a firm

files to go public contain no information about that IPO’s eventual underpricing. Thus, firms do not

appear to be at a disadvantage if they file an IPO during a period of high initial returns. We now consider

the factors that lead firms to prefer to file an IPO during such periods. This section seeks to identify more

precisely the source of the information contained in initial returns that leads so many companies to go

public following periods of high underpricing.

        Table 6 shows Granger F-tests from second order VAR models (similar to tables 2 and 3) relating

initial returns with past and future measures of both the number of IPOs filed per month (NFIL) and the

number of IPOs offered per month (NIPO). It also shows the relations between the expected and

unexpected components of initial returns, conditional on various information sets, with these measures of

IPO volume.

        We focus first on the relations between initial returns and subsequent IPO volume, in the hope of

understanding the sources of information that companies rely on as they decide when to go public. The



                                                      20
                                     Lowry & Schwert, IPO Market Cycles


first column shows F-tests for the VARs between actual IR and the subsequent NFIL and NIPO. As

previously shown in Tables 2 and 3, we find that both pricing measures are significantly positively related

to both measures of subsequent IPO volume. The second and third columns employ the results from the

previous section to decompose the initial return into expected and unexpected components, based on

various information sets, to determine more specifically the source of these relations.

        In rows 1 and 3 the expected initial return is conditional on the firm-specific information

contained in the preliminary prospectus, as well as volatility. Thus, the expected initial return contains

information about the types of companies going public, while the unexpected initial return incorporates

all of the information learned during the registration period plus the incremental information provided by

the secondary market. Results show that the expected initial return has little power to predict either NFIL

or NIPO (p-values of 0.114 and 0.077), while the unexpected initial return is a highly significant predictor

of both (p-values of 0.020 and 0.005). This suggests that the relevant information must be related to

either information learned during the registration period or to the incremental information provided by the

secondary market at the time of the offer, but not to the types of companies going public.

        Rows 5 and 7 provide support for the importance of information learned during the registration

period. Notably, when information learned during the registration period is included in the expected

initial return, the expected initial return is a significant predictor of future IPO volume (p-values of 0.011

and 0.005). However, the unexpected initial return is not significantly related to future IPO volume (p-

values of 0.574 and 0.063), indicating that companies do not rely on the incremental information provided

by the secondary market in their decisions of when to go public.

        The results in rows 1, 3, 5, and 7 indicate that private companies rely heavily on information

learned during the registration periods of recent IPOs in their decisions of when to go public. Neither the

types of firms that have recently gone public nor the incremental information provided by the secondary

market influences the filing or issuing decisions of other private firms.

        Finally, table 6 also shows the relations between NFIL and NIPO and subsequent (as opposed to

past) initial returns. Consistent with prior evidence, there is no evidence of any significant relation


                                                     21
                                     Lowry & Schwert, IPO Market Cycles


between IPO volume and future initial returns. This lack of any significant evidence also extends to the

expected and unexpected components of initial returns.


7.      Conclusion

        Our results show that the dynamic behavior of initial returns and IPO issues is a complicated

function of many factors.      First, there are significant biases in the expected offer prices listed in

preliminary prospectuses, in the sense that the difference between the expected offer price and the final

offer price is predictably related to publicly known firm- and offer-specific characteristics. Further, the

predictability of initial returns shows that underwriters only partially incorporate private information that

is learned during the registration period into the final offer price, but that public information is fully

incorporated.

        Despite all of the evidence on the predictability of initial returns, we find that investment bankers

do fully incorporate current market conditions into the final offer price. The average initial returns at the

time a company files an IPO contain no information about the extent to which that company will be

underpriced. Thus, there exists no evidence that companies can benefit by filing IPOs during periods of

low versus high average initial returns.

        The positive relation between average initial returns and subsequent IPO volume suggests that the

initial returns of recent IPOs contain information on the market’s valuation of future IPOs. Notably, it is

information learned during the registration period that is related to future IPO volume. The portions of

initial returns that reflect firm characteristics and information provided by the secondary market are not

reliably related to either the number of subsequent filings or the number of subsequent offerings.

        Thus, the apparent IPO cycles that have been studied previously reflect two factors. First, similar

types of firms choose to go public at about the same time. To the extent that this clustering is associated

with predictably different expected initial returns, there will be persistence in initial returns through time.

Second, and more important, the information about the value of an IPO firm that becomes available

during the registration period has an effect on the prices and offering decisions for other firms. Since the



                                                      22
                                     Lowry & Schwert, IPO Market Cycles


book-building period averages two months, but often lasts as long as four months, IPOs in subsequent

months have overlapping registration periods.         It is the length of time necessary to produce the

information reflected in the initial returns that causes monthly aggregate initial returns to be

autocorrelated and to be positively related to future levels of IPO activity.

        The remaining rows of the table use data from SDC for the 1985-97 period. The Securities Data Corporation (SDC) data includes the
number of IPOs per month (NIPOSDC), the number of offerings filed per month (NFIL), and the number of offerings withdrawn per month (NWD).
REGTIMEPW is the average length of time in registration, the number of days between the file and offer dates, weighted by proceeds raised in the
IPO. The average return to issues offered in a particular month, IRPW, is weighted by proceeds raised in the IPO. Finally, there is a measure of the
price update that occurs between the initial filing and the offer (i.e., the difference between the mid-point of the initial offer range and the final
IPO price). ∆PPW is the average price update for offers made in a particular month, weighted by proceeds raised in the IPO.

                    t   is the number of IPOs offered in the month. The t-statistics use White's (1980) heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors,
and the Granger F-tests for incremental predictability ("causality") are also corrected for heteroskedasticity. The F-tests indicate the incremental
explanatory power of the two lags of the predictor variable, given two lags of the dependent variable. R2 is the coefficient of determination, adjusted for
degrees of freedom. S(u) is the standard error of the regression.

         Granger F-tests for the incremental explanatory power of the two lags of the predictor variable,
given two lags of the dependent variable in VAR(2) models for initial returns and the measures of IPO
timing. IREW is the equal-weighted return to IPO investors in IPOs offered in the month from ISR. IRPW is
the proceeds-weighted return to IPO investors in IPOs offered in the month from SDC. REGTIMEPW is
the average length of time in registration, the number of days between the file and offer dates, weighted by
proceeds raised in the IPO, from SDC. NWD* is the number of offerings withdrawn per month divided
by the number of offers filed for the prior four months, also from SDC. The Granger F-tests are corrected
for heteroskedasticity.

                                                  Factors Related to IPO Returns, 1985-97
         Regression models for the returns to IPO investors in the U.S. using SDC data from 1985-97. RANK is the underwriter rank, from Carter
and Manaster (1990) and Carter, Dark, and Singh (1998). TA equals the logarithm of real total assets before IPO. NYSE equals one if the IPO
firm will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and zero otherwise. NASDAQ equals one if the IPO firm will be listed on the Nasdaq
National Market System, and zero otherwise. AMEX equals one if the IPO firm will be listed on the American Stock Exchange, and zero
otherwise. TECH equals one if the firm is in a high tech industry [biotech, computer equipment, electronics, communications, & general
technology (as defined by SDC)], and zero otherwise. VOL is the market-adjusted volatility of the IPO stock return, the log of the standard
deviation of daily returns to the IPO stock in the first 63 trading days after the IPO divided by the standard deviation of daily returns to the CRSP
equal-weighted market index of NYSE, Amex, and Nasdaq-listed stocks during the same period. ∆P is the percentage change between middle of
the range of prices in the initial registration statement and the offer price. ∆P+ equals ∆P when it is positive, and zero otherwise. MKT is the
return to the CRSP equal-weighted portfolio for the period between the filing date and the offering date for the IPO. MKT+ is the return to the
market MKT when it is positive, and zero otherwise. The t-statistics use White's (1980) heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors. R2 is the
coefficient of determination, adjusted for degrees of freedom. S(u) is the standard error of the regression. The sample size is 3,832 IPOs.

          The mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum of the initial return to IPO investors (IR). The initial returns are weighted
by proceeds raised in the IPO within each calendar month. Autocorrelations for 12 lags (ρ1 to ρ12), which have a large sample standard error of
0.08 under the hypothesis of no autocorrelation, are also shown.
          The measure of expected initial returns, based on column (3) in table 4, uses data known at the time the IPO is filed (from the preliminary
prospectus) as well as the after-market volatility of the IPO stock returns, where E[IR] is the expected initial return and IR - E[IR] is the unexpected
initial return.
          The measure of expected initial returns, based on column (5) in table 4, uses data known at the time the IPO is offered (including the price
update) as well as the after-market volatility of the IPO stock returns, where E[IR] is the expected initial return and IR - E[IR] is the unexpected
initial return.

         Granger F-tests for the incremental explanatory power of the two lags of the predictor variable, given
two lags of the dependent variable in VAR(2) models for initial IPO returns and the measures of IPO volume.
The return to IPO investors IR is the proceeds-weighted return to IPOs from SDC studied in table 5. The
columns labeled “Expected” represent VAR(2) models using the predicted initial return from the cross-sectional
regression models in table 4. Similarly, the columns labeled “Unexpected” represent VAR(2) models using the
forecast errors for the initial return from the cross-sectional regression models in table 4. For the IPO returns, two
forecasts are studied: first, using public information available at the time the IPO is filed [col. (3) in table 4], and
second, using public information available at the time of the IPO [col. (5) in table 4]. The Granger F-tests are
corrected for heteroskedasticity.
