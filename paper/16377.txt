Managing Credit Booms and Busts: A Pigouvian Taxation Approach

JEL No. E44,G38

                                           ABSTRACT

We study a dynamic model in which the interaction between debt accumulation and asset prices magnifies
credit booms and busts. We find that borrowers do not internalize these feedback effects and therefore
suffer from excessively large booms and busts in both credit flows and asset prices. We show that
a Pigouvian tax on borrowing may induce borrowers to internalize these externalities and increase
welfare. We calibrate the model by reference to (i) the US small and medium-sized enterprise sector
and (ii) the household sector, and find the optimal tax to be countercyclical in both cases, dropping
to zero in busts and rising to approximately half a percentage point of the amount of debt outstanding
during booms.

1     Introduction
The interaction between debt accumulation and asset prices contributes to
magnify the impact of booms and busts. Increases in borrowing and in
collateral prices feed each other during booms. In busts, the feedback turns
negative, with credit constraints leading to fire sales of assets and further
tightening of credit. It has been suggested that prudential policies could
be used to mitigate the build-up in systemic vulnerability during the boom.
However, there are few formal welfare analyses of the optimal policies to deal
with booms and busts in credit and asset prices.
    This paper makes a step toward filling this gap with a dynamic optimizing
model of collateralized borrowing. We consider a group of individuals (the
insiders) who enjoy a comparative advantage in holding an asset and who can
use this asset as collateral on their borrowing from outsiders. The borrowing
capacity of insiders is therefore increasing in the price of the asset. The price
of the asset, in turn, is driven by the insiders’ consumption and borrowing
capacity. This introduces a mutual feedback loop between asset prices and
credit flows: small financial shocks to insiders can lead to large simultaneous
booms or busts in asset prices and credit flows.
    The model attempts to capture, in a stylized way, a number of economic
settings in which the systemic interaction between credit and asset prices may
be important. The insiders could be interpreted as a group of entrepreneurs
who have more expertise than outsiders to operate a productive asset, or as
households putting a premium on owning durable consumer assets or their
homes. Alternatively, insiders could represent a group of investors who enjoy
an advantage in dealing with a certain class of financial assets, for example
because of superior information or superior risk management skills. One
advantage of studying these situations with a common framework is to bring
out the commonality of the problems and of the required policy responses—
although, in the real world, those policies pertain to different areas such as
financial regulation, or individual and corporate taxation.
    One of our main results is that the asset-debt loop entails systemic exter-
nalities that lead borrowers to undervalue the benefits of conserving liquidity
as a precaution against busts. A borrower who has one more dollar of liquid
net worth when the economy experiences a bust relaxes not only his private
borrowing constraint but also the borrowing constraints of all other insiders.
Not internalizing this spillover effect, the insider takes on too much debt
during good times. We find that it would be optimal to impose a cyclical tax

                                       2
on borrowing by leveraged insiders to prevent them from taking on socially
excessive debt.
    It is important that the level of the tax on a given sector be adjusted to
its vulnerability to credit and asset price busts. In a benchmark calibration
of our model to the US small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector, we
find that the optimal tax converges to 0.56 percent of the amount of debt
outstanding over the course of a boom, and drops to zero when a bust occurs.
Borrowing by the US household sector is subject to externalities of similar
magnitude (0.48 percent in booms). By contrast, US Flow of Funds data over
the past decade suggest that large corporations who have access to corporate
bond markets were less subject to systemic externalities and did not require
macro-prudential measures.
    We study four extensions of the basic model and find that its essential
properties are preserved. First, we change the nature of the shock by as-
suming that it affects the availability of credit rather than the income of
insiders. Then we look at the case where insiders can issue long-term debt or
equity. All three of these extensions change some features of the boom-bust
cycle equilibrium, but it remains true that the constrained optimum can be
achieved by a countercyclical tax on debt, and this tax is of the same order
of magnitude as in the benchmark model. Finally, we compare ex ante pru-
dential taxation to ex post interventions that provide funds to constrained
borrowers in a bust. We find that a bailout insurance fund that accumulates
resources in good times and transfers them to debtors in a bust does not in-
crease welfare (unless the resources are levied through the optimal Pigouvian
tax).
    Our model is related to the positive study of financial accelerator effects in
closed and open economy macroeconomics. In closed-economy DSGE mod-
els, Carlstrom and Fuerst (1997) and Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1999)
show that financial frictions amplify the response of an economy to funda-
mental shocks. However, models in this literature are traditionally solved
by linearization, making them more appropriate to analyze regular business
cycle fluctuations than systemic crises. In the open economy literature, Men-
doza (2005) and Mendoza and Smith (2006), among others, have studied the
non-linear dynamics arising from financial accelerator effects during sudden
stops in emerging market economies. Mendoza (2010) focuses on the positive
implications of such dynamics in a framework with asset prices.
    Benigno et al (2009) and Bianchi (2009) characterize welfare-maximizing
policies in such models. Their papers focus on the role of exchange rate

                                        3
depreciations in emerging market crises and find an externality that involves
the real exchange rate rather than the price of a domestic asset. By contrast,
our model does not have an exchange rate and attempts to capture the
essence of the problem in a generic setting involving asset price deflation.
Bianchi and Mendoza (2010) analyze a similar externality mechanism for the
aggregate US economy but focus on the implications of credit constraints
on labor demand, whereas we emphasize the necessity to differentiate policy
measures by the vulnerability of each sector in the economy.
    Our paper is also related to analyses of the ongoing world-wide credit cri-
sis that emphasize the amplifying mechanisms involving asset price deflation
and deleveraging in the financial sector (e.g., Adrian and Shin, 2009; Brun-
nermeier, 2009). Some earlier contributions have clarified the externalities
involved in credit booms and busts and drawn some implications for policy
in the context of stylized two- or three-period models (Caballero and Krish-
namurthy, 2003; Lorenzoni, 2008; Korinek, 2009, 2010; Jeanne and Korinek,
2010). By contrast, this paper gives a more realistic and quantitative fla-
vor to the analysis, by considering an infinite-horizon model. This allows us
to study macroprudential policies over booms and busts and is particularly
relevant for determining the optimal magnitude of regulatory measures in
practice.
    Finally, our paper presents a numerical solution method for DSGE models
with occasionally binding endogenous constraints that extends the endoge-
nous gridpoints method of Carroll (2006). This method allows us to solve
such models in an efficient way and may enable researchers to analyze more
complex models than what has been computationally feasible in the existing
DSGE literature with endogenous constraints, ultimately producing policy
guidance on richer and more realistic models of the economy.
    The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the assump-
tions of the model. Section 3 compares the laissez-faire equilibrium with a
social planner. Section 4 presents a calibration of our model and explores its
quantitative implications. Section 5 discusses extensions of the benchmark
model, and section 6 concludes.


2    The model
We consider a group of identical atomistic individuals in infinite discrete
time t = 0, 1, 2, .... The individuals are indexed by i ∈ [0, 1]. The utility of


                                       4
individual i at time t is given by,
                                           +∞
                                                                 !
                                                     s−t
                                           X
                             Ui,t = Et           β         u(ci,s ) ,                  (1)
                                           s=t

where u(·) is strictly concave and satisfies the Inada conditions. We will
generally assume that utility has constant relative risk aversion,

                                                 c1−γ
                                      u(c) =          .
                                                 1−γ
    These individuals (the insiders) receive two kinds of income, the payoff
of an asset that can serve as collateral, and an endowment income. Insider i
maximizes his utility under the budget constraint
                                wi,t+1
           ci,t + ai,t+1 pt +          = (1 − α)yt + ai,t (pt + αyt ) + wi,t ,         (2)
                                 R
where ai,t is the insider’s holdings of the collateral asset at the beginning
of period t and pt is its price; wi,t is the individual’s wealth at the start of
period t; yt is total income in period t (the same for all individuals) and αyt
is the share of that income that comes from the asset. For example, if the
collateral asset were productive capital used in a Cobb-Douglas production
function, and labor were provided by outsiders, α would be the exponent of
capital in the production function. Wealth is invested with outside investors
who have an indefinite demand/supply for risk-free bonds at the safe interest
rate r = R − 1. Wealth may be negative, in which case insiders sell debt to
outside investors.
    Total income yt follows a stochastic process which, for the sake of simplic-
ity, we will assume to be identically and independently distributed, although
it would be straightforward to extend the analysis to the case where it is
Markov.1 Assuming an i.i.d. process for yt is not too restrictive given that,
in the calibration, we will consider shocks that represent rare crises rather
than business cycle fluctuations.2
    The collateral asset is not reproducible and the available stock of asset is
normalized to 1. The asset can be exchanged between insiders in a perfectly
   1
     The only difference, in the Markov case, is that the policy functions will also depend
on the current level of y in addition to the level of wealth w.
   2
     We could also introduce growth into the model. The model with growth, once de-
trended, would be isomorphic to the model presented here.


                                             5
competitive market, but cannot be sold to outsiders: ai,t must be equal to 1
in a symmetric equilibrium where all insiders behave in the same way. We
do not allow insiders to sell the asset to outsiders and rent it back because
insiders derive benefits from the control rights that ownership provides. This
restriction could be relaxed to some extent, but we need a restriction of this
form for insiders to issue collateralized debt.
    Furthermore, we assume that the only financial instrument that can be
traded between insiders and outsiders is uncontingent one period debt. This
assumption can be justified e.g. on the basis that shocks to the insider sec-
tor are not verifiable and cannot be used to condition payments, and that
short-term debt provides insiders with adequate incentives. This feature cor-
responds to common practice across a wide range of financial relationships.3
    After rolling over his debt in period t, we assume that the representative
insider faces a moral hazard problem: he has the option to invest in a scam
that allows him to remove his future asset and endowment income from the
reach of his current creditors. This would allow him to default on his debts
next period without facing a penalty.
    We assume that outsiders cannot coordinate to punish the agent by ex-
cluding him from borrowing in future periods. However, they can observe the
scam in the current period and take the insider to court before the scam is
completed. If they do so, they can seize a quantity of good ψ plus a fraction
φ < 1 of the insider’s asset, where the inequality captures imperfect legal
enforcement. Since the asset cannot be held by outsiders, they re-sell them
to other insiders at the prevailing market price pt . This implies the following
incentive compatibility constraint for insiders to refrain from the scam:
                                wi,t+1
                                       + ψ + φpt ≥ 0.                                 (3)
                                 R
This constraint is similar to that in Kiyotaki and Moore (1997). The value of
the collateral asset determines how much debt insiders are able to roll over.
We assume that subject to this constraint, debt issued in period t is repaid
with certainty in period t + 1.
    Constraint (3) could be specified in different ways. For example, it could
involve a fraction of the collateral asset held by the borrower at the beginning
or the end of the period, or be a nonlinear increasing function of pt . The only
   3
    More generally, the findings of Korinek (2010) suggest that our results on excessive
exposure to binding constraints would continue to hold when insiders have access to costly
state-contingent financial contracts.


                                            6
important assumption, to obtain the debt-asset deflation mechanism at the
core of the model, is that the credit constraint depends on the current-period
market price of the asset, pt .4


3     Laissez-faire vs. Social Planner
We characterize the symmetric laissez-faire equilibrium and compare it to
the social planner solution. First, we derive the equilibrium conditions (sec-
tion 3.1). We then present some considerations on equilibrium multiplicity
and the possibility of self-fulfilling asset price and debt busts (section 3.2).
Finally, section 3.3 focuses on the case where saving is determined by a social
planner.

3.1     Equilibrium conditions under laissez-faire
We derive in the appendix the first-order conditions for the optimization
problem of an insider i. We then use the fact that in a symmetric equilibrium,
all individuals are identical and hold one unit of collateral asset (∀i, t ai,t =
1). Variables without the subscript i refer to the representative insider (or
equivalently, to aggregate levels, since the mass of insiders is normalized to
1). This gives the following two conditions

                            u0 (ct ) = λt + βREt [u0 (ct+1 )] ,                        (4)

                                  Et [u0 (ct+1 )(αyt+1 + pt+1 )]
                         pt = β                                  ,                     (5)
                                               u0 (ct )
    4
      In our simple setup of an endowment economy, financial amplification dynamics do
not arise if the constraint depends solely on future asset prices: an exogenous tightening
of the constraint would reduce borrowing today and lead to increased future wealth and
higher future consumption, which raises the level of future asset prices, thereby relaxing
the constraint, leading to financial deceleration. In a model such as Kiyotaki and Moore
(1997) that includes investment in capital and a complementary asset in fixed supply
(land), financial amplification also arises with a constraint involving future asset prices
φai,t+1 pt+1 : an exogenous tightening of the constraint would reduce current capital in-
vestment, making complementary land less valuable in the future and therefore reducing
its price, which in turn tightens the constraint further. However, adding investment as
an additional endogenous state variable to our nonlinear stochastic model setup would
increase the computational burden by an order of magnitude.



                                             7
where λt is the costate variable for the borrowing constraint. The first equa-
tion is the Euler condition and the second one is the standard asset pricing
equation.
    The equilibrium is characterized by a set of functions mapping the state
of the economy into the endogenous variables. Given that yt is i.i.d., we
can summarize the state by one variable, the beginning-of-period liquid net
wealth excluding the value of the collateral asset,

                                   mt ≡ yt + wt .

We do not include the asset in the definition of net wealth because its price, pt ,
is an endogenous variable. In a symmetric equilibrium the budget constraint
(2) simplifies to
                                  wt+1
                             ct +       = yt + wt ,                           (6)
                                    R
and the collateral constraint (3) can be written, in aggregate form,

                               ct ≤ mt + ψ + φpt .                                  (7)

   The equilibrium, thus, is characterized by three non-negative functions,
c(m), p(m) and λ(m) such that
                                            h                     i−1/γ 
                                                             0 −γ
            c(m) = min m + ψ + φp(m), βRE c(m )                                ,    (8)
                                                            
                      λ(m) = c(m)−γ − βRE c(m0 )−γ ,                                (9)
                               h                         i
                  p(m) = βE c(m0 )−γ (αy 0 + p(m0 )) c(m)γ ,                       (10)
where next-period values are denoted with primes. The transition equation
for net wealth is
                         m0 = y 0 + R (m − c(m)) .                   (11)

3.2    Multiple equilibria
Many papers, in the dynamic optimization literature on consumption and
saving, compute the equilibrium policy functions by iterating on the first-
order conditions, under the assumption that this method converges towards




                                         8
policy functions that exist and are unique.5 However, we cannot make such an
assumption here as our model generically gives rise to equilibrium multiplic-
ity. We give in this section a heuristic account of the mechanism underlying
multiplicity and of the conditions that ensure uniqueness.6
    The multiplicity comes from the self-reinforcing loop that links consump-
tion to the price of the collateral. In the constrained regime, a fall in the price
of the collateral asset decreases the insiders’ level of consumption, which in
turn tends to depress the price of the asset. This loop, which is essential for
our results since it explains the financial magnification of real shocks, may
also—if its effect is strong enough—lead to self-fulfilling crashes in the price
of the asset.
    More formally, the loop linking consumption to the asset price is captured
by equations (5) and (7). Assuming that the policy functions c(m), p(m) and
λ(m) apply in the following period, equation (5) implicitly defines the asset
price as a function of the state and of current consumption,

                     p̂(m, c) = βE [u0 (c(m0 ))(αy 0 + p(m0 ))] cγ ,                  (12)

where the expectation is taken conditional on m and c, with m0 = y 0 +
R (m − c). The credit constraint (7) can then be written

                                c ≤ m + ψ + φp̂(m, c).                                (13)

    The right-hand side of (13) is increasing in c because the credit constraint
on each individual is relaxed by a higher level of aggregate consumption that
raises the price of the asset.7 Multiplicity may arise if the left-hand side and
the right-hand side of (13) intersect for more than one level of c.
    We further explore the multiplicity of equilibria in the remainder of this
section by considering a special case of the model that can be solved (almost
   5
     See Zeldes (1989) for an early example. Stokey et al (1989) present several fixed-
point theorems guaranteeing that the equilibrium exists, is unique, and can be obtained
by iterating on the problem’s first-order conditions. However, the models considered in
most of the literature (including Zeldes’) do not satisfy the conditions under which those
theorems are applicable—see the discussion in Carroll (2008).
   6
     We are not aware of papers giving general conditions under which the equilibrium is
unique in models of the type considered here (i.e., extensions of Carroll’s (2008) analysis
to the case with endogenous credit constaints).
   7
     This is captured by the factor cγ on the r.h.s. of (12). However, because of the other
terms in m0 , the sign of the variations of p̂ with c is a priori ambiguous.

completely) in closed form: the case where y is constant and βR = 1. We
summarize the main results below (the details can be found in the appendix).
   We derive the equilibrium for t = 1, 2... starting from an initial level of
wealth m1 . It is easy to show that from period 2 onwards, the economy is in
an unconstrained steady state in which the price of the asset is given by
                                                αy
                                      punc =       .                                (14)

Figure 1 illustrates the case with multiple equilibria by showing the varia-
tions of both sides of (13) with c1 . The unconstrained equilibrium (point A)
coexists with a constrained equilibrium featuring lower levels for consump-
tion and the asset price (point C).8 The multiplicity comes from the fact
that the slope of the r.h.s. of (13) is larger than 1 over some range. Then
a one-dollar fall in aggregate consumption tightens the credit constraint by
more than one dollar for each individual, allowing a self-fulfilling downward
spiral in consumption and the price of the asset.
    As shown in the appendix, the equilibrium is unique if and only if φ is
small enough,

For the parameter values used to construct Figure 1, for example, equilibrium
uniqueness is ensured by taking φ ≤ 0.089. A small φ contains the strength of
the amplification effects below the level where it leads to multiple equilibria.
    Equilibrium multiplicity, as we will show in section 4.2, is likely to be
relevant for highly-leveraged institutions in the financial sector. However, it

    The figure was constructed by giving parameters R, γ, α, and ψ the same values as in
our benchmark calibration (given in Table 1). In addition we took y = 1, m1 = −1.3 and
φ = 0.2. There is one more intersection (point B) between A and C. However, point B
corresponds to an unstable equilibrium in the sense that a one dollar change in aggregate
consumption changes the maximum level of individual consumption by more than one
dollar, so that the economy would tip toward points A or C following a small perturbation
in consumption.

   Figure 1: L.h.s. and r.h.s. of equation (13) (y constant and βR = 1)

raises a number of issues (in particular, how the equilibrium is selected) that
we prefer to leave aside for now. We will thus ensure that the equilibrium is
unique by assuming sufficiently low values of φ.

3.3    Social planner
We assume that the social planner of the economy determines the amount of
insiders’ borrowing, but does not directly interfere in asset markets—that is,
the social planner takes as given that insiders trade the collateralizable asset
at a price that is determined by their private optimality condition (5). The
social optimum differs from the laissez-faire equilibrium because the social
planner internalizes that future asset prices and insiders’ borrowing capacity
depend on the aggregate level of debt accumulated by insiders. A possible
motivation for this setup is that decentralized agents are better than the
planner at observing the fundamental payoffs of financial assets, while only
the social planner has the capacity of internalizing the costs of debt deflation
dynamics that may arise from high levels of debt.


                                                   11
    In period t, the social planner chooses the wealth level of the representa-
tive insider, wt+1 , before the asset market opens at time t. The asset market
remains perfectly competitive, i.e., individual market participants optimize
on at+1 subject to their budget constraints. We look for time-consistent equi-
libria in which the social planner optimizes on wt+1 taking the future policy
functions c(m) and p(m) as given. (Although we do not change the notation,
those policy functions are not the same as in the laissez-faire equilibrium.)
    Through savings, the social planner determines the price of the asset,
which at time t is given by

                           pt = p̂(mt , mt − wt+1 /R)

where the function p̂(·, ·) is given by equation (12).
   Since insiders are still subject to the collateral constraint (3), the social
planner sets w0 subject to

                       w0
                          + ψ + φp̂ (m, m − w0 /R) ≥ 0.                     (17)
                       R
If φ is small enough to avoid multiple equilibria (as we have assumed), the
left-hand side increases with w0 , so that this inequality determines a lower
bound on aggregate wealth (i.e., an upper bound on aggregate debt). Then
the social planner’s credit constraint can be rewritten in reduced form,

                             w0
                                + ψ + φp̄(m) ≥ 0,                           (18)
                             R
where p̄(m) is the level of p (m, m − w0 /R) for which (17) is an equality. Note
that by definition, we have p̄(m) = p(m) for all the levels of m in which the
social planner’s constraint is binding.
    The social planner solves the same optimization problem as decentral-
ized agents, except that he takes at = 1 as given in the aggregate budget
constraint, and that his credit constraint is given by (18). As shown in the
appendix, the social planner’s Euler equation is,

               u0 (ct ) = λt + βREt (u0 (ct+1 ) + λt+1 φp0 (mt+1 )) .       (19)

By comparing (4) and (19) and noting that p0 (mt+1 ) > 0, one can see that
the social planner raises saving above the laissez-faire level if there is a risk
of binding financial constraints next period Et λt+1 > 0. The planner’s wedge

                                        12
is proportional to the expected product of the shadow cost of the credit
constraint times the derivative of the debt ceiling with respect to wealth. This
reflects that the social planner internalizes the endogeneity of next period’s
asset price and credit constraint to this period’s aggregate saving.
    With the social planner, precautionary savings is augmented by a sys-
temic component—the social planner implements a policy of macro-prudential
saving. This does not come from the fact that the central planner estimates
risks better than individuals. Decentralized agents are aware of the risk of
credit crunch and maintain a certain amount of precautionary saving (they
issue less debt than if this risk were absent). But they do not internalize
the contribution of their precautionary savings to reducing the systemic risk
coming from the debt-asset deflation spiral.
    The social planner’s Euler equation also provides guidance for how the
socially optimal equilibrium can be implemented via taxes on borrowing. De-
centralized agents undervalue the social cost of debt by the term φEt [λt+1 p0 (mt+1 )]
on the right-hand side of the social planner’s Euler equation (19), which de-
pends on the level of wealth mt . The planner’s equilibrium can be imple-
mented by a Pigouvian tax τt = τ (mt ) on borrowing that is rebated as a
lump sum transfer Tt = −τt wt+1 /R:
                                          wt+1
                       ct = y t + w t −        (1 − τt ) + Tt .              (20)
                                           R
The tax introduces a wedge in the insiders’ Euler equation,

                    (1 − τt ) u0 (ct ) = λt + βREt [u0 (ct+1 )] ,

and replicates the constrained social optimum if it is set to

                                    φβREt [λt+1 p0 (mt+1 )]
                        τ (mt ) =                           ,                (21)
                                           u0 (ct )

where all variables are evaluated at the social optimum.
   The tax raises saving only if the economy is unconstrained under the
social planner so that consumption allocations are determined by the Euler
equation of insiders. If the economy is constrained, consumption and saving
are determined by the binding constraint. As a result, the social planner
equilibrium is unchanged if we lower τ (m) to zero in constrained states m
where λ(m) > 0.


                                          13
4          Quantitative Exploration
We now turn the attention to the quantitative implications of the model.
Sections 4.1 and 4.2 respectively present our numerical resolution method and
our calibration. Section 4.3 discusses the results of a numerical simulation
with booms and busts in the asset price and in credit flows. The last section
presents some sensitivity analysis.

4.1          Numerical resolution
In order to generate a persistent motive for borrowing, we need to assume
that insiders are impatient relative to outsiders, i.e.,9

                                           βR < 1.

   We can make conjectures about the form of the solution by analogy with
the deterministic case studied in the previous section. We consider equilibria
that are unique and in which the consumption function m 7→ c(m) is a
continuously increasing function of wealth. Let us denote by m the level of
wealth for which consumption is equal to zero,

                                          c(m) = 0.

By analogy with the deterministic case, we would expect the insiders to be
credit-constrained in a wealth interval m ∈ [m, m], and to be unconstrained
for m ≥ m. It is not difficult to see that the lower threshold must be equal
to
                                   m = −ψ.
This results from the facts that c(m) ≤ m + ψ + φp, and that p converges
to zero as c goes to zero (by equation (5)). Since m = y + w must be larger
than −ψ and the level of w is set before the realization of y, we must also
have
                             w + ψ + min y ≥ 0.
The upper threshold, m, above which insiders are unconstrained must be
determined numerically.
     9
         With trend growth at a growth factor G, we could allow βR ≥ 1 as long as βRG1−γ <
1.



                                              14
    The numerical resolution method is an extension of the endogenous grid
points method of Carroll (2006) to the case where the credit constraint is en-
dogenous. The procedure performs backwards time iteration on the agent’s
optimality conditions. We define a grid w for next period wealth levels w0
and combine the next period policy functions with agent’s optimality condi-
tions to obtain current period policy functions until the resulting functions
converge. The difference with Carroll (2006) is that the threshold level at
which the borrowing constraint becomes binding is endogenous. This implies
that the minimum level of wealth is itself a function of the state, which is
obtained by iterating on the asset pricing equation (10). The details of the
numerical resolution method are provided in the appendix.

4.2    Calibration
We assume that the process for income is binomial: total income is high
(equal to yH ) with probability 1 − π, or low (equal to yL ) with probability π.
The high state is the normal state that prevails most of the time, whereas the
realization of the low state is associated with a bust in the asset price and in
credit, which occurs infrequently. Thus, we calibrate our model by reference
to rare and large events rather than real business cycle fluctuations. We will
assume that a bust occurs once every twenty years on average.
    Our benchmark calibration is reported in Table 1. The riskless real in-
terest rate is set to 3 percent. The discount factor is set to 0.96, a value that
is low enough to induce the insiders to borrow and expose themselves to the
risk of a credit crunch. The risk aversion parameter is equal to 2, a standard
value in the literature.


                    Table 1. Benchmark calibration
             β      R   γ α      yL  yH    π     φ               ψ

    The other parameters have been calibrated by reference to the experi-
ence of the US small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in 2008-09. We have
also looked at other US sectors (the household sector and the nonfinancial
corporate sector) in order to obtain plausible ranges of variation for the pa-
rameters. We discuss the case of the US financial sector at the end of this
section.

                                       15
    The relevant data for the US nonfinancial sectors are shown in Table 2.10
For each sector we report the change in the value of assets and the change
in debt during a one-year time window centered on the peak of the crisis
(the fall of 2008). For households and SMEs we observe that the value of
assets and debt both fall, consistent with the model. Corporations also had
a fall in asset value but they were able to slightly increase their outstanding
debt by issuing larger amounts of corporate bonds, in spite of a contraction
in bank lending. The difference between SMEs and the corporate business
sector, thus, is consistent with the notion that the former are more vulnerable
than the latter to a credit crunch because they are more dependent on bank
lending.

    Table 3 shows our calibration of α, φ, ψ, and yL for the three sectors cov-
ered by Table 2 except US corporations. We do not include the US corporate
sector because, as mentioned above, its outstanding debt did not fall during
the crisis.
    The share of the asset in income, α, was inferred from the ratio of the
asset price to total income. Abstracting from the risk of bust, the price of

     The source is the Federal Reserve’s Flow of Funds database. The data for Households,
SMEs and Corporations respectively come from Table B.100 (Households and Nonprofit
Organizations), Table B.102 (Nonfarm Nonfinancial Corporate Business) and Table B.103
(Nonfarm Noncorporate Business). The nonfarm noncorporate business sector comprises
partnerships and limited liability companies, sole proprietorships and individuals who
receive rental income. This sector is often thought to be composed of small firms, although
some of the partnerships included in the sector are large companies. More importantly
for our purpose, firms in the nonfarm noncorporate business sector generally do not have
access to capital markets and, to a great extent, rely for their funding on loans from
commercial banks and other credit providers and on trade credit from other firms.

The ratio p/y was proxied by taking the ratio of households’ asset holdings
to national income in the case of households, and the ratio of assets to value
added in the case of SMEs.12 Note that at 20 percent, our estimate of the
share of capital in SMEs’ value added is smaller than the share of capital
income in total GDP (or the value for the exponent of capital that is usually
assumed when calibrating a Cobb-Douglas production function), which is
closer to 0.3. This may reflect the fact that SMEs are less capital intensive
than large corporations, or that a larger share of labor income goes to self-
employed entrepreneurs.

   The two parameters in the collateral constraint, ψ and φ, were calibrated
using the information in Table 2.13 The value of φ was estimated by dividing
the fall in debt by the fall in asset value between the second quarter of 2008
and the second quarter of 2009.14 Abstracting again from the risk of a bust,

closely approximated by this formula.

     Although it would not be difficult to adjust those numbers for inflation, this would
not change the results if we used the same deflator for assets and liabilities. In addition,
the inflation rate was relatively low during this period.
  14
     The resulting values for φ are rather low. We investigate an alternative explanation
for this ratio based on a model of long-term debt in section 5.2.

sectors. We then applied formula (23) using the values of α and φ derived
before and y = 1.
     Finally, income was normalized to 1 in the high state and yL was cali-
brated so as to reproduce the fall in asset value observed in the data in the
event of a bust (Table 2).15
     We also considered the relevant parameter values for the US financial
sector. Unfortunately, the US Flow of Funds do not report the same bal-
ance sheet data for the financial sector as for households or the nonfinancial
business sectors. The evidence presented by Adrian and Shin (2009) and
Brunnermeier (2009) suggests however that φ is much higher in the financial
sector than in the rest of the economy. Those authors show that the debt
d of highly-leveraged institutions had short maturity and satisfied a margin
requirement d ≤ (1 − µ)p where p is the market value of the institution’s
financial assets and µ is the ”margin,” i.e., the fraction of asset holdings that
is financed by the net worth of the institution. In the financial sector, this
margin often amounts to just a few percentage points. Note that the margin
requirement can also be expressed in the form of our collateral constraint
(3), with ψ = 0 and φ = 1 − µ. If φ is close to 1, our model yields multiple
equilibria.16 This points to the ”high-φ” case as perhaps the most relevant
one if one wanted to apply our model to the financial sector. This is an in-
teresting direction for future research but we focus here on the ”low-φ” case,
which ensures equilibrium uniqueness and makes the model more applicable
to the real sector.

4.3     Results
Figure 2 shows the policy functions c(m), p(m) and λ(m) in the laissez-faire
equilibrium, for the benchmark calibration in Table 1, which represents the
SME sector. The equilibrium is unconstrained if and only if wealth is larger
  15
      The price of real estate is determined, in our model, by yt , which could be interpreted
as rental income or as the nonpecuniary utility of home ownership. The latter is not
observable and the former did not fall by enough in the recent crisis to explain a 30
percent fall in real estate prices. The recent boom-bust in US real estate may have been
to some extent the result of a bubble, which our model does not capture as it does not
entail any deviation of the asset price from its fundamental value (conditional on the
frictions).
   16
      Multiple equilibria would perhaps not be a problem in normal times when the financial
assets are liquid and can be sold at no or little discount to outsiders, but multiplicity would
arise when financial assets loose their liquidity.

than m = −1.26. In the unconstrained region, consumption, saving and the
price of the asset are all increasing with wealth. Higher wealth raises current
consumption relative to future consumption, which bids up the price of the
asset.
    The levels of consumption and of the asset price vary more steeply with
wealth in the constrained region than in the unconstrained region, reflecting
the collateral multiplier. Both consumption and the asset price fall to zero
when wealth is equal to −ψ = −1.97. By contrast, saving w0 decreases with
wealth in the constrained region. Higher wealth is associated with an increase
in the price of collateral, which relaxes the borrowing constraint on insiders
and allows them to roll over larger debts.
    Figure 3 shows how saving depends on the level of wealth, w0 (w), for the
two states y = yL , yH . One can obtain the curve for the low state by shifting
the curve for the high state to the right by ∆y = yH −yL . The curves intersect
the 45o line in two points, AH and AL , which determine the steady state
levels of wealth conditional on remaining in each state, respectively denoted
      SS
by wH    and wLSS . We observe that both AH and AL are on the downward-
sloping branches of each curve, which means that insiders borrow to the point
where they are financially constrained in both states. Furthermore, insiders

tend to borrow more in the high steady state than in the low steady state
   SS
(wH   < wLSS ), which they can do because the price of the collateral asset is
higher.
    Figure 3 also shows the dynamics of the economy when the steady state
is disturbed by a one-period fall in y. At the time of the shock, the econ-
omy jumps up from point AH to point B, as insiders are forced to reduce
their debts by the fall in the price of collateral.17 The dynamics are then
determined by the saving function in the high state (since we have assumed
that the low state lasts only one period). The economy converges back to
point AH . As it approaches AH , wealth follows oscillations of decreasing
amplitude. There are oscillations because saving is decreasing with wealth in
the constrained regime. There is convergence because the slope of the saving
curve is larger than −1 in point AH for our benchmark calibration. This is
not true for any calibration and the equilibrium can exhibit cyclic or chaotic
dynamics if φ is larger.

ative to laissez-faire (solid line). The social planner saves more, implying

    The price of the collateral asset falls by 12.3 percent, from 4.81 to 4.22. Thus the
borrowing ceiling falls by φ · 0.59 ≈ 0.03, which is the distance between AH and B.

that the economy has a higher level of wealth and it is no longer financially
constrained in the high steady state. The w0 (w) line is closer to the 45o line
with the social planner, implying that following a one-period fall in y, the
economy reaccumulates debt at a lower pace than under laissez-faire.
    Finally, Figure 5 illustrates the dynamics of the main variables of interest
in the social planner equilibrium with a stochastic simulation. The top panel
shows how consumption falls at the same time as output when there is a
negative shock. Even with the social planner, consumption falls by more than
income because of the fall in the price of collateral. Consumption increases
above its long-run level in the period after the shock, when the economy
is unconstrained and insiders inherit low debt from the credit crunch. The
same pattern is observed for the price of the collateral.
    The bottom panel shows that the optimal Pigouvian tax rate is positive in
the high state and zero in the low state.18 Note the countercyclical pattern in
the tax rate: it falls in a bust, and does not immediately go back to the long-
run level after the bust because the economy temporarily has lower debt. The
tax rate increases with the economy’s vulnerability to a new credit crunch.
  18
    We have set the tax to zero when the economy is financially constrained and the tax
is not binding.

If the optimal tax rate is imposed on insiders, the decline in consumption
when the economy experiences a bust is reduced from -6.2 percent to -5.2
percent, and the fall in the asset price during a bust is reduced from -12.3
percent to -10.3 percent.
    If we calibrate our model using the parameter values reported in Table 3
for the case of the US household sector, the results are similar to what we
found for the SME sector. The optimal magnitude of the macroprudential
tax in the high steady state is τHSS = 0.48 percent for households.

4.4     Sensitivity analysis
We investigate how the optimal Pigouvian taxation depends on the param-
eters of the economy. Figure 6 shows how τHSS (the steady state rate of tax
in the high state) varies with the gross interest rate R. For R = 1.04, the
optimal steady-state tax in the economy is close to zero since βR ≈ 1 and in-
siders accumulate a level of precautionary savings that is sufficient to almost
entirely avoid debt deflation in case of busts.19
  19
    Recall that we require βR < 1 for the economy to converge to a stationary equilibrium.
If βR ≥ 1, wealth is nonstationary and drifts toward infinity.

       Figure 6: Dependence of macroprudential tax on interest rate

    As the interest rate declines, it becomes more attractive for insiders to
borrow and the economy becomes more vulnerable to debt deflation in busts.
Lower interest rates therefore warrant higher macro-prudential taxation to
offset the externalities that individual agents impose on the economy. This
effect can be large: the optimal tax rate is multiplied by two when the interest
rate is reduced from 2 percent to 1 percent.
    For R ≤ 1.026 (when the line is dashed in Figure 6), the level of debt accu-
mulated by the social planner is high enough that the economy is constrained
even in the high steady state AH . This means that the social planner could
lower the tax rate to zero as soon as the economy becomes constrained—
although he could also maintain the tax rate at the level shown by the dashed
line in Figure 6 or any level in between without changing the equilibrium. In
this case, macroprudential taxation matters only in the transition: its role is
to slow down the build-up of risk and financial vulnerability after a bust, and
thus delay the transition to the constrained regime where the tax no longer
matters.
    For low levels of R, the strong desire of private agents to borrow creates
a dilemma for the social planner. On the one hand, it increases the negative
externality associated with debt and so the optimal rate of taxation. On

the other hand, it is also costly in terms of welfare not to let private agents
take advantage of the low interest rate by borrowing more. In the context
of this tradeoff, the social planner may choose to let the economy go into
the constrained regime in booms that lasts long enough, i.e., to let aggregate
debt be limited by the constraint rather than by the tax.20
    Figure 7 depicts the response of the steady-state tax rate τHSS to changes
in the pledgeability parameter φ. One interpretation for an increase in φ is
a process of financial liberalization or development that enables agents to
collateralize a greater fraction of their assets. We observe that the optimal
tax rate increases with the ability of private agents to borrow. The more
insiders can borrow against their collateral, the greater the potential amplifi-
cation effects when the borrowing constraint becomes binding. Thus, greater
financial liberalization or development warrants tighter macroprudential reg-
ulation over a significant part of the parameter space.
    The level of financial liberalization/development also determines whether
  20
    This result echoes a point that has often been made by central bankers in the debate on
how monetary policy should respond to asset price booms: that the interest rate increase
required to discourage agents from borrowing would have to be so drastic to be effective
that it is undesirable (see, e.g., Bernanke, 2002).

prudential taxation is transitory or permanent. For low levels of φ, we find
that the amplification effects are small enough that the planner chooses a
constrained equilibrium in steady state and macroprudential taxation is only
relevant in the transition from busts to booms. By contrast, if φ ≥ .037, the
planner implements an unconstrained equilibrium with a Pigouvian tax in
steady state. This tax reaches a maximum of almost 1 percent at φ = .08
—for higher values of the parameter the economy becomes so volatile that
decentralized agents increase their precautionary savings sufficiently so that
the externality declines.21
    Figures 8 and 9 show how the optimal tax varies with the size and prob-
ability of the underlying shock. The optimal tax rate is not very sensitive
to those variables: it changes by less than 0.3 percent when the size of the
income shock varies between 0 and 10 percent and its probability varies be-
tween 0 and 20 percent. The sign of the variation is paradoxical. Figure

φ > 0.089.

  Figure 9: Dependence of macroprudential tax on probability π of bust

8 shows that τHSS is increasing with yL , i.e., the optimal rate of prudential
taxation is decreasing with the size of the income shock. This result comes
from the endogenous response of precautionary savings by private agents to
increased riskiness in the economy. As the size of the shock increases, insiders
raise their own precautionary savings, which alleviates the burden on pru-
dential taxation. The tax rate is the highest when the amplitude of the shock
is the smallest, but again, these high tax rates do not bind in equilibrium if
the income shock is very small (below 2 percent).
    We observe a similar pattern for the variation of the optimal tax with the
probability of a shock (Figure 9). The optimal tax rate is decreasing with
π because of the endogenous increase in private precautionary savings. The
tax is not binding (and could be set to zero in the long run) if the probability
of bust falls below 3 percent. Prudential taxation thus responds the most to
”tail risk”, i.e., a risk that is realized with a small probability, but not so
small that even the social planner can ignore it in the long run. The long-run
tax rate is binding and is at its maximum when the probability of shock is
between 3 and 5 percent.




                                        26
5     Extensions
We discuss four extensions of the basic model. In the first one, we assume that
the indebted agents are submitted to external financial shocks that abruptly
restrict their borrowing constraints. The second and third subsections ex-
pand the range of liabilities by assuming that the insiders can issue equity or
long-term debt. The last extension looks at whether ex post bailout policies
can provide a good alternative to ex ante prudential taxation.

5.1    Fluctuations in Creditworthiness
It has been suggested (see e.g. Jermann and Quadrini, 2010) that the recent
global financial crisis was driven more by fluctuations in the availability of
credit (“financial shocks”) than by developments in the real economy (“en-
dowment shocks”). In our framework, the availability of credit is a function
of the parameters ψ and φ in the borrowing constraint. We now assume that
the economy may be hit by shocks that reduce ψ rather than y.
    As in our previous calibration, we choose our parameter values to replicate
the declines in credit and asset prices observed during the financial crisis of
2008/09. Income is now deterministic and equal to y = 1. The parameter
ψH is calibrated so as to reproduce the pre-crisis debt-to-income ratio, and
ψL is calibrated to match the observed fall in the asset price at the time of
a bust. This results in a pair of values (ψL , ψH ) = (1.94, 1.97). The other
parameters remain the same as in Table 1.
    We solve for the constrained planner’s problem in the model with credit
shocks and find that the behavior of the model economy is very similar to
the case of output shocks. A planner would impose an optimal Pigouvian
tax on borrowing of τHSS = 0.61 percent if the economy has reached its steady
state during a boom. In a bust, the planner lowers the tax and slowly raises
it back to its high steady-state value as the economy re-accumulates debt.
    The general magnitude of the externality—and by implication of optimal
policy measures targeted at internalizing it—therefore seems to depend not
on the source of shocks but on the extent of amplification when the borrowing
constraint becomes binding. The optimal policy measures in the economy are
similar as long as we calibrate the model in a way that reproduces similar fre-
quencies and magnitudes of crisis as our benchmark model with endowment
shocks.



                                      27
5.2     Debt Maturity
We have observed in the data that outstanding debt fell by substantially
less than asset values in the US coporate and household sectors during the
financial crisis. This implied a relatively low value of φ in the calibration.
However, the small sensitivity of outstanding debt to collateral value could
be due to the fact that a substantial fraction of the debt is medium- or long-
term so that the full impact of low collateral values on outstanding debt is
observed over several periods. We capture this idea in a tractable way by
generalizing the collateral constraint as follows,

                     wi,t+1 − (1 − δ)wi,t
                                          + δ(ψ + φpt ) ≥ 0.
                              R
The parameter δ represents the fraction of the debt principal that comes
due in any given period, i.e., the inverse of the duration of debt. The case
of short-term debt corresponds to δ = 1, which gives equation (3). In the
general case δ < 1, the collateral constraint applies only to the flow of new
debt issued in period t. We interpret 1/δ as the duration of debt.
    Iterating backwards, the new constraint can also be written
                                     +∞
                      wi,t+1
                             + ψ + δφ (1 − δ)s pt−s ≥ 0.
                                     X
                       R             s=0

In this formulation, the collateral constraint has the same form as before,
except that it involves the weighted average of past collateral prices. In a
deterministic steady-state with constant asset price pt , the constraint would
simplify to our original collateral constraint (3). However, the dynamic be-
havior of the economy in case of shocks is modified: when the credit con-
straint binds, a unit decline in the current asset price reduces debt only by
a fraction δφ as opposed to φ in our benchmark model. This mitigates the
debt deflation dynamics in the economy.
                                                                              H
    Figure 10 illustrates how the optimal steady-state tax in the high state τSS
varies with debt duration for the parameters of our benchmark calibration
as listed in Table 1.22 As we increase debt duration by moving leftwards in
the graph from δ = 1, the debt deflation effects that arise during binding
constraints are mitigated. As a result, insiders reduce their precautionary
  22
   The derivation of the equilibrium with long-term debt and the numerical resolution
method are presented in Appendices A.4 and B.2.

 Figure 10: Dependence of macroprudential tax on inverse debt duration δ

savings and the externality of a given dollar of debt at first rises. For δ ≤ .78,
busts are sufficiently mild that a planner chooses not to insure against binding
constraints when the steady state is reached. In this region, a planner uses
macroprudential taxation only during the transition from a bust to the next
boom in order to slow down the build-up of risk.
     An important effect of higher debt duration (lower δ) is to make the
economy more resilient in the sense of admitting higher values of φ without
leading to multiple equilibria—long-term debt insulates borrowers against
self-fulfilling panics. We emphasized earlier that when debt is due yearly
(δ = 1), an insider sector with φ > φ̂ ≈ 9% was vulnerable to multiple
equilibria. As the duration of debt 1/δ increases, a smaller fraction of debt
becomes due in every given period, raising the threshold φ̂ and therefore
mitigating the scope for multiple equilibria. This relationship is depicted in
figure 11. For example, for φ = 0.80—the typical loan-to-value ratio in the
mortgage market—a unique equilibrium is guaranteed as long as δ < 0.095,
i.e., the duration of debt 1/δ is greater than 10.6. The duration of a 30-
year mortgage with a fixed interest rate of 6% is 11.3, which satisfies this
condition. On the other hand, mortgages with shorter duration, such as
teaser loans that are meant to be refinanced sooner because the interest rate

5.3      Outside equity
We could assume that insiders can sell equity rather than debt. Let us assume
that the insider can sell a claim on a share st ≤ s of total income to outsiders.
This claim will be sold to outsiders at price
                                                   E(y)
                                            pe =        ,
                                                   R−1
and the budget constraint of insiders becomes
                       wi,t+1
ci,t + ai,t+1 pt +            = (1 − α)yt + ai,t (pt + αyt ) + wi,t − si,t yt + (si,t+1 − si,t )p.
                                                                                                e
                        R
    It is easy to see that the insiders will always sell as much equity as possible,
which is a way for them to insure against their income risk (at no cost since
outsiders do not require a risk premium on equity) and benefit from the
greater patience of outsiders. Thus, st = s in every period. The introduction
of equity leads to a consumption boom, but the long-run equilibrium is the

                                                   30
same as before except that total income is reduced by the factor (1 − s).
Our model is homogenous of degree 1 in income y, aside from the borrowing
constraint. In a sample simulation in which we set s̄ = .5, we found the
optimal macroprudential tax to be τHSS = 0.59, which is very close to the
level in our benchmark model (0.56).
    Although equity has better risk-sharing properties than debt, it is not
used to reduce risk in equilibrium. Insiders issue equity to increase their
consumption, leaving them with more liabilities and the same level of debt
in the long run. Allowing borrowers to issue equity, thus, does not reduce
the need for the prudential taxation of debt.

5.4    Bailouts
We have focused on the role of ex ante prudential policies, but real world
policy makers also resort to ex post policies, such as bailouts or market
interventions to support the price of assets. In our model, the social planner
could accumulate a bailout fund financed by a lump-sum tax in booms, which
is used to make a transfer to constrained agents in the bust. The budget
constraint of private agents becomes
                                 wt+1
                          ct +        = yt + wt + Tt ,
                                  R
and that of the social planner can be written,
                                        bt+1
                                 Tt +        = bt ,
                                         R
where bt is the size of the bailout fund and Tt is the lump-sum transfer.
    We can show that if this policy does not change the set of periods during
which agents are constrained during the boom, it has absolutely no effect on
the equilibrium and welfare. This comes from a form of Ricardian equiva-
lence: the agents borrow more and exactly the amount that will leave them
the same in the bust as under laissez-faire. This result could be described,
loosely speaking, as ”moral hazard” (since the agents respond to the bailout
insurance by borrowing more)—although this is not moral hazard in the
strict sense of the term (there is no hidden action).
    To see this more formally, note that by substituting Tt from the two
equations above one obtains the budget constraint (6) with private wealth
wt replaced by total wealth wt +bt . Thus, any state-contingent bailout policy

                                         31
b(mt ) can be undone by private agents by setting their wealth to w(m  e   t) =
w(mt ) − b(mt ) where w(mt ) is the laissez-faire policy function. Such a policy
satisfies the first-order conditions as well as the constraints if
                      w(mt ) − b(mt )
                                      + ψ + φp(mt ) ≥ 0,
                            R
so that the equilibrium remains the same as laissez-faire in spite of the social
planner’s intervention.
    The inequality above is satisfied if the bailout fund is reduced to zero in
the constrained states and is not too large in the unconstrained states. The
only way in which such a bailout policy might work is by increasing the size
of the bailout fund in booms all the way to the point where private agents
can no longer undo the social planner’s accumulation because they hit their
collateral constraints.
    Our bailout irrelevance result is relevant to current policy debates from
several perspectives. First, let us discuss the proposal that regulators require
banks to pay into an ”insurance fund” from which future bailouts are to be
financed. If the contribution of each bank is set proportional to its contribu-
tion to systemic risk, then such a requirement plays the same role as ex ante
prudential taxation in our model. The ex post provision of insurance per se
is not relevant since banks can easily undo it by undertaking more risk ex
ante. Some authors have argued that capital insurance should be provided
by the private sector, for example, through contingent capital requirements
(Kashyap, Rajan and Stein, 2008). Our findings suggest that this is only
useful if regulators mandate a sufficient level of insurance to make banks
internalize their systemic externalities.
    Our result is also relevant to the debates on capital controls versus re-
serve accumulation in dealing with volatile capital flows to emerging mar-
ket economies. The official conventional wisdom seems to be that countries
should respond to a capital inflow first by accumulating precautionary re-
serves, and with capital controls only as a second line of defense if the first
policy is insufficient (Ostry et al, 2010). However, our model suggests that
the private sector can easily undo the public accumulation of reserves by
borrowing more abroad, and that the accumulation of reserves will have an
effect only to the extent that it pushes domestic borrowers against their credit
constraints. By contrast, capital controls address the underlying externali-
ties much more directly, and can be differentiated across different types of
capital flows to take into account their contribution to systemic risk.

6    Conclusion
This paper has developed a simple model to study the optimal policy re-
sponses to booms and busts in credit and asset prices. We found that decen-
tralized agents do not internalize that their borrowing choices in boom times
render the economy more vulnerable to credit and asset price busts involving
debt deflation in bust times. Therefore their borrowing imposes an exter-
nality on the economy. In our baseline calibration, a social planner would
impose on average an ex-ante tax of half a percent per dollar on borrowing
so as to reduce the debt burden and mitigate the decline in consumption in
case of crisis.
     The analysis presented in this paper could be extended in several direc-
tions. First, it would be interesting to analyze the case where the sensitivity
of the credit constraint to the collateral price (parameter φ) is large enough
to produce multiple equilibria and self-fulfilling asset price busts. This is
the relevant case to consider if one wants to apply the model to leveraged
financial institutions in systemic liquidity crises. The optimal Pigouvian tax
is likely to be higher than with the calibrations that we have considered in
this paper, but it is unclear whether the optimal tax should be binding in the
long-run steady states. The optimal taxation might be implemented through
the kind of countercyclical capital surcharges that are being discussed in
the debates about the ”macroprudential regulation” of banks. In addition,
policies to remove the bad equilibria, such as lending-in-last-resort, may be
appropriate.
     Another direction of enquiry would take into account the effects of busts
in asset prices and credit on production and income. Our model focused on
the cost of excessive consumption volatility taking income as exogenous. In
the real world, however, busts in credit and asset prices are likely to affect
investment and other productive expenditures. It is not obvious a priori that
investment will fall below the optimal level in a bust if it is triggered by a
negative productivity shock, since in this case the demand for investment will
fall at the same time as the credit constraint is tightened. The investment
channel, however, might magnify the welfare cost of the fire sale externality
in busts, and justify more aggressive prudential taxation in booms.
     In addition, asset price and credit busts might have a permanent neg-
ative effect on long-run output. The data suggest that output does not
generally catch up with its pre-crisis trend following a financial crisis (IMF,
2009). This will be the case, in our model, if the collateral constraint reduces

                                      33
productivity-enhancing expenditures. The welfare cost of asset price busts is
likely to be larger in this case, leading to larger welfare gains from prudential
taxation in booms, and a higher optimal Pigouvian tax level.
    Finally, one would like to incorporate money to the model in order to
derive insights for the debate on whether and how monetary policy should
respond to credit and asset price booms. If there is nominal stickiness, a mon-
etary restriction that raises the real interest rate in the boom should have
the same macroprudential effect as the Pigouvian tax discussed in this paper.
Such a preemptive restriction may come at a cost for the other objectives of
monetary policy (e.g., in terms of inflation), and may not be necessary or de-
sirable if the optimal Pigouvian taxation can be implemented independently
of monetary policy. If monetary policy is the only available instrument, how-
ever, it stands to reason that it should be used with a prudential purpose in
mind, at least at the margin.

    In a symmetric equilibrium with a representative agent, this gives (4) and
(5).

A.2     Deterministic case with βR = 1
In a steady state with βR = 1, equation (5) implies that the price of the
asset is given by (14). The collateral constraint is satisfied if and only if
w/R + ψ + φpunc ≥ 0, that is if wealth is larger than a threshold

                             m ≥ m ≡ y − R(ψ + φpunc ).

A steady state equilibrium exists if and only if m1 ≥ m. In this equilibrium,
consumption is constant and given by

                             cunc (m1 ) = βy + (1 − β)m1 .

By contrast, if m1 < m, the economy is constrained in period 1. Equation
(5) and u0 (ct ) ≥ u0 (ct+1 ) imply pt ≤ punc . Then w2 /R = −ψ − φp1 ≥
−ψ − φpunc , implies m2 = y + w2 ≥ m so that there is an unconstrained
steady state equilibrium. We can assume that the economy is in this steady
state equilibrium from period 2 onwards and focus on the equilibrium in
period 1.

If γ ≥ 1 this is a strictly convex function of c1 for c1 ≤ cunc (m1 ), as shown
on Figure 1. Hence the slope of the r.h.s. of (13) reaches its maximum at
the kink, which is given by,

                     ∂ pb                             1   γαy

                                                      r c (m1 )

As can be seen on Figure 1, equilibrium multiplicity is possible only if the
unconstrained steady state equilibrium exists, which requires m1 ≥ m. In
addition, equilibrium multiplicity requires the slope of the r.h.s. of (13) to
be larger than 1. To avoid multiplicity, it is necessary and sufficient that this
slope be smaller than 1 at the kink for m1 = m, that is

                                       ∂ pb
                                   φ                          < 1.                             (26)
                                       ∂c1     c1 =cunc (m)

If this condition is satisfied, then the slope of the r.h.s. of (13) is lower than
1 everywhere, so that the equilibrium is unique. This is true not only for
m1 = m but also for any m1 ≥ m since the slope at the kink is decreasing
in m1 (see equation (25)). Conversely, if this condition is not satisfied, then
there is multiplicity for m1 slightly below m. Using (25), condition (26) can
be rewritten as (16).

A.3     Social planner
The social planner maximizes the utility of the representative insider subject
to the budget constraint (2) and to the credit constraint (18), taking at = 1
as given. The Lagrangian of the social planner and his first-order condition
on saving are

        F OC (wt+1 ) : u0 (ct ) = λt + βREt [u0 (ct+1 ) + φλt+1 p̄0 (mt+1 )] .

   If we solve the decentralized agent’s problem under a tax that requires
the agent to pay τt for every dollar borrowed as specified in budget constraint
(20), then the first order condition is

              F OC (wt+1 ) :            (1 − τt ) u0 (ct ) = λt + βREt [u0 (ct+1 )] .

This condition replicates the first-order condition of the planner that is given
above if the tax rate is set such that

   λt + βREt [u0 (ct+1 ) + φλt+1 p0 (mt+1 )] = λt + βREt [u0 (ct+1 )] + τt u0 (ct ) .

Simplifying this expression yields the formula (21) given in the text.

A.4     Long-Term Debt
The Lagrangian of our setup extended to long-term debt that repays a frac-
tion δ every period is
            +∞
                                                                        wi,s+1

                  "                                               #)

                               R

   This changes the first-order condition on ws+1 to

F OC (wi,s+1 ) :                u0 (ci,s ) + β (1 − δ) Es [λi,s+1 ] = βREs [u0 (ci,s+1 )] + λi,s .

Taking on more debt now not only has the benefit of raising current con-
sumption, but also of having to roll over (1 − δ) less debt next period, which
is valuable if the borrowing constraint next period is binding. The remaining
first-order conditions are unchanged.

                                                   39
   When including long-term debt, we can no longer summarize the state
variables in a single variable m = w + y, because w determines the level of
debt that comes due in the current period independently of y. All policy
functions are therefore functions of the pair of state variables (w, y).
   The Euler equation of the planner who borrows in long-term debt is
                                                     "                                      #

                                                                            ∂w

B     Numerical resolution method
B.1    Benchmark model
We present the numerical method in the case where income is i.i.d. and
binomially distributed (y = yH or yL ) but the method can easily be extended
to the case where y follows a Markov process with more than two states.
    We first define a grid w for wealth. The minimum value in the grid is
wmin = −ψ − yL . In iteration step k, we start with a triplet of functions
ck (m), pk (m) and λk (m) where ck (m) and pk (m) are weakly increasing in
m and λk (m) is weakly decreasing in m. For each w0 ∈ w we associate
a quadruplet (c, p, λ, m) under the assumption that the equilibrium is un-
constrained. We solve the system of optimality conditions from section 3.1
under the assumption that the borrowing constraint is loose, noting that
m0 = y 0 + w0 :
                              n      h          io− 1
               cunc (w0 ) =    βRE ck (m0 )−γ        γ
                                                         ,
                           βE {ck (m0 )−γ · [αy 0 + pk (m0 )]}
               punc (w0 ) =                                    ,
                                       cunc (w0 )−γ
              λunc (w0 ) = 0,
                                       w0
              munc (w0 ) = cunc (w0 ) + .
                                        R
    In the same way, we can solve for the constrained branch of the system
for each w0 ∈ w s.t. w0 /R ≤ −ψ under the assumption that the borrowing
constraint is binding in the current period as

                            −w0 /R − ψ
             pcon (w0 ) =              ,

                                                pcon (w0 )
                                           −γ
                                                       h          i
             λcon (w0 ) = ccon (w0 )            − βRE ck (m0 )−γ ,
                                                w0
            mcon (w0 ) = ccon (w0 ) +              .
                                                R
    We then determine the next period wealth threshold w such that the
borrowing constraint is marginally binding in the unconstrained system, i.e.,
such that
                                w
                                  + ψ + φpunc (w) = 0.
                                R
This is the lowest possible w0 that the economy can support (any lower level
would violate the collateral constraint). By construction of this threshold,
cunc (w) = ccon (w) for consumption as well as for the other policy variables.
This threshold gives the level of m that marks the frontier between the un-
constrained and the constrained regimes, m = munc (w) = mcon (w). The
lowest possible level of m is m = mcon (−Rψ) = −ψ. One can check, us-
ing the equations above, that any w0 ∈ [w, −Rψ] can be mapped into one
unconstrained quadruplet (cunc (w0 ), punc (w0 ), λunc (w0 ), munc (w0 )) and one
constrained quadruplet (ccon (w0 ), pcon (w0 ), λcon (w0 ), mcon (w0 )).
    We can construct the step-(k + 1) policy function ck+1 (m) for the interval
m ≤ m < m by interpolating on the pairs {(ccon (w0 ), mcon (w0 ))}w0 ∈w where
w0 ∈ [w, −Rψ], and then for the interval m ≥ m by interpolating on the pairs
{(cunc (w0 ), munc (w0 ))}w0 ∈w for w0 ≥ w. The resulting consumption function
ck+1 (m) is again monotonically increasing in m. We proceed in the same
manner for the policy functions pk+1 (m) and λk+1 (m), which are, respec-
tively, monotonically increasing and decreasing in m. The iteration process
is continued until the distance between two successive functions ck (m) and
ck+1 (m) (or other policy functions) is sufficiently small.

B.2     Model with Long-Term Debt
When including long-term debt, all policy functions are functions of the pair
of state variables (w, y). We present the algorithm to solve for the laissez-
faire equilibrium (the case with social planner is similar). We modify the

                                                41
procedure outlined above by adjusting one equation in the unconstrained
solution
                                      n        h                                                  io− 1
                 cunc (w0 , y) = βRE ck (w0 , y 0 )−γ − β (1 − δ) λk (w0 , y 0 )                      γ

In the constrained solution, the following four equations have to be satisfied,

    This is a system of four equations with four unknowns: pcon (w0 , y),
ccon (w0 , y), λcon (w0 , y) and wcon (w0 , y). It can be solved numerically, and
also analytically in the case γ = 2. We substitute wcon (w0 , y) from the fourth
equation into the first equation to obtain
                                       n                                                      o
