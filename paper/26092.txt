This paper estimates the impact of admission to formal vocational secondary programs on labor
market outcomes in Mongolia. We conducted public lotteries to allocate scarce slots for
approximately 8,000 students who applied to oversubscribed trades in 10 vocational schools
during 2010, 2011, and 2012. We find that admission to oversubscribed vocational schools in
Mongolia led to significantly higher employment, and increased earnings for women. These
positive impacts appear to be due to the acquisition of more skills in specific trades, greater work
intensity, and increased employment opportunities in high-paying sectors.

1. Introduction

        With enrollment in primary education having become nearly universal in many middle-

income and developing countries, there is increased attention on secondary education. 1 In addition

to the prevailing issues of access and quality, 2 an important question concerns the role of

vocational training in secondary education: Can vocational training improve labor market

outcomes for youth in developing countries? This is not a new question. A large literature

comparing the returns to general and vocational education in developing countries emerged during

the 1970s and continued through the 1990s, with extensive reviews by Zymelman (1976), Tilak

(1988), and Psacharapolous (1987, 1993). Their conclusions were summarized in a 1995 World

Bank Education Sector Review which stated that "comparative evaluations of...general and

secondary education curricula indicated clearly that the rate of return was much higher to

investments in general than in vocational secondary education" (IBRD, 1995, p.8). Yet many of

the studies underlying these conclusions failed to address the possibility of selection bias when

comparing general and vocational education (Bennel, 1996).

        More recent papers estimating the impact of general and vocational education have

attempted to address selection by exploiting exogenous variation in exposure to different types of

education. For example, Malamud and Pop-Eleches (2010) examine a 1973 educational reform in

Romania that shifted secondary-school students from vocational training to general education,

finding similar rates of labor market participation and earnings between men in cohorts who

received general education and those with vocational training. There have also been several

randomized evaluations of vocational education and training programs in middle-income and

developing countries. As we will elaborate shortly, most of these evaluations focus on relatively

short programs of 3 to 6 months for low-skilled or unemployed youth, including Card et al. (2007)

for the Dominican Republic, Attanasio et al. (2011, 2015) for Colombia, and Hirshleifer et al.

(2014) for Turkey. With the notable exception of Hicks et al. (2017) for Kenya, none directly

examine the impact of untargeted, long-term, formal vocational education programs.

        This paper estimates the impact of admission to formal vocational secondary programs on

labor market outcomes in Mongolia. 3 To this end, we conducted randomized public lotteries in

which applicants to 10 oversubscribed vocational schools were randomly assigned admissions both

by school and specific trade of study in 2010, 2011, and 2012. The majority of the students applied

to 2 or 2.5 year vocational programs after completing 9 years of schooling while others applied to

shorter 1 year programs after completing the full 11 years of schooling. We then followed those

students who were admitted and those who were rejected through 2015, collecting information on

their educational attainment, employment, and earnings, as well as knowledge of their trades, work

intensity, and other ancillary outcomes.

        We find that admission to vocational schools in Mongolia led to significantly higher

employment. For example, a year after completing school, those admitted to a vocational school

were 4 percent more likely to be employed in a paid job and 9 percent more likely to have held a

paid job lasting longer than one month. These impacts are substantially larger for women and

increase over time (for up to three years after completing school). Admission to oversubscribed

vocational schools also led to significantly increased earnings for women. For example, a year

after completing school, women who were admitted to a 2-year vocational program earned 13

  This paper builds on the analysis described in Appendix E of the final evaluation report of MCC's Vocational
Education and Training (VET) project prepared by the authors in Innovations for Poverty Action (2018):

                                                      3
percent per month more in their most recent job and on average as compared to those who were

not admitted. These improved labor market outcomes appear to be due to the acquisition of more

skills in specific trades, greater work intensity, and increased employment opportunities in high-

paying sectors. Moreover, they are mostly driven by students in early cohorts and disappear for

the latest cohort which entered the labor market during an economic downturn.

       These findings are in line with some of the previous literature on vocational education and

training. Attanasio et al. (2011, 2015) evaluate the Jovenes en Accion program, which provided

three months of in-classroom training and three months of on-the-job training to low-income

unemployed youth in Colombia. Following up on these youth 13 to 15 months after they would

have completed their training, they find that women randomly offered training earn almost 20

percent more in wages and have a 7 percent higher probability of paid employment than those not

offered training. None of these outcomes are significant for men. The impacts remain significant

in administrative data up to 10 years later. Card et al. (2007) evaluate the Juventud y Empleo

initiative in the Dominican Republic which provides low-income youth with vocational training

by private institutions up to a maximum of 350 hours. They find no impacts on employment

outcomes but some evidence of a positive (10%) effect on earnings per month among those who

are working. Hirshleifer et al. (2014) evaluate the impact of vocational programs for the

unemployed provided through the Turkish National Employment Agency (ISKUR). Both public

and private vocational programs average approximately 340 hours over 3 months. They find that

being assigned to training leads to a positive but insignificant effect on overall employment (2%)

and income (5.6%) one year after completing training.

       However, it is important to distinguish between untargeted, long-term, formal vocational

education programs and less formal programs targeted at unemployed youth which last only a few


                                                4
months at a time. 4 In contrast to the other studies mentioned above, Hicks et al. (2013) examine

formal in-school technical and vocational programs that last more than a year in Kenya. They

randomly provided vouchers worth US$460 to cover all (or almost all) of the tuition costs for

private and government programs. The sample consisted of 2,160 out-of-school Kenyan youths

between 18 and 30 years of age; the majority (78%) chose courses of 2 years or more, while 20%

chose courses of 1 year or less. There is mixed evidence that the program affected total earnings

with negative impacts several months after completing training but positive impacts a year later

(which are only significant in some specifications). There is also some evidence of a significant

increase in wage earnings among those who earned wages.

        Another study by Bettinger, Kremer, and Saavedra (2007) examines students who applied

to vocational schools through the PACES program which provided over 125,000 pupils in

Colombia with vouchers for private secondary school. They find large positive impacts on

educational outcomes for winners of the lottery and suggest that one possible channel may be the

greater nimbleness of private vocational schools in adapting to labor market needs. Finally, there

has been some research in the United States showing the effectiveness of career academies which

provide vocational training to students in secondary school (Kemple and Snipes, 2000; Cullen et

al., 2005).

        Our study stands out in terms of its breadth of scope and its intensive data collection effort.

We follow three separate cohorts of applicants for up to 4 years after completion of their vocational

training. This is an important contribution of our paper since we can examine how our estimates

  In addition, there are several randomized evaluations of specialized vocational and apprenticeship programs in
developing countries. These include programs that provided tailoring courses to women in the slums of New Delhi,
India (Maitra and Mani, 2012), training on livestock management to women in Bangladesh (Bandiera et al., 2013),
training for Ugandan women to run small businesses (Bandiera et al., 2014), apprenticeships to youth in Malawi
(Cho et al., 2013), and cash grants to fund businesses or training in Uganda (Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez, 2013).

are affected by fluctuations in the business cycle, which cannot be done in that examine only one

cohort. 5 Our results suggest that variation in the business cycle has large effects on the estimated

returns to vocational education. Thus, in addition to variation in the length and quality of

vocational programs, another explanation for the differences in the literature are that they are

estimated in very different market conditions.




2. Background: Vocational Education in Mongolia

        During the socialist era, Mongolia had a robust Technical Vocational and Education

Training (TVET) program fashioned after the Soviet model and supported by the Soviet Union.

The Mongolian TVET sector had the capacity to produce sufficient skilled labor not only for

industries in Mongolia but also for other parts of the Soviet Union. As Mongolia transitioned to a

market economy in the 1990s, the TVET sector deteriorated without financial and technical

support from Russia. Training equipment became outdated and teachers fell behind the newest

developments in their trades. At the same time, the demand for skilled labor grew as Mongolia

experienced substantial economic growth due to a booming mining sector as well as new sectors

such as the processing industry and construction.

        The Mongolian government recognized the lack of skilled workers and inadequate capacity

of TVET institutions to produce such workers. It set goals to increase TVET school enrollment

and improve the quality of TVET education as part of the Second Education Master Plan 2006-

2015. As the government became more focused on the TVET system and the need for skilled labor




5
  Oyer (2006), Kahn (2010), and Oreopoulos (2012) show that initial labor market conditions matter importantly for
the short and long-run labor market outcomes.


                                                        6
became more apparent as the mining sector grew and modernized, a number of international donors

began to participate in making Mongolian technical and vocational education more relevant to a

rapidly evolving labor market.

        In 2008, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) became a major donor in the TVET

sector. 6 From 2008 to 2013 MCC, acting through the Millennium Challenge Account-Mongolia

(MCA-M) Vocational Education Training (VET) Project, implemented wide-ranging measures to

bring Mongolia's TVET sector up to international standards. The VET Project initiated

institutional reforms, created competency-based curricula for prioritized trades, retrained teachers,

introduced labor market information systems and career counseling and upgraded training

equipment and physical infrastructures at select TVET institutions.

        TVET schools in Mongolia can be either private or state-owned. Since 2012, state-owned

schools have been under the authority of the Ministry of Labor which appoints the school directors

and deputy directors, in charge of day to day operations. Private schools have their directors

appointed by their board members. Private schools generally have the same internal structure as

state-owned schools and are subject to most of the same rules, regulations and subsidies as state-

owned schools. In general, there are two types of vocational education training programs available

to students who have completed basic education in Mongolia: a 2/2.5-year program for students

that have only completed nine years of studies in the national education system and a 1-year

program for student who have completed all 11 years of secondary schooling. The 1-year programs

concentrate solely on vocational training and students receive a vocational education certificate

upon graduation. The 2/2.5-year programs offer a mix of basic academic courses and vocational

training, and students receive both a secondary education and a vocational education certificate

upon graduation.



3. Experimental design

         The study sample comprises all applicants to 10 Mongolian TVET schools. These schools

were not randomly chosen and were not a representative sample of all 76 TVET schools in

Mongolia at the time of the study. In order to have randomized admission, schools that were

recruited as part of the study had to have an applicant pool that was larger than the number of

available admission slots. Thus, these schools were likely more competitive than the typical TVET

institution in Mongolia. There were a total of 12 oversubscribed schools that were identified as

potential partners for this study. All 12 schools were approached and ultimately 10 of the

oversubscribed schools decided to participate in the study.

         Lotteries were held in every one of the 10 TVET Evaluation schools during both the spring

and fall rounds of admission over three consecutive years. Most lotteries were held as public

events, open to applicants and other interested parties. 7 Each of the schools set the minimum

criteria that applicants must meet to be considered qualified for admission and thus eligible to be

included in the lottery. 8 Some schools also expressed the desire to guarantee admissions for highly

qualified applicants that met certain criteria. In other cases, schools requested that applicants with

guaranteed employment after graduation and disabled and disadvantaged applicants be granted a

  In accordance with their internal policies and preferences, some schools decided to hold them as closed events in the
MCA-M office in Ulaanbaatar.
8
  Schools also had specific minimum criteria for applicants to certain trades. For example, some schools required that
applicants were of a certain age to be admitted to trades that were particularly physically demanding.


                                                          8
preferred status for admissions. All students identified by the schools as "preferred applicants"

were guaranteed admission.

       Applicants who participated in a spring admissions round were not eligible for the fall

admissions round lottery at the same school, and participants of a lottery at one school were also

not allowed to participate in a lottery at another evaluation school. . We prepared a computer

program that randomly assigned applicants into trade slots based on how they had ranked their

trade preferences on the application form. For example, if there were three applicants eligible for

the lottery who put down construction as their first ranked trade but only two spaces were available,

the computer program randomly assigned two out of the three applicants to the construction trade.

The remaining applicants then went through the same process for her second ranked trade and so

on. The higher students ranked a trade, the higher their probability of being accepted to that trade.

       Lottery observers witnessed each of the lottery computer program's steps on a projection

screen to ensure transparency. Everyone in attendance was walked through each lottery step during

the event. After every step, a hard copy was printed and signed to verify and document the process.

At the end of the process, the lists of trades with accepted students and the list of rejected students

were provided to the school officials responsible for publicizing the lottery results.

       Overall, 12,806 prospective students applied to one of the 10 schools participating in the

study. Of these, 556 applicants did not meet the minimum requirements for any of the trades to

which they applied, and 526 met the requirements for guaranteed automatic admission. As a result,

the lotter determined the admissions status of 11,724 applicants.

4. Data

          The main data used for this study come from Admissions surveys in 2010, 2011 and 2012

and annual Tracking and Graduate Follow-Up (GFU) surveys from 2012-2015. The Admissions

survey recorded basic social, economic and demographic characteristics and contact information

of students. It also served as the application form for the 10 schools that participated in the study

and included a general knowledge test to measure skill levels and academic performance. The

GFU survey was administered in-person, approximately 6 to 12 months after students were

expected to graduate from their respective programs, and served as the primary instrument to

capture post-graduation labor market and educational outcomes. It included information on

enrollment, attendance and graduation information on up to three schools they attended over the

last 18 months, as well as information on short-term and longer-term employment. The survey also

included trade-specific skill tests in their first and second ranked trades, intended to measure

changes in skill level due to studying a trade at a TVET school. The Tracking surveys were an

abbreviated version of the GFU survey that were administered by phone and used to keep track of

students' outcomes before and after the main GFU survey. Table 1 below shows the full sample

of tracking and GFU respondents expected to be interviewed during each year of data collection.

interviewed. The original admissions surveys were taken by 11,973 non-duplicate students who

were eligible for the lottery and applied to a 2 or 1-year program. This translates into a response

rate of 84.7% after up to five years of interview rounds. Of the 11,973 admissions baseline

respondents, 10,950, or 91.2%, were administered the study's main instrument, the Graduate

Follow-Up survey, in 2013, 2014 or 2015.

4.2. Main outcomes

         We consider four main educational outcomes that are derived from the GFU survey which

took place in the year following the expected graduation of students from their TVET programs:

(a) studying at a TVET school, (b) graduating from any TVET school, (c) months enrolled in any

TVET school, and (d) months enrolled in any educational program. In addition, we use the

corresponding educational outcomes from the Tracking survey to generate cumulative measures

of educational attainment over time.

         We consider four alternative measures of employment that are derived from GFU and

Tracking surveys: (1) currently employed in a paid job longer than 1 month, (2) ever employed in

a paid job longer than 1 month, (3) ever employed in a paid job of any length, and (4) ever

employed in a paid or unpaid job of any length. 10 Employment in paid jobs that last longer than 1

month are likely to represent more stable attachments to the labor market. Therefore, we view

these outcomes as more valuable ones. However, there is also value in employment more

generally, whether paid or unpaid, so we present these broader measures of labor market

participation as well.

         We also consider four measures of earnings that are derived from GFU and Tracking

surveys: (1) monthly earnings if currently employed, (2) monthly earnings in most recent job, (3)

average monthly earnings to date, and (4) total earnings to date. 11 These are all measures of


10
   All these outcomes are based on employment questions pertaining to the 18-22 months prior to the GFU survey.
11
   All earnings measures are expressed in 2015 MNT to make them comparable across cohorts and over time. We
winsorize earnings by censoring observations in the top 1 percent of the earnings distribution for each cohort. Our
findings are qualitative unchanged if we include all earnings observations.


                                                         12
earnings associated with stable paid jobs of one month and longer 12. There are advantages and

disadvantages to each measure. For example, one's monthly earnings if currently employed

reflects the most up-to-date earnings at the time of the survey but also incorporate differences in

current employment rates across respondents. On the other hand, total earnings includes all

earnings to date but may be less informative about future prospects because they can be unduly

influenced by past earnings. We regard the monthly earnings in the most recent job and the average

monthly earnings as likely the most informative outcomes, but we show impacts on them all.



5. Empirical strategy

5.1. Estimating the Impact of Admission

           We estimate the impact of admission to a TVET school using the following regression

model estimated via ordinary least squares (OLS)


                        =   +  +  ( ) +  +                                                                        (1)

The variable  is an outcome such as employment or earnings for student  in school 

participating in round  of the lottery for cohort .  is an indicator variable for

whether or not a student  was admitted to a TVET school through the lottery. The coefficient of

interest in this regression is  which captures the difference in outcomes for students who were

admitted to a TVET school compared to those students who were not admitted, after controlling

for the probability of admission to a TVET school and the fixed effects for each lottery round by

school and cohort. This is the causal impact of being admitted to a TVET school on outcome .

Because treatment with a 1-year program is likely to be different from the treatment with a 2 or


12
     Including earnings from jobs of less than one month makes almost no difference to any of our resulting estimates.


                                                           13
2.5 year program, we will generally estimate the impact of admission to a TVET school

separately by program.

         The function ( ) is a polynomial of the probability that student  was admitted to a

TVET school given their, and their peers', preferences across trades. This function effectively

controls for any differences in student characteristics associated with different preferences

among trades as expressed in the rankings submitted during the application process. For this

analysis, we use a cubic polynomial but the results are robust to using alternative polynomial

functions. 13 The probabilities were estimated empirically based on 10,000 iterations of the actual

lottery algorithms used to assign students in the admissions process. 14 The function also includes

indicator variables for students who were guaranteed admissions (either because their most

preferred trade was not oversubscribed or because they met schools' criteria for preferential

treatment) and for students who had no chance of being admitted (because they did not meet the

minimum requirements for any of the trades to which they applied). 15

         The vector of indicator variables  represents fixed effects for each round of the

lottery by school and cohort. Each lottery represents a separate randomized experiment. The

inclusion of the fixed effects enables us to estimate the treatment effects for each lottery and then

average these effects across the different lotteries. We implement these fixed effects by including

indicator variables for each round of the lottery.

         Finally,  is a vector of baseline controls that includes a constant and can also include

demographic information and baseline test scores from the admissions survey. In our preferred


13
   Our results are essentially unchanged when using linear, quadratic, and 10th order polynomial functions of the
probability of admission. We have also considered specifications which interact this polynomial function with
indicators for cohort or program and the results are similar.
14
   Abdulkadiroglu et al. (2015) discuss the use of lotteries within school assignment procedures to estimate causal
impacts and consider alternative approaches for estimating probabilities of admission to schools.
15
   Our results are unchanged if we omit students guaranteed admission and those with no chance of admission.


                                                         14
specifications, we do not include any baseline controls for the sake of parsimony. However,

because our baseline controls are balanced between students admitted and not admitted to TVET

schools, the inclusion or exclusion of baseline controls does not affect the magnitude of our

estimates. The standard errors in these and all subsequent regressions are adjusted for

heteroscedasticity, following Abdulkadiroglu et al. (2015) as well as studies utilizing charter

school lotteries for estimating causal impacts (e.g. Dobbie and Fryer, 2015; Hoxby and Rockoff,

2004). 16

5.2. Internal validity

         We conducted a series of statistical tests on the key socioeconomic and demographic

variables collected in the admissions survey to test whether the lottery process was successful in

producing a group of admitted students who look similar, on average, to those who were

rejected. Specifically, we estimated equation (1) by replacing the outcome variables with

baseline characteristics instead. After adjusting for the probability of admission related to the

rankings submitted during the application process and including fixed effects, we found little

evidence that students who were admitted had significantly different characteristics from those

students who were not admitted. These results imply that the lotteries were successful, and that

comparing across this group of applicants allows for a causal estimate of the impact of attending

an evaluation school (see Appendix Table 1).

         We also examined the possibility of differential attrition between students who were

admitted and those who were not admitted to a TVET school after adjusting for the probability of

admission. We find that students who were admitted to a TVET school were about 2.6

percentage points more likely to respond to the GFU survey (see Appendix Table 2). While these


16
  Most of our results remain significant if we cluster our standard errors at the level of each lottery (i.e. lottery
round by school by cohort) with exceptions mentioned in the relevant sections.


                                                            15
differences are statistically significant, they are not particularly large in magnitude. Moreover, as

confirmed in the "balance tests" described above, this differential attrition did not lead to any

major differences in the baseline characteristics of students who were admitted and not admitted

to a TVET school (see Appendix Table 3). 17

        In addition, we conducted a formal analysis of compliance with the lottery results. We

observe that students admitted to a TVET school are 50 percentage points more likely to

graduate from their assigned school than those not admitted, and 25 percentage points more

likely to graduate from their first ranked trade. These results indicate that, while compliance with

the lotteries was not perfect, there are sufficient differences between groups to enable estimation

of impacts (see Appendix Tables 4 and 5).



6. Results

        We begin by examining the impact of admission to a TVET school on educational

outcomes, followed by an analysis of the impact on employment and earnings. We then consider

the effects on intermediate outcomes which may explain possible pathways for our estimates on

labor market outcomes. We will also show separate impacts by gender because men and women

are likely to experience the labor market differently, and by cohort in order to account for different

conditions upon entry to the labor market. Finally, we will often restrict attention to applicants to

2-year vocational programs since we do not have sufficient sample sizes to examine 1-year

programs separately.




17
   We also estimated these "balance tests" on baseline variables using the full sample with similar results. An
alternative approach to deal with attrition would be to construct Lee-bounds.

6.1. Impacts on Education

          Table 3 shows the impact of admission to a TVET evaluation school on education overall

and by type of program (1 year or 2-year). 18 Applicants to 2-year programs who were admitted to

a TVET evaluation school were significantly more likely to enroll and graduate from a TVET

school. Applicants who were admitted to 2-year programs were 19 percent more likely to enroll in

a TVET school and 29 percent more likely to graduate from a TVET school compared to those

who were not admitted. On average, they also received 3 additional months of vocational training

over those who were not admitted. The differences in the number of months enrolled in any

educational program was substantially lower at only 0.6 months because many of those not

admitted did enroll in other programs.

The educational impacts for applicants to 1-year programs are mostly smaller and less significant,

although the effect on enrollment is not substantially different. The absence of significant effects

for 1-year programs is a direct consequence of the smaller samples sizes which makes it more

at the corresponding levels of the p-values: *** p<0.001, ** p<0.05, * p<0.01.

difficult to ascertain program impacts with confidence. Moreover, the impacts for the full sample

are extremely similar to those for 2-year programs because the sample size is substantially larger

than for 1-year programs. Consequently, in the subsequent tables which consider impacts

separately by cohort and gender, we focus only on applicants to 2-year programs.

                                              We also consider the differential impacts of admission to 2-year TVET programs on

education by cohort. The impacts are fairly similar across cohorts, albeit slightly smaller for the

2010 cohort. In Figure 1 and Figure 2 below, we show the cumulative enrollment and graduation

rates from vocational schools at 6-month intervals by cohort for applicants who were admitted

and rejected by the lottery:

                                              We observe the increase in enrollment in vocational schools almost immediately after

admission to TVET programs while the increase in graduation appears about two years after

admission. For both measures, there are clear and persistent differences between applicants

admitted and rejected by the lottery in subsequent months.

                                              The patterns of enrollment in any educational program differ markedly from the

enrollment specifically in vocational schools. When we compare enrollment rates for admitted

and non-admitted individuals over time in Figure 3, we see that admitted students are more likely

to be enrolled during the 2 years following admission, at which point the pattern reverses with

those non-admitted more likely to be enrolled subsequently. Eventually, the enrollment rates

converge and the differences between admitted and non-admitted individuals become small.




                                                                                        19

If we calculate cumulative enrollment rates, as in Figure 4, we see that admitted students are always

more likely to be enrolled than those non-admitted but essentially convergence by the third year

following admission.

The estimated impacts on education outcomes are markedly different by gender. As shown in

Table 4 below, the impact of admission to 2-year programs is almost twice as large for females

as for males across all our educational outcomes:

For example, female applicants who were admitted to 2-year programs were exposed to 4.2

additional months of vocational training compared to only 2.2 additional months for their male

counterparts.

          To summarize the results from this section, we find strong evidence that admission to

TVET evaluation schools led to significant increases in enrollment, graduation, and months of

exposure to vocational education. The impacts are substantially larger for females than for males

but similar across cohorts.

6.2. Employment

          A serious challenge in examining early labor market outcomes for this population is that

some individuals may still be enrolled in educational programs at the time of the survey. As shown

previously, individuals who were admitted to vocational schools are less likely to be enrolled in

an educational program than those who were not admitted at the time of the GFU survey. Thus,




                                                      21
any impacts on current employment need to be interpreted with care. 19 But given that cumulative

enrollment rates are very similar for admitted and non-admitted individuals at the time of the GFU

survey, measures of ever being employed are likely to be more reliable. Indeed, the number of

months enrolled in any education program is even higher for admitted students than those not

admitted suggesting we might have expected to observe lower employment rates among admitted

students for the likelihood of being employed. Furthermore, estimates using the later tracking

surveys for the 2010 and 2011 cohorts will generally be less affected by this issue.

         Table 5 below shows the impacts of admissions to a TVET evaluation school for the whole

sample and by program at the time of the GFU survey. Admission has a significant effect on

employment for 2-year participants. Those admitted through the lottery were 4 percent more likely

to be employed in a paid job and 9 percent more likely to have held a paid job lasting longer than

one month.

19
  As a possible robustness check for this measure, we also estimate the impact on employment for the subsample of
individuals who are not currently enrolled. Of course, this sample restriction suffers from non-random selection into
who chooses to enroll in an educational program.


                                                         22
The impacts for applicants to 1-year programs are positive, with a surprisingly large magnitude

for current employment in a paid job lasting longer than one month. However, as with the results

for education outcomes, none of the estimates for applicants to 1-year programs are significant.

As a result, all the tables that follow focus on applicants to 2-year programs.

                                The differential impacts of admission to 2-year programs by cohort are available by

request. However, it is worth noting that the impacts on employment are large and significant for

the 2010 and 2011 cohorts but essentially zero for the 2012 cohort (except for ever having been

employed in a paid or unpaid job of any duration). In Figure 5 below, we show the cumulative

employment rates at 6-month intervals by cohort for applicants who were admitted and rejected

by the lottery:

The patterns above depict a gradual increase in employment up to one year after admission to

TVET programs with differences between admitted and rejected applicants appearing by the end

of the period. There are also some apparent differences in both the level and differences by cohort,




                                                                         23
with substantial declines for later cohorts. This is confirmed in the table below showing that the

large impacts on employment are driven by the 2010 and 2011 cohorts:

         Table 7 below shows effects on employment for 2-year programs by gender. The positive

impacts of being admitted to an evaluation school through the lottery are substantially stronger for

female applicants. Admitted females are 15 percent more likely to have ever been employed for

longer than 1 month, whereas the (marginally significant) difference for males is just 5 percent.

We also examined impacts using the Tracking survey in later years for applicants from the 2010

and 2011 cohorts. Table 8 below shows employment outcomes from the 2014 Tracking survey for

the 2010 cohort and the 2015 Tracking survey for the 2011 cohort, to show employment outcomes

one year after their respective GFU surveys:

The effects of being admitted to a TVET evaluation school on employment remain large and

significant one year after the GFU survey, especially for females. Women were 19 percent more

likely to ever have been gainfully employed for longer than 1 month, compared with 8 percent for

males. Overall, applicants admitted to TVET schools were 13 percent more likely to be currently

employed than those not admitted.

        To summarize, there is strong evidence that admission to a TVET school leads to higher

employment. While these impacts are significant for both men and women, the magnitudes are

substantially larger for women, both in absolute levels and in terms of percentage impacts. There

is also some evidence that impacts on employment are larger for later cohorts and grow over time.

6.3. Earnings

         As with employment, our estimates of earnings are likely to be affected by differences in

enrollment rates between individuals who were and were not admitted to vocational schools.

Again, our estimates of impacts on current earnings using the GFU survey need to be interpreted

with care. On the other hand, the measures of total earnings to date and average monthly earnings

to date are probably less affected and the estimates using the subsequent tracking surveys for the

2010 and 2011 cohorts will also be less affected. We begin by presenting the impact of admission

to a TVET evaluation school on earnings, overall and by program 20:

The magnitudes of the impacts are all positive, and especially large for those associated with the

1-year programs. However, none of the coefficients is significant, with the exception of marginal

significance for monthly earnings if currently employed.

         We have examined the differential impacts by cohort for applicants to 2-year programs but

none of the coefficients are significant. Neither does Figure 6 below reveal much evidence of

  Note that we do not estimate log earnings regression as our main specification because there is a large fraction of
individuals with zero earnings (which would be dropped from the sample when applying logarithms). We have
estimated log earnings regression conditional on having positive earnings as well as log earnings regressions where
we arbitrarily assign a 1 to observations with 0 earnings, and these results are available by request.

         The impact of admission to 2-year programs is shown separately for males and females in

10 below. None of the estimates for men are significant and most are close to zero in terms of

percentage impacts. However, the impacts are large and significant for women across the various

measures of monthly earnings. Those who were admitted to a 2-year TVET program earned

approximately 27,000-30,000 MNT per month as compared to their counterparts who were not

admitted. These are also substantial in percentage terms, with 13-14% higher monthly earnings in

their most recent job and on average, and 27% higher monthly earnings if currently employed.

We also examine earnings outcomes from the Tracking survey for the 2010 and 2011 applicants

to 2-year programs, overall and by gender. As with employment, these outcomes are constructed

from the 2014 Tracking survey for the 2010 cohort and the 2015 Tracking survey for the 2011

cohort, to show earnings one year after their respective GFU surveys.

Looking one year after the GFU survey and approximately two years after students would have

graduated from their 2-year programs, we see further evidence of significant impacts on earnings

for females. Women who were admitted to a 2-year TVET program earned approximately 65,000

MNT per month more in their most recent job and on average as compared to those who were not

admitted. The difference in total earnings at the point of the tracking survey is over 550,000 MNT

and highly significant. These impacts are remarkably consistent in percentage terms, ranging from

25% to 26% across all four outcomes. As before, the estimates for men are not significant and

close to zero.

       To summarize, we find strong evidence that admission to TVET schooling increases

earnings for women in 2-year programs, and these impacts appear to increase over time. There is

no evidence that admission to a TVET school improved earnings for men.

6.4. Intermediate outcomes

We investigated a number of intermediate outcomes to better understand the mechanisms

underlying the impacts on employment and earnings. All of the outcomes were reported in the




                                                29
GFU survey in the year after expected graduation and, for simplicity, these analyses are restricted

to individuals who applied to 2-year programs (estimates are similar when including applicants to

1-year programs).

         We begin by examining four outcomes related to the trades that individuals studied in

TVET schools: (1) their standardized scores on a test of trade-related knowledge in their top-

ranked trade, (2) their standardized scores on a test of trade-related knowledge in their 2nd-ranked

trade, (3) whether individuals were currently employed in a paid job of longer than 1 month related

to their TVET trade, and (4) whether individuals were ever employed in a paid job of longer than

1 month related to their TVET trade. The impacts of admission to a TVET school on these

outcomes are presented in Table 12 below:

 Tests of knowledge in the 1st and 2nd ranked trades are standardized to mean 0, standard deviation 1




We see clear evidence that males and females who gained admission to a TVET school showed

increased knowledge in their 1st ranked trade, with impacts of approximately 0.2 standard deviation

units. The absence of impacts for knowledge in the 2nd ranked trade are not surprising given that

so few students ended up studying them. On the other hand, only females were significantly more


                                                         30
likely to be employed in fields related to the trade they studied in a TVET school. While the

impacts are not significant for current employment, the percentage impacts are similar in

magnitude to those associated with being ever employed.

        We also examine several factors related to employment and work intensity: (1) whether

individuals applied for or were offered job, (2) total months employed in paid jobs of longer than

one month, (3) average number of days worked per month, and (4) average number of hours

worked per day. The impacts of admission to a TVET school on these outcomes are presented

below in Table 13:

Males and females who were admitted to a 2-year TVET program were significantly more likely

to apply for a job or receive a job offer, with similar percentage impacts. Furthermore, females

also worked significantly more days per month and hours per day relative to their counterparts

who were not admitted to these TVET programs. While the impacts for men are positive and

marginally significant for number of days worked, they are substantially smaller in magnitude and

percentage impacts. These patterns may partially explain why only women saw higher earnings as

a consequence of admission to TVET schools.

        Finally, we examine the type and sector of employment in more detail by considering the

following outcomes: (1) whether individuals are employed in internships, (2) whether individuals

are self-employed, (3) whether individuals are employed in the government sector, and (4) whether

individuals are employed in the private sector. 21 The impacts of admission to a TVET school on

these outcomes are presented in the table below:

While male applicants are much more likely to have an internship, female applicants are more

likely to be employed in the government sector, the private sector, or to be self-employed. Because

internships are unlikely to pay as well as government and private sector jobs, these differences by

gender may further explain why men did not experience the same earnings gains as women.



7. Conclusion

        This paper presents novel estimates for the effect of admission to formal vocational

secondary programs on labor market outcomes, based on a recent intervention in Mongolia. We


21
  There are additional employment types and employment sectors (e.g. military, non-profits) but these represent a
very small fraction of overall employment.


                                                        32
used public lotteries to determine whether applicants to 10 oversubscribed vocational schools were

accepted to their preferred trades in 2010, 2011, and 2012, and then followed up on these applicants

through 2015. We found that admission to oversubscribed vocational schools led to significantly

higher employment, especially for women. We also found that women who were admitted to

oversubscribed vocational schools had significantly higher earnings as compared to their

counterparts who were not admitted. These findings are largely consistent with the impact on

intermediate outcomes; we observe that admission to oversubscribed vocational schools led to

improved skills in specific trades for both men and women, and to greater work intensity and

increased employment opportunities in high-paying sectors for women.

       There is also some evidence suggesting that the impact of vocational training in Mongolia

depends on labor market conditions. When we observe positive impacts on labor market outcomes,

the impacts are substantially higher for earlier cohorts and disappear for the latest cohort which

entered the labor market during an economic downturn, especially for the mining industry. This

pattern speaks to the possibility that the vocational training may be less transferable to other

occupations in times of deteriorating labor market conditions. As noted by Goldin (2001) in

reference to the past American experience, "highly specific training [is]...more cost effective for

individuals who expect[ed] to spend their lives in the same place and in the same industry and

occupation".

       There are several directions for further research using this data. First, it would be

interesting to examine the impact of admission to specific vocational trades. This may help shed

light both on the heterogenous impacts for males vs. females (given the different composition of

trades by gender) and on the different impacts by cohort (given that certain trades may have been

more severely affected by the economic downturn). Second, it would be informative to examine


                                                33
the impact of admission to specific vocational schools, especially by the quality or selectivity of

these schools. This could be helpful for understanding whether the source of the positive impacts

is due to the vocational training per se, or simply the higher quality of the schools. Finally, it would

be extremely useful to conduct a further follow-up on these students to examine whether the short

and medium-term impact persist over time.
