                 WHAT DO RICH COUNTRIES TRADE WITH EACH OTHER?
               R&D AND THE COMPOSITION OF U.S. AND SWEDISH TRADE


                                   ABSTRACT
      A long tradition in international economics explains comparative advan-

 tage by differences between countries in their stage of development, or their

 endowments of land, labor, and capital, and suggests that universal develop-

 ment will reduce the importance of trade.    Sweden and the United States

 possess similar factor endowments and have converged in overall productivity,

 but their bilateral trade has grown.   The example of these two countries

 suggests that mutual technological progress may promote trade, with the new

 basis for specialization being the different technology levels or R&D inten-

 sities of the goods being traded, rather than the initial endowments.
