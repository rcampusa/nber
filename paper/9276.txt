                                              ABSTRACT

      The last decade has seen an outpouring of scholarship on the economics of the Great
Depression. If there is anything approaching a consensus, it is a synthetic view which admits a role
both for monetary policy mistakes and for the international monetary and financial system in
transmitting those destabilizing impulses to the rest of the world. It explains the speed and extent
of the subsequent decline in terms of both banking crises and the collapse of the gold standard,
which conspired in placing deflationary pressure to different degrees on different countries. And,
it explains the eventual recovery in terms of the abandonment of the gold standard, which facilitated
the pursuit of stabilizing monetary policies, but also in terms of the restoration of stability to banking
and financial systems, something that occurred at different times in different countries. One way
of understanding the veneer of disputation on this consensus is that different elements dominated
in different countries. For the United States, there is no denying the role of monetary policy
mistakes in the onset of the Depression, whereas for other countries international monetary
instability played the most important part.

        I may have been the only one who noticed that 2002 was the tenth anniversary of Golden

Fetters, these kind of things tending to have significance only for the author. Whatever impact

this volume may have had is due in no little part to the title, which invokes Keynes’ description

of the impact of the gold standard on economic policy during the 1930s. In fact, not everyone

thought that this title was particularly marketable. I recently rediscovered a letter, circa 1991,

from my editor at Oxford University Press. “‘Barry,” he wrote, “I have the impression that we

still don’t have a final title that we all like...’Golden Fetters’ sounds just a little old

fashioned...Permit me to suggest that you should consider the following: ‘World Finance in

Chaos: How the Gold Standard Contributed to, and Prolonged, the Great Depression, 1919-1939’

or ‘The Collapse of the World Financial System, 1919-1939.’” Some advice, it would seem, is

best ignored.

        This is not to say that scholars today necessarily agree that the gold standard was a central

factor in the Depression. Not all economists place the same emphasis as I on the implications of

the operation of the international monetary system. To be sure, it is now commonplace to regard

the depression of the 1930s as a global phenomenon, which is very different from the U.S.-

centric approach that long dominated the literature.2 It is now standard to test hypotheses by

       The literature when I first encountered it was dominated by the debate between Friedman
and Schwartz (1963) and Temin (1976), both of which focused on the United States.

comparing countries that experienced relatively mild and severe depressions and by asking

whether their contrasting experiences can be explained by differences in their policies. But it is

not universally agreed that the structure and operation of the interwar gold standard explain why

so many countries experienced sharp and disruptive downturns in the early 1930s, or that the

abandonment of the gold standard was the single most important factor shaping the course of

recovery.

       Indeed, the last decade has seen an outpouring of scholarship disputing virtually every

aspect of the conventional wisdom on the Great Depression. Where does it leave us? How much

has been learned? What questions remain to be addressed? In this lecture, as in my book (some

habits die hard), I organize my answers to these questions around the three phases of the

depression – the onset, the downward spiral, and the recovery.



1. The Onset of the Great Depression

       Four decades ago, Friedman and Schwartz (1963) made the case for U.S. monetary policy

as the key factor in the onset of the depression. As reviewers from Tobin (1965) to Romer and

Romer (1989) have observed, it is the depth and breadth of historical detail that renders their

account so compelling. The most difficult challenge for any analysis of money and output, and

hence for the monetary interpretation of the onset of the Great Depression, is the identification

problem.3 Friedman and Schwartz used historical detail to make the case that the monetary


Kindleberger (1973) was a notable exception to this generalization.
       3
       Temin famously made this point when he observed that a negative shock to output (an
autonomous fall in consumption in 1929) could in principle have caused the concurrent fall in
money, rather than a negative shock to money causing the fall in output.

                                                 2
shock was autonomous and the fall in output was induced – that causality ran from money to

output, in other words. They documented the Fed’s concern with excessive speculation and its

belief that the rise in share prices and the high level of turnover on the stock market were

diverting resources from more productive uses. They showed how this belief led the Fed to raise

the discount rate repeatedly, especially following the death of Benjamin Strong and the ascent of

Adolph Miller, a diehard believer in the dangers of speculative excesses. The implication was

that money was not tightened in response to the evolution of output.4 Rather, it was tightened in

response to developments largely unrelated to the movement of output and employment. The

monetary shock, in other words, was autonomous from this point of view.

       Friedman and Schwartz next argued that the untimely death of Strong and disputes among

regional reserve banks and between the reserve banks and the Federal Reserve Board prevented

policy from responding in its customary stabilizing fashion to the decline in industrial

production. The inexperienced Federal Reserve Board had never encountered an analogous

peacetime recession. Misinterpreting the real-bills doctrine, predisposed to a perverse and self-

fulfilling liquidationalist view of the business cycle, and preoccupied by the belief that monetary

ease might reignite speculation, it saw inaction as the appropriate policy response.5 Rather than

loosening as output declined, monetary policy remained essentially immobilized.



       4
        In particular, money was not tightened in response to the rapid growth of the mid-to-late
1920s, rapid growth which according to some theories could have been responsible for the
subsequent slump (thus causing money to respond to output, but not in ways that could be easily
picked up by Granger causality tests).
       5
        The roles of liquidationism, the real bills doctrine, and renewed speculation are
emphasized by, respectively, DeLong (1990), Meltzer (2002), and Calomiris and Wheelock
(1998).

                                                 3
       This, then, was evidence of an autonomous monetary shock, reflecting the operation of a

unique and unprecedented set of historical circumstances. This argument in turn encourages the

belief that monetary factors played an important role in the onset of the Depression.

       But there are problems with this U.S.-centered monetary interpretation of the slump.

While the tightening of monetary policy through the summer of 1929 was not particularly

dramatic, the subsequent decline in activity was.6 Recall that the Fed attempted to use “direct

action” to deny Wall Street credit for use in speculative activities. Rather than simply relying on

the classic device of a higher discount rate to reduce the volume of credit for use in financing

brokers’ loans (making it more expensive for banks to obtain credit from the Fed and thereby

forcing them to pass through that cost to their customers), it applied moral suasion to the banks.

It hesitated to make more active use of the conventional instruments and to tighten more sharply,

in other words. Essentially, this is another way of saying that the Fed did not tighten as

aggressively as it felt that conditions warranted.7 Thus, the first problem, to put it in the form of

a question, is: how could this modest monetary tightening produce such a sharp contraction in the



       6
         Ritschl and Woitek (2000) document this in a forecasting framework. Their time series
analysis suggests that the effects of the Fed’s discount policy remained “far too small to explain
the collapse in output after 1929" (p.11). To put these changes in perspective, I calculate that the
Fed has typically (since 1951) raised the discount rate by 425 basis points between the trough and
the peak of the business cycle (as dated by the NBER). By comparison, the tightening in 1928-
29 was 350 basis points, hardly out of the ordinary. (This comparison assumes, of course, that
the 1926-7 slowdown was a business cycle trough, a characterization which would not be
universally accepted.) The implication in the text only follows, of course, if one agrees that the
“direct action” part of the Fed’s initiative ultimately had little effect (which is my view).
       7
         Note that the same problem arises in the immediate post-crash period. The Fed actually
loosened quite significantly following the stock market crash, which makes it all the more
surprising that the economy contracted as rapidly as it did – although one can certainly argue,
with benefit of hindsight that it did not loosen far or fast enough.

                                                  4
United States?

       If the Fed’s modest monetary tightening was not obviously sufficient to explain the

unusually sharp downturn in U.S. economic activity, then it was even less sufficient to explain

the unusually sharp downturn in the rest of the world.8 This is the second problem: it is not clear

how modest monetary tightening in one country could have been responsible for the onset of a

depression that engulfed virtually the entire globe.

       The third problem is related: a number of other countries – Canada, Germany, Poland,

Argentina, Brazil, and Australia among them – turned down before the United States.9 The

model of international transmission in most older accounts – inspired by the IS-LM model with

low capital mobility that was the workhorse for multi-country macroeconomic thought

experiments in the 1960s and 1970s – is that the Fed’s tightening led to a deceleration in growth

in the United States, which in turn led the U.S. to import less, transmitting the slowdown to other

countries. Clearly, the actual sequence of events is all wrong for this story.10

       The gold standard – and the fact that capital mobility was anything but low in the 1920s –

helps to resolve all three paradoxes. Because capital was mobile and exchange rates were fixed,



       8
         The Institut fur Konjunkturforschung’s index of world industrial production fell by 10
per cent between 1929 and 1930. (The League of Nations’ index of mining and manufacturing
fell by 12 per cent.) By comparison, the largest fall since 1971 in the IMF’s index of world real
GDP was 1.5 per cent in 1982.
       9
        In Germany, for example, recent national product estimates show that the peak was
reached in 1928. Construction peaked in the summer of 1927, and the production of consumer
goods peaked in February 1928. See Ritschl (1997, 1999).
       10
          U.S. merchandise imports peak in the first half of 1929, not in the first half of 1928.
(There is another upward spike in U.S. imports in October 1929, but that appears to be a seasonal
effect.).

                                                  5
higher interest rates in the United States meant higher interest rates in the rest of the world as a

result of the operation of interest arbitrage. If market interest rates rose in the United States, they

also had to rise in other countries, as capital flowed toward the U.S. or at least flowed out of the

U.S. at a slower rate. If foreign central banks failed to follow the Fed in raising discount rates,

they would suffer reserve losses, jeopardizing the stability of their currencies. Because Europe

and Latin America had relatively weak balances of payments, reflecting the strengthened

competitive position in international markets for manufacturing exports acquired by the United

States during and after World War I and the weakness of agricultural and primary product prices

in the 1920s, their central banks could ill afford reserve losses. Because their commitment to the

gold standard was uncertain, reflecting the expansion of the franchise and the inability of populist

governments to subordinate other goals of policy to the overarching imperative of exchange rate

stabilization, the tendency for capital flows to reverse direction and now flow not from but to the

United States raised doubts about the stability of currencies elsewhere.11 This added a risk

premium to foreign interest rates. Central banks thus had to respond by raising rates even more

sharply to calm skittish investors. This is where the incomplete credibility of the interwar gold

standard enters the story.

       Consequently, the restrictive turn in monetary policy in the United States provoked an

even more restrictive turn in monetary policy elsewhere. The deceleration in the rate of money

growth in 1928 was even faster in Latin America and Europe than in the United States. The



       11
          Obstfeld and Taylor (2002) invoke this connection between gold standard credibility
and popular politics and provide supportive data for the interwar years. Flandreau, Le Cacheaux
and Zumer (1998) challenge the applicability of the thesis to the period before 1913, but that is a
different question.

                                                   6
same was again true in 1929. The only region for which this was not the case was East Asia, not

surprisingly since Australia had already begun to tinker with its gold standard (in 1929), and

Japan was not on the gold standard at all, except for a few months in 1930-1.

       Now consider again our three paradoxes. That the shock was a global monetary

contraction and not just a U.S. monetary contraction helps to explain why the U.S. economy

turned down so sharply. Exports were the first component of aggregate demand to begin falling,

indicative of the impact of the contraction in the rest of the world on the United States. That

foreign central banks had to respond sharply helps to explain why foreign cycles peaked even

earlier. The one factor that insulated U.S. economic activity from the effects of higher Federal

Reserve discount rates, namely the reversal of U.S. capital exports, further explains why other

countries began to contract before the United States. It is revealing that the countries whose

business cycle peaks preceded that of the U.S. had been capital importers in the 1920s. And, of

course, a global monetary shock works better than a U.S. monetary shock in explaining a global

recession.

       There are two objections to this line of argumentation. First, other factors could have

mattered more than tighter money for the onset of the depression. Second, even if tighter money

was responsible, interest rates in other countries could have risen for unrelated reasons; the

tightening of monetary policy elsewhere, it could be argued, did not result from the international

transmission by the gold standard of tighter money in the United States.

       The operation of other factors was clearly evident in France, as I observed in my book

and Clark Johnson (1998) emphasized in his. The Poincare stabilization raised French real

interest rates in the second half of 1926, as inflation came down but nominal interest rates


                                                 7
remained stuck in positive territory. Higher real rates clearly made France a more attractive place

for portfolio capital; hence, funds flowed toward it and away from other countries. High real

rates also made consumption and investment less attractive, strengthening the French current

account. Lower nominal interest rates, for their part, stimulated the demand for money, which

could be met only by running a payments surplus and attracting gold from the rest of the world,

given the reluctance of the Bank of France to expand domestic credit.12 For its own reasons,

then, France was an independent source of monetary deflation in the second half of the 1920s.

       Germany is the other important country for which a case can be made (Balderston 1993,

Ritschl 1999). The president of the Reichsbank, Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht, also became

convinced of the dangers of a speculative bubble in the spring of 1927 and tightened credit (Voth

2002).13 It is no coincidence that Schacht embraced a model similar to that of the governors of

the Federal Reserve System; the leading central banks were in regular contact in the second half



       12
         While the French central bank’s revised statute limited the scope for conventional
expansionary open market operations, it still could have expanded domestic credit by
unconventional means such as purchasing foreign exchange on the open market. Preoccupied
with inflation to the point of phobia, however, it hesitated to do so. If this reference to the need
to use unconventional means and to the central bank’s neurotic preoccupation with inflation
reminds readers of the Bank of Japan in the 1990s, my wording will have accomplished its goal.
       13
          Schacht was also concerned about the high level of foreign borrowing; he saw the stock
market boom in Berlin and expansion in Germany in general as being fueled by unsustainable
capital inflows, which added to the country’s already unsustainable external obligations, thereby
setting the economy up for an even more painful future fall. The dilemma, then, was the same as
that facing any central banker confronting a problem of capital inflows: higher interest rates
might eventually prick the stock market bubble, but in the meantime they would only encourage
further capital inflows (as they did, in the German case, until the Fed responded in 1928 with
further increases in its discount rate). Schacht’s preferred solution, which is the medicine
nowadays recommended for countries experiencing difficult-to-manage capital inflows, was
fiscal restraint, but this was not something he could force on free-spending municipal
governments or Reich authorities feeling pressure from a variety of special interest groups.

                                                  8
of the 1920s. Schacht too resorted to a policy of direct pressure, meeting with the directors of the

big Berlin banks to express his concerns. Tighter money and credit succeeded in pushing down

the German stock market, as Schacht intended, but they also pushed down the German economy,

which was presumably not his intention.14

       The other objection to the gold standard story is that it was not monetary policy but other

shocks and imbalances that caused the slump. This returns us to the debate between Friedman

and Schwartz and Temin; indeed, it returns us to what was the debate in the 1930s. After

experiencing the 1990s, observers are perhaps less inclined to find explanations for the downturn

in an autonomous fall in consumption spending and more likely to consider a role for the credit

boom, the stock market bubble and real estate speculation, for excessive optimism about the

commercial potential of information and communications technologies (in the 1920s, radio; in

the 1990s, the Internet), and for the naive belief that recessions had become a thing of the past.

They see parallels, in other words, between the “new economy” of the 1990s and the “new age”

of the 1920s. The culprit could have been technological change creating structural imbalances

that left the economy vulnerable to destabilizing shocks. Many old industries were financially

fragile, and new ones like radio were not yet profitable. Thus, even a minor shock, whatever its

source, could create financial stress. This is the story told by Bernstein (1987) and elaborated by

Szostak (1995). Alternatively, the culprit could have been overinvestment in property, which left

financial institutions exposed and bequeathed a legacy of inappropriately subdivided tracts that

depressed productivity through the 1930s (Field 1992).



       14
       This line of argument also addresses a problem noted by Temin (1971), that the German
economy started turning down even before capital outflows from the U.S. were curtailed.

                                                 9
       These interpretations tend to be sector and country specific. They focus on sectors like

radio, electricity, and residential construction and on a particular country, the United States.15

Unfortunately, it is not clear how sector-specific factors could have produced such a pronounced

economy-wide slump or how country-specific factors could have produced such a sharp global

downturn. These alternatives thus reproduce a problem with the earlier literature: they are U.S.-

centric, analogous stories being harder to tell for the rest of the world. And, as an explanation for

global macroeconomic trends, they lack a propagation mechanism.

       One way of attempting to knit these stories together is by applying “the Bank for

International Settlements view” to the 1920s. The BIS view, as informed by the experience of

the 1990s, is that pronounced credit booms set the stage for sharp economic downturns,

sometimes marked by financial crises. Borio and Lowe (2002) develop indicators of credit

booms – based on the rate of growth of bank credit, stock market valuations, and the investment

ratio – and show that recessions and crises are most likely to follow when these indicators rise

relative to trend. Their story runs as follows. Loose credit conditions, produced by lax monetary

policy at the center and a combination of pegged exchange rates and implicit guarantees for bank

depositors at the periphery, fuel indiscriminate increases in bank lending. The quality of bank

assets deteriorates, and when equity valuations and investment activity are disturbed by a shock

to confidence or a disturbance to the real economy, the banking system is forced to retrench. As

firms are denied external finance, an unusually rapid decline in economic activity follows,

causing further distress in the financial system. Capital flows reverse direction as investors begin



       15
       Similar country-specific stories are sometimes told for the UK (Heim 1984), but from a
macroeconomic point of view their limitations are the same.

                                                  10
to doubt the security of bank deposits and the stability of the currency. In the worst case, both

banking and currency stability are threatened.

       Together with Kris Mitchener, I have constructed composite indicators of credit

conditions for the 1920s (as in Borio and Lowe’s work for the 1990s, a weighted average of

credit growth, stock market valuations, and the investment ratio).16 As shown in Figure 1, the

composite indicator rises relative to trend after 1927, signaling turbulence ahead.17 And, of

course, currency and banking crises followed. The larger the credit boom circa 1928 (that is, the

greater the rise in the actual value of the composite indicator relative to trend), the larger the

subsequent fall in per capita GDP, as shown in Figure 2. We see from the figure that the credit

boom-subsequent depression relationship is first and foremost a U.S. story, but a number of other

countries also experienced pronounced credit booms in the late 1920s, Canada, France, and Italy

among them, and suffered the consequences subsequently. Multiple regressions including

controls for other country characteristics influencing their susceptibility to the international

slump (the size of the current account deficit in 1928, for example) do not weaken this

relationship.18 Evidently, the transmission mechanism from the credit boom to the economic

slump resembles that sketched by the BIS in its studies of the credit-boom episodes of the 1980s


       16
        The weights are based on the signal-noise ratio of the indicators – in other words, on the
number of crises that are corrected predicted by each indicator out of sample, relative to the
number of false positives, where the critical value taken as signaling a crisis is chosen to
maximize the probability of success.
       17
        This international average is the unweighted average of the 16 country cases for which
complete data are available.
       18
         The typical t-statistic on the value of the composite indicator in 1928 in such a multiple
regression is consistent with statistical significance at the 95 but not the 99 per cent confidence
level. For details, see Eichengreen and Mitchener (2003).

                                                  11
and 1990s.

       Credit booms had littered the 19th century financial landscape, of course. They feature

prominently in Sprague’s (1910) history of U.S. crises, and other countries, like Argentina in the

1880s, similarly displayed all the classic symptoms.19 Typically, a combination of lax domestic

credit conditions and capital inflows fueled a railway- or public-utility-related construction

boom, investment in which was encouraged by government guarantees. All this will be

unsurprising to economists familiar with more recent experience.

       Why, then, did none of these late-19th century episodes produce a slump as deep, long,

and widespread as the 1930s? The competing answers focus, predictably, on U.S. and foreign

policies. Before 1913, Treasury operations were capable of some monetary fine tuning, but there

was no central bank to behave in strongly destabilizing fashion. The prewar gold standard

imposed automatic limits on the extent of credit fluctuations. In the 1920s, in contrast, an

additional element of discretion was introduced. The Fed kept interest rates too low for too long,

allowing the credit boom to develop, before ratcheting them up sharply. The key mistake in this

view was at least as much that monetary policy was too loose before 1927 as that it was too tight

later. The problem was not merely the gold standard, in other words; it was gold standard

management.

       The limitation of this argument, once again, is that it does not explain why other countries

responded in like fashion. Against the backdrop of “new age economics,” it can explain the U.S.

credit boom but not the global credit boom, unless we are prepared to assume that low interest



       19
        This was of course the period leading up to the default in Buenos Aires that precipitated
the famous Baring Crisis in London (Eichengreen 1999).

                                                 12
rates in a country accounting for less than a quarter of global output and 15 per cent of world

exports can explain financial developments throughout the world.

        Foreign policies were to blame insofar as other central banks similarly allowed interest

rates to remain too low for too long. Countries like Britain were already suffering double-digit

unemployment, and raising interest rates would have only added to the problems of a politically-

challenged Conservative Government. Part of what the governor of the Bank of England,

Montagu Norman, meant when he described the Bank as continuously “under the harrow” was

the political pressure he felt not to raise interest rates even when doing was dictated by gold

standard considerations.20 Germany, for its part, had a moral hazard problem: tighter credit

which strengthened the balance of payments undermined the argument that the country was

incapable of meeting its reparations obligations. The problem, in this view, was not so much

misguided policy in the United States as the politicization of policy in other countries.

       Central banks’ ill-conceived efforts to cooperate may have contributed to this situation.

Benjamin Strong understood that his foreign counterparts, in particular Norman, were under

pressure not to raise interest rates. If no other change took place, this might raise questions about

the credibility of Britain’s commitment to the gold standard. This was the motivation for the



       20
          For those who recall textbook accounts in which the instability of the 1920s was a result
of misaligned exchange rates – and specifically of Winston Churchill’s ill-advised decision to
restore sterling’s prewar parity in 1925 – this is where these factors enter the story. Sterling’s
overvaluation compounded the problem of British unemployment and balance-of-payments
weakness. More generally, the failure of central banks to force prices back down to prewar
levels before restoring convertibility at the prewar rate of exchange forced the interwar system to
operate on a narrower gold basis – the real value of existing gold stocks would have been higher
had price levels been lower – in the event leaving less margin for error. The resulting global gold
shortage continues to be emphasized by authors writing in the tradition of Cassel (see Johnson
1998 and Mundell 2000).

secret meeting of central bankers on Long Island in May of 1927 – the 1920s analog of “the

committee to save the world.” Rather than forcing the Bank of England to raise rates, as

dictated by the “rules of the game,” as a result of that meeting the Fed agreed to lower it’s. It was

at this point that the credit boom and the Wall Street bubble began to get out of hand.

       This brings us to the role of central bank cooperation in the depression. My emphasis on

need for cooperation to sustain the interwar gold standard when it came under threat and on its

inadequacy as a factor contributing to its collapse has come in for critical scrutiny (Flandreau

1997, Moure 2002). The critics argue that cooperation was never really prevalent before 1913,

and that cooperation in the 1920s was in fact part of the problem, not part of the solution. I think

these disagreements reflect a misunderstanding.21 When analyzing the pre-1913 gold standard, I

pointed to the importance of “regime-preserving cooperation.” The argument was not that

central banks cooperated continuously when setting interest rates but that the leading central

banks and governments supported one another with emergency assistance in times of crisis. This

prevented the collapse of any one key currency from jeopardizing the entire system and limited

the domestic financial repercussions. It prevented pressures on particular currencies from

provoking systemic crises of the sort that erupted in the 1930s.22 It was this regime-preserving

cooperation that was missing in the 1931, when the Bank of France hesitated to assist its



       21
         In addition, I think that the critics exaggerate the role of international factors in
explaining the Fed’s interest-rate cut in 1927. In addition, the Fed was responding to the
slowdown in industrial production (as Henry Ford shut down his assembly lines to retool for the
Model A) and to distress in the agricultural Midwest due to depressed farm prices. There was a
large element of unilateralism and self-interest, in other words, in the Fed’s 1927 interest rate cut,
as opposed to international motives.
       22
            As I describe below.

                                                 14
Austrian and German counterparts and the BIS was prevented from doing so for a time by the

dispute over reparations, Germany’s program of building pocket battle ships, and the proposal for

a Austro-German customs union (the latter in contravention of the Versailles Treaty). There is

no contradiction between the argument that the absence of regime-preserving cooperation was

part of the problem in the 1930s, but that misguided cooperation of a different sort was equally

problematic in the 1920s.



2. The Downward Spiral

       As output and asset prices began falling, banks experienced financial distress. Since

borrowers’ obligations were fixed in nominal terms, the fall in incomes led to a rise in

nonperforming loans. Rising concern over the stability of the gold standard then led investors to

substitute gold for financial assets where doing so was permitted and central banks to liquidate

their foreign exchange reserves to avoid suffering capital losses in the event that reserve

currencies were devalued.

       Under these circumstances, the gold standard became an engine of deflation. Money

supplies were a multiple of the international reserve backing of central banks and governments.

That backing contracted as central banks, fearful for the stability of the gold standard, liquidated

their foreign their exchange reserves. Central banks whose obligations were reserve currencies,

suffering corresponding reserve losses, raised their discount rates to defend their parities.23


       23
         As the Fed did, for example, in September-October 1931 following Britain’s
abandonment of the gold standard – see below. Say that the National Bank of Belgium sought to
liquidate its holdings of British treasury bills, and to replace them with gold in order to avoid
suffering capital losses on the former. It would sell those bills on the British market for sterling
and present that sterling to the Bank of England for conversion into gold. The Bank of England,

                                                 15
Higher interest rates heightened the distress experienced by commercial banks with maturity

mismatches on their balance sheets. They consequently sought to rebuild their liquidity and

reserves by calling in loans. Depositors, with fears about the liquidity of the banks, fled into

currency.

       Bernanke and Mihov (2000) decompose this process by writing the money stock (M1) as

follows:



       M1 = (M1/BASE) x (BASE/INTRES) x (INTRES/GOLD) x GOLD



where BASE is currency in circulation plus the reserves of commercial banks, INTRES is the

country’s international reserves (gold plus foreign exchange), and GOLD is the value of gold

reserves denominated in domestic currency. The preceding discussion suggests that most of the

action in this product should have come from the first and third terms.24 The first term, the

money multiplier, will fall as the worsening prospects of financial institutions lead depositors to

flee into cash and banks to call in their loans. The third ratio, the international reserve multiplier



experiencing gold losses, would then have to raise interest rates to limit the deterioration of its
position. The National Bank of Belgium, to minimize its own reserve losses, would presumably
respond in kind. The net effect would be a decline in reserve backing (since foreign exchange
reserves had declined but the amount of gold in the international system was fixed) and higher
interest rates all around – two indications of deflationary pressure. In fact, the Belgian case is an
interesting one. The British authorities lobbied the National Bank to hold onto its sterling, as a
result of which the Belgian authorities suffered extensive capital losses when sterling was
ultimately devalued.
       24
         In the short run, we can take the second term as given by the backing rules under which
the gold standard operated in each country, and the fourth term as fixed, reflecting the lagged
response of the gold-mining industry.

                                                  16
(total international reserves relative to gold), will fall as central banks liquidate their foreign

currency assets.

        How important were these components in producing the observed decline in money

stocks? The INTRES/GOLD ratio fell from 1.27 at the end of 1929 to 1.25 at the end of 1930

and 1.12 at the end of 1931 in 26 countries (the 24 countries considered in Nurkse (1944),

Appendix II, plus the United States and the United Kingdom). Other things equal, this implies a

12 per cent fall in global money supplies centered in calendar year 1931. If we exclude the U.S.

and the UK, the principal reserve-currency countries (the ratio being fixed in the countries

issuing rather than holding foreign exchange reserves), the INTRES/GOLD ratio falls from 1.60

at the end of 1929 to 1.53 at the end of 1930 and 1.23 at the end of 1931. For countries other

than the reserve centers, the corresponding fall in money supplies was then 23 per cent, ceteris

paribus.

        While the INTRES/GOLD ratio fell across the board (except in the U.S. and the UK for

the aforementioned institutional reasons), the change in M1/BASE varied more across countries.

Bernanke (1995) analyzes data for six countries, of which the largest fall was in the United States

(25 per cent), but in two of which (the UK and Sweden) the ratio instead rose between the end of

1929 and the end of 1931.25 The weighted average for Bernanke’s six countries (weighted by

1929 money supplies expressed in U.S. dollars) declined by 21 per cent. The weighted average

excluding the U.S. was 11 per cent. I undertook a broader comparison for a total of 31 countries;

in this larger sample, the weighted average decline excluding the U.S. (30 countries) was 10 per


        25
         Of course, these were two of the countries that went off the gold standard toward the
end of 1931. But the other two countries considered, Poland and Belgium, did not experience
declines in the M1/BASE ratio approaching that of the United States.

                                                   17
cent.26

          Evidently, then, the liquidation of foreign exchange reserves played a more important role

than the liquidation of bank deposits in the monetary contraction outside the United States. The

U.S. was unusual in that the percentage fall in the M1/BASE ratio was larger than the percentage

fall in the INTRES/GOLD ratio.27 (Recall that as the issuer of a reserve currency, the Fed, like

the Bank of England, held no foreign-exchange reserves.) It is tempting to say that for the rest of

the world the collapse of the gold-exchange standard mattered more than the collapse of the

banking system, while the opposite was true for the United States. It is not surprising from this

point of view that the literature on the global depression focuses on the gold standard while that

on the United States concentrates on the banking crisis.

          One should be cautious here, since banking and currency crises were related. Currency

crises in other countries were one factor forcing the Fed to ratchet up interest rates in the final

months of 1931, contributing to the U.S. banking crises. In countries experiencing both kinds of

crisis, the banking crisis typically became evident before the currency crisis. All of the banking-

crisis episodes identified by Bernanke and James (1991) begin before the corresponding currency

crises in the same countries. This same pattern – banking crises first, currency crises second – is



          26
          The 30 countries in question were Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile,
Colombia, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Estonia, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary,
Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Uruguay. Again, I took the weighted average by
converting M1 and the base into dollars at market exchange rates.
          27
          In the U.K., in contrast, the M1/BASE ratio rose slightly between the end of 1929 and
the end of 1930 and fell slightly between the end of 1930 and the end of 1931, hence remaining
essentially unchanged over the period. This stability reflects the absence of serious banking-
sector problems in Britain, an issue to which I return subsequently.

                                                  18
also typical of twin crises today.28 When deposits hemorrhage out of the banking system, the

government and the central bank find themselves between a rock and a hard place. In the 1930s,

providing large amounts of liquidity to the banking system almost certainly would have violated

gold-standard statutes; doing so would have raised questions about whether the authorities

attached priority to the maintenance of the exchange rate peg relative to other social and

economic goals. But not doing so might have allowed the banking system to come crashing

down, with even more disruptive effects on economic activity. Except in the United States,

where they remained strangely unperturbed, the authorities generally took steps to prevent the

collapse of banking systems. In Germany and Austria, for example, they injected just enough

domestic credit to keep the principal banks afloat, thereby limiting the fall in the money

multiplier. But doing so undermined confidence in the stability of the currency, provoking

capital flight and encouraging the continued conversion of foreign exchange reserves into gold,

thereby accelerating the fall of the gold-reserve multiplier. Again, it follows that the main engine

of deflation was the banking crisis in the United States but the currency crisis in other countries.

       One of the conventional critiques of the literature on twin crises is that timing does not

prove causality.29 That a banking crisis becomes evident before a currency crisis does not prove

that the former caused the latter. It could be that anticipations of a subsequent currency crisis led

savers to liquidate domestic-currency-denominated deposits and flee into foreign exchange in




       28
            This is the famous finding of Kaminsky and Reinhart (1998).
       29
          Recall that this is the same critique of timing evidence on money and output, alluded to
in the preceding discussion of Friedman and Schwartz’s discussion of monetary factors in the
onset of the Depression and made explicit in Tobin (1965).

                                                 19
order to avoid capital losses due to the eventual devaluation.30 Ferguson and Temin (2001) show

that Germany was running chronic budget deficits in the first half of 1931 and reason that

expectations that these would be monetized, leading to a currency crisis, provoked the deposit

withdrawals of May and June.31 Wigmore (1984) argues that anticipations of Roosevelt’s

decision to take the dollar off gold led to the run on U.S. banks in the interregnum between

FDR’s election and assumption of office. The judicious conclusion, then as now, is that the

causality between banking and currency crises was bidirectional.

       If expectations of depreciation could destabilize a banking system, then the fact of

depreciation could be broadly stabilizing. Going off the gold standard freed up monetary policy.

It allowed the central bank to cut interest rates, relieving banking sector distress. Grossman

(1994) contrasts a number of explanations for why some countries succeeded in averting banking

crises in the 1930s. The single most important factor, he finds, was whether a country had

abandoned the gold standard, allowing the central bank to engage more freely in lender-of-last-

resort operations and to jump-start the recovery. This seems to have been the case in capital-

importing and capital-exporting economies and in industrial and developing countries alike.

       This is in contrast to the experience of the 1990s, when capital-importing emerging

markets saw their financial systems and economies destabilized by depreciation. Why didn’t



       30
         This dynamic was evident in Argentina in the final months of 2001, for example,
although the deposit withdrawals were not enough to provoke a full-blown banking crisis prior to
the actual devaluation.
       31
          The authors argue that Bruening’s references to a reparations moratorium worked in the
same direction. Of course, there is a sense in which the reparations tangle and German budget
deficits were two sides of the same coin; strengthening the budget would have weakened the
argument that Germany could not pay.

                                                20
depreciation in the 1930s have similarly destabilizing effects? One can think of several potential

explanations.

!      Foreign deposits were widespread but foreign-currency-denominated deposits were less.

       This was at least one favorable legacy of the gold standard, insofar as a history of fixed

       rates made it seem less imperative for foreign depositors to avoid currency risk.

!      Foreign-currency denominated loans to the banks’ domestic clients were similarly less

       prevalent. Hence, depreciation did not destroy the balance sheets of the corporate sector

       and aggravate the problem of nonperforming loans.

!      Not a few countries with foreign obligations responded to exchange market pressures by

       slapping on currency and exchange controls – in effect, they responded like Malaysia in

       1998. This allowed the authorities to inject credit into the banking system without

       precipitating the uncontrolled collapse of the currency. Decoupling from international

       financial markets made more sense in the 1930s than the 1990s because the market for

       new foreign issues was effectively shut down.

!      Finally, a number of countries substituted clear and coherent monetary policy operating

       strategies for the gold-standard anchor. Sweden adopted a price level target not

       dissimilar from the inflation targeting regime that has become a popular approach to

       anchoring floating exchange rates in recent years. Britain adopted a dirty float consistent

       with an exchange rate that remained stable over the intermediate run. The

       Commonwealth and many of Britain’s trading partners adopted a policy of following the

       pound, albeit more loosely than before, forming what came to be known as the Sterling

       Area. Thus, fears that abandoning the gold standard would unleash another round of


                                                21
       uncontrolled inflation were quickly dispatched. This helped to revive confidence in

       banking systems.

       All this assumes that the gold standard was a binding constraint on stabilizing

intervention and that its abandonment was a precondition for the adoption of reflationary

policies. Any attempt to unilaterally reduce interest rates or to unilaterally engage in

expansionary open market operations would have precipitated capital outflows and reserve losses

that endangered the exchange rate peg. Here was where the absence of international cooperation

was an issue. A unilateral interest rate reduction would cause capital to flow toward other,

higher interest rate markets, endangering the exchange rate of the initiating country, but there

was no reason why simultaneous reductions by several countries would weaken any one currency

relative to another.

       The United States was the one country that arguably was not prevented from taking

unilateral monetary action. Controversy here centers on the open market operations of April-

August 1932 and whether they were abandoned as a result of fears that continued security

purchases would lead to continued reserve losses, to the point where the dollar would be

attacked.32 This episode has been revisited by Bordo, Choudhri and Schwartz (1999) and Hsieh

and Romer (2001), who question whether the open market purchases of the spring and summer



       32
          There is less dispute over the two other periods where the gold standard allegedly
inhibited the pursuit of more expansionary policies. The first time was in 1931, following
Britain’s devaluation, when the Fed had to hold gold not just to back its own liabilities but also
government securities in its portfolio; this was the problem of free gold eliminated by the Glass-
Steagall Act of February 1932. No one to my knowledge has disputed that the Fed needed to
raise rates in the wake of Britain’s devaluation in order to maintain confidence in the dollar. The
second time was in January-February 1933, when excess reserves fell to zero and there is no
question that the gold standard bound.

                                                 22
created expectations of dollar devaluation or induced the Fed to draw to curtail those operations

in order to prevent the emergence of such expectations. This is not the place to become

embroiled in this controversy.33 But that controversy is one more sign that the United States was

different; again, the gold standard mattered less, while banking crises – and the failure of the

authorities to do what was in their capacity to avert them – mattered more in this, the second

stage of the Great Contraction.



3. The Recovery

       This perspective implicating monetary blunders and constraints in the onset of the slump

suggests a role for corrective monetary action in the recovery. Just as the gold standard


       33
          Bordo, Choudhri and Schwartz (1999) simulate a calibrated price-specie flow model
and show that further increases in domestic credit, undertaken either in October 1930-February
1931 or September 1931-January 1932 would not have exhausted the Fed’s excess gold reserves
because the Fed held ample amounts of excess gold. This assumes a linear relationship between
domestic credit creation and reserve losses of a sort that will be familiar to readers from the
monetary approach to the balance of payments. The authors raise but rule out the possibility of a
speculative attack, which, in balance-of-payments crisis models like Krugman (1979), produce a
sharp nonlinearity when reserves fall to a lower threshold. In effect, this rules out a priori the
central problem of concern to those who see fears for the stability of the dollar as possibly
constraining the Fed. Hsieh and Romer argue that there was little perceived likelihood, either in
the markets or in the corridors of the Fed, that such an attack was pending. Their evidence
mainly concerns forward foreign exchange rates; they show that the forward discount adjusted
for trend reversion implied a maximum probability of 11 per cent of a major U.S. devaluation in
the summer of 1932. The forward discount displayed no significant correlation with open market
operations. And, their measure suggests that expectations of a major dollar devaluation actually
dropped during the latter part of the Fed’s expansionary program. I would require more evidence
on the volume of activity in the forward market, and on how these forward quotations are
constructed, before being convinced. There is also the question of whether the Fed aborted its
program for fear of destabilizing the dollar before a larger discount was allowed to emerge, and
whether expectations of this action were what caused the discount to narrow in July. Hsieh and
Romer’s qualitative discussion speaks to this question; it focuses on the Harrison Papers, which
do not suggest significant concern within the Fed about the danger to the dollar. But Sumner
(1997) provides qualitative evidence that points in the opposite direction.

                                                 23
prevented central banks from unilaterally pursuing expansionary monetary policies, abandoning

the gold standard could have allowed them to impart an expansionary monetary impulse. Fiscal

policy played a negligible role in recovery, even in countries like the U.S., the UK and Sweden

where the Keynesian revolution received the most intellectual play.34 Monetary policy did the

hard lifting. In some cases like the U.S., the monetary authorities simply cut interest rates and

encouraged the exchange rate to decline; they accommodated an increase in the demand for

money and credit by passively discounting or leaving capital inflows unsterilized.35 In a few

cases they actively expanded domestic credit but did so cautiously, given the immediacy of

memories of high inflation in the 1920s, the last time the gold standard had been abeyance. This

reluctance to expand more aggressively, while understandable in the circumstances, is one reason

why the recovery was not more robust.

       We can analyze the reorientation of monetary policy using the approach of Cecchetti and

Krause (2001). These authors study how efficiently central banks minimize a weighted sum of

output and inflation variability. The measure of monetary policy efficiency is the variance of

output times the variance of inflation, minus the squared covariance of inflation and output.



       34
         See Romer (1992) on the U.S. and Jonung (1981) on Sweden. The same was also true
of emerging markets (see della Paolera and Taylor 1998). The main exceptions were Germany
and Japan, in which recovery was stimulated by public expenditure on rearmament. Toward the
end of the 1930s, as military conflict loomed, stimulus from rearmament became general (see for
example Thomas 1983 on Britain). But this occurred after the period of principal concern here.
       35
         The U.S. case probably overstates the typical degree of monetary stimulus from
devaluation, since the country was also on the receiving end of capital flight from Europe once
the clouds of war darkened. Romer emphasizes the importance of this factor. On the other hand,
devaluation would have helped less insofar as the U.S. was a large open economy (for smaller
economies, there would have been no offsetting negative impact on the rest of the world and
hence on export demand).

                                                 24
(Output is detrended, and the period average is subtracted from the inflation rate.) The measure

should become smaller as monetary policy improves. The comparison in Figure 3 is of 1919-30

with 1931-39. (Output followed very different trends in the 1920s and 1930s; I therefore de-

trend separately for the period 1920-30 and 1931-39, regressing it on a linear time trend in top

panel and log time in the bottom panel.)

       Some of the results here are intuitive, for example that three of the larget gains in

monetary policy efficiency were in Sweden, Britain and Japan, these being three countries where

there was a particularly dramatic reorientation of monetary policy once the gold standard was

abandoned.36 By comparison, there was not much improvement in French or Belgian monetary

policies, these gold bloc countries having stuck to the old monetary regime until 1934 in Belgium

and 1936 in France. Austria and Germany had more monetary leeway as a result of their

exchange controls; this renders it somewhat surprising that the efficiency of their monetary

policies did not improve more than in Belgium and France.37 Spain was not on the gold standard

at all in the interwar period, so it is not surprising that its experience is anomalous; standard



       36
         The result for Japan is somewhat sensitive to how output is de-trended (and, it turns out,
to whether the sample is broken in 1930 or 1931). Again, it is not entirely surprising that the
Japanese case is somewhat anomalous. Unlike most of the other countries, Japan was on the
gold standard only in 1930 and 1931. Breaking the sample in 1931 rather than 1930 thus puts
twice the weight on gold standard years in the first subsample, and thus leads to a largest
apparent improvement in the efficiency of Japanese monetary policy in the first subperiod.
       37
         Data on the growth of money supplies in the exchange control and floating countries in
the 1930s, in Eichengreen (1992), similarly show that the second group expanded money
supplies more aggressively once gold convertibility was abandoned or controlled. Note that our
data for Austria and Germany only begin in 1922 and 1925, respectively, due to their
hyperinflations. Clearly we would observe a very dramatic improvement in the efficiency of
policy in the 1930s if we extended their data series backwards, but this would tell us nothing
about the consequences of abandoning the gold standard.

                                                  25
arguments suggest no reason why its policies should have been more flexible and efficient in the

1930s than in the 1920s. A straightforward explanation for why policy efficiency appears to

deteriorate in the second decade is that the global macroeconomic environment deteriorated.

This presumably is also part of the explanation for why the efficiency of U.S. monetary policy

declined slightly in the 1930s, but a larger part is that the relatively efficient monetary policies of

the mid-to-late ‘thirties are swamped by the dreadful policies of 1931-33. Canada does slightly

better than the U.S. because it left the gold standard somewhat sooner. Poland is not a case about

which I know enough to pontificate.38

       But wasn’t monetary policy rendered impotent by the liquidity trap?39 In the 1930s,

nominal interest rates fell to extremely low levels, especially the United States. With rates so

low, it hardly made sense for banks to lend, as opposed to holding excess reserves. Expansionary

open market operations that created additional Federal Reserve obligations to the private sector

might simply go into additional bank reserves and, given where the banks held their reserves,

back into the Fed.40 Equally, so long as households and firms expected deflation to continue, real

interest rates were high (given the zero bound on nominal rates), and potential bank customers

had no incentive to borrow.

       In the 1930s, as in the 1990s, whether the supply or the demand for bank loans was the


       38
            One suspects data problems, particularly with the measurement of output.
       39
        Keynes famously warned of the danger at the time, and the possibility has gained new
relevance with Japan showing signs of having entering a liquidity trap at the end of the 1990s.
       40
         Buying bonds “would simply increase the reserves of the banking system by the amount
of government bonds which were purchased with currency. The currency would go out...but [it]
would immediately go into the banks and from the banks into the federal Reserve Banks.” U.S.
Congress (1935), quoted in Wilcox (1984), p.1.

                                                  26
binding constraint mattered greatly for effectiveness of policy. If the problem was less that no

one was willing to lend, given the low-interest-rate environment, than that no one was willing to

borrow, given deflationary expectations and demoralized business conditions, then a monetary

shock could transform the situation. A sharp change in the exchange rate was an obvious way of

transforming expectations of future prices and policies.41 For a small country, allowing the

exchange rate to depreciate by, say, 25 per cent (the magnitude of a typical devaluation) implied

an eventual 25 per cent rise in import prices and ultimately in the domestic price level.42 For a

large country, the eventual rise in prices was smaller, but the direction was the same. In the short

run, before prices had completed their adjustment, the change in the exchange rate also had the

effect of shifting demand from foreign to domestic goods. If the authorities wished to prevent

the currency from rebounding too strongly from its initial drop, they could undertake unsterilized

intervention (Britain’s approach following the establishment of the Exchange Equalisation

Fund), engage in expansionary open market operations, or re-peg the currency to gold at its new

lower level (as the U.S. did in January 1934), allowing the now higher demand for money and

credit to be met by capital and gold inflows.43 In this case, the fall in the exchange rate was an


       41
          This is similarly the conclusion of the modern literature on the liquidity trap. Even if
the interest-rate channel for monetary policy is immobilized by the lower bound on the nominal
rate, a reflationary strategy of pushing down the exchange rate and committing to a future path
for the foreign exchange value of the currency can still help an open economy to escape the
liquidity trap (Svensson 2000, McCallum 2001).
       42
         Adjusted, of course, for any fall in world prices due to the continued deterioration in
global conditions.
       43
         Svensson (2000) observes that pegging the exchange rate in an environment of
deflationary expectations (when it is, if anything, expected to appreciate) may require arbitrarily
large foreign exchange market interventions. Pegging to gold may thus require arbitrarily large
purchases of gold. In practice, it was through daily purchases of gold at progressively higher

                                                 27
unequivocal signal that future prices would be higher than current prices; by transforming

deflationary expectations, it pushed down the real interest rate and stimulated borrowing for

investment.

       Temin and Wigmore (1984) show how devaluation of the dollar led to a sharp rise in

activity in capital-goods-producing industries in a matter of months, just as if such a

transformation of expectations had taken place. The literature on Britain’s devaluation and

recovery points in a similar direction; it emphasizes the recovery of residential construction (the

housing boom), and what is residential construction if not an investment activity? Nominal

interest rates declined still further starting in 1932, but this did not prevent British banks from

lending. Rather, the fall in real interest rates as expectations of deflation were eliminated

stimulated the demand for bank credit. Both cases thus suggest that it was the failure of the

demand for bank loans, and not any liquidity-trap-related obstacle to their supply, that was the

problem in the Depression.44 Both cases suggest that this problem could be solved by a

devaluation that convincingly transformed expectations of future prices and monetary policies

and gave the authorities the leeway needed to validate those expectations.45 The econometric

evidence provides only limited support for the hypothesis of a liquidity trap in the 1930s, but the


prices (set by FDR and his “kitchen cabinet” over the president’s breakfast) that the dollar’s rate
of exchange was driven down to lower levels after April 1933.
       44
         Of course, factors other than the liquidity trap (adverse balance-sheet effects due to
deflation, the destruction of information due to bank failures, the elimination of thickness
externalities) could have disrupted the supply of financial-intermediation services, as emphasized
by Bernanke (1983) and analyzed further below.
       45
         Similar arguments can be made for still other countries. Thus, della Paolera and Taylor
(1998) show that abandonment of the gold standard led to a sharp change in expectations in
Argentina, again consistent with the effectiveness of monetary-cum-exchange-rate policy.

                                                  28
qualitative evidence is if anything still harder to square with the notion that monetary policy was

impotent.46

       Once devaluation transformed expectations and freed up monetary policy, prices began to

rise – or, at least, they stopped falling. Eichengreen and Sachs (1985) identified a number of

channels through which supply and demand were stimulated. Raising product prices relative to

wages made production more profitable and stimulated labor demand. Raising import and export

prices relative to the cost of domestic goods stimulated net exports. Increased profitability and

sales, future as well as current, raised the value of productive capacity relative to its replacement

cost. It raised Tobin’s q, encouraging investment (which, as already noted, tended to lead the

recovery in countries pursuing this policy).

       Eichengreen and Sachs report bivariate correlations showing that European countries

devaluing by larger amounts tended to recover more rapidly. Campa (1990) shows that the

comparison extends to Latin America. Bernanke and Carey (1996) focus on sticky wages and

aggregate supply; they show that the supply relationship estimated by earlier authors survives a

variety of econometric extensions. Under the assumption that differences in economic

performance as of the mid-1930s were due to differences in gold standard policies, they show

that the cross-section relationship between real wages and production identifies a component of

the aggregate supply relation.47



       46
         Thus, Wilcox (1984) reports estimates showing that the demand for excess reserves was
very (but not completely) flat in the 1930s.
       47
         If the main thing happening in the 1930s was shocks to demand coming from domestic
and international monetary policies, in other words, then the resulting shifts in the aggregate
demand schedule enable us to trace the aggregate supply curve.

                                                 29
          This assumption has not gone unquestioned. Cole, Ohanian and Leung (2002) observe

that the cross-section relationship between the change in real wages and the change in output

(both between 1929 and 1933) is surprisingly diffuse. Figure 4 shows their labor demand

schedule, derived on the assumption of a Cobb-Douglas production function with a labor share of

two-thirds.48 In some countries, prominently the U.S., the fall in output was larger than the rise

in real wages alone would lead one to predict. In others, notably France, Holland, and

Switzerland, it was smaller. It could be that a Cobb-Douglas production function with a labor

share of two-thirds poorly represents the technology of the time. But no conventional production

function, in conjunction with an explanation for the Great Depression that relies on demand-side

factors alone, can explain why output should have fallen more than predicted by the rise in real

wages in some countries but less than predicted by the rise in real wages in others. The

implication is that the observed real wage-employment relationship was simultaneously

perturbed by other disturbances. The reduction in the real wage produced a surprisingly large or

small increase in output and employment, depending on the national case, due to these other

shocks.

          The bad news, in this case, is that the real wage-output relationship does not in fact

identify a component of the aggregate supply relation. The good news, for those who emphasize

the role of gold standard policies, is that the observed correlation then underestimates how much

difference changes in those policies could make for macroeconomic outcomes, ceteris paribus.

Cole, Ohanian and Leung’s point, though, is that ceteris was not paribus. In addition to the effect



          48
         This schedule goes through the zero-zero point on the figure and has an elasticity of
negative one-half, such that labor’s share is constant at two thirds.

                                                   30
of negative demand shocks, the Depression was evidently compounded by negative supply

shocks.

          This interpretation is attractive if it is possible to identify plausible shocks in the

countries concerned. As noted, four countries in Cole, Ohanian and Leung’s 17 country sample

lie especially far from the predicted real wage/employment relationship. As shown in Figure 4,

the U.S. lies far below, while France, the Netherlands and Switzerland lie far above. For the

U.S., the obvious factor disrupting aggregate supply was the financial crisis.49 This emphasis on

the collapse of financial intermediation as a supply shifter is consistent with Bernanke’s

emphasis on the nonmonetary effects of the financial crisis and on the impact of increases in the

cost of credit intermediation. Early analyses treat bank failures mainly as a determinant of

aggregate demand, operating through the monetary channel. This analysis, in contrast, suggests

that the banking crisis had an impact on both blades of the aggregate-supply/aggregate-demand

scissors.

          As noted, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland did better, in terms of the change in

output, than the rise in their labor costs alone would lead one to predict. As members of the gold

bloc, they were on the receiving end of capital inflows once other countries’ gold-standard

parities began to crumble, rendering their economies and financial systems more liquid than

would have been the case otherwise.50 This, then, could be the mirror image of the U.S. case.


          49
          Conceivably supplemented by the tendency for New Deal policies to restrict
competition and push up production costs, although the comparison of 1933 with 1929 is a bit
early for the latter set of effects to have plausibly made themselves felt.
          50
         Cooper and Ejarque (1995) provide a model in which capital flows like these can affect
the supply side due to thickness externalities in financial intermediation, but as they note their
model can reproduce only some of the macroeconomic fluctuations of the period.

                                                     31
       That said, none of these countries escaped banking sector problems entirely. France

experienced the collapse of a major deposit bank, the Banque Nationale de Credit, in October

1932.51 In Switzerland, the Banque Populaire had to be restructured in November 1933. That

these events occurred relatively late in the 1929-33 period suggests that the longer these countries

stayed on the gold standard, the greater became the fragility of their financial systems and

economies. Thus, in an even longer term comparison (from 1929 through 1935, as in

Eichengreen and Sachs), these three members of the gold bloc should not have performed so

unusually well, while the U.S., now off the gold standard and able to put its banking-sector

problems behind it, should not have performed so exceptionally poorly. This prediction is borne

out for the U.S., as shown in Figure 5. Output is now 30 per cent below predicted levels, rather

than 45 per cent, a considerable improvement in just two years.52 France, the Netherlands and

Switzerland, on the other hand, remain positive outliers, in terms of output, by about the same

extent as in 1933. By 1935 they were no longer on the receiving end of gold and capital inflows.

This suggests that there must have been additional factors that also help to explain why output in

the gold bloc countries did not collapse more dramatically as the real wage rose. What they were

remains, to my mind, one of those mysteries that future research will have to solve.




       51
        There were also three bank failures and runs on provincial banks in November 1930,
although Bouvier (1984) questions whether these events in fact constituted a banking crisis.
       52
          Bordo, Erceg and Evans (1997) notes that a standard model of monetary-caused
inflation and deflation, together with wage stickiness due to overlapping contracts, cannot
explain why output in the U.S. recovered as quickly as it did after 1933, especially since real
wages did not decline. This is a problem for the Romer (1992) story. The speed of recovery
becomes easier to understand once one admits a role for the restoration of financial stability and
reintermediation due to the looser credit conditions brought about by capital inflows.

                                                32
4. Conclusion

       One way of characterizing recent research on the Great Depression is as “normal

science.” There is now a steady stream of publications that add incrementally to existing

knowledge. Economists recognize the Depression as a natural testing ground for theories of

macroeconomic fluctuations. Historians have gone beyond the American and British cases that

were once the focal points for archival research. If this work has limitations, it is that many

economists continue to view the 1920s and 1930s as simply a data set with which to test the

latest fashions in economic theory rather than a period to be understood in its own right, while

historians disregard the economic dimension of the greatest macroeconomic catastrophe of

modern times in favor of its social and psychological aspects.

       The onset of the Depression remains the stage about which there is least consensus,

perhaps unavoidably given the limited ability of macroeconomists to explain turning points. The

debate continues to revolve around the relative importance of domestic monetary policies and an

unstable international system. If there is anything approaching a consensus, it is a synthetic view

which admits a role for both factors – for monetary policy mistakes not just in the United States

but also in Germany and, of a different sort, in France, and for the international monetary and

financial system in transmitting those destabilizing impulses to the rest of the world. It explains

the speed and extent of the subsequent decline in terms of both banking crises and the collapse of

the gold standard, which conspired in placing deflationary pressure to different degrees on

different countries. And, it explains the eventual recovery in terms of the abandonment of the

gold standard, which facilitated the pursuit of stabilizing monetary policies, but also in terms of

the restoration of stability to banking and financial systems, something that occurred at different


                                                 33
times in different countries.

       One way of understanding the veneer of disputation on this consensus is that different

elements dominated in the United States and other countries. For the U.S., there is no denying

the role of policy mistakes in the onset of the Depression, whereas for other countries

international transmission via capital and gold flows plays the most important part. The banking

crisis was the main motor for the downward spiral in the United States, whereas for other

countries the disintegration of the gold-exchange standard was more important. For most

countries, the movement of wages and prices can largely explain the course of slump and

recovery, but industrial production in the U.S. fell more rapidly than the behavior of real wages

would lead one to predict and remained depressed relative to the international norm for several

years following devaluation of the dollar. One explanation of the disputes that characterize the

literature is thus that Americanists continue to export the conclusions of research on the United

States to the rest of the world while other country specialists continue to do the opposite.

       The other way of understanding these disputes is that economists continue to search for a

unified explanation for the global depression, while historians continue to treat each national

experience as unique. The contrasts between the experiences of the United States and other

countries drawn in this lecture suggest that neither approach is quite right for understanding this

pivotal period in the development of the 20th century world economy.
