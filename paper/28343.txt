                                           ABSTRACT

We estimate a model of high school students' college choices, allowing for rich heterogeneity in
students' preferences for college attributes. We use data on students' enrollment decisions and
application decisions--i.e., the sets of colleges to which they applied--to identify the distribution
of students' preferences. We use our estimates to quantify differences in a student's expected
value upon college application that result from the uneven spatial distribution of colleges. As with
other aspects of economic opportunity, we find that place matters: students with otherwise
identical characteristics can have very different expected values depending on where they live.
The importance of location reflects differences across states as well as differences across counties
within a state. For students with low parental incomes and low SAT scores, over 70% of the
variation is within-state across counties, while for students with high parental incomes and high
SAT scores, 66% of the variation is across states.

1       Introduction

Some of young adults' most consequential decisions are about whether and where to attend college.
The weight of these choices reflects both the importance of college as an economic investment, since
the choice of college can substantially influence both near-term costs and lifetime earnings,1 and the
fact that college is also an expensive consumption good, since a student's enjoyment of the multi-
year college experience depends on the match of college attributes to her preferences. However, the
uneven spatial distribution of colleges in the United States means that not all students are endowed
with equal access. Given that students typically face much lower in-state tuition than out-of-state
tuition, cross-state differences in the quality of public colleges directly translate to differences in
students' ex ante expected net returns to a college education depending on which state they live
in.2 Moreover, to the extent that students prefer to attend college close to home, they face unequal
access to colleges even within a state.

Table 1 shows the relevance of both types of spatial dispersion faced by college-bound students
surveyed in the Educational Longitudinal Study 2002.3 The first row shows the cross-student
distribution of the quality of one's home state's flagship college, as proxied by the median SAT score
of admitted freshmen.4 At the lower end, 5% of the students are from states where the flagship
colleges have a median SAT score of 1080 or lower; at the upper end, 5% are from states where
the flagship colleges have a median SAT score of 1325 or more. The remaining rows summarize the
cross-student distribution of the number of four-year colleges within a 250 kilometer radius of the
student's home. Some students have over 200 colleges nearby, including over 50 high-SAT colleges;
some have fewer than 10 colleges nearby, with none of them being high-SAT colleges.

However, whether the heterogeneity described in Table 1 should cause concerns about "education
deserts" depends on students' preferences, as would policies aimed at addressing such concerns. For
example, if students care little about distance, then it will not matter that students from Wyoming
have to travel greater distances from home to attend college. Similarly, if students do not have
strong attachment to their home states, then cross-state differences in the quality of public colleges
could be mitigated via tuition subsidies that offset the out-of-state vs. in-state tuition difference
for students who attend high-quality out-of-state public colleges.5 However, if students do care
about proximity, and to different degrees, then such subsidies will do little to level the playing

      This statement is made in a partial equilibrium (individual optimality) sense. Large-scale policies such as cross-
state reciprocal tuition agreements can serve a similar purpose, but likely stimulate general equilibrium responses.

field for students whose willingness to pay to stay in their home states exceeds the out-of-state
vs. in-state tuition difference; instead, these subsidies will disproportionately benefit students who
value college quality over proximity. Moreover, if the latter group tend to have more advantaged
family backgrounds, these subsidies will be regressive in nature, leading to serious equity concerns.
More generally, the efficiency and equity implications of education policies clearly depend on the
distribution of student preferences for various college attributes.

This paper aims at recovering a richer characterization of students' preferences for college attributes
by incorporating information about the sets of colleges to which they applied, which we will refer
to as students' application sets.6 The essential idea is that when we observe the set of colleges a
student applied to, the strength of her preference for a given attribute is reflected in the similarity
of that attribute across colleges in that set. For example, conditional on observables, a student who
applies only to colleges near her home may have very different preferences than her counterpart
who applies only to academically competitive colleges: the former appears to care mostly about
geographic proximity while the latter mostly about academic quality. Intuitively, recovering the
distribution of preferences is then based on observing the fractions of students who appear to care
a lot about the given characteristic.

Our model of student preferences follows the approach that is common in Industrial Organization
studies of differentiated product markets, casting student utility as a function of college character-
istics. Heterogeneity in preferences is incorporated by allowing student-specific coefficients on those
characteristics. Application sets are most informative about students' preferences--i.e., their vec-
tors of coefficients for college characteristics--if we fully utilize comparisons of all colleges included
and excluded from these sets. Given the large number of colleges to choose from (and hence combi-
      6
     Some studies have attempted to quantify which factors are influential in students' college choice decisions (e.g.,
Manski and Wise 1983, Avery and Hoxby 2004, Long 2004, Dillon and Smith 2017); while another set of studies has
focused specifically on the impact of tuition or financial aid on college choices (e.g., Curs and Singell 2000, Dynarski
2003, Avery and Hoxby 2004, Kane 2007 and Deming and Walters 2018).

natorially large number of possible application sets), empirically modeling the optimal application
decision becomes a daunting task. However, there are useful properties that the optimal set must
obey,7 which we utilize in our empirical approach: we derive necessary conditions for optimality of
students' observed application sets, and base our estimator on these conditions.

We estimate our model with data from the Educational Longitudinal Study (ELS) 2002, the Na-
tional Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), and the Integrated Postsecondary Education
Data System (IPEDS). The ELS data provide information on application sets, admission and enroll-
ment outcomes, and binary indicators of whether financial aid was received at each of the colleges to
which a student was admitted. We supplement ELS with more detailed information from NPSAS
about financial aid amounts. The IPEDS data provide information on college attributes.

We use our estimates of students' preferences to answer two questions about college choices. First,
we quantify the implications of the uneven spatial distribution of colleges for student welfare.
Following in the spirit of Chetty et al (2014) and several other recent papers that have emphasized
the geography of opportunity,8 we use our estimates to calculate ex ante welfare for the same
student were she to live in different counties across the U.S. We find that geographic variation in
student welfare is considerable; that the variation is more pronounced for high-SAT students; and
that the geographic patterns are quite different for high-SAT students vs. low-SAT students. For
example, we find that across U.S. counties the interquartile range of the ex ante expected utility for
an average high-SAT, low-income college-bound student is over 2,500 tuition dollars, compared to
about 1,700 tuition dollars for her low-SAT, low-income counterpart. There is important variation
both across states and across counties within a state: for low-SAT low-income students, over 70%
the variation is within-state across counties, while for high-SAT high-income students, 66% of the
variation is across states. We discuss the broader implications of these findings in our concluding
section.

Second, we predict the substitution patterns that would result if a student were to face out-of-state
tuition rates in all states. Peltzman (1973) argues that subsidies in the form of lower tuition for
in-state students can perversely lead to a reduction in education--the idea being that inexpensive
public colleges may attract students who otherwise would have attended costlier but higher-quality
colleges. As a preliminary, partial-equilibrium investigation of such a hypothesis, we use our esti-
mated model to simulate the choices of students if they had to pay the out-of-state tuition at their
home-state public colleges. We find that while high-income students with high SAT scores would
enroll in colleges with higher SAT scores on average, across all students the average quality of the

     See, for example, Abbott and Gallipoli (2017); Corak (2019); Berger (2018); Berger and Engzell (2019); and the
follow-up paper by Chetty and Hendren (2018).

chosen college goes down, largely because many students simply switch to lower quality in-state
universities that charge lower out-of-state tuition than their higher-quality counterparts. Our find-
ings suggest that based on substitution effects alone, increasing in-state tuition would have a very
limited effect in pushing students toward higher quality institutions.

Our paper contributes to the broad literature on the economics of higher education, especially
the branch that studies the college market through the lens of structural models. For instance,
Arcidiacono (2005) and Howell (2010) estimate structural models of students' choices and use them
to address questions about affirmative action policies. Epple, Romano and Sieg (2006), Fu (2014),
Bodoh-Creed and Hickman (2018), Fillmore (2018), and Cook (2019) estimate equilibrium models
of the college market in which both students and colleges make strategic decisions.

The geography of college opportunity has been analyzed in the sociology literature, where re-
searchers such as Turley (2009) and Hillman (2016) have documented geographic disparities in
college availability. These studies emphasize that most students choose colleges in close proximity
to their homes, and the number of nearby colleges varies considerably depending on where a student
lives. Moreover, this variation is correlated with race and socioeconomic status, with minorities
and lower-income students having fewer nearby colleges on average. Hillman (2016) contemplates
whether some locations should be described as education deserts. Our estimated model allows us
to quantify such geographic disparities not just in terms of proximity but also incorporating other
college characteristics that students value.

Our estimation method, which exploits necessary conditions for optimality of students' application
sets, is similar to approaches other authors have used in the IO literature. For example, Ellickson,
Houghton, and Timmins (2013) use profit inequality conditions to estimate the strength of network
economies for retail chains like Walmart and Target. As in our application, it would be infeasible
to characterize the exact optimal choice of where these chains should locate their stores; but
estimation can be based on necessary conditions for the optimality of those choices. Our use of
data on application sets is somewhat similar to the use of survey data by Avery, Glickman, Hoxby,
and Metrick (2013) to construct a revealed preference ranking of U.S. universities. They surveyed
high school seniors to determine the set of colleges to which each student was admitted, as well
as the single college the student chose to enroll in. Knowing the admissions set enables them
to characterize each student's chosen university as the winner of a small tournament, and their
overall ranking of colleges is essentially an aggregation of the preference rankings implied by these
tournaments.

2        Data

We analyze a sample of college applicants from the Educational Longitudinal Study (ELS) 2002
run by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The ELS 2002 surveyed a nationally
representative sample of students as 10th graders in 2002 and as 12th graders in 2004, and also
conducted follow-up surveys of the same students in 2006 and 2012. For our purposes, the important
survey questions are about the students' college application and enrollment decisions: for each
student, we know which colleges they applied to, where they were admitted, whether they received
financial aid at each of the colleges to which they were admitted, and where they chose to enroll.
We limit our sample to the respondents who reported applying to college while still in high school,
which yields a sample of 7,410 students,9 whose characteristics are summarized in Table 2.

Our data on college characteristics come from NCES's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data
System (IPEDS) for the academic year 2004-2005, to match the year when the students in our
sample would have been entering college. In estimating our college choice model, we include only
colleges that offer four-year degrees, and we exclude the five U.S. service academies and colleges
whose Carnegie classification is "Special Focus Institution".10 The resulting sample includes 1,337
four-year colleges, whose characteristics are summarized in Table 3.

The cost of attending a college includes both tuition and fees.11 For public colleges, the cost
often depends on a student's state of residency due to differences between in-state and out-of-state
tuition. Among the 492 public universities in the data, 479 charge higher tuition for out-of-state
students than in-state students, with out-of-state tuition on average over $7,400 higher. At least
54 of these public colleges have reciprocity agreements that allow neighboring states' students to

     The tuition numbers reported in Table 3 include fees, and throughout the paper when we say or report "tuition"
we mean "tuition plus fees."

pay discounted tuition. However, many of the most prestigious flagship universities opt out of their
states' reciprocity agreements. For example, UC Berkeley and the University of Michigan do not
offer in-state tuition to students from neighboring states even though other colleges in California
and Michigan do.12

A final data source is the 2004 wave of the NCES National Postsecondary Student Aid Study
(NPSAS), which we use to augment the information from the ELS about students' financial aid
outcomes. While the ELS survey only indicates whether a student received any financial aid at each
college to which she was admitted, the NPSAS data also include information on the amounts and
sources of financial aid received. As we explain below, we use these data from NPSAS to estimate
the distribution of aid amounts conditional on receiving aid.

Before outlining our model, we first describe several key facts and patterns in the data. Table 4
shows the distribution of application set sizes (i.e., how many colleges a student applies to). An
important and perhaps surprising fact is that 30% of students apply to only one college. Applying
to multiple colleges is more common for students who have higher family income and higher SAT
scores.

Table 5 shows some examples of "overlaps"--namely, colleges that tend to appear together in a
student's application set. In some cases the overlaps reflect similarity in quality--for example,
students who applied to Harvard also tended to apply to Yale, Princeton, and UPenn. But more
often the overlaps reflect geographic proximity. For example, students who applied to the University
of Georgia also commonly applied to Georgia State, Auburn, and Georgia Tech. This suggests

most students prefer to attend colleges close to their homes, which means that differences in the
availability of nearby colleges (as described above in Table 1) could translate into economically
important differences in the ex ante value of students' college choice sets.

3    Model

Our purpose is to estimate high school students' preferences for college attributes using a framework
that leverages not only those students' enrollment decisions (which college they choose to attend),

                                                       8
but also their application decisions (which colleges they choose to apply to). As explained above,
knowing the full set of colleges to which a student applied--what we call the student's application
set --should improve estimation of preference heterogeneity, since similarities in the applied-to
colleges reflect the strength of the student's preferences for certain characteristics.

In this section we outline the structure of our model, specifying the decisions students make and
the uncertainties they face when making those decisions. Details of how various functions are
parameterized for estimation are described in Section 4.



3.1      Primitives


There are J (four-year) colleges, each characterized by a vector Wj of attributes including location,
academic quality, public/private dummy, and college athletics. Each student i is characterized by a
vector of observable characteristics Xi (including location, demographics, family background, and
test scores) and a vector of unobservable tastes (i ) associated with the various college characteris-
tics. Each student makes two decisions in our model: which colleges to apply to, and--conditional
on the admissions and financial aid outcomes--which college to enroll in.



3.1.1      Admissions and Net Tuition


Students face uncertainty over the outcomes of admissions and financial aid. The probability that
student i is admitted to college j is assumed to be a function of student and college observable
characteristics, given by
                                                   pij = P (Xi , Wj ) .                               (1)

A student may obtain financial aid to attend college, the amount of which is a stochastic function
of student characteristics, college characteristics and gross tuition tj . The net tuition tij for student
i attending college j is given by
                                              tij = f (Xi , Wj , tj ) + ij ,                          (2)

where ij is a random shock that is realized after the student makes her application decisions.13
Students know the admissions probabilities and the distribution of financial aid amounts when they
make their application decisions.
  13
       Financial aid includes both government aid (e.g., Pell grant) and college-specific aid.




                                                            9
3.1.2    Student Preferences


Students care about the net tuition cost tij and college characteristics Wj , and both the sign and
strength of student preferences for these characteristics may vary with their own characteristics Xi
and taste vector i . Student i's utility from attending college j is given by

                                         uij = U (Xi , Wj , tij ; i )

There is an outside option available to all, the value of which is normalized to zero ex ante. After
applications are submitted, the outside option is subject to a shock ui0 that captures unforeseen
events that change the opportunity cost of attending college (e.g., getting a job offer).



3.2     Student Problem


Student i faces a two-stage decision problem. In the first stage she chooses a set of colleges to
apply to, after which admissions, financial aid outcomes, and the shock to the outside option are
realized. Then, in the second stage, she chooses to enroll in one of the colleges that admitted her,
or the outside option. To characterize students' optimal choices, we begin with the second stage
enrollment decision and work backward.

Given a set of admissions and financial aid outcomes, student i chooses her most preferred college
within the set Oi of colleges that admit her, or the outside option, i.e.,

                              v (Oi , Xi , i , i , ui0 )  max{{uij }j Oi , ui0 }                       (3)


Denoting the ex-ante value of being admitted to Oi as v (Oi , Xi , i )  E [v (Oi , Xi , i , i , ui0 )] , we
can write the value of an application portfolio Y  J for student i as

                          V (Y, Xi , i )         Pr(O|Xi )v (O, Xi , i ) - C (|Y |),
                                            OY


where Pr(O|Xi ) is the probability that i is admitted to the set of colleges O. |Y | is the number of
colleges in Y and C (|Y |) is the application cost. Denoting the set of J colleges as J , the student's
application problem is therefore
                                            max{V (Y, Xi , i )}.                                       (4)
                                            Y J




                                                      10
3.2.1      Simplification


Note that uncertainty about admissions makes a student's application decision (4) a complicated
portfolio problem rather than one of simply listing the colleges she most wishes to attend. For
example, admissions uncertainty creates incentives for students to include "safety schools" in their
application sets.14 Moreover, the complexity of this portfolio problem increases combinatorially
with the number of colleges (J ). Other studies that examine students' college choices have typically
restricted J to be a small number, either by allowing for only a small number of colleges in the
choice set (e.g., Arcidiacono (2005) and Cook (2019)) or by grouping colleges into a small number
of types (e.g., Epple, Romano and Sieg (2006) and Fu (2014)). Since the goal of this paper is to
gain a more precise understanding of students' heterogeneous preferences over college attributes,
we treat each college as a unit (instead of grouping them) and allow for a large number of colleges
in the consideration set (J = 80 in our empirical application), which makes solving the full problem
(4) a daunting task.

However, notice that (4) can be viewed as a two-layer problem, where a student chooses the best
portfolio of a given size n in the inner layer and optimizes over n in the outer layer, i.e.,

                                       max {         max           {V (Y, Xi , i )}}.                              (5)
                                     n{1,..J } Y J s.t. |Y |=n



To simplify our analysis we focus on the inner layer of (5) and solve a student's problem taking the
observed application set size n as given. The cost of this simplification is that we cannot estimate
the application cost function C (|Y |). This also means that in the counterfactual simulations below
we must hold each student's n fixed at the value we observe in the data.

Even taking n as given, with J = 80 (as in our empirical application) it is computationally infeasible
for an estimator to find the exact optimal set of colleges to include in the application set. For
example, if n = 4 there would be over 1.5 million possible sets to check. The following assumption
greatly facilitates the search for a tractable estimator.

Assumption 1: Conditional on observables, student i's admissions outcomes are independent
across colleges, i.e.,
                                       Pr(O|Xi ) =          pij            (1 - pij ).                             (6)
                                                      j O         j Y \O


Assumption 1 is not entirely innocuous: it would be violated if multiple colleges receive similar
information about student i beyond Xi and interpret it in similar ways. In order to make As-
  14
       See Chade, Lewis, and Smith (2014) for discussion and analysis of the student's portfolio choice problem.


                                                            11
sumption 1 as realistic as possible, in our empirical analysis we include a rich set of observables
in the admissions probability function P (Xi , Wj ), and we assume the independence of admissions
outcomes conditional on those observables.

Under Assumption 1, we can form an estimator based on necessary conditions for optimality of the
application set, as stated in the following Proposition.

Proposition 1. Given Assumption 1, a necessary condition for the optimality of application set
Yi among sets of the same size is that for all y   Yi and all k / Yi ,

         piy                   Pr Oi |Xi v   Oi , y  , Xi , i - pik                   Pr Oi |Xi v   Oi , k , Xi , i
               {Oi }Yi   \y                                           {Oi }Yi   \y 

     (piy - pik )                     Pr Oi |Xi v Oi , Xi , i
                         {Oi }Yi \y


The proof of this proposition is in Appendix A. In essence, the proposition says that for the
observed application set to be optimal, it must be that all possible pairwise swaps--of one college
outside the set for one of the colleges in the set--would weakly reduce the expected utility. Our
estimator utilizes these necessary conditions for optimality and involves checking these pairwise
swaps, which is tractable because for a student who applied to n colleges, we only need to check
                                                       J
n(J - n) conditions instead of comparing all           n    possible application sets.



4     Estimation

Our primary objective is to structurally estimate the distribution of students' preferences for college
characteristics, rather than colleges' preferences for students. As such, we estimate parameters
governing admissions probabilities and financial aid distribution outside of the model. In this
section, we will first briefly describe our estimation of these two components, and then we will
describe our empirical specification for student preferences and how we estimate them within the
model.



4.1    Admissions Probabilities and Financial Aid


Admissions Probabilities are estimated via probit regressions in which student i's probability of
admission at college j is a function of the student's characteristics, the college's characteristics, and
their interactions. In the interest of flexibility, we estimate the model separately for six categories


                                                           12
of colleges defined by (public vs. private) × (tercile of SATjc ), where SATjc (the median SAT score
of students in college j ) is a proxy for college quality that we obtain from IPEDS.15 In each case,
the included covariates are student high school GPA; student SAT score; median SAT of the college
SATjc ; an indicator for whether student i's SAT score is below the 25th percentile of SAT scores in
college j ; an indicator for whether college j is in the student's home state; an indicator for whether
the student has taken any Advanced Placement course; indicators for female, black, and Hispanic;
an indicator for whether the student is from a single-parent family; an indicator for whether at least
one of the student's parents graduated from college; and indicators for 7 family income categories.

Importantly, the probit regressions deliver predicted admissions probabilities that exhibit reason-
able patterns (e.g. they are increasing in student's GPAs and SAT scores) and cover a sensible
range (e.g. low-SAT students' predicted probabilities of being admitted to Harvard are around
3 percent, and high-SAT students' predicted probabilities of being admitted to non-competitive
public universities are above 90 percent). Additional details and fit statistics are available in an
online appendix.

Financial Aid includes both government aid (the Pell grant) and college-specific aid. We compute
the Pell grant following the government-specified formula, where the amount of grant depends
mainly on one's expected family contribution (EFC) and the cost of attendance. For college-specific
aid, we model the probability of receiving aid in a way that mirrors the admissions probabilities, with
probit regressions run separately for the six different college types. In addition to the covariates
listed above for the admissions model, we also allow the probability to depend on the college's
tuition and the student's EFC. This yields a predicted probability that student i will receive aid
at college j for any i-j pair.

To estimate the amount of college-specific aid received, conditional on receiving any, we use the
NPSAS data (described in Section 2). We model the log of aid received as a truncated normal with
the upper truncation point set at 1.2 times the maximum observed amount of aid,16 and the mean
being a linear function of covariates including the college's gross tuition, the student's EFC, sex and
race dummies, student SAT score, college median SAT score, an indicator for whether the student
is in the same state as the college, and a few interactions among these variables. Full details are in
the online appendix referenced above. The NPSAS data introduce a possible selection bias because
they only report aid amounts at students' chosen colleges--i.e., the colleges where they chose to
enroll. If students tend to enroll in colleges that offer more aid, then the aid amounts of enrolled
  15
      Each college in IPEDS reports the 25th and the 75th percentiles of SAT scores of its enrollees; we take the
average of these two percentiles as SATjc .
   16
      We found that if we simply model aid amounts as being log-normally distributed without any upper bound, our
estimator for student preferences would sometimes draw simulated aid amounts that were unrealistically high--i.e.,
out in the long tail of the log-normal distribution.



                                                       13
students will tend to be higher than the aid amounts offered to admitted students, so our model
may slightly overpredict aid amounts.17 Fortunately, selection is not a problem in our model at
the aid vs. no-aid margin, since the ELS data report whether any aid was received at all colleges
to which the student applied.



4.2     Student Preferences


Empirical Specification Student i's utility at college j is given by

          uij = - (1 LowInci + M idInci + 2 HighInci ) tij                                                          (7)
               + 0 + 1 (SATi - SATjc )2                c 2
                                      + + 2 (SATi - SATj )- + 3 Blacki + 4 Hispanici

               + exp (1,i ) SATjc + 1 (SATjc - 1200)+ + 2,i [ln (Distij ) + 2 OutStateij ]
               + 3,i P rivatej + 4,i N CAAIj .

The first component of this function reflects the student's sensitivity to net tuition (tij ), which
may differ across students from different family income groups. We categorize a student i's family
income as low (LowInci = 1) if it is less than $35,000, as high (HighInci = 1) if it is above
$100,000, and as middle (M idInci = 1) otherwise. The parameters 1 and 2 measure how the
price sensitivity of low- and high-income students (respectively) differ from that of students in the
middle income group. We normalize the tuition coefficient for middle-income students to 1, so
student preferences for various college attributes are measured in tuition dollars.

The parameter 0 represents the overall attractiveness of attending a 4-year college relative to the
outside option for an average student; 3 and 4 are introduced to capture potential differences in
preferences among black and Hispanic students. To allow for the possibility that a student may
prefer colleges that closely match her own academic ability, we introduce parameters 1 and 2
to measure students' preference for the difference between her own SAT (SATi ) and the median
SAT score at the college (SATjc ), allowing for asymmetry in the preference for over-match vs.
under-match.

For our purposes, the most important components of the utility function (7) are the college charac-
teristics over which students have heterogeneous preferences, as reflected by the student-specific k,i
coefficients. First, students are allowed to have heterogeneous preferences for a college's academic
quality, as measured by SATjc . Since these quality differences are most likely to be meaningful for
   17
     To check whether this selection effect is likely to be important, we examined data from the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth (NLSY 97), which reports aid even for unaccepted offers. We estimated models for aid amounts
using both the full sample of all offers and the selected sample of accepted offers, and found that the latter predicted
aid amounts only slightly higher than the former.


                                                          14
colleges toward the upper end of the distribution, we allow the slope to differ depending on whether
SATjc is above or below 1200. Student-specific preferences for proximity are represented by 2,i ,
where we use a distance index that combines actual distance (Distij ) and an indicator for whether
j is out of student i's home state. We measure Distij as the distance in kilometers between college
j and the centroid of student i's home zip code. Finally, students have heterogeneous preferences
over whether or not the college is private (P rivatej  {0, 1}), and for whether or not the college has
an NCAA Division I football team (N CAAIj  {0, 1}). The latter serves as a proxy for whether
major sporting events are an important aspect of college life in j .

Student-specific preference parameters k,i are drawn from the following normal distribution,

                             k,i = µk (Xi ) +   k,i k ,     with     k,i    N (0, 1) .

The mean tastes for college SAT scores (1,i ), distance (2,i ), and private colleges (3,i ) are allowed
to vary with family income, while the mean tastes for Division I sports (4,i ) are common across
students, such that

                              µk,0 + µk,1 LowInci + µk,2 HighInci                 for k = 1, 2, 3
                µk (Xi ) =
                              µk,0                                                for k = 4

Students are subject to post-application shocks to their outside option, drawn from a normal
distribution:
                               ui0 =   0,i 0 (Xi ) ,   with    0,i    N (0, 1) .

The dispersion of shocks is allowed to be different for low-income and/or low-SAT students, such
that
                       0 (Xi ) = exp [0 + 1 LowInci + 2 I (SATi  950)] .                            (8)

We allow this layer of flexibility to better fit the data: conditional on admissions and financial aid
outcomes, low-income and/or low-SAT students have a much lower enrollment rate than other stu-
dents, which holds even if we compare students with similar application behaviors. Such patterns
can arise, for example, if low-income households are subject to higher income volatility (unemploy-
ment), which would be captured by a larger dispersion of post-application shocks faced by these
students.



Estimation Procedure At a high level, the goal of our estimation approach is to choose param-
eters that maximize the likelihood of students' observed application sets and enrollment decisions.
Two complicating factors are that (1) our model does not admit a closed-form solution to the
portfolio problem of choosing an application set, and (2) the number of colleges in the U.S. is

                                                       15
quite large. As explained above, our solution to the first problem is to base our estimator on the
necessary conditions for optimality of the application set, as described in Proposition 1.

To address the second issue, instead of including the full set of J colleges in each student's choice
set, we draw a subset Ji of 80 colleges for each student i: Ji always includes colleges in student
i's observed application set Yi , and the remaining colleges are drawn from J \Yi in a way that
accounts for both variety and relevance in terms of geography, school type (public vs. private)
and school quality. The sampling scheme, which we describe in more detail in Appendix B, draws
colleges proportionally from bins defined by public vs. private ownership, in-state vs. out-of-state,
and academic quality (as measured by SATjc ). The scheme guarantees inclusion of at least one aca-
demically competitive public university from the student's home state, since the flagship university
of a student's home state is almost certainly in her consideration set. Importantly, the sampling
rules are common across students and independent of Yi .

Once we have constructed choice sets Ji for each student, we hold those sets fixed during the esti-
mation. We construct the quasi-likelihood function using a simulation procedure that (1) simulates
M copies of each student i, each with different preference "shocks"                 k,i   that lead to different pref-
erence coefficients k,i ; (2) uses these simulated students to compute a kernel-smoothed probability
that the chosen application set is better than all possible one-for-one swaps (Proposition 1); (3)
computes a smoothed probability that the enrollment decision is optimal given the admissions and
financial aid outcomes; and (4) combines the probabilities from (2) and (3) to construct the quasi-
likelihood for student i's observed choices (application set and enrollment decision). The details of
this procedure are explained in Appendix C.

5.1      Parameter Estimates


Table 6 reports the parameter estimates and associated standard errors.18 The estimated tuition
sensitivity declines with family income, which is in line with findings from the previous literature.
The coefficients on the distance between one's own and a college's quality as proxied by SATjc ,
1 and 2 , are both negative--which is consistent with the idea that students prefer to fit in
academically rather than overmatch or undermatch.

     We estimate the information matrix as the sum of the outer products of the scores: I^=

score function for student i. We estimate the Hessian matrix as H = i hi , with hi being the Hessian for student i.
The standard errors are then computed as the square roots of the diagonal elements of H ^ -1 I

The main parameters of interest are the ones related to heterogeneity in preferences--i.e., the dis-
tributions of student-specific coefficients for various college attributes (academic quality, distance,
in-state vs. out-of-state, public vs. private and college athletics). To better understand these
estimates, we report, in Table 7, the change in a student's utility, measured in thousands of tuition
dollars, associated with a given change of an attribute. The middle column reports the impact for
a student with the mean k,i . The first and third columns report the same effects for students with
k,i 's one standard deviation below or above that mean, respectively. Since we estimate different
tuition coefficients for different family income levels, we report the effects separately for each in-
come group. Students from high-income households are estimated to have a lower coefficient on
tuition (^
         2 = 0.269), so the heterogeneity in their preferences for non-tuition college characteristics
is amplified when expressed in terms of tuition dollars.

Two points stand out from the table. First, there is considerable heterogeneity in how much
students value academic quality, as proxied by the college's median SAT score. A middle-income

student at the high end of the preference distribution (roughly the 85th percentile) would be willing
to pay $13,130 more in tuition to attend a college with median SAT scores of 1400 vs. 1300 (rough
examples would be UCLA vs. Loyola Marymount, or NYU vs. Rutgers), whereas a student at the
low end of the distribution would be willing to pay only $7,530. Second, a majority of students have
strong preferences for attending colleges close to home. For a middle-income student with average
preferences--i.e., with the mean value of 2,i --an increase in distance from 10 to 500 kilometers is
equivalent to a nearly $11,000 increase in tuition. However, some students appear to prefer being
further from home. Our estimates imply that 10 percent of low-income students and 31 percent of
high-income students have positive coefficients on distance. Similarly, most students exhibit strong
home-state biases (for reasons beyond tuition and distance), while a small fraction of students



                                                 18
prefer to go out of their home states.



5.2      Model Fit


As discussed in Section 3.2.1, all of our simulations take as given the observed number of colleges
|Yio | a student applied to. To evaluate how well our model fits the data, we simulate each student i's
optimal application set given size |Yio | by solving the inner layer of problem (5) and then deriving
her optimal enrollment decision given the admissions and financial aid outcomes for the applied-to
colleges. Panel A of Table 8 shows the average characteristics of the colleges students actually ap-
plied to and enrolled in as well as the average characteristics of the colleges our model predicts they
would apply to and enroll in. Some of these college characteristics are common across students--
such as college median SAT, private, and NCAA--while others are college-student specific, such as
admissions and aid probabilities, aid amount, tuition (because tuition for public colleges depends
on in-state status and reciprocity agreements with other states), differences between the student's
SAT and the college's median SAT, whether the college is out of state, and home-college distance.
For enrollment, each row is a simple average across college enrollees. For application, since some
students applied to more than one college, we first take the average of (college-student-specific)
characteristics across the colleges a student applied to, and then average across students.19 Over-
all, the model fits the data well. However, it underpredicts the tuition and home-to-college distance
for both applied colleges and enrolled colleges.

Panel B reports model fits for the fraction of students admitted to any college, and the fraction of
college enrollees among those with at least one offer. Table 12 and Table 13 in the appendix show
model fits by family income and by student SAT, respectively.



6        Counterfactual Simulations

Using our estimated model, we explore two questions about higher education. First, we examine
the implications of the uneven spatial distribution of colleges in the U.S. for students' choices and
welfare. Then, we examine the substitution patterns that would result if public universities' in-state
subsidies were eliminated.
    19
     For example, to obtain the entry in Row 1 of the Application column, we first calculate the college-student-specific
admissions probability pij for student i at each of the colleges she applied to, and take the average across j  Yi ,
                          1                                                                                1  I
yielding an average pi  |Y i|   j Yi pij for the student; then we take the average across students, i.e., I   i=1 pi .

6.1     Geographic Differences in Student Welfare


Given our estimated student preferences, the uneven spatial distribution of colleges in the U.S. may
lead to different outcomes and welfare levels for otherwise identical students depending on where
they live. To quantify these differences, we use our estimates to simulate the outcome and welfare
for the same student were she to live in different counties across the U.S. Since locations may matter
more depending on students' backgrounds, we conduct the cross-county comparison separately for
9 hypothetical students, each representing a group defined by SAT (low, middle, high) and family
income (low, middle, high). The representative student in each group is assigned the average
characteristics of the students in that group.20 For each of the 9 representative students, we place
her into each U.S. county and simulate her application and enrollment outcomes in each county. We
use the same draws of random preference coefficients and shocks (to financial aid and the outside
option) in all counties, so that all differences across simulations for the same representative student
are attributable to the county of residence.

Figure 1 summarizes the geographic variation in students' ex ante welfare upon college application
with heat maps for each combination of family income (low, middle, high shown from the top
    20
       To construct the group averages, we use means for continuous variables and medians for categorical variables
(like family income).

to the bottom) and student SAT tercile (low, middle, high shown from the left to the right).21
The differences shown in the figure reflect a variety of factors. Obviously the main driver is that
most students have relatively strong preferences to attend a nearby college. This preference for
proximity, combined with the substantial heterogeneity in students' preferences for other college
characteristics, makes it quite valuable to live in a place with a wide variety of nearby colleges. This
is especially true for high-SAT students, since their higher chances of admission mean that more
of the nearby colleges will be realistic options for them. Indeed, the largest geographic differences
shown in Figure 1 are for students with high SAT scores. The values of high-SAT students' choice
sets differ sharply across regions, with higher values in the eastern half of the country. A high-
performing student is meaningfully better off if she lives in Virginia instead of Nevada, for instance.
By contrast, geographic heterogeneity for students with low SAT scores is far less pronounced. With
the exception of some remote areas in states like Wyoming and Montana, low-SAT students' ex
ante expected values are roughly the same regardless of where they live. This suggests that the
supply of non-selective colleges in the U.S. has a spatial distribution that mostly matches demand.

Besides the welfare differences shown in Figure 1, the uneven spatial distribution of colleges can also
lead to substantial differences in the same student's likelihood of enrollment, and the characteristics
of the enrolled colleges, depending on her county of residence. The magnitudes of these differences
are summarized in Table 9, which shows the interquartile range of welfare and interquartile ranges
of four predicted outcomes across counties. For instance, the enrollment probability of a low-
income student with a middle SAT score varies by 5.47 percentage points between the 25th and
75th percentile counties, and the median SAT score of the enrolled college varies by 53 points.

Expected utility is measured in tuition dollars. From top to bottom, the family income for the
three rows are  35, 000, (35, 000, 100, 000], and > 100, 000, respectively. From left to right, the
student SAT for the three columns are  950, (950, 1130), and  1, 130, respectively. Each map
has 6 colors, each representing 1/6 of the counties.


There are also meaningful correlations between the same student's welfare and her enrollment
outcome across counties, as shown in Table 10. Each row in the table refers to one of the 9
representative students; the four columns show how each representative student's expected utility
is correlated with her college enrollment probability and the characteristics of enrolled college
(quality, distance and net tuition) when she resides in different counties in the U.S. Not surprisingly,
expected utility is highly correlated with enrollment probability. Among the three characteristics
of the enrolled college, the expected utility is most strongly correlated with distance, but there is
some heterogeneity across student groups. For example, regardless of income, a high-SAT student's
expected utility is strongly correlated with the quality of her enrolled college, while this correlation
is either negative or near zero for low- and middle-SAT students.

A natural question to ask is whether the geographic differences mostly reflect state-level variation,

or whether variation across counties within a state is also important. To answer this question, we
regress a student's county-specific welfare on state fixed effects; the R2 from this regression is shown
in the last column of Table 10. State fixed effects generally explain between one fifth to two thirds
of the cross-county variation, implying that both between- and within-state variation in college
access are important, but to different extents depending on family income and SAT. In particular,
as a student's family income and SAT increase, especially the latter, the student's state of residence
becomes more and more relevant for her utility. For example, for a student with high family income
and high SAT, 66% of the geographic dispersion of expected utility reflects cross-state variation.



6.2      Student Responses to In-state Tuition Subsidies


Most public universities are heavily subsidized, charging much lower tuition for in-state residents.
Peltzman (1973) argues that such subsidies might actually cause students to choose in-state uni-
versities instead of unsubsidized but higher quality institutions for which they would qualify, thus
reducing their educational attainment. At a deeper level, this is an argument against the tuition
subsidy policy that applies to all in-state students; and an evaluation of counterfactual policies
would require an equilibrium model that takes into account the supply side responses. However,
before conducting such a full-blown investigation, a pre-requisite is to understand how an individual
student would respond.

To this end, for each student, we simulate her choice when facing the actual/baseline tuition
schedules, and separately simulate her choice if she were to face counterfactual tuition schedules
in which she has to pay out-of-state tuition at her home-state institutions. To ensure that the



                                                          23
comparison of these two simulations isolates the effect of tuition changes, for each student the two
simulations use the same consideration set, the same draws of random preference coefficients, and
the same draws of the random shocks to financial aid and the outside option.22 Table 11 reports
the differences in average outcomes between the two simulations (counterfactual minus baseline).

Naturally, we find that eliminating subsidies leads students to substitute away from their home
states' universities. Overall, students are 6.97 percentage points more likely to attend a college
outside of their home states, and the average distance to the enrolled college increases by 88.75
kilometers. Some of the substitution is consistent with Peltzman's hypothesis, as higher income
students with high SAT scores on average enroll in colleges with higher SAT scores. Over all
students, however, the average quality of the enrolled college goes down. Some students simply
switch to lower quality in-state universities that charge lower out-of-state tuition than their higher-
quality counterparts. Others switch to lower quality private colleges where they are more likely to
get in and receive aid.23,24

These simulations are at best a crude evaluation of Peltzman's hypothesis, but they suggest that
substitution effects resulting from the removal of in-state tuition subsidies would do little to push
students toward higher quality institutions. Perhaps a stronger argument for increasing in-state
tuition would be that the increased tuition revenue could be used to improve the quality of public
   22
      Tuition is an input into our model of college-specific financial aid, therefore, financial aid amounts are adjusted
accordingly.
   23
      If students in the baseline are not allowed to re-optimize in response to the elimination of the in-state tuition
subsidy, the average net tuition of the enrolled college across all students would increase from $2,105 to $7,413,
compared to $5,191 in the counterfactual where re-optimization is allowed (not shown in the table). The smaller
increase in the counterfactual reflects the switch to colleges with lower out-of-state tuition and more generous financial
aid.
   24
      The predicted enrollment rate (not shown in the table) also drops by 3 percentage points, but our simulation
may underpredict the drop in enrollment because we do not model the extensive margin of college application: if
application costs are high enough, an increase in tuition levels may discourage some students from applying to colleges
at all.

7    Conclusion

A central purpose of this study was to develop and estimate a model that allows for rich hetero-
geneity in students' preferences for college characteristics. From a modeling standpoint, allowing
for heterogeneity in preferences is nothing new: estimating choice models with random coefficients
has long been a standard approach to estimating demand systems in product markets. From a data
standpoint, our key innovation is to use data on students' application sets as a way of credibly iden-
tifying preference heterogeneity. The modeling challenge is to incorporate these data in estimation
without having to fully solve the computationally intractable portfolio problem of students choosing
which colleges to apply to. We achieve this by exploiting necessary conditions for optimality that
respect the subtleties introduced by admissions uncertainties (e.g. the "safety schools" problem).

Our estimates confirm considerable heterogeneity in students' preferences for college attributes.
Most students prefer to attend colleges close to home, and for many students this preference is
quite strong. Preferences for other college characteristics are more variable: for instance, some
students appear to care a lot about academic quality, others very little. Given the uneven spatial
distribution of colleges in the United States, the combination of strong preferences for proximity
and variable preferences for other characteristics implies substantial differences in the expected
values of students' choice sets depending on where they live. These differences are especially large
for high-performing students.

The fact that most students have strong preferences for proximity also means that even large
changes in tuition may not meaningfully change their choices. Peltzman (1973) hypothesized that
tuition subsidies for in-state students might inefficiently distort their choices away from higher-
quality colleges outside their home states, but our simulations indicate that if students were forced
to pay out-of-state tuition at their home state public colleges, most would simply switch to cheaper
colleges that are still close to home. Only high-performing students with higher incomes appear to
substitute toward higher-quality colleges that are further away.

Many policies and programs already aim to equalize opportunity in higher education, such as
private scholarship funds and government financial aid programs that specifically help low-income
students. Our results suggest these policies could also consider equalizing geographic differences
in opportunity, for instance by subsidizing students in locations where colleges are sparse, or by
making investments to raise the quality of academic institutions in targeted locations.

A    Proof of Proposition 1

For convenience, we will drop the Xi and i arguments from the v function, denoting the ex ante
value of being admitted to the set of colleges Oi as v (Oi ). We do the same for the V function,
denoting the value of an application set Yi for student i as V (Yi ). Finally, we drop the Xi argument
and denote the probability that student i is admitted to the set of colleges Oi as P (Oi ).

Under Assumption 1, the value of application set Yi is given by
                                                                                       

                     V (Yi ) =             P (Oi ) v (Oi ) + 1 -                 P (Oi ) E (ui0 )                      (9)
                                   Oi Yi                                 Oi Yi

                              =            P (Oi ) v (Oi ) .
                                   Oi Yi

Pick any school in Yi , say, y  . Oi  Yi \y  are sets that do not include y  . (9) can be written as

          V (Yi ) = piy                P Oi v        Oi , y      + (1 - piy )                      P Oi v Oi
                          {Oi }Yi \y                                               {Oi }Yi \y

Consider the set Yi and Yi where y  is replaced by k.

           V Yi = pik                  P Oi v         Oi , k    + (1 - pik )                   P Oi v Oi
                          {Oi }Yi \y                                             {Oi }Yi \y


    V (Yi ) - V Yi      = piy                     P Oi v       Oi , y      - pik                   P Oi v     Oi , k
                                  {Oi }Yi   \y                                     {Oi }Yi   \y 

                            - (piy - pik )                    P Oi v Oi .
                                              {Oi }Yi   \y 


V (Yi ) - V (Yi )  0 implies

                  piy                P Oi v         Oi , y     - pik                  P Oi v         Oi , k
                        {Oi }Yi \y                                       {Oi }Yi \y
               (piy - pik )                       P Oi v Oi
                                  {Oi }Yi   \y 




B    Choice sets

For each student, the choice set always includes (1) colleges in the actual application set and (2)
public colleges with the highest median SAT in each state that has a reciprocity agreement with


                                                         28
the student's state of residency, or the public college with the highest median SAT in the nearest
neighboring state if the student's state of residency has no reciprocity agreement with any other
state. The rest of the choice set are drawn randomly from the remaining colleges.

Specifically, for each student, all colleges are divided into ten groups that are exhaustive and
mutually exclusive: (i) top public in state, (ii) other public in state, (iii) top private in state, (iv)
other private in state, (v) top public out of state, (vi) middle public out of state, (vii) other public
out of state, (viii) top private out of state, (ix) middle private out of state, and (x) other private
out of state. An in-state public (private) college is classified as top if it meets at least one of three
criteria: (1) median SAT ranks among the top 10% of all public (private) colleges in the country,
(2) median SAT ranks first among all public (private) colleges in state, (3) enrollment ranks first
among all public (private) colleges in state. An in-state public (private) college is classified as other
if it does not meet any of the three criteria. An out-of-state public (private) college is classified
to be: (1) top if its median SAT ranks among the top 10% of all public (private) colleges in the
country, (2) middle if its median SAT ranks among the top 10-30% of all public (private) colleges
in the country, and (3) other if its median SAT ranks among the bottom 70% of all public (private)
colleges in the country.

The number of colleges drawn from each of the ten groups is proportional to the weighted group
size, subject to the following modifications:


   1. Colleges in groups (vii) and (x) receive a weight of 0.5. All other colleges receive a weight of
      1.

   2. There must be at least one college drawn from each of the four in-state groups (i)-(iv),
      unless the group is empty. The numbers for other groups are adjusted so that they are still
      proportional to the weighted group size.

   3. If the number of colleges for a group is not large enough to include the colleges in the actual
      application set and the best public colleges in reciprocity (or the nearest neighboring) states,
      it is increased to the number of the two types of colleges in the group. The numbers for other
      groups are adjusted so that they are still proportional to the weighted group size.

   4. If necessary, a random number is used to make sure the resulting numbers are all integers. As
      an example, suppose steps 1-3 imply that the numbers of colleges drawn from the first two
      groups are 1.6 and 3.4, respectively, while the numbers for the other groups are all integers.
      We would draw a number from the uniform distribution [0,1]. If the number drawn is less
      than 0.6, we set the numbers for the first two groups to 2 and 3, respectively. Otherwise,
      they are set to 1 and 4, respectively.


The colleges in the actual application set and the best public colleges in reciprocity (or the nearest
neighboring) states are drawn first. If the number of these two types of colleges in a group is
smaller than the number to be drawn, the rest are drawn randomly from the remaining colleges in
the group.

While this procedure almost always ensures that the flagship university in a student's home state
is included in her choice set, theoretically it may not be included if (1) the size of group (i) is larger
than one and (2) the flagship is not in the student's application set.

                                                   29
C     Estimation algorithm

We use the following algorithm to construct the quasi-likelihood for student i's observed choices
(application set and enrollment decision):


    1. Simulate M copies of student i with the same characteristics Xi but different preference
       "shocks" k,i , so that each simulated student m  {1, .., M } is characterized by Xi , m   k,i ,
       which are fixed throughout. Also draw a set of S post-application shocks {ij , i0 }, which are
       fixed throughout.
    2. For each simulated student, compare each college j in the observed application set Yi with ev-
       ery college k in Ji \Yi , checking the necessary condition from Proposition 1. For Yi to be opti-
       mal among the set of alternatives involving one-for-one swaps, it must be that V (Yi , Xi , i  m) 
            k\j       m ) for all possible swaps (j, k ), where Y k \j
       V (Yi , Xi , i                                            i     denotes i's application set with col-
       lege k replacing college j . The probability is calculated using a kernel smoothed frequency
       simulator (McFadden (1989)), which converges to the frequency simulator as the smoothing
       parameter  goes to zero, so that the likelihood of the application decision for copy m of
       student i is

                                                                                m)

                                                            exp

                                                                                                      ,Xi ,i
                                    exp                     +                     exp                 
                                                                   j Yi kJi \Yi

    3. For each college o in Oi  {0} (the set Oi of colleges that admitted student i augmented
       to include the outside option of not enrolling in any college j = 0), compute the ex post
       utility Uimso for the random coefficient draw m and post-application shocks s. Letting o be
                                  e
       the observed choice and rimso  Uimso - Uimso , we compute the smoothed likelihood of the
       enrollment decision for copy m of student i as

    4. The smoothed log-likelihood function of the sample is then calculated as

                                               1                   1

                                                    i

       The model parameters are then chosen to minimize this log-likelihood function using a stan-
       dard numerical optimization algorithm.

E    Simulations

For baseline simulations, we proceed as follows:


    1. For each individual, we keep the consideration set (with size J ) and the draws of random
       coefficients and shocks (to financial aid and the outside option) used in estimation.

    2. For each individual, we draw J random numbers to determine the admission outcome of each
       college in the consideration set.

    3. For each draw of the random coefficients, we calculate the expected value of each possible
       combination of n colleges, where n is the number of applications in data. The combination
       with the largest expected value will be the application set.

4. Given the application set and the random numbers that determine the admission outcome of
   each college, we have the admission set. We can then calculate the enrollment outcome for
   each draw of the shocks to financial aid and outside options.
