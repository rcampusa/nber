This paper is the first attempt to structurally estimate the impact of globalization on markups, and
the effect of changing markups on welfare, in a monopolistic competition model. To achieve this,
we work with a class of preferences that allow for endogenous markups and firm entry and exit that
are especially convenient for empirical work – the translog preferences, with symmetry in substitution
imposed across products. Between 1992 and 2005 we find the U.S. market experienced a series of
changes that confirm a pro-competitive effect: import shares rose and U.S. firms exited, leading to
an implied fall in markups, while product variety and welfare went up. We estimate the impacts of
these effects on a national level, and find that U.S. welfare rose by as much as 0.86 percent between
1992 and 2005 as a result of these changes, with product variety contributing one-half of that total.

1. Introduction

         A promise of the monopolistic competition model in trade was that it offered additional

sources of the gains from trade, beyond those from comparative advantage (e.g. Krugman, 1979,

and more recently Melitz, 2003). These additional sources include: consumer gains due to the

expansion of import varieties; efficiency gains due to increasing returns to scale and/or improved

productivity; and welfare gains due to reduced markups.1 While the first two sources of gains

have received recent empirical attention,2 the promise of the third source – reduced markups –

has not yet been realized. To be sure, there are estimates of reduced markups due to trade

liberalization for a number of countries.3 But these cases rely on dramatic liberalizations to

identify the change in markups and are not tied in theory to the monopolistic competition model.

The reason that this model is not used to estimate the change in markups is because of the

prominence of the constant elasticity of demand (CES) system, with its implied constant

markups. To avoid that case, the above authors do not specify the functional form for demand

and instead rely on a natural experiment to identify the change in markups.

         For these reasons, we do not have evidence beyond these case studies about how the

broad process of globalization affects markups, and particularly no evidence on the impact of

such markup reductions on U.S. welfare. This paper is the first attempt to structurally estimate

the impact of globalization on markups, and the effect of changing markups on welfare, in a

  These sources are not mutually exclusive. In Krugman (1979), for example, the welfare gains due to reduced
markups are identical to the gains from increasing returns to scale: as the scale of firms expands due to trade,
average cost is reduced and the gap between price=average cost and marginal cost is also reduced.

  The consumer gains due to import variety have been estimated for the U.S. by Broda and Weinstein (2006). Gains
due to the self-selection of efficient firms into exporting (as in Melitz, 2003) have been demonstrated for Canada by
Trefler (2004) and for a broader sample of countries by Badinger (2007b, 2008). See also Head and Ries (1999,
2001) for Canada, and Tybout et al (1991, 1995) for Chile and Mexico.

Badinger (2007a) for European countries. Most recently, De Loecker, et al (2012) have found that markups in India
increased following liberalization of trade in intermediate inputs.

monopolistic competition model.4 To achieve this we work with a class of preferences that are

relatively new to that literature – the translog preferences, with symmetry in substitution imposed

across products.5 These preferences have good properties for empirical work (Diewert, 1976):

they can give a second-order approximation to an arbitrary expenditure function; and correspond

to the Törnqvist price index, which is very close to price index formulas that are used in practice.

Furthermore, these preferences prove to be highly tractable even as the range of import varieties

changes, and because they are homothetic, we prefer them to the quadratic preferences of Melitz

and Ottaviano (2008) to obtain endogenous markups in a general equilibrium setting.6

         In the translog case the elasticity of demand is inversely related to a product’s market

share, so markups fall as more firms enter, which we call the pro-competitive effect. On the other

hand, domestic firms may exit as foreign competition intensifies, offsetting some of this gain to

consumers. This we will refer to as the domestic exit effect. Incorporating these two effects into

the analysis allows us to estimate the impact of globalization on markups. Furthermore, this class

of preferences also allows us to address three potential criticisms of Broda and Weinstein (2006):

first, that CES preferences may overstate the gains from import variety because reservation

prices are infinite; 7 second, that product space might become crowded resulting in diminishing

returns from new varieties, which are not measured in the CES case; and third, that the CES

4

  These preferences have been used previously in trade by Bergin and Feenstra (2009) and Rodriguez-Lopez (2011).
6
  The quadratic preferences used by Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) lead to linear demand curves with zero income
elasticity, though country population can act as a demand shift parameter. Demand curves of this type and the
associated markups are estimated in the industrial organization literature: see Bresnahan (1989) and the recent trade
application by Blonigen et al (2007). Estimates from gravity equations, however, show that when population is used
as one shift parameter, country income or income per capita is also needed (e.g. Bergstrand, 1989). So the zero
income elasticity assumed in Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) is not sufficient for general equilibrium analysis, where it
is often desirable to work with homothetic preferences: see, for example, Bilbiie, Ghironi, and Melitz (2012), who
adopt the translog preferences when analyzing markups in a dynamic model. For these reasons, we find that the
translog is a very attractive functional form to model variable markups. For other non-homothetic preferences that
allow for variable markups see Behrens and Murata (2007), Behrens et al (2008) and Simonovska (2010).
7
  While the CES system has an infinite reservation price, the area under the demand curve is still bounded above
(provided the elasticity of substitution exceeds unity). But it can be expected that the gains from new product
varieties in the CES case might exceed the gain from other functional forms such as translog; see note 30.
                                                   3

model may overstate the gains because the welfare calculations typically assume that foreign

entry results in no exit of domestic firms.

       We shall address all these concerns using translog preferences, and surprisingly, obtain

estimates of the gains from trade for the U.S. that are similar to those under CES, but with

different sources. Our point estimate for the cumulative welfare gains to the U.S. from new

varieties and decreased markups in our preferred specification is 0.86 percent over the period

1992 to 2005. While much of the previous literature has focused on the gains from varieties, our

analysis suggests that variety gains only account for one-half of the aggregate gains. That effect

incorporates the loss in variety due to the exit of domestic U.S. firms. The remainder of the

welfare gain is due to the impact of new competitors on markups. Interestingly, our combined

gains for the U.S. due to import variety and the pro-competitive effect are of the same magnitude

as Broda and Weinstein’s CES estimates in our preferred specification. This finding resonates

well with the recent paper of Arkolakis, Costinot, Donaldson and Rodriguez-Clare (ACDR,

2012), who argue that with a broad class of preferences including translog, the formula for the

gains from trade is the same as that obtained in the CES case analyzed by Arkolakis, Costinot,

Rodriguez-Clare (ACR, 2012). But despite this apparent similarity between our results and

theirs, the reasons for our findings are quite different.

       Specifically, ACDR focus on the second reason mentioned above for gains from trade:

the efficiency gains due to improved productivity, as the most efficient firms self-select into

exporting. Under their assumptions that the distribution of firm productivity is Pareto with a

support that is unbounded above, and the only parameter changing between equilibria are trade

costs, they find that the efficiency gains are identical in the translog and CES cases. Furthermore,

by construction in their model the first and third reasons for gains from trade mentioned above
                                                 4

do not operate: trade brings about neither changes in product variety nor in the distribution of

markups, both of which remain fixed as the costs of trade change. As shown in Feenstra (2014)

and by numerical methods in ACDR, if the distribution of firm productivity is instead a Pareto

with a bounded support, then the product variety and pro-competitive effects reappear. We focus

exclusively on product variety and firm markups and ignore the impact of trade on productivity

through the self-selection of firms into exporting. Additional efficiency gains due to improved

productivity can certainly apply in our model, but we do not attempt to measure these.

       In the next section, we present some features of the data that are used to infer product

variety and markups. In section 3, we introduce the translog expenditure function and solve for

the cost-of-living index in the presence of new and disappearing goods, which allow the gains

from new products to be measured in section 4. Firms are introduced in section 5, where we

solve for the pro-competitive effect of imports. To measure the change in markups we follow the

general approach of the industrial organization literature (Bresnahan, 1989; Berry, 1994):

markups are not observed directly because marginal costs are unknown, so we rely on estimates

of the elasticity of demand to identify the markups. We do not have the data to measure those

elasticities at the firm level, so we rely instead on Herfindahl indexes of concentration for both

U.S. firms and countries exporting to the U.S. We show that these Herfindahl indexes, in

conjunction with the share of each country in the U.S., provide theoretically consistent ways to

measure the pro-competitive and variety effects. Significantly, we have been able to obtain these

indexes for all countries selling to the U.S., by land or by sea, as described in Appendix A. In

section 6 we discuss the procedure for estimating the system of demand and pricing equations,

and results are presented in section 7. Section 8 concludes.

2. Data Preview

        One of the dramatic changes that globalization has wrought on the U.S. economy is the

declining share of U.S. demand supplied by plants located in the U.S. To see this, we define U.S.

domestic supply as aggregate U.S. sales less exports for agricultural, mining, and manufacturing

goods (see the Appendix A for detailed definitions of all of our variables). We define U.S.

apparent consumption as domestic supply plus imports. Similarly, we define the U.S. suppliers’

share of the U.S. market, as U.S. domestic supply divided by apparent consumption. Finally, we

define each country’s U.S. import share as the exports from that country to the U.S. divided by

apparent consumption.

        From Table 1 we see that the share of U.S. apparent consumption sourced domestically

fell by a little more than 5 percentage points between 1992 and 1997 and by 9 percentage points

between 1998 and 2005. This decline corresponds to an annual decline in the U.S. share of 1.4

percentage points per year in the early period and 1.7 percentage points per year in the later

period. The flip side of this decline was an almost doubling of the import share. Interestingly, the

growth of imports was not uniform across countries: depending on the time period, between one-

half and two-thirds of the increase was due to increases in import shares from Canada, China,

and Mexico – countries that were either growing rapidly or involved in free trade agreements.8

        One possible explanation for the findings in Table 1 is that the rise in import penetration

was confined to a few important sectors. We can examine whether this was the case by looking

at more disaggregated data. In Figure 1, we plot the U.S. suppliers’ share in 1997 or 2005 against

its level in 1992 or 1998, for each HS 4-digit category. We also place a 45-degree line in the plot


8
 The switch in U.S. classification of output data from the SIC system to the NAICS in 1998 makes it difficult to
compare sectoral output levels between 1997 and 1998. We therefore break our sample into two periods (1992-1997
and 1998-2005) to maintain consistent series. For the initial tables, we will present the raw data drawn from two
subsamples, but we will present results for both sub-periods and the full sample in the results section.
                                                         6

so that one can easily see that the vast majority of sectors lie below the 45-degree line, meaning

that import penetration was steadily expanding over this time period. This pattern establishes that

the rise in import penetration, though quite pronounced in some sectors, was a general

phenomenon that was common across many merchandise sectors.

        To make this clear, it is convenient to work with Herfindahl indexes of market

concentration, defined for each country selling to the U.S. We let i denote countries, j denote

firms (each selling one product), k denote sectors and t denote time. Let sikjt denote firm j’s

exports from country i to the U.S. in sector k, as a share of country i’s total exports to the U.S. in

that sector. Then the Herfindahl for country i is:


                                                         
                                            H itk   sikjt
                                                              2
                                                                  .                                     (1)
                                                    j


        The inverse of a Herfindahl can be thought of as the effective number of equally-sized

exporters, or U.S. firms, in an industry. Thus, a Herfindahl of one implies that there is one firm

in the industry and an index of 0.5 would arise if there were two equally-sized firms in the sector.

Similarly, if we multiply the Herfindahl by the share of the country’s suppliers in the market, one

obtains the market share of a synthetic typical firm in the market. This Herfindahl index is a very

useful statistic because in many demand systems, the markup of a firm is monotonically

increasing in its market share, and this feature will also hold in our translog system.

        We were able to obtain the Herfindahl indexes for most countries selling to the U.S., by

land or by sea, in 1992 and 2005 (see the Appendix A). In Table 2, we present average

Herfindahls at the HS 4-digit level for the U.S. and for the 10 major exporters to the U.S.9 As

one can see from the table, the average U.S. Herfindahl rose slightly over both sub-periods,


9
  For the U.S., we have adjusted the NAICS 6-digit Herfindahls from the Bureau of Economic Analysis data so that
they match the HS 4-digit categories, and detail that procedure in the data Appendix.
                                                          7

indicating that increased foreign competition was likely associated with some exit of U.S. firms

from the market. If we multiply this average Herfindahl by the share of each country i in the U.S.

consumption of good k, sitk we can compute the typical market share of a firm from that country,

H itk s itk . We report the weighted average of these per-firm market shares in the last column of

Table 2, where the weights are based on the importance of each sector in total U.S. consumption.

Table 2 reveals that the share in the U.S. market of a typical U.S. firm fell slightly in the first

period and by about 8 percent in the second period. By contrast exporters to the U.S. appear to

have gained market share in both periods. In other words, those U.S. firms that survived ended

up with smaller market shares individually while some foreign firms gained market share. But

the overall average of firm shares, shown by the final averages in the last column Table 2,

decline in both periods.

         This data preview suggests that prior work on the impact of new varieties is likely to

suffer from a number of biases. First, as foreign firms have entered the U.S. market there has

been exit by U.S. firms, which serves to offset some of the gains of new varieties. Second, while

U.S. Herfindahls rose, the Herfindahls of many of our largest suppliers fell. The fall in the firm-

level import Herfindahls suggests that there may have been substantial variety growth that is not

captured in industry level analyses. Finally, because the market shares of both U.S. firms and the

average firm fell over this time period, the rise in foreign entry is likely to have depressed

markups overall and therefore lowered prices.10 Thus, estimates of the gains from new varieties


10
  While we infer the change in markups for U.S. firms using indirect evidence on their market shares and
Herfindahl indexes, there is direct evidence from other countries to support the idea that trade liberalization is
associated with falling markups. In addition to the work cited in our first paragraph, several studies have also shown
that falls in domestic market share due to imports are associated with lower domestic markups. For example,
Badinger (2007b) shows that when looking within the same manufacturing sectors, OECD countries that have
higher import shares tend to have lower markups in their domestic industries. This result remains robust even when
he instruments for import penetration exogenous factors related to openness such as distance and other gravity
factors. Similarly, Konings et al (2005) find evidence that markups are positively related to Herfindahl indexes and
                                                                  8

obtained from industry-level data using CES aggregators could either be too large if domestic

exit is an important source of variety loss, or too small if foreign firm entry and market power

losses are important unmeasured gains. We turn to quantifying these gains and losses in the next

sections.


3. Translog Expenditure Function

          We begin by considering a translog expenditure function defined over products denoted

by i, and then will later introduce notation that allows us to consider countries, firms, and

industries.11 The translog function is defined over the universe of products, whose maximum
                                      ~
number is denoted by the fixed number N . The expenditure needed to obtain a fixed utility (or

the “ideal” price index) in period t is:

                                    
                                    N                   N
                                                       N 
                   ln e t  0   i ln pit            ij ln pit ln p jt , with ij = ji .
                                                   1
                                                                                                                (2)
                                                   2
                                    i 1               i 1 j1


Note that the restriction that ij = ji is made without loss of generality.12 We add the further

restriction that the ij coefficients for all goods are “symmetric,” by which we mean:

                             N  1                 
                    ii                                                             .
                                      0, and  ij    0 for i  j, with i, j = 1,…, N                       (3)
                                
                              N                     N

These symmetry restrictions have not been used in past work dealing with estimating the translog

function, but are essential in our monopolistic competition model.


that markups in concentrated sectors fall significantly when trade liberalization leads to higher levels of import
penetration. This study provides additional evidence for a negative relationship between domestic market share and
markups. Finally, Konings and Vandenbussche (2005) find that antidumping protection not only raises the markups
of European firms, but does so even more when importers have high market shares. The fact that protection raises
domestic markups more when domestic market shares are low provides additional support for the notion that firms
with low market shares are likely to have relatively low markups.
11
   The translog direct and indirect utility functions were introduced by Christensen, Jorgenson and Lau (1975), and
the expenditure function was proposed by Diewert (1976, p. 122).

          The share of each good in expenditure can be computed by differentiating (2) with

respect to ln p i , obtaining:

where the second line is obtained using the symmetry conditions in (3). Notice that the term

ln p(t) refers to the average over all the prices of all goods in period t. But that average will

include goods that are not available to the consumer, in which case the appropriate price to use in

the expenditure function is the reservation price, where demand equals zero. So we want to solve

for the reservation prices for goods not available, and then re-express the expenditure and share

equations so that they no longer depend explicitly on these reservation prices.

          We let I t denote the set of goods available each period, with number N t . We can solve

for the reservation price of the goods not available by setting the share equation in (4) equal to

zero. More generally, we can invert the share equation to solve for the prices of all goods in

terms of their shares:

                                                 i  sit
                                     ln pit               ln p(t) ,                          (4')
                                                    

which equals the reservation price of good i when sit  0. It is convenient to substitute (4') back

into the expenditure function (2) to obtain an expression for the cost-of-living in terms of shares.

After some simplification, we obtain:13

           While this expression is close to what we shall use to evaluate the cost-of-living, we still

need to eliminate the reservation prices within the overall average ln p(t) . That is done by

expanding this average as:

Notice that ln p t is the average of prices over the goods actually available, while t is inversely

related to the range of goods available: as the set I t expands, then the summation                     jI  j rise

and Nt also rises, so t falls. We can substitute these two terms into the expenditure function (5)
to obtain:

Taking the change in the expenditure function the first two terms vanish and we obtain:

           Equation (7) is a useful expression for the change in the cost of living and consists of

three terms. The first term is an unweighted average of the change in log-prices for available

products, and will cancel out is subsequent formula, so we focus on the next two terms. The

second term is a shift parameter t/ where, as noted above, where the entry of new products

will result in t < 0 so that the cost of living falls. The third term is the change in the Herfindahl

index of product shares.

           To interpret the second term, denote the set of products available both periods by

I  It  I t 1 , with N > 0 elements. For simplicity, suppose that the prices of all products are

unchanging. Then sit   t , and averaging over the N products we obtain:

where we use the fact that the shares sum to unity each period. Thus, –t is directly related to

the share of expenditure on new goods minus the share of expenditure on disappearing goods.

Feenstra (1994) shows that those shares, in conjunction with the elasticity of substitution,

determine the gains from variety in the CES case. To develop this comparison with the CES case

more carefully, note that from Feenstra (1994) we can express the “ideal” CES price index as:

                                  e                        1                              

where I  It  I t 1 is the common set of goods in both periods. The first expression on the right

of (8) is a weighted average of the log price changes, similar in spirit to the unweighted average

appearing as the first term on the right of (7).15 The second expression on the right of (8) is the

welfare gain from new and disappearing goods in the CES case, which involves dividing the net

change in expenditure on new and disappearing goods by the elasticity of substitution minus

unity, ( – 1). As we have shown above, that expression is very similar to the second term t/

on the right of (7), which likewise involves dividing the net change in expenditure on new and

15
     The weights wit appearing in (8) are the Sato-Vartia weights defined in Feenstra (19994, pp. 158-159).

disappearing goods by the translog parameter . The expenditures on new and disappearing

goods are measured in logs and levels, respectively, in the CES and translog cases, and the

substitution parameters ( – 1) and  correspondingly differ, but otherwise there is a high degree

of similarity between the CES and translog expressions. The key difference between (7) and (8)

is that in the translog case we have an additional term in (8), the change in the Herfindahl index

of product shares, that has no analogue in the CES case. Notice that a fall in the Herfindahl index

raises the cost-of-living index in (7), which is surprising because a fall in the Herfindahl

indicates less concentration of shares, due to more new products for example. So why does the

cost-of-living go up in that case? The answer illustrates a key difference between the translog

and CES formulas.

         Consider replacing one good having a high share parameter 1t-1 in period t-1 with two

other goods having lower values of 2t and 3t in period t (while goods 4,…,N are unchanged).

We choose these parameters so that the total share of spending on goods 1 and 2+3 are identical,

s1t-1 = s2t + s3t (with s4t, …, sNt unchanged). Because there are two goods instead of one, the

Herfindahl index is lower: s1t2 1   i  4 sit2 1 > s 22t  s3t   i  4 sit2 , provided that s2t ,s3t  0. That
                                            N                   2      N




would raise the cost of living in (6) because product space is more “crowded,” so that goods are

more substitutable.16 In other words, as the number of varieties increases, we care less about each

new variety. This explains why the Herfindahl index of product shares enters the cost-of-living

index in a counter-intuitive way. Notice that this crowding effect does not occur in the CES case,

because replacing one good with two new goods that have the same total expenditure would have

no impact at all on consumer well being.


16
  This claim can be confirmed from the elasticity of demand in (17). With identical prices for all goods, so
sNt  1 / N , this elasticity becomes 1  (N  1) which is increasing in N.

4. Consumer Gains from New Varieties

              In order to implement the cost-of-living formula in (6), we estimate the shift parameter

t as well as the translog parameter . Because we do not have firm-level data we shall rely on

Herfindahl indexes of U.S. firms and of firms exporting to the U.S. To show how the aggregation

over firms is done in the theory, we will henceforth let i  I t denote the countries selling to the

U.S. each period (including the U.S. itself) and j  J it denote their firms. We shall assume that

each firm sells one product in a given sector with its share denoted by sijt . The total import share

from country i is sit   jJ sijt , and we let sijt  sijt / sit denote firms’ shares within the exports
                                       it



of country i. Then the Herfindahl index for country i is H it   jJ (sijt )2 .
                                                                                           it



              We re-writing the share equation in (4) and (6) using this new notation as:

the average log-price of all available goods in period t.17 Multiplying the above equation by the

firms’ shares within the exports of a country, sijt  sijt / sit , and summing over firms with


 jJ   it
             sijt  1 ,we obtain:


                                                                                      

where it   jJ sijt ij and ln pit   jJ sijt ln pijt are weighted averages of the taste parameters

and log prices, respectively. It is natural to model it as a country fixed effect plus an error term:

     We use the summation  as a shorthand for   , i.e. to sum across all available products each period.

Substituting this equation above, we obtain the share equation,

        In the next section we show how the translog parameter  is obtained using an estimator

that differences across time and across countries, thereby eliminating the fixed effects i and t

in (11). Supposing that we have the translog parameter, we can move the prices to the left in (11)

and therefore obtain an unbalanced panel from which we can estimate these fixed effects. But

since we are only interested in t, the simplest approach it to difference (11) for a non-empty

set of countries i  I  I t 1  I t , thereby eliminating i, so that we are left with:

                                        1
                            t  ln p t   (Hitsit )   ln pit  it , i  I .              (12)
                                        

By taking a weighted average of the terms on the right, we obtain the terms on the left, which is

what we need to construct the cost-of-living index in (6). The weights that we shall use to form

the average are the average shares shown in the Törnqvist index (9), restricted to the countries

i  I . Specifically, define:

                                                  1             

as the shares for the countries in I , re-normalized to sum to unity. Then we apply the Törnqvist

weights 12 (sit 1  sit ) to (12) and sum over i  I to obtain:

                                                       1                               

        To measure the left-hand side precisely, we need all three terms in brackets on the right,

but only the first two are observed. The final term on the right is the change in the weighted-

average taste parameters for each country, it  it    jJ sijt ij . It is difficult to measure
                                                                               it

exact price indexes when taste parameters are changing, and this difficulty appeared in the CES

case analyzed by Feenstra (1994). To overcome it, Feenstra assumed that there was a subset of

countries i  I for which the CES taste parameters were constant. In that case, it became

possible to measure the exact CES price index for that subset of countries, while the remaining

terms indicated the gains from new or disappearing countries as well as those with changing taste

parameters. Taking the same approach here, we set it  0 in (14) for i  I , and substitute that

expression into (6) to obtain the result:


Proposition 1

Suppose that there is a set of countries i  I  I t 1  I t , I   , with it  0. Then the

Törnqvist cost-of-living index is:

where the final terms define the variety effect Vt. If it  0 for i  I  I t 1  I t , then:


                                          Vt   1  sit 1sit H it .                                         (16)

                                                   i I



        The first term on the right of (15) is the conventional Törnqvist cost-of-living index

defined over the prices of those countries i  I with constant taste parameters. The additional

terms define Vt as the extra impact of product variety on the cost of living, with Vt > 0 indicating

greater variety and lower cost of living. The variety effect itself is defined by two terms: the

first is the effective firm shares H it sit , with falling shares indicating welfare gains. In Table 1,

we saw that Hit sit fell for the United States and rose for some other exporters, but on average
                                                            16

fell over both sample periods. This average decline in the typical market share of a firm indicates

that there is increased spending on new countries and products, so we should expect to see a gain

from variety. But that gain is potentially offset by the change in the overall Herfindahl appearing

as the last term in (15), which is the share-weighted average of (Hit sit ) as shown in the last row

of Table 1, and reflects crowding in product space. We note that this decomposition of the total

welfare change in (15) is closer to the CES decomposition that we reported in (8), because in

both cases the first term is the exact price index over the set of goods i  I  I t 1  I t , while the

remaining terms reflect the cost-of-living reduction from new varieties: in the translog case in

(15), those remaining terms include the change in the overall Herfindahl, reflecting crowding.

         In (16) we provide a simplified expression for Vt that holds if there were no change in the

set of countries selling to the United States, so that we could choose I  I t 1  I t .18 In the CES

case considered by Feenstra (1994) and Broda and Weinstein (2006), there would then be no

gains from import variety because there are no new countries selling to the U.S. But now we can

use the Herfindahl indexes for each country to infer entry or exit of firms and products: falling

Herfindahls due to entry will contribute towards gains with Vt > 0, whereas exit will contribute

towards Vt < 0. We stress, however, that (16) is valid if and only if there is no change in the

average taste parameters for all countries, it  0 for i  I  I t 1  I t .19

         The remaining question is how the set of countries I  I t 1  I t , for which the taste

parameters are constant, will be chosen. Broda and Weinstein (2006) chose the set I as the


18
   The proof of (16) is provided in Appendix B.
19
    Notice that this assumption did not hold in the example we provided in section 3, where one good having a high
share parameter 1t-1 was replaced with two other goods having lower values of 2t and 3t (while goods 4,…,N are
unchanged). We chose those parameters so that the total share of spending on goods 1 and 2+3 were identical, s1t-1 =
s2t + s3t , resulting in a fall in the Herfindahl index and a consumer loss. In contrast, a fall in the Herfindahl index in
(16), with no change in taste parameters, will lead to consumer gains.
                                                                  17

intersection of countries supplying in the first and last years of the sample. So all countries

selling to the United States in the initial year, and not disappearing by the end of the sample, are

presumed to have no expansion in product varieties within their exports to the United States. We

can improve on this assumption by using information on the Herfindahl indexes of exporters to

the U.S. in each sector. We shall interpret Herfindahl indexes that are changing by more than a

tolerance as evidence of large changes in it, and exclude these countries from the set I , as will

be discussed in more detail in section 7.


5. Producers and the Pro-Competitive Effect

         To develop a simple general equilibrium expression for welfare, suppose that firms

selling to the U.S. each produce a single product and act as Bertrand competitors. The profit

maximization problem for a firm j exporting from country i in period t is,

                                                pijt x ij (p t ,E t )  Cij[x ij (p t ,E t )] ,
                                      max
                                     pijt  0



where x ij (p t , E t ) denotes the demand arising from the translog system, with the price vector pt

and expenditure Et, and Cij [x ij (p t , E t )] is the cost of production. We denote the elasticity

of demand by ijt   ln x ij (p t , E t ) /  ln pijt , which from (9) is:

                                                 ln sijt                  (N t  1)
                                    ijt  1                       1              .                 (17)
                                                 ln pijt                    sijt N t
                                                                   

Then the optimal price can be written as the familiar markup over marginal costs:

                                                      ijt                             sijt N t 

                                                                                       (N  t   1) 

where C 'ijt  C 'ij[x ij (p t , E t )] denotes marginal cost.
                                                                        18

         We do not have the firm-level data needed to measure the above expression directly. But

we can aggregate it by taking a weighed average using the firm shares sijt  sijt / sit within the

exports of country i. Then the geometric average of prices from country i is:

                                                                                      sit sijt N t 
                   ln pit       sijt   ln pijt  ln C'it            sijt   ln 1               ,                     (18)
                              j                                jJ it               (N t  1) 

where ln C'it   j sijt ln C'ijt are the average marginal costs. We are not able to measure (18)

directly in the absence of firm-level information, but data on the Herfindahl indexes for each

exporting country will allow us measure a first-order approximation to (18) around the point

where the firm shares are equal. Recall that the inverse of the Herfindahl can be thought of as the
effective number of equally-sized firms, each of which would then have the share sijt  H it .

Since the first-order approximation to the log function is ln(1  x)  ln(1  a)   x1aa  around x=a,

we apply this formula to (18) around sijt  H it to obtain:

which is obtained since H it   jJ (sijt )2 and                        jJ          sijt  1 . The average country markup
                                                 it                               it


appearing as the final term in (19) is the markup for a firm with the average share sijt  sit Hit . In

other words, we are ignoring the variation in firm sizes within countries when we compute the

“average” markup for each country in (19). In the absence of having such firm-level information

for all countries exporting to the United States, however, we believe that this average markup is

the best that we can do.20,21


20
  In order to assess the importance of limitation of this approach, we simulated firm-level data to compare the true
markup in (18) with the approximation in (19). We begin by assuming that γ=0.19 (which is our median estimate)
and that the underlying firm sales distribution follows Zipf’s Law, i.e. we used a Pareto distribution with a shape
parameter of 1 and a minimum value of 10. Then we assumed that there were 500 firms in each sector and that every
                                                           19

         To obtain an expression for welfare, suppose that labor is the only factor of production,

with wage wt. We make the key assumption that profits of firms are zero under monopolistic

competition, so that welfare of the representative consumer is Wt  w t / e(p t ), or the real wage.

The change in the real wage is  ln Wt   ln w t   ln e  p t  . We evaluate the cost-of-living

index from (15), where the first term on the right is the conventional Törnqvist index defined

over the average log-prices for each country. Those averages are in turn approximated as in (19).

Combining these results, we have:

Proposition 2

The change in welfare of the representative consumer with translog preferences is:
                                                                                         

         The approximation in (20) depends on the first-order approximation to prices in (19), and

also assumes that the change in the taste parameters it for i  I is small, as was assumed in

Proposition 1. The term in brackets on the right in (20) is the change in wages relative to a

Törnqvist index of marginal costs, for both domestic and foreign-produced goods. Its role in

firm in each sector except the first firm had a sales share drawn from this Pareto distribution. If we impose that the
sector must have the actual Herfindahl index in the data, and the sales of all but the first firm are drawn from the
Pareto distribution, then the Herfindahl index implicitly defines the sales of the first firm. We then used this
simulated firm-level data to construct the true markup equation, i.e. the second term on the right of (18). We then
calculated the percentage difference of the approximation, the last term on the right of (19) from the actual simulated
values as: diff = [(actual – approx)/ (actual value)], where Jensen’s inequality guarantees that diff < 0. When we
applied this method using the Herfindahl indexes for each sector and country selling to the U.S., we found that the
median difference was -0.005 percent and the mean difference was -0.28 percent, indicating the first-order
approximation holds quite closely.
21
   It is possible that (19) overstates the average markup if the Herfindahl index of exporters is computed by
bundling products within a single shipment, making firms appear bigger than they really are. We used the PIERS
data, described in Appendix A, to check for the prevalence of trading companies, i.e. those whose names including
“trading”, “wholesale”, “import” or “export”, “group”, or abbreviations of these terms. There were about 8,000 such
firms, and they accounted for 5 percent of exports to the U.S. in 1992 and 7.5 percent in 2005.

welfare is similar to the real earnings of home factors in term of imported goods – or the “single

factoral terms of trade” introduced by Viner (1937) – except that in (20) we have stripped out

firm markups. Viner introduced this concept because it is highly relevant to the welfare gains

from trade, and we agree. For example, this term captures the positive effect of import

competition on firm selection and welfare, through forcing the exit of less-efficient firms and

lowering average costs. That effect is the focus of ACR (2012) and ACDR (2012), but we do not

attempt to measure it here.22

         We focus on the remaining terms in welfare. The pro-competitive effect Pt in (21) once

again depends on the change in Hitsit, and from Table 1, that typical market share of a firm was

on average falling over both sample periods. This decline provides the intuition for why we

should expect to see a welfare gain from reduced markups as measured by Pt. A final

approximation is needed to measure the pro-competitive effect, and that concerns the number of

available product Nt which appears in (21). We shall consider two methods of making this

approximation, the choice of which does not matter for the results.

         One approach is to measure Nt by the inverse of the overall Herfindahl shown in (8),

which would equal the number of synthetic, equally-sized firms in each industry. That approach

is a lower-bound to the number of products, however, since firms might not be equally-sized and

they might sell more than one product each. A second approach is to treat the term Nt/(Nt – 1)

appearing in (21) as close enough to unity to be ignored. This approach follows from a standard

assumption in monopolistic competition models that firms ignore the impact of their prices on

the overall price index. In the demand equation (9), the average log-prices ln p t acts like a price

22
   This term would be considerably more complex once we allow for multiple factors of production and realistic
input-output linkages in the economy. For example, Feenstra et al (2013) argue that a portion of the productivity
increase in the United States after the mid-1990’s is due to improvements in the terms of trade, especially for high-
technology goods. Measuring the full impact of trade on U.S. productivity is beyond the scope of this paper.

index for the market. If the firm does not consider the impact of its own price on this price index,

then the elasticity of demand is,

                                   ijt  1                           1   .
                                                  ln pijt                  sijt 
                                                             ln p t         

Comparing this result with (17), we see that the two elasticities are the same if and only if

Nt is sufficiently large so that Nt/(Nt – 1)1. We will experiment with both approaches when

measuring Nt in order to obtain the pro-competitive effect.

        Proposition 2 is our final expression for the change in welfare, and depends on the pro-

competitive effect Pt and the variety effect Vt. Of course, these terms can differ across sectors, so

we need to sum the welfare gains across all of the manufacturing sectors in our sample. We do

this by adding an industry superscript k to Pt and Vt, then multiplying the welfare gain in each

industry by the appropriate translog weight, and summing across all sectors,

                                                             

                                         k

where skt is the share of sector k in U.S. absorption in period t.23 Since the consumption of

merchandise only accounts for about 19 percent of U.S. absorption, a drop in the price of

manufactured goods translates into about a one-fifth as large gain in aggregate welfare. That is,

we multiplied all our welfare calculations from (22) by 0.19 to present them as relative to the

entire U.S. economy. We omit the sector k notation in the next section, though our estimation is

done separately over each sector.



23
  While we had the appropriate shares of each sector within manufacturing for 1992 and 2005, we used data from
the benchmark input-output tables to obtain the aggregate share of merchandise apparent consumption in total U.S.
final demand. We computed this by using the 2002 use table from the benchmark input-output table before
redefinitions. We set apparent consumption of merchandise equal to agricultural, mining, and manufacturing value
added less exports plus imports. Total U.S. absorption was set equal to U.S. final goods demand.

6. Estimation

        Our next task is to address how to estimate the translog parameter  , which is obtained

from the share equation (11). The important property of this share equation is that the parameter

 does not depend on the set of goods available, which only influences the time-effect t. We can

expect that the prices appearing in (11) are endogenous, as in a conventional supply and demand

system. For the CES case, Feenstra (1994) showed how this endogeneity could be overcome by

specifying the supply equation and assuming that the demand and supply errors are uncorrelated:

that moment condition was used to estimate the model parameters.24 We will follow the same

procedure in the translog case, as described next.

        We use the first-order approximation to obtain the weighted average of prices in (19),

which in practice are measured by the unit-value of imports from each source country and

industry, and the price index within each industry for the United States. We further specify that

the weighted average of marginal costs from each exporting country take on the iso-elastic form:

                                                         s E     
                                    ln C'it  i0   ln  it t     it ,
                                                          pit    

where the term (s it E t / p it ) reflects the total quantity exported from country i, and it is an error

term. Combining the above equation with (19), we obtain a modified pricing equation:

                                                                   H s N 
                  (1  )ln pit  i0   lnsit   ln E t  ln 1  it it t   it .                     (23)
                                                                  (N t  1) 

        We see that the translog parameter  appears in both the share equation (11) and the

pricing equation (23): larger  means that the goods are stronger substitutes and the markups are

correspondingly smaller. It is also evident that the shares and prices are endogenously

24
   Identification of the model parameters from this moment condition depended on having heteroskedasticity in
second-moments of the data, so this is an example of “identification through heteroskedasticity,” as discussed more
generally by Rigobon (2003).
                                                            23


determined: shocks to either supply it or demand it will both be correlated with shares sit and

prices pit. To control for this endogeneity we will estimate these equations simultaneously using

a similar methodology to that proposed in the CES case by Feenstra (1994) and extended by

Broda and Weinstein (2006).

       The first step in our estimation is to difference (11) and (23) with respect to country k and

with respect to time, thereby eliminating the terms i + t and the overall average prices ln p t

appearing in the share equations and eliminating total expenditure ln E t . We also divide the share

equation by  and the pricing equation by (1  ) , and then express each equation in terms of its

error term:

                  (  it   kt )   [  (H it sit )   (H kt s kt )]
                                                                        (  ln pit   ln p kt ) ,

                                    (  ln pit   ln p kt ) 

We multiply these two equations together, and average the resulting equation over time, to obtain

the estimating equation:

                                      (1  )

         We shall assume that the error terms in demand and the pricing equation are uncorrelated,

which means that the error term in (24) becomes small, u i  0 in probability limit as T   .

That error term is therefore uncorrelated with any of the right-hand side variables as T   , and

we can exploit those moment conditions by simply running OLS on (24). Feenstra (1994) shows

that procedure will give us consistent estimates of  and  in a slightly simpler system, provided

that the right-hand side variables in (24) are not perfectly collinear as T   . As in the CES

case of Feenstra (1994), that condition will be assured if there is some heteroskedasticity in the

error terms across countries i, so that the right-hand side variables in (24) are not perfectly

collinear. More efficient estimates can be obtained by running weighted least squares on (24).

         Before proceeding with the estimation, we need to address a number of data problems.

First, while in principle we could estimate  at the 10-digit level, our estimates would not be

precise because often there are few countries exporting in a given 10-digit HS product. In order

to make sure that we have enough data to obtain precise estimates, we assume that the ’s at the

10-digit level within an HS-4-digit sector are the same, and therefore pool the HS-10-digit goods

within each 4-digit sector.25


25
  This approach means that a sector typically had 94 varieties – defined as a distinct (country,10-digit good) pair –
when we estimate  for an HS-4 sector.
                                                          25

         A second complication arises because we have U.S. shipments data at the NAICS 6-digit

level but we need to compute shares at the HS-10 digit level. Thus, we must allocate NAICS 6-

digit production data to each HS 10-digit sector. In order to do this, we assume that the share of

U.S. production in each HS 10-digit is the same as that of the U.S. in the NAICS 6-digit sector

that contains it, as discussed in Appendix A.

         A third complication arises because we use unit values of import prices from each source

country rather than the geometric mean price, which introduces measurement error, especially

for import flows that are very small. Broda and Weinstein (2006) propose a weighting scheme

based on the quantity of imports at the HS-10 level. Unfortunately, we cannot implement

precisely that scheme because the U.S. quantity indexes were defined at the NAICS 6-digit level

and not at the HS-10 digit level. We therefore implement the Broda and Weinstein weighting

scheme using the value of shipments instead of the quantity of shipments, since shipment values

are likely to be highly correlated with shipment quantities across countries.

         Finally, as in Broda and Weinstein (2006), we also face the problem that only 86 percent

of our estimates of  had the right sign if we estimate them without constraints. If  is less than

zero, then this implies that markups are negative, and there is no equilibrium. Since we want to

rule this out and because V is very sensitive to small values of , we impose   0.05. To achieve

this, we use a grid search procedure over  and  to minimize the sum of squared errors in (24).

In this procedure we set an initial value for  of 0.05 and increased it by 5 percent over the range

[.05, 110].26 Similarly, we set an initial  of -5 and increased it by 0.1 over the range [-5, 15].




26
  In order to speed up the grid searches, in most specifications we increased the interval by 5 percent until 7.8 and
then jumped to 109.9. We did this because we almost never found gammas between 7.8 and 109.9. Moreover,
making this change did not qualitatively affect the results because all high gammas imply very small markups and
variety effects.

7. Estimation Results

       The coefficients γ k for each sector k are obtained by estimating equation (24). Because

we ultimately estimate over one thousand γ k ’s , it is not possible to display all of them here. We

display the sample statistics for γ k and 1/ γ k in Table 3. The median  is 0.19 and the average is

12. The large average k is driven by the fact that their distribution is not symmetric and k can

take on very large values if goods are relatively homogeneous. It is difficult to have strong priors

for what a reasonable value of k should be. One possible benchmark is the implied markup. We

can compute the markup for each industry by using equation (19). Based on this calculation the

median estimated markup in our data is 0.30 (i.e. a 30% markup over marginal costs) in 2005.

By comparison, Domowitz, Hubbard, and Petersen (1988) estimate markups across U.S.

manufacturing and obtain an average markup of 0.37, which is a bit higher than ours but not

dramatically different especially given the large differences in data and estimating procedures.

       The markups in each sector depend on the value of the firm’s market share as well. We

can get some sense of the reasonableness of our estimates by looking at the most important

sectors in U.S. absorption. In Table 4, we report the share of U.S. absorption from the ten largest

sectors (with names not beginning with “other”), where we define the share to be the average

share of absorption in 1992 and 2005. In the first column we report our estimate of the γ k ’s .

Based on this measure, we find the three sectors where the products are most heterogeneous and

firms are likely to have the most market power are Aircraft and Spacecraft, Televisions, Video

Cameras, and Receivers, and Private Motor Vehicles. In contrast, the most homogeneous sectors

where firms are likely to have the least market power are Crude Petroleum, Natural Gas, and

Cigarettes and Cigars. This pattern seems broadly sensible.
                                                 27

       We next compute the variety and pro-competitive effects for each sector, and aggregate

these across sectors as in (22). The key decision that must be made in measuring both these

effects is the set of countries i  I , which we interpret as having small changes in the set of

products and firms within each country (literally, in Proposition 1 we assume that the taste

parameter for countries i  I does not change at all). As mentioned earlier, in the CES case

Broda and Weinstein (2006) used the set of countries supplying to the U.S. at both the beginning

and end of the sample to compute the change in product variety between these dates. We can do

better here because we also have information on the Herfindahl indexes of exporters and U.S.

firms. We will suppose that if the Herfindahl index changes by more than some tolerance, that is

evidence that the set of firms has changed sufficiently to exclude that country from the set of

countries I . For convenience, we refer to this set as “common” countries, that are supplying in

the first and last periods and are judged to have little change in their exporting firms. In our

baseline results reported in Table 5, we choose 30 percent as the tolerance for the change in the

Herfindahl index for each sector and country, and then will indicate how our results change for

other tolerances.

       Table 5 reports our welfare results. Because we had to drop the change between 1997 and

1998, we computed the aggregate welfare change between 1992 and 2005 as the sum of the gains

from 1992-7, the gain from 1998-2005, and the geometric average annual gain over the two

periods. Using the full sample our baseline Herfindahl cutoff of 30 percent we find that the

aggregate welfare gain over the time period was 0.86 percent.

       The magnitude of this number is perhaps easiest to understand relative to Broda and

Weinstein’s (2006) estimates for the period 1990 to 2001. Those authors used a CES aggregator

and obtained a gain to consumers of 0.8 percent over the 1990-2001 period. This result is almost
                                                        28

exactly the same as what we obtain in the translog. However, they estimated the gain over a

different and shorter sample period (eleven years vs. 13). If we multiply our estimates by 11/13,

we find that implied aggregate gain due to varieties over the 11-year period in the translog case

is 0.73. These results suggest that the translog functional form yields similar, but slightly smaller,

variety gains as the CES.

        One major advantage of the translog setup is that it allows us to examine the sources of

these welfare gains. In particular, the translog specification indicates that markup declines, Pt,

account for about half of the welfare gains – of the 0.86 percentage point welfare gain, 0.42

percent is due to markup declines. The fact that the gain due to new variety in the translog setup

is approximately one-half of the gain obtained by using a CES formula is theoretically well-

justified when there is only one new good,27 and we are finding that the result applies here even

with many new goods.

        We can go further towards understanding the difference between the CES and translog by

using equation (15) to decompose the total variety gains, Vt, into two components: the first term

in the formula, V1t, measures the impact of new varieties on welfare irrespective of crowding,

and the second term, V2t, provides the impact of crowding, i.e. the fact that consumers care less

about varieties as more become available. The results in Table 5 indicate that crowding of the

product space is an important offset of the variety gains: without it, the welfare gain due to

import varieties would have been as large as what we obtain for the total welfare gains, including

from reductions in markups. In other words, it is the crowding effect that makes the translog gain

from variety less than the CES gains. But the reduced gains from variety are fully compensated

by the extra gains due to reduced markups.


27
   Feenstra and Shiells (1994, Corollary 2) argue that with a single new good, and with the translog demand
elasticity equal to the CES elasticity, the translog gain would be one-half as much as the CES gain.
                                                         29

         We should check that the pro-competitive effect does not depend on our measurement of

the total number of each goods in each sector, Nt in (21). So far we have used the inverse of the

overall Herfindahl index in each sector to infer Nt. An alternative approach is to treat Nt as

infinity so that Nt/(Nt – 1) = 1. We refer to this second case by Winf and Pinf in the final columns

of Table 5, and find that it reduces the pro-competitive effect Pt only slightly.

         We can think of four other possible issues with the reliability of our estimates.28 First, we

should compute standard errors because of imprecision in the estimation of k. Second, our

results might be sensitive to our choice of Herfindahl cutoff. Third, our estimates might be

heavily influenced by outliers of particular sectors. Finally, since the automobile sector is the

largest sector and had some idiosyncratic factors, discussed below, we decided to also rerun our

estimates without this sector. We deal with each of these concerns in turn.

         In order to deal with the imprecision of our k estimates, we bootstrapped each of the

over one thousand k’s and k’s and then used these bootstrapped parameter values to compute

the distribution of Ptk , Vtk , and total welfare  ln WtPV . This is computationally intensive, but

ultimately we were able to compute 100 estimates of each k and generate 5-95 percentile

confidence bands.29 The narrowness of these bands, reported in Table 5, indicates that our point

estimates for the markup and variety effects are estimated with reasonable precision.

         Second, we experimented with other cutoffs for the change in the Herfindahl indexes.

The choice of what threshold to use in the definition of the “common” countries i  I involves a

tradeoff between two opposing forces. Classifying even the small movements in the Herfindahl


28
   A fifth issue, discussed in Appendix C, is whether the number of years in our sample (thirteen) is enough to avoid
the small-sample bias in our estimator noted by Soderbery (2010) in the CES case. That issue is taken up in
Appendix C, where we find that thirteen years is (just) enough to avoid significant bias.
29
   It took 10 days on an 8-processor SPARCstation.

index as evidence of firm entry and exit will reduce the number of countries included in the

common set I , thereby eliminating some sectors, which makes our welfare calculations very

sensitive to Herfindahl and share movements in fewer remaining countries and sectors. On the

other hand choosing a very wide band of allowable Herfindahl movements means that our

estimates of welfare gains will be based on more countries and sectors, but we run the risk of

erroneously missing some of the variety gains. As noted in equation (16) of Proposition 1, even if

there is no change in the set of countries we can still use changing Herfindahls to infer gains or

losses from variety, but that assumes that there is no change in the average taste parameters for

countries. By leaving countries out of the common set I , we do not need that assumption and

are more accurately imputing welfare gains/losses due to the entry/exit of firms and products

from those countries. We therefore considered a number of cutoff values for the Herfindahl

indexes: movements of plus or minus 20, 30 (as already reported) and 40 percent.

         We obtain very similar welfare gains if we use a 40 percent cutoff, but the welfare gain

is much smaller with the 20 percent cutoff, because that estimate is excluding many more

countries from the common set.30 As a final robustness check for understanding the role played

by the Herfindahl cutoff, we decided to examine the impact of completely shutting down this

channel. In order to do this calculation, we set all the Herfindahl ratios equal to their 1992 values

and only consider the welfare impacts coming from the entry and exit of countries selling to the

U.S. The results from this calculation are presented in the “Constant HI” row of Table 5. Overall

   To get some intuition for whether these cutoff values are sensible, we can consider how much of the data we
move from the common set of countries I to the excluded countries i  I . We will split our estimation into two
sub-periods (1992-1997 and 1998-2005) because of the change in industry definitions. If we follow the prior CES
literature and assume that variety change is only measured when country import flows start or end, we find that on
average 95 percent of the value of varieties – defined as a country/HS-10 digit good pair – available in the starting
year are available in the last year in each period. If we reclassify countries in which the Herfindahl moved by more
than 40 percent as no longer common, we find that on average only 77 percent of varieties available in the first
time period were available in the second period. Similarly, the share of commonly available varieties falls to 71
percent, 52 percent, and 30 percent as we move to 30 percent, 20 percent, and 10 percent cutoffs, respectively.

we obtain a welfare gain of 0.79 percent of GDP, which is quite similar to our baseline results,

but focusing on this number misses some important differences. In particular, by assuming that

there is no U.S. exit in response to new imported varieties, we obtain a very large pure variety

effect as measured by V1t, but the absence of exit also implies an offsetting crowding of the

product space as measured by V2t. Thus, on net, there is almost no variety gain, and virtually all

of the welfare gain comes from decline in market power arising from the drop in the demand

elasticities.

        A third concern arises from the possible role played by outliers. In order to ensure that

our results were robust to outliers, we dropped the sectors in the top 5th percentile of welfare

gains and those in the lowest 5th percentile. In order to prevent the welfare gains from falling

simply because we were summing across fewer sectors, we reweighted each sector’s share in

(22) so that the shares continued to sum to one. Overall, dropping the top and bottom 5th

percentiles slightly lowered our aggregate welfare gain: taking the change in welfare from 0.86

percent of GDP to 0.64 percent. This indicates that outliers are not driving our results.

        A fourth concern relates to the importance of the automobile sector. Automobiles is the

largest sector in manufacturing, and although the point estimate for k in this sector was not an

outlier, the sector does exert a particularly large impact on the overall welfare gains. Between

1992 and 2005, there was enormous entry into this sector as Japanese car makers set up new

plants (see Blonigen and Soderbery, 2010). This entry had two important impacts. First, the U.S.

Herfindahl index declined sharply from 0.35 to 0.21, reflecting the large increase in the number

of makers operating in the U.S. Second, the transplant of Japanese car makers to the U.S. was

associated with a very large increase in U.S. automobile production: real output of autos made in

the U.S. grew by 41 percent between 1992 and 1998, which contributed to a substantial increase
                                                  32

in the share of U.S. consumption made domestically. That increase in the share and falling

Herfindahl contribute to a large welfare gain from variety, Vtk , from (15).

       There are reasons to believe, however, that our welfare formula cannot accurately deal

with the transplant of Japanese varieties to the United States: we have ignored multi-product

firms, for example, and in the same way have assumed that the k estimate for autos applies

equally well to products across firms as to products within firms. That assumption clearly

contradicts the theoretical literature on multi-product firms, which makes a strong distinction

between consumer substitution of products within and between firms (see Allanson and

Montagna, 2005, and Bernard, et al, 2011). For this reason we also computed the welfare gains

after dropping the passenger vehicle sector. This gives the result shown in the “Excluding Auto

Sector” row of Table 5, where we assume that the gains from variety in the automobile sector

were same as in all other sectors. The welfare estimate of 0.49 is somewhat smaller than our

baseline estimate, but not significantly different.

       Finally, in the last two rows of the table, we can see the welfare gains in each of our sub-

periods. Most of total welfare gain Wt appears to have accrued in the first sub-period, between

1992 and 1997. The reason for this finding is that in the second sub-period, from 1998 to 2005,

there is substantial crowding in product space: the component V2t subtracts a full 0.71 percent

from any welfare gains, thereby canceling out the contributions of V1t and the pro-competitive

effect Pt in that period. Thus, while the markup gains were quite similar in both periods, the

gains from variety collapse in the later period because of crowding in product space. This finding

suggests that the gains from varieties may be declining as globalization progresses.

8. Conclusions

       Using general additively separable preferences, Krugman (1979) demonstrated the

reduction in markups that accompanies trade liberalization under monopolistic competition. That

reduction in markups is not just a consumer gain, but is also a social gain: the reduction in

markups in a zero-profit equilibrium indicates that the wedge between a firm’s marginal and

average cost is reduced, so that output is expanding and there are greater economies of scale. So

the competition between firms from different countries is an important channel by which

international trade leads to social gains.

       Despite this insight, such a channel has received only limited attention in the empirical

trade literature. We have argued that the reason for this gap in the literature is the common

assumption of CES preferences, which leads to constant markups. So instead we must look to

alternative preferences, and here we have adopted translog preferences. We have derived quite

general formulas for the variety gains from new products with these preferences, and also the

pro-competitive effect of new entry on reducing markups.

       The estimated declines in market share of incumbent firms in the wake of the tremendous

amount of entry of foreign countries into U.S. markets, as well as more exporters within those

countries, drives our measure of the welfare gains. This entry has been offset to some degree by

crowding of the product space as measured by declining Herfindahl indexes. Nevertheless, we

find that the exit from the U.S. market has been less than the new entry, in the sense that the

demand for the typical incumbent firm’s output fell, so that the per-firm share of surviving U.S.

firms fell in many sectors. That feature of the data drives our estimates of the fall in markups,

which is the pro-competitive effect of globalization. In our benchmark results, we find that the
                                                 34

variety gain from globalization for the U.S. in the translog case is one-half of that found by

Broda and Weinstein (2006) in the CES case, but that the total welfare gain is the same size.

       As noted in the Introduction, we have not attempted to measure an important source of

welfare gain that can operate in our model: the efficiency gains that come from the self-selection

of more efficient firms into exporting. That source of gains is the focus of ACDR (2012), but by

construction in their model, the variety and pro-competitive effects do not operate when the

distribution of firm productivity is Pareto with unbounded support: in that case, variety in each

country and the distribution of markups are not affected by reductions in trade costs. If instead

the distribution is Pareto with a bounded support, so that productivity does not exceed some

maximum value, then the product variety and pro-competitive effects operate once again, along

with the self-section of more efficient firms into exporting (Feenstra, 2014). We have not

attempted to measure this latter effect, and that is an important area for further research.

Appendix A: Data

       The dataset used for this project contains quantity, value, and price information

aggregated at the HS-10 digit level, as well as HS-4 digit level Herfindahl Indexes, for the U.S.

and all countries exporting to the U.S. for every year from 1992 to 2005.

       One challenge in piecing together this dataset was calculating the amount of U.S.

absorption produced in the U.S. We begin with the identity that the U.S. supply of U.S.

absorption is equal to the difference between U.S. production and exports. We obtained data on

industry-level production from the Bureau of Economic Analysis at www.bea.gov and export

data from http://www.internationaldata.org/. Unfortunately, the BEA production data are

classified according to the SIC system for years 1992 to 1997 and according to the NAICS

system for years 1998 to 2005, while the trade data is at the HS-10 digit level. Addressing this

complication required a two-step process: the first step was to adjust the BEA production data so

that the data are on the NAICS level for all years within the sample. The second step was to use

our import/export data (containing both NAICS and HS-10 digit codes) and our newly created

NAICS level production data to infer domestically produced absorption at the HS-10 digit level,

as described below.

       It is not easy to concord SIC and NAICS categories because there is not always a one-to-

one mapping between the two. To deal with this issue, we first used a NAICS-SIC concordance

from the BEA to convert the SIC data to the NAICS level. The absence of a one-to-one mapping

meant that sometimes we would observe large jumps in a NAICS category derived from SIC

data from 1997 relative to 1998. In order to deal with this problem, we used a “bridging

dataset”, from the U.S. Department of Commerce, containing SIC level values for both 1997 and

1998. This enabled us to construct a ratio between the actual NAICS output levels and the
                                                     36

NAICS levels that we constructed from the SIC data for 1998. We then multiplied all of NAICS

data that was constructed from the SIC data by this ratio. If a SIC sector did not match any

NAICS sector we dropped the observations prior to 1998 in the estimation. We also dropped all

changes between 1997 and 1998 in the regressions where we estimated , so that concordance

problems would not affect our estimates.

       After our BEA data was brought to the NAICS level, we use it, along with our import and

export data, to calculate HS-10 digit level U.S. domestic supply. We begin with the identity that

U.S. supply for the domestic market at the NAICS level – denoted by k – equals U.S. production

at the NAICS level less U.S. exports: Supply kt  Pr oduction kt  Exports kt . Using the NAICS

import data, we can compute the share of U.S. supply in apparent consumption according to the

following formula: Share kt  Supply kt / (Supply kt  Imports kt ). By assuming that the U.S. share of

a NAICS code is equal to that of the U.S. share in a corresponding HS-10 code, we calculate

supply at the HS-10 digit level using the following formula:

                                                                     Supply HS10
                Share kt  Share HS10
                                 t    and Share HS10
                                                t                          t
                                                             Supply HS10
                                                                    t     Imports HS10
                                                                                   t

                                                                 Imports HS10 .

       We next needed to merge in data for Herfindahl indexes for domestic firms and exporters

to the U.S. For land shipments from Canada, we purchased Herfindahl indexes at the 4-digit

Harmonized system (HS) level, for 1996 and 2005, from Statistics Canada. These Canadian

Herfindahl indexes were constructed from firm-level export data to the U.S.

       For land shipments from Mexico, the Herfindahl indexes were constructed using data

sourced from the Encuesta Industrial Anual (Annual Industrial Survey) of the Instituto Nacional
                                                                     37

de Estadistica y Geografia. This data contains firm-level exports for 205 CMAP94 categories for

1993 and 2003. We also obtained the export Herfindahl for 232 categories at the HS-4 level.

These categories cover the most important Mexican export sectors.

           For all other major exporters to the U.S., we computed these Herfindahls for sea

shipments from PIERS (www.piers.com), for 1992 and 2005. PIERS collects data from the bill

of lading for every container that enters a U.S. port. The median country exports about 80

percent of its goods by sea. Thus for the typical country in our sample, the sea data covers a large

fraction of their exports. Although purchasing the disaggregated data is prohibitively expensive,

we were able to obtain information on shipments to the U.S. for the 50,000 largest exporters to

the U.S., for 1992 and 2005. For each exporter and year, we obtained the estimated value,

quantity and country of origin of the top five HS-4 digit sectors in which the firm was active. We

also obtained this data for the top ten HS-4 digit sectors for the largest 250 firms in each year.

           Let i  I t denote the countries exporting to the U.S. each period and j  J it denote their

firms.31 The total import share from country i in sector k is sitk   jJ sijt
                                                                            k
                                                                                , and we let
                                                                                                 it


sikjt  sijt
         k
             / sitk denote firms’ shares within the exports of country i. Then with the Herfindahl index

H itk   jJ (sikjt )2 , the sum of squared firm shares from country i is:
                it



                                         (sijtk )2   (sikjt )2 (sitk )2  H itk (sitk )2 .         (A1)
                                        jJ it          jJ it


Thus, the sum of squared shares can be measured by using the Herfindahl indexes and overall

shares (squared) from those countries. If we further summed over all countries i, we would

obtain what we will call the overall Herfindahl index (in each sector):

                                         (sijtk )2    (sikjt )2 (sitk )2   H itk (sitk )2 .    (A2)
                                       iI t jJ it              iI t jJ it            iI t




31
     These sets depend on the sector k, but we omit that notation for simplicity.
                                                                  38

        The PIERS data has a number of limitations relative to other firm level data sets. The first

is relatively minor: we do not have the universe of exporters but only the largest ones. This turns

out not to be a serious problem because the aggregate value of these exporters is typically within

5 percent of total sea shipments. Thus, smaller exporters are unlikely to have a qualitatively

important impact on our results. A second potential problem is that PIERS sometimes lists

trading companies as exporters. Sometimes these trading companies may actually be exporters,

however this does not appear to be a big problem in our data since companies that have the

words “trading,” “exports,” “Imports” or variants of these words in their name (such as

“exporting”) only accounted for 5 percent of exports in 1992 and 7.5 percent of exports in 2005.

Thus, we think that the vast majority of exporters in our sample are actual exporters.32

        A larger problem is that the PIERS data only comprises sea shipments and thus we have

no information in these data on land and air shipments. This means that we have to adjust our

Herfindahl indexes to take into account land and air shipments. The Herfindahl of country i’s

exports in sector k can be written as

                                                              2                               2

                       
where VitkSea VitkTotal denotes the value of sea (total) shipments and HitkNon Sea is the Herfindahl

for non-sea exporters, which is defined analogously as the sea Herfindahl. We do not have a

measure of HitkNon Sea , but theory does place bounds on the size of the Herfindahl since the true

index must be contained in the following set, obtained with HitkNon Sea = 1 or 0:

32
  It’s not clear whether we should delete these companies or not because many of them , such as “Kerala Cashew
Exports” may serve as the exporters of firms that do not export independently.
                                                                   39

For most sectors the share of sea shipments in total shipments is quite high, so these bounds are

quite tight. In the analysis we assume that H itkSea  H itkNon Sea , but our results do not change

qualitatively if we assume that HitkNon Sea = 0.33
        For the U.S. Herfindahls, we rely on data from the Census of Manufactures at the NAICS

6-digit level. Unfortunately, this is more aggregate than the 4-digit HS level at which we have

the foreign export Herfindahl indexes. Accordingly, we need to convert the U.S. Herfindahl

indexes from the NAICS 6-digit level to the HS 4-digit level. Abusing our above country

notation, let i  I k denote a 4-digit sector i within the NAICS code k. Then the Herfindahl for 4-

digit sector i is H itk   jJ (sijt )2 , where sijt is the share of firm j  J i in sector i. We see that the
                                   i


overall Herfindahl in NAICS code k is:


                            H itk sitk 
                                             2
                                                      (sijt )2 (sitk )2   (skjt )2  H kt ,           (A4)
                           iI k                     iI k jJ i                 jJ k


where sitk is the share of 4-digit HS sector i within NAICS sector k, and s kjt  sijt sitk is the share of

product j within the NAICS sector, j  J k . In words, the inner-product of the Herfindahl firm

indexes and the squared sector shares, on the left of (A4) is exactly the right way to aggregate

these indexes to obtain an overall Herfindahl for the good k in question, on the right of (A4).

One of the problems that we faced is that we know H kt but not H itk . A solution can be obtained

by assuming that H itk is equal across all 4-digit sectors i  k , in which case we solve for H itk as:

                                                      H itk  H kt /    (sitk )2 .                          (A5)
                                                                       iI k



33
   One can see this from a simple example. Our median sea Herfindahl is 0.6 and our median share of sea shipments
is 0.8. This means that the true Herfindahl ranges from .38 to .42 and our estimate would be 0.41. Nevertheless, we
are implicitly assuming that goods shipped by air and goods shipped by sea are not the same. We justify this
assumption because it costs substantially more to ship goods by air, and thus the mode of shipment is likely to
differentiate the goods in some important ways.
                                                               40

In other words, the 4-digit HS Herfindahl is estimated by dividing the 6-digit NAICS Herfindahl

by the corresponding Herfindahl index of 4-digit HS shares within the 6-digit sector. This simple

solution assumes that the 4-digit HS Herfindahl indexes are constant within a sector, but is the

best that we can do in the absence of additional data.

Proof of (16):

          The only expression in Propositions 1 or 2 that is not already derived in the text is (16).

To obtain this result, substitute the shares from (9) into the definition of Vt in (15). Note that any

difference (x t y t ) can be expressed as (x t y t )  12 (x t 1  x t )y t  12 (y t 1  y t )x t . Using (9)

and this result, we can simplify Vt when i  I  I t 1  I t as:

Thus, for I  I t 1  I t we are left with only the last term, as shown in (16).


Appendix C: Monte Carlo Simulation

         One concern with our methodology stems from the fact that we rely on asymptotic

properties that arise as the number of observations approaches infinity, but we are working with

a sample of only thirteen years. In this Appendix, we use a Monte Carlo simulation to determine

whether this is a problem. Our approach is quite similar to that used in Soderbery (2010).

         We begin by reproducing the estimating equation (24), but without averaging over time:

                                              1           1                     1
         Yit            X1it           X2it    X3it          Z1it (  )           Z2it (  )  uit . (C1)
                 (1  )        (1  )                (1  )              (1  )

If we average equation (C1) over time we obtain the estimating equation used in the paper:

                                              1           1                    1
         Yi             X1i           X 2i    X3i          Z1i (  )            Z2i (  )  u i . (C2)
                 (1  )       (1  )                 (1  )              (1  )

         Our next task was to generate a synthetic dataset to use in our simulations that matched

the moments in actual data. We decided that in this synthetic data, we would work with a sector

whose estimated γ equals the median estimated γ. Since HS sector 2902 (Styrene) had the median

γ, we decided to base our exercise using the data and parameter from this sector and then see
                                                  42

how sensitive they were to estimation problems. We therefore conducted our simulation using a

 equal to 1.52, which is the same as the estimated  in this sector. We also took the values of

Hit, sit, Hkt, skt and Nt terms from the actual data for this sector. We then set the error term equal

to zero in equation (C1) and solved for Δlnpit – Δlnpkt so that equation (C1) fit exactly.

        Once we had generated data that fit the model exactly, we needed to also generate a

series of errors to test how efficient our estimation procedure was. In order to do this we first had

to match the variance of the error terms that we actually observed. To obtain the variance

estimates, we generated the residuals of equation (C1) after imposing our chosen parameter

values and using the actual, rather than synthetic data. The sample variance of the residuals for

each country-HS-10 sector provided the variance estimate for each country-HS-10 sector.

        We then added an error term (uit) to each simulated country-HS-10 sector observation

whose variance was drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean and a variance equal to the

one we obtained for that country-HS-10 sector. In principle, this would let us also solve for the

underlying demand and supply shocks, but it turns out that we only need to know their product in

order to do the simulation.

        With the simulated data constructed, the observations were then averaged across time

within country-HS-10 sectors in order to transform observations for equation (C2). We then

estimated the parameters of the model using the same technique as in the paper. This provided

the first estimate (and iteration of the Monte Carlo). For each subsequent iteration, we discarded

the previous error terms (uit) and drew new error terms from the normal distribution to add to

each observation. We then estimated the parameters of the model again. This process was

repeated for each sample of a given time period for a total of 200 iterations.
                                                  43

        The simulation results for samples that were less than thirteen years were based on using

the actual Hit, sit, Hkt, skt and Nt values for each sector from the corresponding years in the data. .

For each additional year above thirteen, we independently re-sampled one set of values of Hit, sit,

Hkt, skt and Nt from the actual data. This re-sampled data was then appended to the actual data

from 1992-2005, an error term was added, and the estimation proceeded as outlined above.


Simulation results

        The simulation results for the structural parameter γ are presented in Figure C1. The

median estimated gamma is shown, along with the 10th and 90th percentile gammas. The results

show a rapid convergence to the correct value of gamma beginning after approximately 12 years

and almost complete convergence within 24 years. These results are similar to the results in

Soderbery (2010).

        The simulation can also be used to predict the percent of gammas estimated to be

negative by the unconstrained WLS. The estimation used data for 14 years, from 1992-2005.

However, because the change from 1997 to 1998 was dropped, the actual estimation used the

equivalent of 13 years of data. In the simulation, 2.2% of the γ estimates were negative. By

contrast 14% of the estimates of γ in the paper were actually negative. The higher percentage of

estimated γ’s relative to simulated γ’s may reflect the fact that we simulated estimation assuming

the true γ equaled the median gamma. If we had simulated the data using a smaller γ (and indeed

half of all γ’s are less than the median), we would have obtained more negative gamma

estimates. Thus, the fact that our simulation produces few negative γ estimates when we

constrain γ to be the median, seems basically in line with what our estimation procedure

produces.

Notes:
The Herfindahl Index is the weighted average of the country's Herfindahl Index, where the weights
correspond to the share of each HS-4 sector in U.S. apparent consumption. “Share” sit is defined to be the
country's share of U.S. apparent consumption. The “Weighted Average Hitsit” is the weighted average of
the Herfindahl Index in sector i in year t multiplied by that country's share of U.S. apparent consumption;
the weights are the same as before. The last row reports a weighted average across all countries using
each country's share of U.S. apparent consumption as weights. Thus, the number shown in the last row
and column of each panel is i Hit(sit)2 , averaged across sectors.
