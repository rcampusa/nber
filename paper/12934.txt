                                             ABSTRACT

A modern statistical literature argues that countries such as Denmark are particularly happy while
nations like East Germany are not. Are such claims credible? The paper explores this by building
on two ideas. The first is that psychological well-being and high blood-pressure are thought by clinicians
to be inversely correlated. The second is that blood-pressure problems can be reported more objectively
than mental well-being. Using data on 16 countries, the paper finds that happier nations report lower
levels of hypertension. The paper's results are consistent with, and seem to offer a step towards the
validation of, cross-national estimates of well-being.

Because humans are extremely social animals, their sense of well-being is to a large extent determined
by their social interactions. In hierarchical societies, individuals at every level have to submit … and
the recognition of this submissiveness generates emotions such as shame, anger and depression. These
emotions lead to the activation of physiological alarm systems such as the hypothalamic pituitary
adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system. The chronic activation of these systems … results in
… hypertension, atherosclerosis, major depression and autoimmune diseases. Roy (2004)


1. Introduction

For effective social and economic policies to be designed, it is necessary for policy-

makers to be able to measure human well-being.                     Simple things -- real Gross

Domestic Product, lifespan, height, incidence of cancer -- can usefully be counted.

Quantifying psychological well-being in a broader sense, in an objective way, is a

more complicated task.

         This paper examines national levels of happiness1 and the validity of different

measures of psychological well-being. To do this, it explores the use of cross-

national survey data on hypertension (that is, on problems of high blood-pressure).

The paper estimates both well-being and blood-pressure equations. Using Pearson

and Spearman rank tests, it argues that the structure of the coefficients on country

dummy variables is similar in both kinds of regression equations. Happy countries

seem to have less hypertension. This has a number of implications. First, it suggests

that there may be a case to take seriously the subjective ‘happiness’ measurements

made across the world: they follow a pattern like the (inverse of) high-blood-pressure

estimates. Second, in constructing new kinds of economic and social policies in the

future, where well-being rather than real income is likely to be a prime concern, there

are grounds for economists to study people’s blood pressure. Third, the paper’s

findings are relevant to our understanding of what Chockalingam, Campbell and

Fodor (2006) and Lawes et al (2006) describe as a global epidemic of high blood-

pressure. The World Health Report 2002 identified hypertension -- one definition is

blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg -- as a major determinant of disability-adjusted

life years; WHO estimates that 1 billion people live with hypertension.

        Although the details of the causal processes are not fully understood, there is

some evidence that happiness and heart rate are negatively associated among men,

and that wellbeing is correlated with cortisol levels and cardiovascular behaviour

(Steptoe et al 2005). Yet internationally comparable measures of hypertension, where

the demographic and educational characteristics of randomly sampled people are

known, are in short supply, and social scientists have paid little attention to the idea

that blood pressure could play a role as a relevant variable.

        Measured psychological well-being levels seem to vary across the

industrialized nations. Countries like Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands tend to

score highly in standardized surveys, while nations such as Italy, Germany and

Portugal come out as markedly less happy. Perhaps naturally, such research has an

interdisciplinary feel and has attracted attention from many kinds of scholars2. Using

regression equations or simple tabulations, large samples, and pooled data, a number

of the small social-democratic countries of Europe are consistently found to be among

the happiest nations.

        While these multi-country studies’ findings seem intriguing, commentators

like Ostroot and Snyder (1985), Argyle (2001) and Kahneman and Riis (2005) point

out that it is hard to know what to make of the cross-national claims. First, language

differences raise the worry that words like ‘life satisfaction’ cannot be translated

sufficiently consistently to ensure that the variations in reported well-being are

meaningful.    Second, cultural differences -- in some countries it may be less

acceptable to admit to unhappiness -- further complicate inference. Third, when

visited, these European nations anecdotally appear similar in wealth, and in most

ways of living. None of these objections is definitive; but all of them mean there are

doubts over the substantive interpretation of estimated cross-national happiness

variation.

       Authors such as Easterlin (1974), Clark and Oswald (1994), Inglehart (1996),

Ng (1997), Oswald (1997), Diener (2000), Kahneman et al (2004), and Vemuri and

Constanza (2006) have made a case for taking well-being data seriously in the

evaluation of human welfare. This form of research may even presage some move

away from simple GDP targets of the sort that have been favoured in post-war

economic policy. However, to make progress on the construction of a national well-

being index, a better empirical justification for the use of subjective life-satisfaction

and happiness statistics is needed. The paper tries to pursue this aim and relies on one

central idea. It is that individuals know whether a doctor has informed them that they

suffer from blood pressure problems. Arguably, such knowledge is relatively free of

the cultural and language problems that presumably bedevil questionnaire evidence

on happiness. We implement a test around this. The paper assumes that people

provide survey answers to questions about high blood-pressure difficulties in a

relatively objective way. One advantage of information on reported blood-pressure

problems, relative to much other health self-reporting, is that respondents must rely

on what physicians have said to them. Moreover, it is known in the medical literature



                                           3
that self-reports of hypertension are correlated with objectively measured readings of

blood pressure and seem to have high validity (Giles et al 1995, Muhajarine et al

1997, Vargas et al 1997, Martin et al 2000, Liman-Cost et al 2004, Alonso et al 2005,

Yoon and Zhang 2006). The paper’s results are also potentially relevant to the so-

called socioeconomic gradient in health and well-being (see, for example, Marmot

2004). It is known that those of high social and occupational status suffer less actual

illness, die later, and report better subjective health than the poor and low-status.

Gravelle and Sutton (2006) provides a clear discussion of self-reported health

measures and how they are used.           Steptoe (2000) reviews evidence on the

socioeconomic gradient in hypertension.

2. Measuring well-being

        Subjective well-being patterns across nations might be scrutinized in various

ways.    Happiness correlates could be studied, for instance, in the search for

corroboration. Di Tella et al (2003) show, encouragingly for the quality of subjective

data, that in a sample of Western nations there is evidence that the rises and falls in

suicide rates move in the opposite direction to changes in happiness.         The null

hypothesis of no correlation, however, can be rejected only at the 10% level. Bray

and Gunnell (2006) demonstrate that suicide is negatively correlated with happiness,

and can reject the null of a zero correlation at the 5% level; but in a smaller sample

Lester (2002) does not find such clear-cut results. Other national correlates studied in

the literature include trust and political institutions (Hudson 2006, Helliwell 2003).

None of these articles, however, is an attempt to understand the quality of different

measures of mental well-being.

        As Ostir et al (2001) and Joynt et al (2003) demonstrate, rates of depression

and heart disease are linked. A review of related evidence is available in Rutledge



                                           4
and Hogan (2002). Steptoe and Wardle (2005), for example, offer evidence that

blood pressure is inversely related to reported happiness. Their data come from

middle-aged men and women, with positive ‘affect’ (a psychological term for a form

of happiness) assessed through repeated ratings over a working day. Greater

happiness is associated with lower salivary cortisol both on working and nonworking

days, reduced fibrinogen stress responses, and lower ambulatory heart rate in men.

These patterns, Steptoe and Wardle argue, are be independent of age, socioeconomic

status, smoking, body mass and psychological distress. In addition, happiness is found

to be inversely related to ambulatory systolic blood pressure on follow-up, again

independently of potential confounders including negative affect. The results

establish that affective states are linked to outcomes. Similarly, Lazaro et al (1993)

shows that borderline hypertension is associated with worse GHQ mental strain

scores.

          The work of Jonas and Lando (2000) uncovers a positive connection between

anxiety today and hypertension in the future. A population-based cohort of 3310

initially normotensive and chronic disease-free persons in the NHANES I

Epidemiologic Follow-up Study is tracked through four follow-up waves (maximum,

22 years). The association between hypertension and baseline negative affect is

analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for baseline age, sex,

race, education, smoking, alcohol use, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, body

mass index, and change in body mass index as a time-dependent covariate. Steptoe et

al (2005) paints a complementary picture. It demonstrates that levels of positive

affect in middle-aged men and women are associated with reduced neuroendocrine,

inflammatory, and cardiovascular activity. Well-being in the study is assessed by

aggregating momentary experience samples of happiness over a working day and is



                                          5
found to be inversely related to cortisol output over the day. Once again, happiness is

inversely related to heart rate measured using ambulatory monitoring methods.

Strasser (1998) documents evidence that East Europeans have much higher blood

pressure readings than citizens from Western Europe. This is interesting, from the

perspective of the well-being literature, because it has long been known that Eastern

Europe has particularly low happiness scores (Blanchflower, 2001). Banks et al

(2006) argues that Americans are less healthy than Europeans; differences in blood

pressure form part of the authors’ evidence. Wolf-Maier et al (2003) and Stamler et

al (1992) document blood pressure internationally and establish that education is

inversely related to hypertension.     Owen et al (2005) shows strong childhood

influences. Colhoun et al (1998) provides a valuable summary of similar evidence.

       Nevertheless, despite this epidemiological evidence on groups of medical

subjects, relatively little is known, especially by economists, about national

correlations between well-being and hypertension. The individual-level association

between well-being and blood pressure is also imperfectly understood. Johannesson,

Jonsson and Borgquist (1991) estimate a figure that individuals are willing to pay for

hypertensive therapy, although conclude that the Contingent Valuation method does

not work well.

3. Analysis

In this study the data set is Eurobarometer #56.1.       It collected identical survey

information in September and October 2001 from approximately 15,000 randomly

sampled individuals in Denmark, West Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, France,

Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, the United Kingdom, East Germany,

Finland, Sweden, Austria, and Belgium. Among other questions, one was: Would you

say that you have had problems of high blood pressure? Answers could be given in



                                          6
four different boxes: not at all; no more than usual; rather more than usual; much

more than usual. The presumption in the paper is that individuals who said yes had

obtained such information from doctors.

        We start with descriptive statistics. Using this 2001 European cross-section,

Table 1(a,b) gives raw numbers on life-satisfaction and blood-pressure answers,

where the well-being question in this case is the simple one: Would you say you are

very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied, or not at all satisfied with the life you

lead? Table 1(c) gives a cross-tabulation for the two variables, which takes the

expected pattern.

        Table 2 sets out regression equations in which the dependent variable is a

measure of reported high blood-pressure problems.               These use Ordinary Least

Squares and Ordered Logit methods. They are to be read vertically, and can be

thought of as hypertension regression equations. Here the sample size in column 1 is

15,517 individuals.     The OLS equations assign the numbers 1 to 4 to people’s

answers (where 4 is the most severe blood-pressure problems). The independent

variables in the first column of Table 2 are country dummies, age, age squared, and a

dummy variable for the gender of the respondent. ‘Male’ does not have an effect that

is statistically significantly different from zero. Age in Column 1 of Table 2 enters

with a well-determined linear positive effect; there is no evidence for a nonlinear

term. The estimated dummy-variable coefficients for nations range from a high of

0.2695 for Portugal and 0.2197 for East Germany to lows of -0.1825 for Sweden and

-0.1313 for the Netherlands.       Belgium is the omitted, base country. According to

these data, the measured levels of hypertension -- without controlling for personal

characteristics other than age and gender -- are therefore high among, from the

greatest levels downwards, the Portuguese, the East Germans, the West Germans, the



                                              7
Italians, and the Finns. Nations with low levels of hypertension are, from the lowest

upwards, Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, the UK, and Ireland. Hypertensive

nations might be expected to have shorter longevity. The latest Human Development

Report shows, consistently, that Sweden currently has the longest lifespan of the 16

nations at 77.9 years for males, while Portugal at 73.9 years has the shortest length of

life. There is, however, not an exact match.3

          Column 2 of Table 2 adds an Age Left Schooling variable as a simple measure

of the individual’s level of education. It enters strongly negatively with a coefficient

of -0.0035 and a t-statistic that allows the null of zero to be rejected at conventional

confidence levels. This, although in a slightly unusual setting, is the familiar idea of a

socio-economic gradient in health:             more highly-educated people report fewer

problems with hypertension. This is despite the fact that they presumably have more

information from, and access to, physicians. Hierarchy’s effects are one possible

explanation (Roy 2004, Marmot 2004).

          It is useful to ensure that the results are not being driven by the sub-sample of

people who report the two highest levels of hypertension problems. To check this, we

re-estimated column 2 of Table 2 as a simple probit equation, with a blood-pressure

problems dependent variable being a 0-1 dummy for None and Any. The country

dummy structure was approximately unaffected; it was correlated 0.97 with that from

column 2 of Table 2 itself.

          In its third column, Table 2 adds a further set of independent variables. These

are controls for the individual’s life experiences before the age of 18 (such as whether

they grew up in a single-parent home), the individual’s labour force status such as

which if any kind of job and occupation they have, and a set of dummy variables


3   We thank Danny Kahneman for suggesting that we examine longevity.


                                                 8
capturing different kinds of marital status. Adding these makes little difference to the

country-dummy coefficients.              Column 4 of Table 2 moves to an ordered logit

estimator.       Because the independent variable on blood pressure problems is not

cardinal, the OLogit column is in principle to be preferred. Again the structure of the

country dummies is not radically altered by going from Column 3 to Column 4 of

Table 2. Age squared, however, now enters with a coefficient of -0.0003 and a t-

statistic of 4.89, so aging appears with a concave structure. Nevertheless, as the

turning point in the quadratic is at greater than 100 years old, the substantive

consequence for the age effect in going from Column 3 to 4 is small. To explore the

robustness of the structure of this hypertension regression specification, Tables 3 and

4 set out the equations separately for the male and female sub-samples of, in the first

columns, 7,400 and 8,117 people respectively. Encouragingly, the general equation

structure looks similar for men and women. This is important for the paper’s aim,

namely, to isolate a unique and well-determined country pattern of well-being.

           The ordering of the country-dummy values is close to identical in each table.

One important difference is visible, however. For Europe’s males, in Table 3, the

variable Age Left Schooling enters with a negligible effect on blood pressure. In

Table 4, for European females, there is a well-determined negative correlation, with,

in Column 4, a coefficient of -0.0352 and t-statistic of 4.82. It is only for females

here that there is a clear socioeconomic gradient in reported blood pressure problems.

No income measures are available in the data set so cannot be included.

           It might be argued that the data should be partitioned4 into groups of

individuals with different education levels. To check this, the specification of column

3 of Table 2 was re-estimated. This was done, first, on the subsample of those in the


4   A referee suggested this approach.


                                                 9
data set (57%) who left schooling before the age of 18 and, second, on the subsample

of those (the remaining 43%) who left later than 18. Country dummies were then

extracted from these two regression equations. The sets of dummies exhibited a

correlation coefficient of 0.9, which suggests that partitioning does not affect the

principal conclusion.

       A range of well-being equations is presented in Table 5. The first three

columns are for life-satisfaction as a dependent variable; the fourth column uses a

happiness variable. Here the data sets differ. Column 1 is for the previous 2001 data

set, #56.1. Column 2 draws instead upon 185,711 randomly sample people from the

Eurobarometer Trends files; it pools the years 1994, 1995 and 1997-to-2002

inclusive. Finally, Columns 3 and 4 of Table 5 use data on approximately 47,000

individuals from the pooled European Social Surveys of 2002 and 2004. Although

not the focus of the paper, these well-being specifications generate the equation form

now familiar from modern research on industrialized countries. There is a U-shape in

age; males are less happy with their lives; education enters with a positive coefficient.

       Two points follow from Table 5. First, regardless of the data set used, the

estimated structure of the country dummy variables is similar.            Denmark, for

example, across the well-being regression equations is always the happiest country.

Greece, Italy, Portugal and East Germany are always low in the well-being country-

by-country rankings. Second, and of central importance to the paper’s thesis, this

structure is approximately the inverse of that found in the nations’ dummy-variable

coefficients in the earlier blood-pressure problems equations.

       Figure 1 illustrates the pattern. It plots a measure of hypertension problems

for each nation against a measure of the level of happiness by nation. The graph

displays the country dummies from the fourth column of Table 2 against the country



                                           10
dummies from the fourth column of Table 5. Looking, using the final columns of

Tables 2 and 5, at the top and bottom of the ordering: the lowest blood-pressure

countries are Sweden (#1), Denmark (#2) and the UK (#3) and these are ranked #3,

#1 and #8 in happiness; the three highest blood-pressure countries are West Germany

(#14), East Germany (#15) and Portugal (#16), and these are between #12 and #14 in

the happiness league table. The only anomaly appears to be Finland; for reasons that

are unclear, its position moves around across the different well-being rankings.

       Figure 2 depicts the result in an alternative way. Here the sixteen nations are

grouped -- by blood pressure -- into quartiles. The graph uses the coefficients from

the third column of Table 2, plotted against, on the y-axis, the matching data for the

nations’ percentages of those saying they are very satisfied with their lives (so there is

here no regression-equation correction). In the four countries with low levels of

blood-pressure problems, 48.5% of individuals say they are very satisfied with life.

Among the highest blood-pressure countries, namely, those in the top quartile of

hypertension, only 22.5% of citizens give this satisfaction rating.

       We also report Pearson correlation coefficients for blood-pressure dummies

correlated with the country dummies from equations with various dependent variables

for mental well-being. Arguably a more appropriate test relies only on the ordinality

of the league-table positions in international measures of blood-pressure difficulties

and psychological well-being.       A Spearman’s rank correlation test is therefore

computed. These provide tests of the null hypothesis of no correlation between the

country dummies in Table 5 and the country dummies in the right hand column of

Table 2.

dummies in the four columns of Table 5. The first three columns are life satisfaction

equations; the fourth is a happiness equation.

tailed test with cut-off α = 0.05 (n=16); the critical value of Spearman’s rank

correlation coefficient is 0.425. For a two-tailed test, with α = 0.025, it is 0.507.

[McClave, J.T., P.G. Benson and T. Sincich (2001), Table XV11, Appendix B, page

1005.]

         Whichever well-being measure is adopated in Table 5, there is evidence of an

inverse relationship between national subjective well-being and national blood-

pressure problems. For the data represented in Figure 1, Pearson’s R is -0.597 and

Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient is -0.553. Both are significantly different

from zero, given the 16 observations on European nations, at the 5% level. The

pattern is the same if OLS coefficients are used.

         Objective hypertension measures would be valuable. Kearney et al (2005) is

one of the few modern papers to try to document the levels of statistically

representative age-adjusted blood-pressure figures by nation. Its conclusions are

approximately consistent with our numbers. For example, for Kearney’s sample of

six nations, among randomly sampled European males the highest levels of

hypertension are found -- in the same order as in our sample -- within Germany


                                          12
followed by Italy and then Spain. It rates Sweden, England and Greece at lower

levels. However, the range of European nations in the Kearney sample is too small to

allow a full comparison, and the different national samples are collected in slightly

different ways and years.

          Could the paper’s main result be some form of spurious correlation? One

concern is the possibility that different degrees of information and health resources

are provided to people across nations5. In a country where there are relatively few

physicians, that nation’s citizens may have greater levels of undiagnosed

hypertension, which could lead to errors in the data provided earlier in the paper.

This difficulty is an important one. We attempt to address it in the following way.

          Assume that individuals are necessarily informed by their doctors that they

have hypertension. A natural check is then to examine how the international patterns

in reported levels of high blood-pressure correlate with the number of doctors per

head of the population. If we take, for example, the data from the third column of

Table 3’s equation for males, and average across the 3 highest blood-pressure nations

(East Germany, Portugal, Finland), the mean number of physicians per 100,000

people according to the latest Human Development Report data is 332. Across the 3

lowest blood-pressure nations here (Sweden, Netherlands, Denmark), it is almost

identical, at 333 physicians per 100,000. This counter-argument to the difficulty of

potentially different levels of medical advice across nations cannot be definitive. Yet

it suggests that the differences we observe in hypertension levels are not in any

simple sense because of cross-European differences in access to medical information.

          A further check was done. We explored the patterns in a different measure of

mental well-being, favoured by, for example, Goldberg et al (1997). It is a so-called

GHQ (General Health Questionnaire) psychiatric measure. In this case, in Table 6, the

dependent variable is a measure of psychological distress that comes from

amalgamating answers to the questions:

Have you recently:

       1. Lost much sleep over worry?

       2. Felt constantly under strain?

       3. Felt you could not overcome your difficulties?

       4. Been feeling unhappy and depressed?

       5. Been losing confidence in yourself?

       6. Been thinking of yourself as a worthless person?

To the answers to each of these six, we assigned the integers 0, 1, 2, 3 -- depending

whether each was answered not at all, no more than usual, rather more than usual,

much more than usual. The numerical answers were then summed. Overall, a mental

distress score, denoted GHQ-N6, must by definition lie between 0 and 18. Across

Europe, the mean of this psychological score is 3.6 (standard deviation 3.7). A more

complete GHQ measure is often computed from 12 questions (Goldberg et al 1997).

However, no other GHQ questions were available in the data set, but there is a

precedent -- as in Huppert and Whittington 2003 and Hu et al 2006 -- for use of these

‘negative’ six questions (hence the abbreviation N6). The cross-country pattern in

mental distress GHQ-N6 here is consistent with those found in happiness, life-

satisfaction and hypertension. This can be seen informally by inspection in Table 6;

but, more formally, for the specification in column 3 of Table 6, the country dummies

in GHQ-N6 when correlated with those in the blood-pressure equation in column 3 of

Table 2 produce a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.55, which is significant at the

5% level.



                                          14
         The focus of this paper has been upon country-level differences in well-being.

Nevertheless, it is possible to get some feel for the individual-level correlation

between hypertension and happiness. Table 7 estimates a life satisfaction equation

which includes a blood-pressure independent variable that takes the form of a single

dummy for any reported problems of hypertension or not. Although a cross-section

regression equation of this type cannot uncover the direction of causality6, the

hypertension measure enters significantly negatively in the life-satisfaction

specification, with a t-statistic of approximately 20 across the various columns. Table

8 performs one further check. It replicates the same individual-level result in a life-

satisfaction equation estimated with data from the 1999/2000 sweep of the British

National Child Development Study. This data set is a birth cohort of individuals born

between the 3rd and the 9th March 1958, who were all aged 42 at the time of

interview. Table 8 reveals that the indicator variable for high blood-pressure is again

negative in all specifications. It is possible in this data set to allow for obesity, which

is a known correlate with hypertension. The negative correlation remains once extra

controls are included for body mass index (BMI) and its square, as well as also self-

reported assessments of weight.

4. Conclusions

         This paper is an attempt to study the levels of hypertension and happiness

across nations. It draws upon data on 15,000 randomly sampled individuals from 16

countries (and on larger samples to provide measures of well-being). The paper

provides evidence to suggest that happier nations report fewer blood-pressure

problems. Figure 2 illustrates the principal conclusion.




6 In an equation with blood-pressure variable as the dependent variable, a negative association with
well-being is again found.


                                                  15
          A modern literature has claimed that countries like Denmark, Ireland and the

Netherlands are particularly happy while nations such as Germany, Italy and Portugal

are less happy. Yet it is arguably implausible that words such as ‘happiness’ or

‘satisfaction’ can be communicated unambiguously and in exactly the same way

across countries, so it is not easy to know whether such cross-national well-being

patterns are believable.

          The paper’s main finding is that the pattern of the country dummies in tables

like Table 2 is similar to the (inverse of the) pattern of the dummy variables for

countries in a table like Table 5. This seems to be true whichever the chosen well-

being proxy or data set. These results do not seem to be caused by different numbers

of physicians across countries. Nevertheless, the persuasiveness of the paper rests on

three assumptions:

   (i)       it is reasonable to treat survey evidence on high-blood-pressure problems

             as a proxy for objective hypertension (for example, Vargas et al 1997);

   (ii)      people report high blood-pressure in a more objective way than they report

             levels of happiness;

   (iii)     the patterns in Figures 1 and 2 are not merely the product of something

             special to this sample of nations.

          It might be conjectured that the paper’s conclusion is potentially illusory and a

product of the fact that an inherently cheery nation will be optimistic about

everything. However, it is not easy to believe that someone told by their doctor that

they have a condition of high blood-pressure will have an incentive to conceal or mis-

report that. For researchers, the attraction of a blood-pressure question in surveys is

that, because it relies on medical opinion given to the individual, it seems valuably

different in character from conventional subjective well-being questions.



                                             16
       Could the explanation for the pattern uncovered here be along the following

lines: there is an omitted variable in both sets of equations for the intangible thing

‘physical flourishing and good mental-well-being’? It may well be that this is an

appropriate way to think. However, that appears not so much a criticism of the paper

as much an interpretation of it. Psychological health cannot be measured easily but it

is high in Denmark and low in East Germany, and this, at some still poorly-

understood level, is what connects the observed data on happiness and hypertension.

More research remains needed on how such connections may operate.

Notes Each of the four regression equations is to be read vertically. The dependent variable here is a measure of
reported problems of high blood-pressure. ‘Personal controls’ are 10 dummy variables relating to the individual's
experiences before the age of 18; 16 labour-force status dummies; and 8 marital-status dummies. Belgium is the
excluded nation. The question that forms the dependent variable is here, and in some later tables, “Would you say
that you have not at all, no more than usual, rather more than usual, much more than usual...had problems of high
blood pressure?” where 1=not at all; 2=no more than usual; 3=rather more than usual; 4=much more than usual.
t-statistics are in parentheses.

Notes: The dependent variable is a psychological distress score measured on a scale from 0 to 18. A GHQ-N6 score
amalgamates answers to six questions: Have you recently: Lost much sleep over worry? Felt constantly under
strain? Felt you could not overcome your difficulties? Been feeling unhappy and depressed? Been losing confidence
in yourself? Been thinking of yourself as a worthless person? Its mean in the sample is 3.6 (s.d. 3.7).

‘Personal controls’ are 10 dummies relating to the individual's experiences before the age of 18; 16 labour force
status dummies; and 8 marital-status dummies. Belgium is the excluded country. t-statistics are in parentheses.

Notes: ‘Personal controls’ are 17 ethnicity dummies; 11 labour force status dummies; and 5 marital-status
dummies. t-statistics are in parentheses. The excluded category is 'about the right weight'. Individuals were
asked 'Would you say you were ... 'about the right weight' etc. The ‘Blood-pressure’ variable is a dummy
variable. Respondents were asked 'Have you ever had or been told you had high blood pressure?' Life
satisfaction is scored from 0-10. Respondents were told ‘here is a scale from 0-10 where ‘0’ means that you are
completely dissatisfied and ‘10’ means that you are completely satisfied. Please enter the number which
corresponds to how satisfied or dissatisfied you are about the way your life has turned out so far.’ t-statistics are
in parentheses.

Data Appendix

I. The Wording of the Questions in the International Data

1) Eurobarometer #56.1

a) Blood pressure
“Would you say that you have not at all, no more than usual, rather more than usual, much
more than usual...had problems of high blood pressure?”
Here 1=not at all; 2=no more than usual; 3=rather more than usual; 4=much more than usual.

[NB. It could be argued that someone with a high but unchanging level of hypertension might give the answer 2 rather than a
higher number. Nevertheless, as the great majority of the population give answer number 1, such a person would still be
identified, within the paper’s regression equations, as having blood-pressure problems.]


b) Life satisfaction
Would you say you are very satisfied; fairly satisfied; not very satisfied or not at all
satisfied…with the life you lead?”
Here 1=very satisfied; 2 =fairly satisfied; 3=not very satisfied and 4=not at all satisfied.
For the empirical analysis, for clarity we reverse the order and set 1=not at all satisfied; 2=not
very satisfied; 3=fairly satisfied and 4=very satisfied.

2) Eurotrends

a) Life satisfaction
“On the whole are you very satisfied; fairly satisfied; not very satisfied or not at all
satisfied…with the life you lead?”

Exceptions to this are in Eurobarometer #56.1 noted above which is included in the
Eurotrends file and in Eurobarometer #52.1 (Modern Biotechnology, Quality of Life and
Consumer’s access to Justice, November-December, 1999, ICPSR #2893) and that is also
included in the Eurotrends file, where the question is as follows:
“On the whole are you: very satisfied; fairly satisfied; not very satisfied or not at all
satisfied…with your life in general?”

Here, in all cases, 1=very satisfied; 2 =fairly satisfied; 3=not very satisfied and 4=not at all
satisfied. For the empirical analysis, for clarity we reverse this order and set 1=not at all
satisfied; 2=not very satisfied; 3=fairly satisfied and 4=very satisfied.

3) European Social Survey

a) Happiness
“Taking all things together, how happy would you say you are? Please use this card:
‘Extremely unhappy’ to ‘Extremely happy’ on a scale of 0-10.”

b) Life satisfaction
“All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole nowadays? Please
answer using this card, where 0 means extremely dissatisfied and 10 means extremely
satisfied”
