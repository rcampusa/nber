Internationalized Production in Developed
and Developing Countries and in Industry Sectors
Robert E. Lipsey
NBER Working Paper No. 6405
February 1998

                                            ABSTRACT

       Internationalized production, that is, production in a country controlled by firms based in

another country, grew from about 4½ percent of world output in 1970 to over 7 percent in 1995.

The importance of internationalized output fell substantially in developing countries until around 1990

but has been increasing since then, especially in the “transition” countries, where it has grown from

less than $100 million in 1977 to over $25 billion in 1994.

        The petroleum sector was the one with the highest share of internationalized production in

the 1970s, but that share has declined sharply, especially in the developing countries, where important

operations were nationalized. Manufacturing is now the sector in which internationalized production

plays the largest role, the internationalized share rising from under 12 percent to more than 16 percent

in 1990. That share was probably considerably larger in 1995, given the increase in the absolute value

of internationalized output by more than a third from 1993 to 1995.

       Outside of petroleum and manufacturing, internationalized production was of little

importance. For the world as a whole, the internationalized share was about 3½ percent in 1990.

However, if the trend in U.S.-owned production is an indication, the role of internationalized

production in this sector may be changing; the share in total production of U.S. foreign affiliates in

developing countries of a broad service sector including trade and finance rose from 6 percent in 1977

to 18 percent in 1995.
