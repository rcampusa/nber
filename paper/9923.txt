                                           ABSTRACT

       We use establishment-level data to study capital deepening -- increases in the capital-output
ratio -- in American manufacturing from 1850 to 1880. In nominal terms, the aggregate capital-
output ratio in our samples rose by 30 percent from 1850 to 1880. Growth in real terms was
considerably greater -- 70 percent -- because prices of capital goods declined relative to output
prices. Cross-sectional regressions suggest that capital deepening was especially importnat in the
larger firms and was positively associated with the diffusion of steam-powered machinery. However,
even after accounting for shifts over time in such factors, much of the capital deepening remains to
be explained.
       Although capital deepening implies a fall in the average product of capital it does not
necessarily imply that rates of return were declining. However, we find strong evidence that returns
did decline. We also show that returns were decreasing in firm size, although the data are not
sufficiently informative to tell us why it was so.

1. Introduction

       In the early nineteenth century most manufacturing in the United States was

undertaken in artisan shops. These typically employed the owner-operator and perhaps

one or more additional workers. Workers in the artisan shop were, on average, highly

skilled. Capital, however, was relatively modest, and non-specific – a building, general-

purpose hand tools, and credit extended to customers or tied up in goods sold on

consignment.

        Over the course of the century, the American manufacturing sector steadily

expanded its share of total output and its use of productive resources. This growth was

associated with a shift in production from artisan shops to factories. The typical factory

was larger in terms of employment and less skill intensive than the typical artisan shop.

Initially, many factories relied on hand power just like artisan shops, although some

relied on water. However, over time, the use of steam-powered machinery increased

substantially (Brown and Philips 1986; Atack, Bateman and Weiss 1990; Goldin and

Katz 1998).

       By century’s end, American manufacturing had begun yet a third transformation--

“continuous processing”--that embodied a vastly higher level of capital and energy use,

notably, electricity (Chandler 1977; Wright 1990). Although the artisan shop never

disappeared completely (and has not even to this day), its role in manufacturing at the end

of the nineteenth century was far smaller than it was at the beginning.

       American economic historians agree that the various changes in the internal

organization of firms, capital intensity, and energy use were associated with significant

gains in real output per worker. There is also broad agreement that the productivity gains




                                             2
from the continuous processing phase of industrialization can mostly be attributed to

increased capital intensity and energy usage. Further, a significant portion of the increase

in productivity during the initial shift away from the artisan shop up to the Civil War can

be attributed to the increasing division of labor rather than increased use of capital

(Chandler 1977; Sokoloff 1984a; Engerman and Sokoloff 2000). What is less clear,

however, is the role that capital played during the second half of the century as

manufacturing establishments became larger in size and much more reliant on powered

machinery.

       In this paper we use establishment level data from the original schedules of the

1850-1880 censuses of manufacturing to study “capital deepening” in mid-nineteenth

century manufacturing. By capital deepening we mean changes over time, as well as

differences across establishments, in the ratio of capital to output. We focus on the 1850-

80 period in part because it encompasses much of the growth of manufacturing prior to

continuous processing; that is, the period when the factory increased its share of total

value added in manufacturing and steam power displaced hand and waterpower.              In

nominal terms – that is, not adjusting for changes over time in prices of capital goods and

of output – the aggregate capital-output ratio was about thirty percent higher in 1880 than

in 1850. Most of this increase occurred in the 1870s. In real terms, however, the

increase was even greater because the price of capital goods relative to output appears to

have declined over the period. Adjusting for this decline in relative price, real capital per

(constant dollar) of output was between seventy and one hundred percent higher on

average in 1880 than in 1850. It is also the only period in our history for which these

data are available nationwide.




                                              3
       Unlike data from the published census, which are aggregated, the data in this

paper shed light on the correlates of the capital-output ratio at the establishment level,

such as the size of the establishment and its use of steam power. Drawing on the work of

Goldin and Katz (1998) we present a simple model relating the capital-output ratio to

establishment characteristics, such as size and use of steam power.

       In 1850 the capital-output ratio followed a modest U-shaped pattern with respect

to establishment size, once other characteristics were controlled for. However, by 1880,

the relationship between the capital-output ratio and size had turned positive, and the

larger establishments had higher capital-output ratios, controlling for other factors. The

implication of this “twist” in the gradient is that capital deepening occurred primarily in

the larger establishments.

       Some, but not all, of the twisting may be explained by the diffusion of steam

power. Establishments that used steam power had higher capital-output ratios, and steam

power use was positively correlated with size, but rising establishment size per se appears

to matter. However, even after taking account of the diffusion of steam and rising

establishment size, much of the capital deepening remains to be explained.

       Our estimates of capital-output ratios imply that capital productivity –ouput per

unit of capital -- was declining between 1850 and 1880. This does not necessarily mean

that the return to capital – its marginal product – was falling over time, because the share

of income going to capital might have been rising. Despite this possibility, our estimates

suggest that, in both nominal and real terms, the rate of return to capital invested in

manufacturing was significantly lower in 1880 than in 1850. Cross-sectional regressions




                                              4
reveal that returns were decreasing in establishment size, although the data are not

sufficiently informative to tell us why it this was so.



2. Data and Estimation: Aggregate Results



        Our empirical analysis is based on random samples drawn from the surviving

manuscripts of the 1850-1880 federal censuses of manufactures (Atack and Bateman

1999). These samples are nationally representative of the surviving manuscripts for each

census year.

        The censuses reported the value of capital “invested” in the establishment, along

with information about each plant’s outputs and inputs. The specifics of what was

reported, however, varied somewhat from census to census. Although all of the censuses

reported the value of outputs and raw materials, only the pre-1880 censuses reported

physical quantities of outputs and inputs. In 1850 and 1860 the number of male and

female employees was reported; in 1870 and 1880, the number of adult males, adult

females, and children were given. Information was also reported on the use of inanimate

sources of power, such as water or steam (1850-70); and, in 1880, on horsepower, where

water or steam was used.1

        There is no question that the inquiries about manufacturing capital were among

the most vexing and problematic of all such inquiries in the nineteenth century censuses

both at the time and since. The questions themselves were vague and it is unclear if

census enumerators were given much guidance in eliciting proper responses.


1
 Occasionally, information was reported on horsepower in steam or water powered establishments prior to
1880 but this information is too scattered to be of much use.


                                                   5
Consequently, it is not surprising that there is some disagreement as to what exactly

“value” was supposed to mean and what types of “capital” were to be reported.

        As for what was meant by “value”, there are several possibilities: “book value”,

net reproduction cost, or market value. The manuscripts schedules themselves offer

essentially no clues as to which of these definitions applied in any specific case. The

leading authority on the subject, Robert Gallman (1986, p. 174; 1987, pp. 220-222), has

argued, however, that book value was uncommon in the nineteenth century and that the

capital figures refer typically to market value or net reproduction cost.

       Although the samples analyzed in this paper are nationally representative of the

surviving manuscript schedules, this does not necessarily mean they are nationally

representative of manufacturing establishments that were (at risk) of enumeration by the

census. We can do nothing about establishments that were missed completely by a

careless enumerators. Likewise, some schedules did not survive to be sampled by us.

However, with one exception, we may assume that such failures were random and, hence,

do not bias our results.

       The one exception occurs in 1880. In that year, certain industries were designated

to be enumerated by so-called “special agents” who were, allegedly, more knowledgeable

about the industry than the average census enumerator. For example, James Swank,

Secretary of the American Iron and Steel Association, was appointed to collect the data

on steel producers. However, despite an assiduous search of relevant archives, no

schedules enumerated by special agents have ever been found (Delle Donne 1973).

       But, as it happens, many establishments in these industries were, in fact,

enumerated by regular census agents in the course of their daily tasks and, therefore, were




                                              6
at risk of inclusion in our samples, although there is no question that special agent

establishments are under-represented in the 1880 sample. We have dealt with this

problem as follows: All statistics for 1880 in this paper have been re-weighted to take

account of the under-representation. The precise details of the re-weighting vary

depending on the variable being considered but, in general, the assumption is that, when

re-weighted, the proportion of special agent establishments in 1880 equals the average

share observed in the 1850-70 samples.2

         We impose a number of selection criteria on the data before estimation. In

particular, we require that establishments had (1) positive employment, defined to be the

sum of male, female, and (in 1870 and 1880) child workers (2) positive reported value of

capital (3) positive value added (value of outputs – value of raw materials) (4) positive

value of raw materials. We also excluded observations were extremely low or extremely

high rates of return to capital, as estimated by an accounting procedure described in the

appendix (see also section 4) Panel A of Table 1 shows the sample sizes for each census

year used in our estimations.

         We present two series of aggregate capital/output ratios in index number form

(1850 = 100) in Panel A of Table 1. “Aggregate” means that the ratios are weighted

averages of estimates made at the establishment level, with the weight for each equal to



2
  This re-weighting scheme assumes that special agent establishments that were included in the regular
schedules were a random sample of the underlying population of such establishments. It is possible,
however, that the extent of under-enumeration was relatively greater for the largest special establishments
which, on the basis of our regression results (sections 4 and 5), suggests that our estimates of capital
deepening between 1850 and 1880 (Table 1), and of the downward trend in the mean returns to capital
(Table 4) may be biased downwards. In this regard, it is important to note that omitting the special agent
establishments does not alter our substantive finding with regard to the long-term trend. For instance, if we
exclude special agent industries, our estimates of aggregate capital deepening between 1850 and 1880 (see
the notes to Table 1) are virtually unchanged, as is our estimate of absolute decline in the mean rate of
return to capital (see Table 4).


                                                     7
the establishment’s share of total value added.3 These ratios are labeled “nominal”

because they are not (as yet) adjusted for changes over time in the price of capital goods

relative to the price of output. Index A follows Sokoloff (1986) by assuming that the

census data refer to both fixed and working capital. Index B assumes that the census only

reported the value of fixed capital and, therefore, it is necessary to estimate the value of

working capital and add the estimated values to the census figures.4 The estimation

procedure assumes that working capital was used in fixed proportion to the gross value of

output. The ratios of working capital to gross output are estimated from the 1890 census

(which did collect data on working capital). Separate ratios were estimated at

approximately the three or four-digit standard industrial classification (SIC) level in each

state. These are applied to the establishments in the samples, using the appropriate ratio

given the industry and location of the establishment.5 Index B should be viewed with

  Also shown in Table 1 are index numbers for 1880 associated with the geometric means of the
establishment level capital-output ratios, weighting each establishment by value added.

  Like today, manufacturing capital in the nineteenth century was of two fundamental types – “fixed”
reproducible capital-- equipment and structures--and “working capital” (for instance, inventories, financial
assets). Until recently, the consensus view has been that working capital was under-reported, or even
omitted entirely, in the 1850-1880 manufacturing censuses. The 1890 census specifically requested
information on working capital, and it is this information that we use to adjust the pre-1890 data; see the
text. The argument that working capital was under-reported prior to 1890 was based on the belief that the
growth in the capital stock in manufacturing between 1880 and 1890 was too large to be explained except
by under-reporting of working capital in 1880. Sokoloff (1986, p. 713), however, argues that capital
reported in 1850 and 1860 did include “at least a major component” of working capital. As Sokoloff (1986)
points out, working capital was reported in the so-called 1832 McLane Report, a document prepared by the
conclusion. Treasury Department that contains establishment-level data on manufacturing. If working
capital were not reported in the 1820 or 1850 censuses, there would have been very large increases in
capital between 1820 and 1832, and large declines between 1832 and 1850. No such movements in capital
are observed – hence, Sokoloff’s conclusion While we acknowledge Sokoloff’s point, we tend to favor the
conventional wisdom that working capital was under-reported prior to 1890. However, were we to adjust
just the 1880 data for under-reporting, the resulting increase in the capital-output ratio between 1850 and
1880 is too large to be believable. Consequently, we have chosen for the sake of consistency to adjust all of
our samples (the adjustment procedure is described in the text). However, our analysis does consider both
points of view; for example, in Table 1, we present estimates of capital deepening assuming that the census
reports were complete, along with estimates assuming that working capital was omitted. In general, the
adjustment for the under-reporting of working capital does not alter our substantive findings with respect to
trends or differences across establishments.
5
  Although we use separate ratios by state and industry, the values of the ratios are the same for each census
year. A case can be made, however, that the share of working capital may have been higher in 1850 than


                                                      8
some caution because this imputation procedure may introduce bias of uncertain

magnitude and direction. Following much previous work in nineteenth century

manufacturing (for example, Atack 1977; Sokoloff 1984a), we measure production in

value added terms (= value of outputs – value of raw materials).6

          Measured in nominal terms, the aggregate capital-output ratio in the 1880 sample

was approximately 30 percent higher than in 1850. Most of the deepening occurred in

the 1870s; in particular, we observe little increase in capital/output ratios before the Civil

War and (essentially) none at all during the Civil War decade. Although the levels of

ratios underlying the two indices are very different, the trends are remarkably similar

suggesting that, in practical terms, adjusting for working capital has relatively little

impact.

          By definition, the nominal ratios do not adjust for changes over time in the price

of capital goods relative to the price of output. At the outset it must be recognized that

any attempt we make to adjust for changes in the relative price of capital goods will be

extremely crude and possibly subject to considerable error. The fundamental problem is

that (with the exception of the type of inanimate power source being used, if any) the

census did not collect information on the type and quantity of capital in use prior to 1890.

that implied by the 1890 data; that is, over time, establishments increased their fixed capital relative to
working capital due, in particular, to the diffusion of steam-powered machinery and other novel (for the
time) technologies and to the increase in the frequency of full-year establishments (Sokoloff 1984b; Atack,
Bateman, and Margo 2002) If this were the case, our estimates of capital deepening would be biased
upwards because we are underestimating the extent of working capital in 1850. On other hand, if Sokoloff
(1986) is correct that working capital was generally reported in 1850, our estimates may be biased
downwards substantially. See, in addition, Sokoloff (1984b) who shows that, in 1832, larger firms, firms in
urban areas, and firms whose markets were regional (or national) as opposed to local, tended to use more
working capital relative to fixed capital --patterns that suggest that working capital may have been
increasing in importance over time.
6
  It is not possible to construct a consistent series based on physical output measures because the 1880
census only reported the total value of all outputs produced, not quantities of specific goods. Yet another
reason for using value added as the measure of output is that our model of manufacturing (see section 2) is
framed in these terms; however, it is possible to recast the model in gross value terms (see Goldin and Katz
1998).


                                                     9
As a result, conventional hedonic methods (that is, valuing particular types of physical

capital at fixed prices) cannot be applied to our data.

         For the purposes of this paper, we developed aggregate output and capital price

deflators. The output price deflator, taken from U.S. Department of Commerce (1975), is

based on Gallman (1961).7 This price index follows the familiar patterns suggested by

other nineteenth century price indices over the 1850 to 1880 period. Prices rise slightly

in the 1850s, increase sharply in the 1860s, followed by deflation during the 1870s.

According to Gallman’s estimates, output prices in manufacturing, on average, were

about 9 percent higher in 1880 than in 1850.The capital price deflator follows the general

procedure outlined in Sokoloff (1986). Specifically, we assume that capital was divided

into equipment, structures, and working capital, and that working capital was further

divided equally into finished output and raw materials. Like Sokoloff (1986), we use

data from Brady (1966) to compute price indices for equipment and structures, albeit with

some modifications that are discussed in the notes to Table 1. For the finished goods

component of working capital, we use the output price deflator, and for the raw materials

component, the Warren-Pearson wholesale price index (U.S. Department of Commerce

1975).

         It is reasonable to assume that capital and output prices evolved differently in

different industries; and, therefore, it would be better to make estimates of both at the

industry level and then aggregate using fixed value added weights (see Sokoloff 1986).

However, our preliminary work along these lines suggests that the overall trends would

not change and, therefore, the aggregate deflators are not too far off the mark.

7
 Gallman (1961) reports estimates of nominal value added and value added in constant 1880 dollars.
Dividing the former (nominal value added) by the latter (real) produces our price index. We re-scale the
price index so that the value in 1850 is 100.


                                                    10
        The general pattern emerging from the price deflators is that the relative price of

capital goods was declining over time. Much of the decline in the relative price appears

to have occurred between 1860 and 1870; like output prices, capital goods prices rose

during this decade, but the extent of the increase was below that of output prices.

        To convert the nominal capital/output ratios into constant dollars, we divide the

nominal ratios by the relative price of capital or, equivalently, multiply the capital/output

ratios by the ratio of output to capital goods prices. Because the relative price of capital

goods was falling, the real ratios grew at a much faster pace than the nominal ratios.

Again, however, relatively little of the increase in real capital deepening occurred before

the Civil War (see Sokoloff 1986 for a similar conclusion). We do find an increase in

real terms during the 1860s, largely driven by the fall in the relative price. Virtually all

of increase in the real ratio during the 1870s, however, occurred because of pure capital

deepening; that is, it would have occurred whether or not we adjust for changes in the

relative price of capital. Overall, the capital-output ratio grew in real terms at an average

annual rate of about 1.8 percent per year between 1850 and 1880.

        To the best of our knowledge, there are no previously constructed aggregate series

of capital-output ratios for manufacturing against which to compare the series in Table 1.8

Gallman (1986, Table 4.8) presents nominal and real series of capital-output ratios for

mining and manufacturing for the 1850-80 census years but because his series includes

mining, it cannot be expected to track ours exactly. In terms of the long-term trend

(1850-80), Gallman’s series show somewhat more overall increase than our series, but

8
  Our series for manufacturing do grow more quickly than series for the aggregate economy. For example,
Gallman’s (1986, p. 186) variant A series shows a modest decline in the aggregate capital-output ratio
between 1850 and 1880 in both nominal and real terms. Gallman’s variant A series includes agricultural
improvements, which grew more slowly than other forms of capital as the economy shifted away from
farming; see Gallman (1986, p. 188).


                                                  11
the difference is slight in the case of the nominal series.9 However, decade-to-decade

growth in Gallman’s series is more evenly spaced than in our series, and Gallman’s real

series shows a steep increase during the 1860s and a decline in the 1870s, opposite the

behavior of our series. Although further work is necessary to reconcile the differences in

decade-to-decade movements between Gallman’s series and our series, some of the

difference can clearly be traced to the choice of price deflators.10



3. A Model of Capital Deepening



         As noted in the Introduction, the data analyzed in this paper unlike published

census figures are able to shed light on the correlates of the capital-output ratio at the

establishment level,. To provide intuition for such analysis, we rely a simple model of

manufacturing that is very similar to the model of Goldin and Katz (1998). .

         The Goldin-Katz model presumes that industrialization proceeded in three distinct

phases – from the “artisan shop” (phase 1) to the “factory” (phase 2) to “continuous


9
 Gallman does not adjust for working capital, so his figures should be compared with our Index A ratios
(Table 1). In index number form (1850 = 100), Gallman’s (1986, Table 4.8) estimate of the nominal
capital-output ratio in 1880 is 137.5, compared with our estimate of 132.1, a differences of 4 percent..His
1880 estimate of the real ratio is 193.0, compared with our estimate of 173.8, a difference of 11 percent.
As pointed out in the text, some of the differences in the real ratios can be traced to the price deflators. If
we deflate Gallman’s 1880 nominal ratio by our 1880 price deflators, the result would be an index number
of 180, 4 percent higher than our 1880 index number.
10
   Gallman’s estimates were based on the census, and should (mining aside) be similar to our index A. Our
selection criteria (see the text) exclude certain types of establishments from the computation (for instance,
firms with negative value added) that cannot be excluded from the published volumes. However, if we do
not impose the selection criteria, the resulting series do not differ appreciably from the series in Table 1.
Gallman’s price deflators, like ours, were based on Brady (1966); however, while his ratio of capital to
output price shows a very similar decline between 1850 and 1880 (his 1880 index number (1850 = 100) is
71, whereas ours is 76, see Table 1), his shows a much steeper decline in the 1860s and a rise in the 1870s,
unlike our relative price series. If we adjust Gallman’s series using our relative price deflator, the capital-
output ratio rises in real terms in the 1870s, whereas Gallman’s original estimates show a decline, as noted
in the text. Although we cannot be certain without access to Gallman’s worksheets, we believe that the
much of the difference between the relative price deflators can be traced to the adjustments that we make to
Brady’s 1870 index numbers and, possibly, to different weights in constructing the overall index.

processing.” (phase 3). The focus in their model is primarily on differences in capital and

skill intensity across the different phases of manufacturing, rather than the forces that

propelled the transition from one phase to the next and their specific application of the

model addresses the continuous processing phase.11 Because thisphase occurred largely

after the turn of the twentieth century and because our empirical analysis stops with 1880

when establishment-level data cease being available, our exposition here focuses

primarily on the first two phases.

         Within each phase – for instance, the artisan shop – the manufacturing process is

divided into two stages. In the first stage, skilled labor (Ls) is combined with “raw”

capital (Kr) —tools and buildings, for example—to produce, and subsequently maintain,

an intermediate input called “operating” capital (Kw). Goldin and Katz (1998) assume

that the production function for operating capital is Leontief, which can be written12



                                           Ko = min (αLs, Kr)



In the second stage, operating capital is combined with unskilled labor (Lu) to produce a

finished good (Q). Substitution between workable capital and unskilled labor is permitted

in the second stage as, for example, in a Cobb-Douglas technology,




11
   Goldin and Katz (1998), however, clearly have in mind two primary determinants of the transition. First,
because the “division of labor was limited by the extent of the market” falling costs of transportation
contributed to the initial shift away from the artisan shop. Second, advances in technology embodied in
new capital goods raised the productivity of unskilled labor, creating an incentive to substitute capital and
unskilled labor for skilled labor. Later in the section we argue that a reduction in the relative price of
capital – a possible consequence of such technological improvements – can also cause a shift away from
the artisan shop.
12
   As Goldin and Katz (1998) note, the Leontief assumption is made for simplicitly; that is, substitution
between raw capital and skilled labor could be permitted in the first stage.


                                                    13

           Firms are assumed to select an optimal ratio of unskilled labor to operating

capital. This is a function (Ф) of the ratio of rental price of operating capital to the

unskilled wage (f = r/wu) and, possibly, the level of output



                                                      Lu/Kw = Ф(f,Q)



           The capital-output ratio is the ratio of capital per worker (k = Kw/(Ls + Lu)) to

output per worker (q = Q/(Ls + Lu)). From the above assumptions it follows that k = (1-

s)/Φ, where s is skill intensity ( = Lu/(Lu + Ls)).

           An important presumption in the Goldin-Katz model is that Φ is smaller in the

artisan shop than in the factory; that is, in the artisan shop, a much smaller ratio of

unskilled labor relative to workable capital is used in the second stage. The fundamental

reasons is that, in the artisan shop, most finished goods were made to order; that is, they

embodied a large component of workable capital from the first stage, and required

relatively little unskilled labor in the second stage. By contrast, factory production

tended to be standardized, in part to realize the gains in efficiency from division of labor.

In terms of the model, this means that Φ was greater in the factory than in the artisan

shop. However, skill intensity was lower in the factory, implying that (1-s) was higher.13


13
     Since Ls = Ko/α, it follows that

                                        s = (Ko/α)/((Ko/α) + ФKo) = 1/(1 + αФ)

As noted in the text Φ is presumed to be small in the artisan shop. In addition, Goldin and Katz assume
that α was also small in the artisan shop. When α is small, relatively large amounts of skilled labor are


                                                         14
Whether the capital-labor ratio is higher or lower in the factory, therefore, depends on the

relative magnitudes of these two effects. Specifically, if skill intensity is decreasing with

respect to size at a faster rate than Φ rises with size, the capital labor ratio will be higher

in the factory than in the artisan shop.

         Even if the capital-labor ratio is higher in the factory than in the artisan shop, it

does not follow that the same will be true of the capital-output ratio. Presumably a key

factor motivating the shift in production from artisan shop to factory was that there were

gains in labor productivity to be had (Sokoloff 1984a, 1986). However, as long as the

gains in labor productivity were proportionately smaller than any increase in the capital

labor ratio, the capital-output ratio will be higher in the factory than in the artisan shop.14

         Continuous processing, the third phase of industrialization, differed from the

factory primarily in the second stage of production, in that a vastly higher ratio of capital

to unskilled labor was the norm. In this regard, the critical technological advance,

according to Goldin and Katz (1998), was the development and diffusion of electric

power. Electricity greatly altered the design of manufacturing plants, permitting the

elimination of a wide range of unskilled jobs on the shop floor that were involved in the


needed to transform raw capital into workable capital. While the overall capital requirements of most
artisan shops were minimal, the operating capital itself might be complex or unique, requiring considerable
skill to produce, cultivate and manage. Further, in the artisan shop, each worker was responsible for
maintaining his own tools whereas, in the factory, a single worker (or a small number thereof) may have
installed and maintained the machines operated by the unskilled labor in the second stage. Thus, possibly
for both reasons – low values of α and Φ -- skill intensity will be higher in the artisan shop than in the
factory and, consequently, 1-s will be higher in the factory.
14
   In the case where production in the second stage is Cobb-Douglas, the expression for the capital-output
ratio can be simplified further, Ko/Q = Φβ-1/A. Taking logarithms of both sides, the total differential of the
left hand side is [(β-1)/Φ]dΦ - ln Φdβ - dA/A. In the transition from the artisan shop to the factory, the
first term in this expression will be negative, because β<1 and dΦ>0. The third term will be negative if
total factor productivity is higher in the factory (dA>0; see Sokoloff 1984). However, the second term will
be positive, because dβ<0 (the output elasticity of capital in the second stage is smaller in the factory than
in the artisan shop).



                                                     15
movement of bulky materials and product from location to another within establishments.

Continuous processing establishments not only had much higher capital-output ratios,

they also tended to be relatively more skill intensive than factories, even though, in terms

of production, they were much larger than factories.

       With very few exceptions (such as reduction flour milling and the manufacture of

cigarettes, both after 1880), the diffusion of continuous process technology in American

manufacturing did not begin in earnest until after the turn of the twentieth century

because it was dependent on electrical power,. However, electricity was not the first use

of inanimate power in American manufacturing. Prior to the diffusion of electricity,

establishments used steam or water to power equipment. Although water-power was

more important initially, use of steam-powered machinery diffused rapidly after 1850

(see Fenichel 1966; Atack, Bateman, and Weiss, 1980).

       The use of steam or water power does not appear to have altered the architecture

of manufacturing plants in the same way as electricity and, therefore, arguably did not

lead to the widespread elimination of unskilled jobs as did electricity (Goldin and Katz

1998). However, either source of power complicated the production in various ways that

may have affected capital use. In terms of our model, we think of the use of steam or

water as having two possible effects. First, steam- or water-powered plants may have had

a higher ratio of skilled to raw capital in the first stage of production, in order to maintain

equipment (steam engines, waterwheels).              Second, steam- and water-powered

establishments may have had more capital per unskilled worker in the second stage. If

the second of these effects outweighed the first, and if the impact of steam or water on the




                                              16
productivity of unskilled labor was not too large, the capital-output ratio would increase

with the use of steam or water.

       Because production in the first stage in the model is Leontief, changes in the

rental rate of raw capital relative to the wage of skilled labor do not affect factor

intensities, holding the type of manufacturing – artisan or factory – constant. However,

as the expression for the capital-output ratio shows, a fall in the rental price of capital

relative to the unskilled wage in the second stage will lower the value of Φ and, other

factors held constant, raise the capital-output ratio. It is possible that such increases

might be proportionately greater in larger establishments, if the ease of substituting

capital for unskilled labor was increasing in establishment size. Further, a fall in the

relative cost of capital would also encourage a shift towards factory production in order

to economize on relatively expensive skilled labor. The same could result from a rise in

the skilled-unskilled wage ratio.

       As we show in the previous section, the price of capital was apparently falling

relative to output prices between 1850 and 1880. Over the same period employment

grew in large establishments relative to small establishments (Atack, Bateman, and

Margo, forthcoming).      Real wages in manufacturing were rising over this period and

there is some, albeit, controversial evidence that skill differentials were also rising

(Margo 2000a, b; Engerman and Sokoloff 2000; Williamson and Lindert 1980).

Although we do not investigate the hypothesis in this paper directly, it is possible that

shifts in factor prices – or rather, the factors that caused the shifts in factor prices - may

also be partly responsible for spread of the factory system.

4. Multivariate Analysis



       In this section we estimate multivariate regressions of capital-output ratios using

the establishment samples. Because our interest is primarily in the long-term trend – that

is, 1850 to 1880 -- and, as pointed out in section 2, our estimates of this trend are broadly

similar to previous work (Gallman 1986), we present regression results just for the base

year (1850) and terminal year (1880) samples.. The results of the regressions are

interpreted in light of the model of manufacturing sketched in the previous section.

       The dependent variable in the regressions is the log of the ratio of the value of

capital to value added and the independent variables are establishment characteristics.

Capital is as reported to the census enumerators plus the adjustment for working capital

described in the previous section. We do not adjust for changes in the relative price of

capital since this amounts to adding a fixed number to the constant term in the 1880

regressions; the reader should keep in mind, however, that the dependent variable here

corresponds to the nominal capital-output ratio in Table 1. Separate regressions are

estimated for 1850 and 1880. The results for 1850 are reported in Panel A of Table 2 and

those for 1880 in Panel B.

       The first column reports regressions with three dummies for establishment size, as

measured by the number of workers: 6-15, 16-100, and 100 or more. This classification

is a slight extension of that used by Sokoloff (1984; see also Sokoloff and Villaflor

1992). It is difficult to say precisely at what level of employment the artisan shop ceased

and the factory began but, as Sokoloff (1984) shows, there appear to have been gains in

efficiency even at the relatively modest size represented by the second of these dummies




                                             18
(6-15 workers). In what follows, we refer to the left-out size classification (1-5

employees) as the artisan shop.

        In both years, establishments with more than 16 workers had significantly higher

capital-output ratios than either artisan shops or slightly large establishments (6-15

workers). However, in 1850, the positive dependence of the capital-output ratio on size

largely disappears once we control for other characteristics, particularly in the

specification in column 3. When other factors are controlled for, a modest U-shaped

pattern emerges in 1850; that is, the capital-output ratio declined as employment first

increased beyond the (hypothesized) boundary of the artisan shop (1-5 workers to 6-15

workers), and then rose slightly as employment grew further. However, we emphasize

that the U-shaped pattern is quite modest and is not, in fact, statistically significant, so we

cannot reject the hypothesis that, in 1850, size (in terms of employment) was irrelevant as

a determinant of the capital-output ratio.

        By 1880, this U-shaped pattern had disappeared and the capital-output ratio rose

sharply with establishment size. The capital-output ratio in the 6-15 size group was about

8 percent higher that in the artisan shop, but this difference is not statistically significant.

However, the ratio in the next size group (16-100) workers was about 29 percent

[=exp[0.255] – 1) higher than the ratio in the artisan shop, controlling for other factors.

In the very largest establishments (100+ workers), there appears to be a slight decline

compared with the preceding size group, but the largest establishments nevertheless used

about 24 percent more capital per unit of output than did artisan shops, controlling for

other factors, considerable more in relative terms than was the case in 1850.




                                               19
         In column 2 we add the steam and waterpower dummies and in column 3 we add

the percent of employees who were female, and dummy variables for urban status,

region, and two-digit SIC industry codes.15 We do not report the coefficients for the

industry dummies. However, not surprisingly, we find that including industry dummies

increases the explanatory power of the regression, indicating the different industries had

different capital-output ratios, controlling for other establishment characteristics (see also

Sokoloff 1984b).

         In both 1850 and 1880 establishments using steam or water had significantly

higher capital-output ratios. These differences are quite substantial in the column 2

regressions, which do not control for establishment characteristics other than size.

Controlling for the additional characteristics in column 3 reduces the magnitudes of the

power dummies. However, the differences in capital intensity associated with the use of

either source of power in 1850 are still striking.16 Use of steam power was associated

with a higher capital-output ratio in 1880 but the coefficient on waterpower, while still

positive, was statistically insignificant.

         Our model of manufacturing does not make a specific prediction as to whether

less skill intensive establishments should have had lower or higher capital-output ratios;

and, in any case, the proportion of workers who were female is, at best, an imperfect

measure of skill (Goldin and Sokoloff 1982). Nonetheless, in both years we observe a

15
   It is important to keep in mind that the percent female is females/(females + males) in 1850 and adult
females/(adult males + adult females + children) in 1880; that is, the definition of the variable is not fully
consistent over time. However, if most children employed in manufacturing in 1850 were boys (see
Sokoloff 1986), the inconsistency should be very minor. As the regression results show, percent female is
negatively related to the capital-output ratio in both 1850 and 1880.
16
   There is anecdotal evidence that some establishments using water rented power, and the rental
agreements included access to capital that was probably not included in the value of capital reported to the
census; if so, the capital-output ratio for such establishments would be biased downwards. We have no
idea if this was common or not; if it was, the coefficients on the water dummy would be biased downward.

negative relationship: female-intensive establishments tended to have lower capital-

output ratios, all other factors held constant..17

         Urban establishments in 1850 had slightly lower capital-output ratios than rural

establishments but the difference was not significant. However, the negative effect of

urban location on capital use apparently increased by 1880 (to about 10 percent). A

possible explanation is that the price of land – a component in the price of structures –

may have increased in urban areas relative to rural areas after the Civil War.18 Before the

Civil War establishments located in the Midwest and especially the Far West had lower

capital-output ratios than establishments in the Northeast, but there was no difference in

capital-output ratios between the South and the Northeast. After the Civil War,

Midwestern and Western establishments still used less capital per unit of output than

establishments in the Northeast, but the differences were much smaller than before the

War (and statistically insignificant). However, Southern establishments after the War

were far less capital intensive than before the War, relative to the Northeast or the other

regions. Since these regressions control for size, power, and industry, regional

differences in the evolution of factor price ratios may account for the changing regional

contrasts in capital-output ratios. Recent work by Hutchinson and Margo (2003; see also

Wright 1986) demonstrates that, compared with factor price ratios in the North, interest

rates in the South rose sharply relative to unskilled wages after the War. Such an

increase, according to our model, should have induced southern establishments to



17
   The significant negative coefficients are sensitive to the adjustment for working capital; if no adjustment
is made, the coefficient on percent female is slightly positive in 1850 and insignificant; in 1880 the
coefficient is negative, smaller in magnitude than as reported in Panel B of Table 3, and insignificant.
18
   See, for example, Atack and Margo (1998) who find a substantial rise in the price of vacant land in New
York City after the Civil War. An alternative explanation, which we cannot rule out, is that urban
establishments relied more heavily on leased capital, which was excluded by the census prior to 1890.


                                                     21
substitute labor for capital and, holding productivity fixed, this should have lowered the

capital-output ratio in the South relative to other regions, which is what we observe.

        Shifts in the distribution of production across power types and employment size

classes can explain some of the rise in the capital-output ratio between 1850 and 1880. In

the samples analyzed in this paper, the proportion of value added produced using steam

increased sharply between 1850 and 1880 while the proportion produced by water

declined.19 Using the 1880 coefficients (column 3, Panel A, Table 2), the net effects of

these shifts was to increase the capital-output ratio, on average, by 0.051 log points,

compared with an overall increase of 0.237 between 1850 and 1880.20 Thus, the

replacement of water and hand power with steam can account for 22 percent

[=0.051/0.237] of the increase in the capital-output ratio.

        Between 1850 and 1880 the proportion of value added produced in artisan shops

in the samples declined from 27 to 16 percent, and the share produced in the two largest

size classes (16-100 workers, and 100+ workers) increased from 53 percent to 65 percent.

If we use the 1880 coefficients to compute the impact of these changes, the net effect was

to raise the capital-output ratio by another 0.027 points, raising the percent explained by

just these two shifts – power and the employment-size distribution – to 33 percent.

However, if the 1850 coefficients are used to value the shifts in power and size, the




19
   Specifically, the share of value added produced using steam power rose from 0.259 in 1850 to 0.600 in
1880 while the share of value added produced using water power declined from 0.25 to 0.089. Details of
the calculation of these figures are available from Robert A. Margo on request.
20
   The figure 0.237 is the increase in log points in the geometric mean of the capital-output ratio between
1850 and 1880, weighting each establishment by value added (see Table 1). The impact of the relative shift
to steam is computed as 0.051 = 0.192*[0.600-0.259] + 0.096*[0.099-0.254]. Note that, if some firms
using water rented access, this estimate of the importance of the relative shift to steam power will be
overstated if the extent of leasing was greater in 1850 than in 1880.


                                                    22
percent explained declines to 21 percent. Including additional explanatory variables does

not appreciably improve the degree of explanatory power.21

         While numerically and economically significant, it is clear that other factors

besides the diffusion of steam power and increasing establishment size per se must have

played a role in the capital deepening that occurred after 1850. Perhaps the obvious

economic explanation –a general decline in the relative price of capital goods – is the

correct one: a fall in the price of capital goods relative to output induced establishments

to increase the capital-output ratio. For this explanation to be correct, however, it must

explain why, after controlling for other factors, capital deepening was concentrated

within the two largest size categories (see Table 2, column 3, both panels). Either the

price elasticity of demand for capital in such establishments exceeded unity, or there were

factors unmeasured by the census in such establishments that were positively associated

with the demand for capital. Further progress on this issue, however, will require

establishment-level data that is fundamentally more informative and detailed about

capital structure in nineteenth century manufacturing plants and its determinants than the

census manuscripts.



4. Rates of Return



We have shown that manufacturing establishments used more capital per unit of output in

1880 than in 1850 measured in nominal terms and especially when measured in constant

21
  For instance, production shifted towards urban areas between 1850 and 1880. However, because capital-
output ratios were either unrelated to urban status (1850) or negatively related (1880), the urbanization of
production cannot explain capital deepening. The proportion of female workers was slightly lower in 1880
than in 1850, but evaluating this shift raises the percent explained by less than a log point, and thus does
not change the substantive conclusion.


                                                    23
dollars terms. This capital deepening may have had implications for the rate of return to

capital. By definition, the (nominal) rate of return (π) to capital is



                                          π = δQ/K



where Q is value-added and δ is capital’s share. . If δ were fixed over time, a rise in K/Q

would imply a decline over time in π. However, if δ were not fixed but instead were

falling, it is possible that the rate of return would not fall, and might even increase.

       We can estimate π using an “accounting” approach that has been previously used

to estimate rates of return in mid-nineteenth century manufacturing and also in

agriculture (Bateman and Weiss, 1981; Atack and Bateman 1987; Atack and Passell

1990). The details of the computation are described in detail in the appendix (see section

6). In brief, we subtract an estimate of various omitted and neglected production costs

from value-added, in addition to labor costs. These omitted and neglected costs are

meant to be inclusive --- for instance, they include depreciation, and miscellaneous

expenses – however, they do not, by construction, include the opportunity costs of

capital. We then divide “profits” – the difference between value added and costs – by the

sum of reported value of capital invested and our adjustment for working capital—that is

we use the capital estimates that we have used in the analysis above..

       The estimates presented here significantly improve on earlier estimates in two

ways. First, the national samples used in this paper are designed to be self-weighting,

which is not the case with versions of the samples used in previous work (eg. Bateman




                                              24
and Weiss, 1981; Atack and Passell 1994, p. 206). Second, we present estimates for 1870

and 1880, while previous work has focused just on the antebellum period.

        There are numerous difficulties entailed in using any accounting method to

estimate rates of return from our samples. These are discussed at length in the appendix.

Here we highlight three specific problems. First, our procedure occasionally yields rates

of return that are either very large and negative or very large and positive. Because our

estimates of return are “realized” not “expected,” negative returns cannot be dismissed on

theoretical grounds. However, it is also possible that extreme values are due to simple

measurement error. Consequently we truncate our samples to those firms whose

estimated rate of return lies between the 1st and 99th percentile of the distribution.22

        Second, annual labor expenses and annual months of operation were not reported

before the Civil War; rather, only monthly labor costs were reported. To compute annual

labor costs for 1850 and 1860, we assume that all establishments operated on a full year

basis, which is almost certainly factually incorrect (see Atack, Bateman, and Margo

2002). On average, we believe that this procedure overstates wages by an average of

about 16% (that is firms probably averaged about 10 months per year, not twelve, in 1850

and 1860). As a result, our estimates of returns for 1850 and 1860 are biased downwards.

Judging from the post-bellum evidence (Atack, Bateman, and Margo 2002), which shows

that full year operation was a positive function of establishment size, it is likely that the

downward bias is also largest for the smallest establishments.

        On the other hand, unlike Sokoloff (1984) in his analysis of economies of scale in

ante-bellum manufacturing, we make no explicit allowance for the possibly unreported


22
  Adopting a somewhat stricter amount of trimming (for example, the 5th through the 95th percentiles) does
not change our substantive findings.


                                                   25
labor input of owners. We believe a case can be made that any such input was included

in the census reports on employment and wages, although we acknowledge that the case

is (1) largely circumstantial (2) considerably stronger for 1850 and 1860 than for 1870

and 1880. If, contrary to our assumption, the census did not report the labor input of

owners, then our estimates will be biased upward, possibly more so for the post-bellum

than the ante-bellum censuses, and particularly for the smallest establishments (see

below).23

           Column 1 of Panel A of Table 3 shows our estimates of mean rates of return.

Despite the problems just noted, the levels of returns, ranging from 11 to 18 percent,

seem plausible, at least in light of estimates previously made for other sectors, such as

agriculture (particularly if capital gains to land are included; see Atack, Bateman, and

Parker, 2000, p. 279) and consistent with the comments of contemporaries (US Congress

1846). The estimates, as noted above, are nominal – they are not adjusted for changes

over time in the price of capital relative to output. And they are, as just argued, likely to

be biased downwards before the Civil War.

           If we could adjust the ante-bellum estimates properly for annual labor costs it

seems likely that the mean rate of return would have fallen modestly from 1850 to 1870,

and then declined sharply in the 1870s. The sharp decline in the 1870s, of course,

coincides with an increase in nominal capital deepening, as documented in Table 1. In

real terms – that is, when the estimates are adjusted for the decline over time in the

relative price of capital -- there is a more pronounced downward trend. Indeed, in real

terms, the mean return in 1880 was approximately half of the level in 1850; and, this

     However, because we know annual labor costs in 1880 the first bias is no longer relevant.


                                                      26
decline, because of the bias resulting from the overstatement of annual labor costs in

1850, is understated.

        It is possible to use our estimates of mean rates of return to infer a time series of

capital’s share, using the estimates made previously of the capital-output ratio. These

estimates of capital’s share are shown in column 3 of Panel A. Capital’s share appears to

rise in the 1850s, remain constant in 1860s, and then decline in 1870s to a level slightly

below that in 1850. A simple average of the four figures in column 3 gives a value of

0.334, implying that capital’s share of value added was one-third on average during the

period. This seems highly plausible, and suggests that our procedure for estimating mean

returns, for all its potential pitfalls, yields results that, on average, may not be too far off

the mark.

        Panel B of Table 3 reports regressions of the estimated rate of return on

establishment characteristics, using the column 3 specification from Table 3. If (1) capital

markets were “perfect” (2) there were no systematic errors in our estimation procedure,

and (3) there were no differences in risk either across locations or types of

establishments, rates of return should have been equalized. We already know that

assumption (2) is likely to be false, because we cannot observe annual labor costs for the

census establishments before the Civil War.

        In any case, the regressions reveal that rates of return varied across establishments

in systematic ways. The geographic differences that we observe – for instance, the urban

premium prior to the Civil War – and the lower returns to establishments in the

Northeast, particularly in comparison with the Midwest and South after the Civil War, are

consistent with previous research (Bodenhorn and Rockoff 1992; Hutchinson and Margo




                                               27
2003). No significant correlations are observed, however, between rates of return and

the percent female or the use of steam or waterpower.

        Perhaps the most intriguing finding in Panel B is the negative relationship

between the rate of return and establishment size. Because we are forced to annualize

labor costs in 1850 and 1860 and this assumption arguably biases down the rate of return

for the smaller establishments, it is likely that the true negative gradient between the

returns and size is even steeper in 1850 than we estimate. That is, if we were able to

make the appropriate adjustment, it is likely that, relative to artisan shops, the larger

establishments earned lower returns, but the gaps in this regard were probably no larger

in 1880 than in 1850 – despite the substantial rise in capital-output ratios that took place

in the larger establishments, relative to artisan shops, over this period.

       With the information at our disposal it is not possible to identify the cause, or

causes, of the negative relationship between returns and size. It is possible, for instance,

that the culprit is measurement error. As we noted above, we make no adjustment for the

labor input of owners, on the grounds that the census counted this input if it materially

contributed to production. If we are wrong about this, returns will be biased upwards for

establishments in which the owner’s contribution was proportionately larger – in the

smallest establishments.

       Absent an explanation based on measurement error, there may be numerous

reasons why size and returns were negatively correlated. One obvious possibility is that

size is a proxy for risk – that is, larger establishments were less risky investments than

smaller establishments. Post-bellum evidence suggests that larger establishments were

more likely to operate on a full year basis than smaller establishments (see Atack,




                                              28
Bateman, and Margo 2002), which is consistent with the hypothesis that larger

establishments were less likely to shut down or go out of business. In this sense, capital

invested in large establishments make have been at lower risk than capital invested in

smaller establishments. On the other had, if we compute coefficients of variation

(standard deviation/mean) of rates of return by size class of establishment, we find no

evidence that the dispersion in returns was decreasing in establishment size – which we

might expect to see if large establishments were less risky. In short, further research is

needed, using much more detailed data, is necessary to explain the negative association

between rates of return and size observed in our samples.



5. Conclusion



       This paper has used establishment level data to examine capital deepening in

nineteenth century U.S. manufacturing. Adjusted for changes in the price of capital

relative to output, each unit of output used approximately 70 percent more capital in 1880

than in 1850. In 1850, the capital-output ratio followed a U-shaped pattern with respect

to establishment size, but even the largest establishments did not use much more capital

per unit of output than did artisan shops. By 1880, however, the capital-output ratio was

positively related to establishment size. A portion of the twist in the relationship between

capital and size can be attributed to the diffusion of steam power. Steam or water

powered establishments used more capital per unit of output, other factors held constant.

Over time, steam accounted for an increasing share of total value added, relative to water

or hand power, and the diffusion of steam can explain, in a proximate sense, a portion of




                                             29
capital deepening after 1850. However, other factors clearly mattered, including rising

establishment size but others as well not revealed by the information in the census data.

       The rise in the capital-output ratio implies that capital productivity was falling

over time on average and we also show that capital’s marginal product – the rate of return

– was also falling, especially when adjusted for changes in the relative price of capital

goods. Rates of return varied with the location of the establishment in ways that seem

consistent with previous research using other data. Large establishments earned lower

returns than small establishments but determining the cause of the negative relationship

between size and returns will require much more information than was reported in the

censuses.



6. Appendix: Calculation of Rates of Return to Capital



       The purpose of this appendix is to describe our calculations of rates of return to

capital. By “rate of return” we mean the difference between revenues less all non-capital

costs of production, per dollar of capital. Here “capital” includes the value of capital

invested in the establishment, as reported in the census, plus estimated working capital

which is assumed to not have been reported

       The equation for estimating the rate of return, π, is as follows: :




                                π = (VA–W – E)/(Ki + Kw)




                                             30
Where



         VA = value added = gross value of output – value of raw materials used in

                production

         W = cost of labor used in production

         E = other non-labor costs of production

         Kf: value of capital reported by the census

         Kw: estimated working capital



We discuss the components of this equation in turn.

         Each of the censuses reported the value of output. As best as we can determine,

value was measured “f.o.b.” – that is, at the factory gate.24 For 1850, 1860, and 1870, the

census instructions directed the enumerators to account for up to six different products,

which we have summed into a single, overall figure. In 1880, only the aggregate value of

output was reported.

         A firm’s profits derive from its revenue, but revenue is not the same as the value

of production. However, by definition, revenue, R, in any given year is



                                               R=Q-∆I



Here Q is the value of output and ∆ I = It+1 – It, is the change in value of inventories. In

24
  The instructions to enumerators in 1860 specifically stated that value was to be determined “at the place
of manufacture … exclusive of the cost of transportation to any market”; see U.S. Census (1860, p. 27).
See also Wright (1900, p. 315).


                                                    31
any given year revenue would also include realized payments on outstanding debt. On

the expense side, these would be offset by an allowance for bad debt. We have no

information on either and thus we are assuming that both are zero, or their difference is

zero. Note that, if ∆I is positive, R < Q – revenues are less than the value of production –

and if ∆I is negative, revenues exceed the value of production. Because we do not

observe inventories in calculating profits we must assume that ∆ I is zero, in which case,

R = Q. For many establishments this may be a reasonable assumption. For example,

establishments that produced processed food items the change in inventories across years

may have been close to zero, because such items were perishable. More generally, much

manufacturing in the nineteenth century was of a custom nature, made to order. Almost

by definition, the value of output for a custom manufacturer would equal revenues. Still,

we cannot rule out the possibility that the change of inventories was non-zero for any

given establishment, and this introduces some error in our estimates.

        Over long time periods with frequent observation, we might expect this error to

cancel out on average. However, this might not be true because profitability is also

influenced by the business cycle. On the basis of twentieth century evidence, we would

expect profits to be pro-cyclical, rising in booms and falling in recessions. The 1850

census year coincides with the middle stages of a moderately serious downturn that began

in 1847 and ended in December 1854. The 1860 census was towards the end of an

expansion following the 1857 panic. The 1870 census followed the business cycle peak

but was well in advance of the 1873 nadir. The 1880 census in contrast was taken during

the recovery from the prolonged downturn of the 1870's. Modern research suggests that




                                             32
profits are a leading economic indicator.25 If this were also the case in the nineteenth

century, profits for the 1850 census year were probably below average; those for 1860,

above average; and those for 1870 and 1880 perhaps more nearly average for their time.

However, we would also expect that during recessions, inventories piled up unsold, while

during booms, the change in inventories may have been negative. If this were true, our

estimates of returns for 1850 may be biased downwards relative to their true value while,

for 1860, our estimates may be biased upwards. Thus our procedures will tend to

dampen any procyclical movement in returns that might have existed. With only four

census years represented in the data, we cannot, in any case, analyze the relationship

between profits and business cycle; at best, we can merely point out the possible

relationships assuming that they follow the same pattern as in more recent data..

        The censuses all reported raw materials costs on a “c.i.f.” basis—the value of

materials used in the production process. For those raw materials or intermediate inputs

that were directly incorporated into the final product, the data seems to be reliable and

comprehensive. We are less certain about fuel although we note that, in 1850-1870 at

least, firms using steam power consistently listed wood and coal among their inputs, and

that the 1870 census contained a specific instruction to include the cost of fuel (see U.S

Census 1870, p. 22). We do not, however, find firms in Lowell, for example, that rented

waterpower from the Locks and Canal Company listing such expenditures in their

accounting to census enumerators.

        The reporting of labor costs varied across the censuses. For 1850 and 1860 the

average monthly cost of male and female labor was reported, but not the average months

of operation. To estimate annual labor costs in these years we assume that establishments

operated on a full-year basis (i.e.12 months), an assumption that almost certainly biases

downwards our estimated rates of return for both years. In 1870 and 1880, actual annual

labor costs were reported.

       An important question in interpreting the census data on labor costs is the

treatment of the so-called “entrepreneurial labor input”. Our interest is in the return on

capital, not in the return to the labor effort of the owner (or owners). Consequently, if the

census did not measure the value of this labor input we would need to inflate the reported

figures on labor costs.

       In general, we believe that the entrepreneur was almost always included in the

count of employees if he or she “materially contributed” to production. We say, “in

general” because the evidence for this belief is circumstantial and it is stronger overall for

the pre-Civil War censuses and stronger for 1880 than for 1870.

       The evidence is in two parts. The first concerns the instructions to enumerators.

In 1850, the instructions clearly specified enumerators "to include the individual labor of

a producer" (U.S. Census 1850, p.xxiv). In 1860, the instruction read: "the average

number of hands and the average monthly wages are to be returned so that dividing the

latter by the former, the result will show the average earnings of individuals. This is also

to include in the individual labor of the producer ”(U.S. Census 1860, p.27).

       If most entrepreneurs did work alongside their employees – and it seems likely

that they did, particularly in small establishments – and if the census enumerators

followed their instructions to the letter we should observe very few establishments in

1850 or 1860 that reported a “zero” for the labor input (or left the relevant columns




                                             34
blank). In fact, very few did – just 0.4 percent of the sample firms in 1850 and 0.8

percent of the sample firms in 1860.

       In 1870 and 1880 the instructions were less specific. For example, in 1870

enumerators were instructed to not include “the cost of Superintendence” in materials,

but there was no offsetting instruction to count such expenses as wages (U.S. Census

1870, p. 22). The proportion of establishments reporting zero employees jumped to 4.2

percent of the sample in 1870 and to 5.1 percent in 1880.

       It is possible that some enumerators in 1870 and 1880 might have interpreted the

instructions as indicating that managerial and supervisory labor, including that of the

entrepreneur, should be ignored. However, this could not have been common, because the

size distributions by employment, particularly among the smaller firms in 1870 and 1880,

are not very much different from what they were are earlier censuses. In 1850, 21.4

percent of establishments reported just one employee. In 1860, the fraction rose slightly

to 21.9 percent. Ten years later, 29 percent of establishments reported employing only

one person but by 1880 the fraction of such firms had fallen back towards its level at

mid-century--23.6 percent. In 1850, 27 percent of producers had two employees. This

was virtually unchanged at 26.4 percent ten years later. It declined thereafter, dropping

to 21.9 percent is 1870 and to 20.1 percent in 1880.

       If the entrepreneur had been systematically excluded from the labor statistics, we

presume that we would have found a much higher fraction of firms reporting zero

employment than we did and that firms with just one worker would have dominated, but

such firms did not. Only in 1870 did the fraction of firms with only one employee exceed

that the fraction with two. Although this evidence is circumstantial, we believe that it




                                            35
favors the point of view that the entrepreneurial labor input was counted if the owner (or

owners) was actively working in the establishment.

       Since the questions on the physical quantity of inputs (such as labor) and their

costs were complementary, it stands to reason that, if the entrepreneurial labor input was

counted, it would have been valued in some manner. Certainly this seems to have been

the intent in 1860, as noted above. But how was this carried out in practice?

       Because the census instructions are silent on this issue, any evidence is

necessarily indirect. For example, suppose we assume that establishments with one

reported employee were, in general, sole proprietorships. If the custom were to not

impute a wage for this work, we would expect such firms to report zero wages. In 1850

and 1860, this was clearly not the case. The fraction of enterprises reporting no wages

was essentially the same for those with just one worker as for those with more. Both

were miniscule (well under one percent). In 1870, however, the case is not so clear.

About 30 percent of firms with just one worker reported zero wages. But in 1880, the

situation looks much more like that existing in 1850 or 1860 than 1870: Relatively few

firms (under five percent) reported zero wages regardless of the number of workers

employed.

       In sum, our operative assumption is that the entrepreneurial labor input was

counted if the owner (or owners) “materially” contributed to production and that the

enumerator – presumably in consultation with the owner – assigned a value to it. We

believe this assumption applies to the vast majority of establishments in 1850 and 1860

and probably 1880, but there were likely some exceptions in 1870 (as described above).

Consequently, it is possible that our estimate of the average return in 1870 may be biased




                                            36
upwards, although we do not believe the bias to be very large, especially when the data

are weighted by capital at risk (see below).

       The next term in the equation concerns non-labor expenses. With some

exceptions, most of these were not reported prior to 1890. For example, most

establishments did not report annual expenses of purchased waterpower rights, insurance

payments, the cost of repairs, or payments to contractors (unless they resulted in a raw

material input to the production process) No establishments reported paying property

taxes nor did they report paying corporate franchise fees to the state.

       On the other hand, the general opinion of contemporaries is that allowance was

made for excise taxes in either the cost of materials deducted from the value of output

(U.S. Census, 1895: 12; U.S. Census, 1902: cxxxiv-v). Prior to 1862 such taxes were of

little consequence but there after federal excise taxes on tobacco products and alcoholic

beverages began to be imposed to ease the fiscal crisis created by the Civil War. These

taxes seem to have had a major impact upon the profitability of firms in these industries

is so far as we note a sharp drop in the rate of return in such activities beginning with the

1870 data.

       Although we do not know how much each firm spent on these various

miscellaneous expenses, is seems reasonable to suppose that these depended upon each

firm’s output level. For example, firms that operated longer and faster should have

higher repair and maintenance costs and pay more excise taxes if they produced more

output. We have therefore made an adjustment to each firm’s costs based upon the gross

value of output. The adjustment is derived from the ratio of miscellaneous expenses to

output for firms in the same state and industry in 1890 when these data were first




                                               37
reported. We have made these calculations at a level that corresponds roughly to the

three or four-digit SIC (standard industrial classification) level of detail. The inquiry

required separate amounts for “(1) amount paid for rent of tenancy, power, and heat; (2)

for taxes; (3) for insurance; (4) for repairs, ordinary, of buildings and machinery; (5) for

commissions and expenses of sales department; (6) for interest on cash used in business;

(7) for all other sundries not reported elsewhere.” (US Census, 1902, cxxxiv).

Unfortunately, because the 1890 census manuscripts themselves were burnt in a fire at

the Commerce Department in 1921, our estimates are based solely upon the published

summary figures and we are unable to factor in any role that size or other firm

characteristics may have played in the determination of these costs.

       No inquiry regarding depreciation was made prior to 1890, when respondents

were required to report the average annual depreciation allowances since 1880.

Unfortunately these allowances were not tabulated and were lost when the original census

schedules burned in a fire. The published volumes, however, do give a breakdown of

fixed capital into land, buildings and machinery by industry and state. We have used

these as a basis for our estimates of depreciation assuming that fixed capital (see below)

at earlier dates was divided in the same proportions as in 1890. We have arbitrarily

assigned a useful life of 15 years to machinery and 50 years for buildings and used

straight-line depreciation. No depreciation is taken on land.

       As an example, consider Pennsylvania flourmills. In 1890, such mills had slightly

more than 44 percent of their fixed capital tied up in machinery and almost 37 percent in

buildings. Thus at the earlier censuses we would make a capital depreciation allowance

equal to 2.96 percent of reported capital for machinery ( = 1/15 of 0.4436) and 0.74




                                             38
percent for buildings ( = 1/50 of 0.3698). Thus depreciation for a Pennsylvanian

flourmill capitalized at, say, $10,000 is estimated to be $370 during the census year. A

flourmill in New York state capitalized at the same amount is assumed (on the basis of

the 1890 figures) to have had less in plant and equipment and more in land. Its

depreciation charge would have been $359.

        The denominator in our equation consists of the value of capital reported in the

census plus estimated working capital. As noted in the text, we are presuming, in the

direct calculation (unlike the production function estimates) that working capital was not

included in the census enumerations. We estimate working capital by again making use

of the data for 1890, specifically by taking the ratio of live assets to output (most items

included in live assets are clearly closely related to output) for 1890 by industry and state

and applying it to output at earlier census years to generate an estimate of the working

capital which the firm may have employed. 26

        As noted in section 2, so-called “special agent” industries are under-represented in

the 1880 sample. We have no reason to believe, however, that firms in such industries

that were included in the 1880 census were anything but randomly selected.

Consequently, to correct for the under-sampling, we re-weight the 1880 data prior to

estimating sample statistics.




        26
            Aside from borrowed capital, some capital may be leased. We make allowance, as noted
above, for rents but do not make any adjustment for leased capital because it is clear from the commentary
in the 1890 census that leased capital was not generally reported prior to 1890.

Notes: Sample size: number of establishments. To be included, establishments have to
meet the following criteria (1) positive value added (value of outputs – value of inputs >
0) (2) value of inputs > 0 (3) value of capital invested > 0 (4) employment > 0 (5) very
low or very high realized rate of return establishments are excluded (see the text).
Source: Atack and Bateman (1999).

Panel A: Figures are index numbers (1850 = 100) of weighted sample averages of
establishment estimates of capital/value added. Figures in [ ] are index numbers for 1880
(1850 = 100) based on weighted geometric means of establishment level ratios. Weight
is value-added. Index A: Assumes that reported capital invested includes working
capital.
Index B: Assumes reported capital invested refers to fixed capital only. Working capital
is estimated by multiplying gross output by the ratio of working capital/gross output in
the 1890 census for the state-two digit industry group.

All 1880 figures are re-weighted for the under-sampling of special agent industries. are
restricted to non-special agent industries, the 1880 nominal estimates (Panel A) in index
number form (1850 = 100) are 132.6 (index A) and 130.3 (index B).

Panel B: Price Deflators: Capital deflator is a weighted average of price index numbers
for equipment, structures, and working capital; see Sokoloff (1986). Weights:
equipment, 0.412; structures, 0.275; working capital, 0.313. Working capital is presumed
divided equally between finished output and raw materials. Weights are computed from
1890 census of manufactures. Equipment capital price is from Brady (1966, pp. 110-111,
“Machine-shop products”). Structures capital price is from Brady (1966, pp. 110-111,
“Factories, Office Buildings” with imputation for 1859 based on change in construction
costs for “Houses, churches, schools” between 1854 and 1859 and imputation for 1869
based on change in construction costs from 1869 to 1879 implied by Riggleman building
cost index; see U.S. Department of Commerce (1975, series N138, p. 629). Price index
for finished products component of working capital is set equal to output price deflator.
Price deflator for raw materials component of working capital is set equal to Warren-
Peason wholesale price index. Output price deflator computed by taking the ratio of
Gallman’s (1961, Table A.13) estimates of aggregate nominal and real value added in
manufacturing, 1849-1879, and re-scaling so that 1850 = 100.

Panel C: Figures are nominal capital/value added ratios x (Output price deflator)/Capital
price deflator.

Panel A: Figures in column 1 (“Nominal”) are mean nominal returns to a dollar of
capital; column 2 (“Real”) = column 1 x [capital price deflator/output price deflator].
Establishment estimates are weighted by estimated capital (= capital reported in the
census + adjustment for working capital). See Table 1 for price indices. Implied
Capital’s Share = column 1 x (inverse of K/Q series used to produce Index B, Panel A,
Table 1). 1880 figures are re-weighted to correct for under-sampling of special agent
industries. Mean nominal rate of return of non-special agent industries shown in [].
