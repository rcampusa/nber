         Deficits, Crowding out and Inflation: The Simple Analytics



                                    Abstract


     The paper studies the relationship between public sector financial

deficits, crowding-out of public sector capital formation and inflation in

a number of small, classical macroeconomic models. This amounts to

reworking some of the government budget constraint literature by including

capacity constraints, flexible prices and rational expectations. After

considering some simple "money only' and "money—capital" models, most of

the paper is devoted to the analysis of a continuous time representation of

the "money—bonds-.capitaP model of Sargent and Wallace. It is noted that

the conventionally measured deficit is likely to be a poor indicator both

of the "eventual monetization" implied by the fiscal stance and of the long—

run financial crowding-Out pressure it represents. A better measure would

be the inflation-and-real-growth-corrected, cyclically adjusted ("permanent")

government currect account deficit as a proportion of national income.

     It is also suggested that the Sargent—Wallace "paradox" -       in   the

variable velocity model ,   lower monetary growth now may mean higher inflation
•now and in the future — has its counterpart in the possibility that lower

money growth now may give lower inflation now and in the future. In the

constant velocity model the Sargent-Wallace findings are confirmed when

the real interest rate is made endogenous.

      This paper investigates the relationship between monetary growth,

government deficits and crowding out. Public sector deficits, if not quite

the root of all evil, are nevertheless frowned upon, condemned and combated

by finance ministers, central bankers and heads of international financial

institutions. The case against government deficits can be briefly stated as

follows:

      Deficits must be financed by borrowing or "high-powered" domestic credit

expansion. In a closed economy or an open economy with a freely floating

exchange rate, "high-powered" domestic credit expansion equals the rate of

change of the monetary base.        If deficits are financed by printing money,

this will fuel inflation. If they are financed by borrowing this will put

upward pressure on interest rates, leading to "crowding out" of interest-

sensitive spending. Even at given interest rates "crowding out" could cccur,

with government bonds displacing claims to private capital in private

portfol ios.

     Like most conventional wisdom in economics, the account of the money

growth -   deficit   -
                         crowding out nexus just given is a (potentially
dangerous) half—truth. The correct relationships are fortunately quite

easily derived. They involve no more than a "dusting off" of the government

budget constraint literature with allowance for real growth, inflation,

public sector capital formation, and cyclical deviations of actual from

trend output (Blinder and Solow (1973), Buiter (l977a, b), (1979), Tobin

and Buiter (1976, 1980).)

     The paper analyses the implications of government deficits in a number
                                     -2—




of familiar macroeconomic models. Three limitations, to be remedied in

 future research, stand out. First, only closed economies are modelled.

Second, "money" is identified throughout with the monetary base. Private

money is not considered. Third, only full employment models are considered.

Even with these restrictions, a number of important issues can be dealt with.

     The plan of the paper is as followsY7 Section 2 considers models without

public sector interest-bearing debt. After analysing a model in which money

is the only asset, two models with money and real capital are studied.

Section 3 considers models with money, real capital and public sector

interest-bearing debt. This whole section is organised around the seminal

paper of Sargent and Wallace (1981) in which rational expectations met the

government budget constraint. It is noted in Section (3a) that it is

necessary to correct the conventionally measured deficit for changes in the

real value of government interest-bearing debt due to inflation to obtain a

proper measure both of the "crowding out pressure" and of the eventual

monetisation implied by the fiscal stance. In Section (3b) the Sargent-

Wallace "paradox" that lower monetary growth now may mean higher future

inflation and even, with velocity endogenous, higher inflation now is

analysed. It is argued that a counter-paradox" - lower monetary growth now

leading to lower inflation now and in the future - can also occur when

velocity is endogenous. A diagrammatic description of this phenomenon is

provided. In Section (3c) it is shown that the exogenous real interest rate

of the Sargent-Wallace model can be endogenised without changing its

qualitative conclusions in the case when velocity is constant. Public sector

capital formation is introduced in Section (3d). It is argued that (with

proper allowance for any difference between the appropriated rate of return

on public sector capital and the government's cost of borrowing) it is the

government's current account deficit that matters for future inflation and
for crowding out of total (private plus public) capital formation. Finally,

in Section (3e) we consider cyclical variations in the deficit without

(necessarily) viewing departures of actual from trend output as due to

Keynesian fluctuations in effective demand.

     The conclusion is that the deficit measure that should be the focus of

concern is the inflation-and-real-growth—corrected, cyclically adjusted

government current account deficit.   I have shown elsewhere that this

measure can differ quite strikingly from the conventionally measured

government deficit (Buiter (1981, 1982c)).

          2.       DEFICITS, INFLATION AND CROWDING OUT IN CLOSED ECONOMIES
                                WITHOUT GOVERNMENT BONDS


 (2a) Models with neither government bonds nor private capital

        Consider the world's simplest economy. The income velocity of

 circulation of money, V, is constant as is the rate of growth n of real

output, Y. G denotes public spending onoods and services and T taxes net

of transfers. The price level, P, is perfectly flexible. Money, M, is the

only government liability and the only private sector asset.


(1)            MV = PY

(2)             V=V

It    follows immediately that


(5)
               P   = M   -n   =    ___     n            -   n
                                  V   j-
                                               V(g-T)


At each moment, the rate of inflation equals the proportional rate of growth

of the nominal money stock minus the rate of growth of output. We define

g GY1 and T = TY1.                The proportional rate of growth of the nominal money

stock can be expressed as the product of the velocity of circulation and

the public sector deficit as a proportion of GNP. With velocity constant,

an increase in the deficit relative to GNP raises inflation. The deficit,

as a proportion of GNP, consistent with any rate of inflation t             is   given

by

                                  +n
                              *

(6)            g-= []
e.g. the zero inflation deficit is given by nV. Note that in the U.K. the

annual velocity of circulation of base money is about 20 while Ml velocity is
                                                    —5-




about 7 and M3 velocity about 3,5*                  With a natural rate of growth of 2 to 3

per year, one's estimate of the zero-inflation deficit in a "pre-Ricardian" U.K.

economy therefore ranges between .1 and .9 per cent of GNP.

       There is no role for private capital formation in this model, so the

"crowding out" issue is moot.                Let C denote private consumption and S private

                Then Y = C +   G   and S =   Y -   T   -   C   =       .. With   output exogenous, public
saving.

spending displaces private consumption one for one.                               Private consumption is

unaffected by changes in taxes.                  An increase in taxes lowers private saving

(here equal to the private sector financial surplus) and the public sector

financial deficit equally.                Real private financial wealth,                  is constant.

        If we make the velocity of circulation endogenous, the relationship

between changes in the deficit and the rate of inflation may appear to become

ambiguous.         An increase in g - T          might     be offset by a decrease in velocity

sufficiently large to result in a net negative effect on inflation.

        Retaining the assumption that money is the only asset we replace (2) by

                      vJ1:

        For any variable x, (s,t) denotes its value expected, at time t, to prevail

at time s.         We assume that the past and present are known i.e. x(s,t) =                       x(s)
                                                                   -

for s      t.


        Velocity      as a non-decreasing function of the expected rate of inflation does

not,of course,follow inevitably from rational optirnising behaviour.                              The model

of equations (1), (2'), (3) and (4) can be viewed as the continuous time analogue

of the discrete time overlapping generations model in which money is the only

store of value, population grows at a rate n and per—capita endowments are

constant.         The effect of anticipated inflation on the demand for money in such

models is simply the effect on saving of the anticipated real rate of return.

Substitution and income effects pull in opposite directions.

        For most plausible expectations mechanisms, the long run (or steady state)


actual and expected rates of inflation coincide.                     With .   = - we   obtain

If the initial equilibrium is characterised by a deficit (g-T > 0) then an

increase in the deficit-GNP ratio could lower the long—run rate of inflation

if velocity were sufficiently responsive to the expected rate of inflation:

v' > (g-TY1 or ( +              n)           >1 -- a greater than unitary inflation elasticity

of velocity.

        This apparent anomaly, however, can be shown to imply indeterminacy in

the behaviour of the system under rational expectations.

        We can solve (1) and (2') for - as a function of in                        This yields

       c0 is the constant of integration.                 For there to be a unique convergent

forward-looking solution we require x                >0   and c0 =    0.     Since   + n =     (g—t)V,
the condition x    > 0 is equivalent to v'(g—T) < 1.                   From equation (7) we see

that this rules out a negative effect of an increase in the deficit-GNP ratio

on the long-run rate of inflation.

       The change in. the real value of the government's nominal liabilities (only

money is this model) is not a useful indicator of the behaviour of the rate of

inflation, in the short-run or in the long-run.                      The stationary equilibria of

both the constant velocity and variable velocity models have a constant stock

of real money balances per unit of output m; real money balances grow at the

natural rate n.        In the constant velocity model m is the same regardless of

the rate of inflation.

       In the variable vefocity model we know from equation (8) that whenever

expectations of the future are not being revised(i.e. except for those instants

at which 'news' arrives),m(t) and                     are inversely correlated.           Setting C0
equal to zero in (9a) and differentiating we obtain.

The last term on the right-hand—side of (10) and (11) contains the effect of

revisions, at time t, in expectations about the future course of the deficit.

At those instants that news arrives, P may jump discontinuously.                               obviously

"jumps" in the opposite direction.                 On the adjustment path, when no news

arrives the rate of inflation is given by -                = - (A÷n)       while the rate of change

of    real money balances per unit of output is an increasing function of the

deficit-GNP ratio.

        As suggested in the introduction, the "inflation correction" to be

applied to the deficit in order to evaluate its long-run implications for

money growth consists in subtracting from the flow-of-funds measure the

inflation—induced reduction in the real value of the government's interest-

bearing debt only.                The 'nflation ta>? on t1e stock of high-powered money

should not be subtracted.

(2b) Models without government bonds but with private capital

A money-capital model without intrinsically valuable money

        A negative long-run effect on the rate of inflation in response to an increase in

the deficit occurs in the simplest money-capital model.                             denotes the capital

labour ratio, m the stock of real money balances per worker, g real spending

per worker,          lump—sum taxes per worker, s the private savings rate (0 < s <                   1),
and      =   f(i)    (f' >   0,    f' <   0) output per worker.            Money is assumed not to yield

any intrinsic, direct utility so it will be held only if its rate of                         return
equals that obtainable by holding real capital, i.e.

*      This model can be viewed as the continuous time representation of an over-
       lapping generations model with a Cobb-Douglas production function and
       homothetic preferences.   Note that if the constraint f'   0 applies, we
       can never observe an economy with a positive rate of inflation.   Instead
       the price of money falls to zero (p tends to infinity) and the model reduces
       to the familiar one sector Solow-Swan barter model.    Therefore, if money
       is held in the steady state, we have                       <   n.

       Across steady states the rate of inflation moves in the same direction as

the capital labour ratio.                        A lower value of k raises the marginal product of

capital.     To preserve portfolio balance the real rate of return on money

balances has to rise pari—passu.                               This is achieved by a lower rate of inflation.

Note that both spending increases and tax cuts crowd out capital in the long—run,

as does a balanced budget (or constant deficit) increase in spending.

        There is one predetermined variable I and one non-predetermined variable .

For a unique convergent solution to exist, the equilibrium must be a saddle-

point.      The two characteristic roots of the system are A1 =                           sf—n      and A2 =   f'-n.
A1 < 0 and A2 > 0 are necessary and sufficient for (15) to have a saddlepoint

equilibrium with k predetermined.

along the saddlepath SS', the rate of inflation and the stock of real per-

capita money balances are positively related, unlike the variable velocity

model of Section 2a.

        This money-capital model is the only well-known simnic monetary

model to always have larger deficits associated with lower inflation in the

 long-run.      The Sidrauski model analysed next exhibits some ambiguity in the

deficit-inflation relation for the general case.              A standard restriction,

however, results in deficits and inflation being positively related in            the
long-run.

The Sidrauski model

        Consider the rational expectations version of Sidrauski's model of money

and growth (Sidrauski 1967) summarised in equations (17a) -            (17e).

                                     0


The economy-wide constraints are:

(17d)        w = f() -

        c is per-capita consumption,           real per-capita non-human private wealth,

  > 0 the subjective discount rate, w the wage rate, r the rate of return on

capital.      Public spending neither adds to the economy's productive capacity

nor yields intrinsically valued consumption services.               The production function

f(i) is characterised by V > 0 and f" < 0 and satisfies the INADA conditions.

The instantaneous utility function u is strictly concave, twice continuously

differentiable and increasing in c and m.               We also assume that urn u       =
                                                                                    c

urn u (c,m) =
        m
m-'O


        The first-order conditions for an interior optimum are given by the

constraints (17b),(17c) and, after substituting from (17d) and (17e), the

marginal conditions (18a), (18b) and (18c).



(18a)        u((t), (t)) -      uc('(t)                                =0

(18c)        urn u((t), (t))et = 0
             t-+


        To determine the long-run effect on the rate of inflation of an increase in

the (real per-capita) government deficit we differentiate the steady-state

conditions (19a) —    (19d) with respect to            or



(19a)       f'(k) = n +

        The steady—state capital-labour ratio is determined by equation (19a) and

is independent of either the level of public spending or of the level of taxes.

Per-capita          private consumption is independent of the level of taxes but decreases
one-for—one when public spending increases.                           The Sidrauski model has the usual
property that, across steady                       states, an x percentage point increase in the rate

of   growth of the nominal money stock will be associated with an x percentage
point     higher rate of inflation.                     A larger deficit, however, does not necessarily

entail a higher (steady state) proportional rate of growth of money, even in the

very classical Sidrauski model.

        The effects of higher spending and lower taxes on long-run inflation are

given in equations (20a) —                     (20b).

convergent saddlepath is SS.               Starting from an initial equilibrium at E, a

cut in taxes, , (whether anticipated or unanticipated), will have no effect,

short-run or long-run, on                and .

      An unanticipated increase in public spending by an amount dg will immediately

depress consumption by the same amount as the increase in public spending. The

  =   0 locus shifts down vertically by an amount equal to dg. The system remains

at E' afterwards. An anticipated (at t =

t =
      t1 > t) leads to a smaller immediate drop in consumption, to E1, say.
The jump in consumption at t0 places the system on the divergent trajectory

(drawn with reference to E, that will put they system on the unique convergent

trajectory through E' at t1, the moment the increase in public spending actually

takes place.        In Figure 2 that point is E2.                The path of consumption therefore

only has a discontinuity at t =                    the moment that "news" arrives.

        The condition that A3 be positive is equivalent to the condition that the

denominator of (24a), (24b) and (25a), (25b) be negative.                           Given this it is

clear from (24b) that, with separability, a larger real per-capita deficit due

to lower taxes will be associated with a higher rate of inflation and (from(25b))

a lower real per—capita stock of money balances.

     The effect on long-run inflation of larger deficits due to increased

public spending is not quite unambiguous even with Ucm = 0.            A sufficient

condition for higher inflation to result from higher spending is, from (24a)

that the initial rate of inflation is non-negative.

a lower value of     are associated with a lower long-run value of ,          i.e.   with

a higher velocity.     The impact effect on the price level is therefore an

immediate jump up.     The rate of inflation also immediately assumes its new

equilibrium value.     Since    =   (-) — n,          the rate of inflation will be

higher both because g —   T    is larger and because m is smaller.

Output, employment and the real value of the stock of bonds plus the capital
stock grow at the same proportional rate, n.                        The real interest rate is fixed.

The model exhibits one-for-one crowding out of private capital formation by

changes in the real stock of government bonds, at a given real interest rate.

The demand for real per-capita money balances is a non-increasing function of

the expected rate of inflation.                   (38a, b)          technical but not entirely
                                                              pre
innocuous assumptions.               The model has some peculiar features.                  One class of

agents (the poor) hold only money as a store of value.                           A second class of

agents (the rich) hold the bonds and real capital .                       As long as (38b) holds

they will not hold any money.                   This accounts for the absence of real money

balances in (37) and the dependence of money demand on the rate of inflation

rather than the nominal interest rate.                      Bonds and real capital are perfect

substitutes in the portfolios of (rich) private agents.

       Equations (39) and (40) describe the financial rule followed by the

government, i.e. its money vs. bonds financing mix for a given path of

D(t)     G(t) —   T(t).       The rate of growth of the money stock is e up to t =                   t.
The amount of bond—financing for t <                t is     therefore residually determined by the

budgetconstraint., 0(t) and the monetary growth rate.                      After t =    t   the authorities

following a bond financing rule that keeps the                      real per—capita stock of bonds
constant    at the level achieved at t, i.e.                                 -

From time     onwards, growth of the money stock is therefore residually determined

by the budget constraint, 0(t) and the bond—financing rule (41).

       The intuition behind (44) is clear.           Government spending has to be financed

either by explicit taxes, by borrowing or by printing money.              To the extent that

borrowing increases the real stock of per-capita government bonds held by private

agents,it increases the future real per—capita deficit (if the real interest rate

exceeds the natural rate of growth).          If there is a finite upper bound on the

stock of real per—capita bonds that the private sector will hold, (or the public

sector is willing to owe)then once that upper bound is reached, further deficits

have to be financed by money creation.            The point to note is that only nominal

bond issues in excess of the rate of inflation plus the natural rate of growth

times the outstanding stock of bonds (B -          (.- + n)B)   will raise the real per-capita

stock of bonds.        In the flow-of-funds accounts, of which the government budget

constraint is part, debt service is recorded (in real terms) as .                  Inflation

 growth means that ceteris paribus bond demand grows by n -.           Bond issues less

 than (-   - n)B   are associated with a falling stock of real per-capita government

 interest—bearing debt, lower future conventionally measured deficits if r > n

 and, ceteris   paribus   lower future money creation.

       Note also that B <   (- + n)B   means that/there is per-capita "crowding in"

in the Sargent—Wallace model.          From equation (29) it can be seen that real

bonds (changes in the real stock of bonds) "crowd out" real capital (real

capital formation) on a one-for-one basis.          The total rate of accumulation of

capital—cum-real bonds is exogenously given and grows at the natural rate n.

Crowding out takes place not through changes in the real interest rate, which

is constant by assumption, but by channelling private savings into public debt

rather than private capital at a given real interest rate.

       Deficits are a source of concern to policy makers because (a) to the

extent that they are not monetised they are feared to cause crowding out and

(b) to the extent they are monetised they are feared to cause inflation.             To

investigate whether deficits cause crowding out we consider the behaviour of

the real stock of government interest-bearing debt (or the real per-capita

stock of government interest-bearing debt) for a given path of exhaustive

spending G(t) and taxes net of transfers T(t) and for a given path of monetary

growth.     This corresponds to the behaviour of the Sargent-Wallace model for

t <   f.   To determine what the monetary growth rate implied by the fiscal

stance is, we look at the behaviour of monetary growth for given paths of G(t)

and T(t) and for a given value of the real stock of government debt or the real

stock of government debt per-capita.         This corresponds to the behaviour of the

Sargent-Wallace model for t t.

       In the Sargent—Wallace model changes in -- crowd out private capital one—

for-one.    This extreme form of crowding out will not hold in many more plausible
                                                                  -25-




 models.         It seems safe to say, however, that in any model not exhibiting

 non-Ricardian debt neutrality, the change in the real (or real per—capita)

 stock of public sector interest-bearing debt will be the proximate determinant

 and the best single indicator of the change in the degree of aggregate or per

 capita crowding out pressure that the government is bringing to bear on the

 economy.        The proposed crowding out measures are given in (45a, b)

The degree of aggregate or per-capita crowding out depends on the amount of money

financing that is permitted.    A useful benchmark is e.g. a monetary growth

rate consistent (in the long run) with zero inflation:    0 =   n.   Given any rule

for monetary growth, the aggregate and per-capita crowding out implied by the

fiscal stance can be found from (45a) and (45b).     The per capita crowding out

equation (45b) is the proper one for the evaluation of the very long run or

steady state implications of the fiscal sta,pce for crowding out since in the

steady state     must be constant.    In (45b), the conventionally measured deficit

is corrected not only for the effects of inflation and real growth on the

outstanding real per—capita stock of bonds (and on the demand for bonds

by private agents) but also for any monetisation permitted by the authorities.

It is obvious that in any given period in which the conventionally measured

deficit is large because of a high current rate of inflation and high nominal

interest rates, the inflation-and—growth-corrected deficit may well be

significantly smaller: the deficit is a monetary phenomenon; its elimination

requires a monetary, not a fiscal ,   correction.
       Similar conclusions can be drawn as regards the implications of the fiscal

stance and the conventionally measured deficit for monetary growth in the long

run.     Equations (46a) and (46b) show what the spending and tax programmes imply

for monetary growth if bond financing is conducted in such a way as to neither

raise nor reduce the crowding out pressure (aggregate or per-capita) exercised

by the government.

       The real (per-capita) stock of bonds that the authorities (39) aim to keep

constant need not be the historically inherited one.      It could be a target

stock to be achieved at some future date.      The deficit measure relevant for

eventual monetisation is the conventionally measured deficit corrected for the

effect of inflation on the real value of the outstanding stock of bonds and

(in the case of (46b)) for the effect of real growth.     Current high inflation

may make the current deficit (and the current deficit-GNP ratio) high because
                                                  -27—




     of its effect on nominal interest rates.              If the inflation—corrected deficit

     is nevertheless negative, this means that, if the authorities were to stick to

     their spending and taxation programmes (as a proportion of GNP) and if they

     were to keep the degree of aggregate crowding out (--)            constant,        they would

     henceforth have a negative rate of monetary growth and therefore, in due course,

     a negative rate of inflation.      In other words, an inflation-and-growth-

     corrected budget surplus means that, whatever the current conventionally

     measured deficit may be (i.e. regardless of the current inflation premium in

     nominal interest rates), a negative rate of monetary growth would result if

     the government simply froze its spending and taxation programme as a proportion

 of GNP and used bond-financing to keep the bond-(trend)GNP ratio constant.

 (3b)      Does tighter money now mean higher inflation in the future?

         Sargent and Wallace obtained the prima facie paradoxical result that tighter

money early on (a lower value of S          for   t <      ) may   imply a higher rate of growth

of money (and a higher rate of inflation) later on (for t                     ).         Specifically,
when        =    0, a lower value of e (and thus a lower rate of inflation) for t <

always implies a higher rate of growth of money (and thus a higher rate of inflation)
for t       €.    Below I argue that when         >    0 a lower value of 0       for    t <   t   need not

necessarily imply a higher rate of growth of the money supply for t .                                 When

it     does however, it   is   possible that a lower value of 0         for   t   < t implies        a

higher     rate of inflation not only for t E but also for t < t.                        Current
inflation, when 2 0, depends on the entire anticipated future path of the
money supply.         The higher later rates of money growth may, for certain parameter
configurations,       dominate the lower earlier rates of growth of money as regards

their effect on the price level and the rate of inflation for t <                       t.
        Consider first the case where         =       0.    From (43),_the rate of inflation

       Equations (47) and (49) together imply that tighter money now (which with
  = 0
      means lower inflation now) means looser money and higher inflation later,

if there are no changes in the spending, tax and transfer programmes.

       When we consider the more general case in which the demand for money is

a decreasing function of the expected rate of inflation                                         >   0 in equation

(33)) the analysis becomes quite a bit more involved.                                   It is still the case

       The price level is now, however, a 'forward-looking" variable whose value

is given by

If t(t) o(t) is constant for all t , there                                              exists a steady state

       For this to make sense the roots should of course be real.                                             In addition

we also assume that the authorities will always choose the lower of the two

 From (52') it follows that the inflation rate for                                             t     E   is   again an increasing
 function of                since

It no longer follows necessarily, however, that a lower value of 6 for t <                                                          t

implies a higher value of                                    .       Let                             b(t).        For simplicity
                                              P(t)L()

we assume in what follows that bonds are index-linked.                                                   Jumps in p will
therefore not affect b.

from (54).      Given --, a lower value of e raises b.                                        is endogenous, however;

may imply higher inflation now and in the future has its counterpart in the

possibility that tighter money now many imply lower inflation now and in the

      An unanticipated permanent reduction in the rate of monetary growth to

01 < 00 raises the long-run real per-capita stock of money balances to E1                                say,

and shifts the AA locus to A'A'.               The price level falls immediately as the

economy moves instantaneously from E0 to E1 and stays there.                          The rate of

inflation falls immediately from 00 - n to 81 - n.                        A previously unanticipated

future permanent increase in the rate of monetary growth to 02 >                               at t =

results   in an immediate increase in the price level (at t = 0) which places the

system in Figure 4 somewhere on AA between E0 and E02, say at E01.                              From there

it moves gradually along AA towards E02, where it arrives at t =                          t   when the

rate of monetary growth is actually increased.                  At t =       t   the system jumps from

E02 to E2.
                 Neither P nor        jump at t = E.            At   t = 0 the rate of inflation

jumps up to (•)        .    After   that it continues to increase gradually to 02 —
                  01

E01 will be closer to E02 the closer the implementation date (t) is to the

announcement date (0)

     The Sargent-Wallace paradox can be represented as a previously unanticipated

immediate temporary reduction in                 (for 0     t    <   t)   followed by


future permanent increase in               at t = E beyond its original value.                     This is

depicted in Figure :           Up to t.= 0, the system is at E0 with the rate of

inflation given by (--) .    At t = 0 the system jumps onto A'A' to a position
                       0
such as     or E01 '.    From t = 0 to t =          t the
                                                 system moves smoothly along A'A'

to E02 where it arrives when t =          t.     At t =   t the system moves to E2.
     It is clear that it is possible for the rate of inflation at t                              0 to rise

in spite of the temporary reduction in monetary growth.                          If the system were to

move to E01 ',   the   rate of inflation at t = 0 jumps to (-)     : the rate     > (-)

Since at         the price level is also above its value at E0, the price level

path is also higher throughout.                 it is also clear that even if the temporary

 reduction in money growth is followed by a rate of monetary growth that is

 higher than the initial rate, the impact effect on the price level and the

rate of inflation may well be negative.                   A move to E01 at t = 0 would generate

this outcome.

        In the extreme non-Sargent-Wallace case, an initial reduction in money

growth (oi < eo) is followed, after t =                 t by   a rate of monetary growth that also

lies below o, though not necessarily below                          The case where       >        >
                                                            o.                               02
is    depicted in Figure 6.        Here the systems jump at t = 0 to E01 on the (divergent)

solution path corresponding to                       It then moves smoothly between t = 0 and
                                          01.
t =      along OA' towards E02.           At t =        it jumps from E02 to E2.       Both the

price level and the rate of inflation decline at t = 0 and both stay throughout

below what they would have been in the absence of the policy change.

        In the remaining sections of the paper we return to the constant velocity

case with 2 =


(3c)     An endogenous real interest rate

        The analysis is not affected significantly if we endogenise the real

interest rate by postulating an inverse relationship between the real interest

rate and the capital-labour ratio, i.e. (35) becomes

(I /              -- r IK(tfl                   r   <
                       L(t

        From (37) we know that once                 is held constant,     will also be constant.


Indeed since K(t) =     ent     [K(o) +   B(0)] —              we can rewrite (35') as

The    effect of a larger stock of real public debt per-capita on the rate of
inflation for t                  t is given by

Thus a higher value of b(t) raises inflation for t                                            by more when r is endogenous

than when r is exogenous.                              To determine what happens to b(t) when e is lowered

we specialise (35") to the linear function

For t <   f, the rate of change of b is governed by
              b(t) = o(t)                 -            + (r-n)b
or

(61)          (t) = o(t)                  -            + b(t)2

       We shall consider the case where o(t) = ó.                                      The graph of equation (61)

b2 in Figure 7a.                  We believe it to be more in the spirit of the Sargent and

we note that when the interest rate rises linearly with b, the growth of b is so

strong that it tends to infinity in finite time.                                    With tan(z)      0 by assumption,

o    b(t)   will be negative provided the initial stock of bonds, b(O) is not too

large.        In this sense, the conclusion of Sargent and Wallace that a lower rate

of growth of money for 0                     t <   t raises     b(t) (and raises inflation for t                 T)

remains valid in the constant velocity model when the real interest rate is

endogenised in the manner suggested above.

(3d) Public Sector Capital Formation

           If public sector expenditure on goods and services is not merely of the

hole-in-the-ground public consumption variety, the monetary implications of

the deficit can only be accurately assessed by making a correction for net

public sector capital formation.                        Let        denote public sector consumption,

      public sector capital formation, K6 the public sector capital stock,
                                                 -44-



      the private sector capital stock and rG the real rate of return on public

    sector capital.        We only consider the case where both rG and the rate of

    return on private capital, r, are exogenous.               Government bonds still yield

 the same expected real rate of return as can be earned from the ownership of

 capital .        We   assume that the government appropriate the return on its capital

 stoc'k, rGKG.

         The budget constraint is now                   /


 (66).        M+BGCGIiBGG
        Extending the Sargent-Wallace policy rules we now assume that for t


 both       and        are kept constant, i.e.          =   (n +   •-) j- and              = n KG.


The rate of inflation in t              is now given by

                                                                                                         *

                                                     Y(T)                                 K)]

        If the rate of return from government capital formation rG, equals the

marginal cost of borrowing r, the measure of the deficit relevant for inflation

is the "inflationandgrowthcorrected", government current account or

consumption account deficit.           Net capital formation by the public sector in

the long-run creates income equal, in present value, to the cost of borrowing

incurred to finance such expenditure.             There are no long-run inflationary

implications of such expenditures.           Obvious adjustments have to be made if the

rate of return on public capital exceeds or falls short of the cost of borrowing

The use even of the inflation-and-growth corrected deficit                                -f (r-n)
to infer the long-run inflationary implications of the fiscal stance amounts to

assuming, implicitly, that rG= 0 for new public sector investment i.e. that

additional public sector capital formation is entirely unproductive.

(private   plus public) capital formation will of course be invariant under bond-
financed increases in public sector capital formation.
(3e) Cyclical corrections
       A common feature of the tax-transfer structure in most industrialised

courtries is the dependence of net tax receipts on the current level of

economic activity, Y.             A simple linear tax function without an intercept

will suffice for our purposes.

We continue to treat public expenditure on goods and services as exogenous:

it is assumed to grow at the natural rate of growth, n.                 Trend output is

denoted by Y(t) =         L(t).
       If output is subject to cyclical fluctuations around a trend, then G(t)T)(t)

is likely to give a misleading impression of the long-run inflationary

implications and the crowding out consequences of the fiscal stance whenever

output deviates from its trend level.                  Note that it is not necessary to

identify such cycles in the level of economic activity with "Keynesian"

deviations of actual from full employment output.                  For present purposes they

might as well represent serially correlated movements in the "natural1' or full

employment level of output.             Quite separate issues arise when past, current

and prospective future fiscal and monetary policy actions themselves contribute

to endogenous cyclical movements in the level of economic activity. E.g. the

issues raised by Blinder and Solow (1973), concerning the appropriate

"multiplier" weights to be attached to the various fiscal instruments, are not

germane to the point made here.

       Consider again a policy regime which fixes the rate of growth of the

nominal stock of money, e, up to t =               , financing   any resulting deficit (given

the parameters of the expenditure and tax functions, g =

borrowing.      After t = E the real per capita stock of government interest-bearing

debt is held constant.             Equations (69) and (70) are not model—specific:

implications    of the fiscal stance for inflation in the long-run are similarly

obtained by evaluating (70') at V = V.            "Cyclical corrections" are therefore

merely a convenient procedure for estimating the trend or permanent deficit.

If departures from trend output are not of a regular cyclical nature and if

upward and downward deviations from trend do not tend to balance each other

out, the convenient short-hand measure of the permanent deficit obtained by

evaluating the deficit at Y(t) =      V(t)   will be inappropriate.               Explicit

estimates of the future expected paths of the deficit will have to be made

instead.

         If we take a Keynesian view of business cycles, and model output as

demand-determined, the endogeneity of            creates the danger that mistaken

inferences concerning the fiscal stance will lead to destabilising "corrective"

fiscal actions.         (This requires us to drop the assumption of a constant

velocity, which would deprive fiscal policy (changes in g and t1) of any

short-run impact on effective demand).            Clearly if

a small-inflation-and-growth-corrected, cyclically adjusted government current

public spending or increases in tax rates that lower the level of effective

that maintaining the fiscal stance (or even reducing t1 and/or raising g) would

between conventionally measured public sector financial deficits, crowding out
