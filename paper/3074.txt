             CONSISTENT VALUATION AND COST OF CAPITAL EXPRESSIONS
                       WITH CORPORATE AND PERSONAL TAXES


                                   ABSTRACT

     This paper examines three valuation methods, each of which should lead to
the same value for a given asset. These are the Adjusted Present Value,
Adjusted Discount Rate and Flows to Equity methods. To achieve identical
valuations, however, the different methods must be implemented with cost of
capital expressions that embody a consistent set of assumptions about (1) the
tax regime and (2) the time pattern and riskiness of debt tax shields.
Valuation and cost of capital expressions that have been proposed in the
literature are grouped and contrasted according to these assumptions. It is
also shown that the familiar weighted average cost of capital can be consistent
with any such set of assumptions, as long as the correct expression is used to
estimate the relationship between the levered and unlevered cost of equity.

         The interaction between financing and investment is a classic problem in the
 valuation of firms and assets. If financing affects value, then an accurate estimate of

 value must take the financing mix into account. Recognition of this problem has in turn

 spawned a variety of methods for estimating asset value and the cost of capital, most of

 them focusing on the tax effects of financing.

         This paper examines three basic valuation methods, each of which should lead to

 the same value for a given asset. These are the Adjusted Present Value, Adjusted Discount

 Rate and Flows to Equity methods. However, each method relies on a different cost of

 capital measure and incorporates the tax effects of financing in a different way. To

 achieve identical results, therefore, the different methods must be implemented with

 cost of capital expressions that embody a consistent set of assumptions.

        The purpose of this paper is to group the different cost of capital expressions that

 have appeared in the literature according to consistent sets of assumptions. Specifically,

 it is shown that existing cost of capital formulas can be separated into six groups,

depending on which of two tax regimes is assumed and which of three assumptions is

made about the riskiness and time pattern of debt tax shields.' As long as the analyst

works within one of these six groups, consistent results will be achieved using any of the
three valuation methods.

        The three valuation methods are described in more detail in Section I. Section Il

considers valuation with corporate but no personal taxes. The case in which a perpetual

firm has a known, constant amount of debt outstanding is considered first, since this is

the case that has been most frequently analyzed in the literature, It is then contrasted

with the case in which future debt levels are uncertain. In Section III, personal taxes are

introduced, and the equilibrium relationships between after-tax market rates of return

are described. Cost of capital expressions are then derived under three different
                                             2


assumptions about the risk of future debt tax shields. The results are summarized, and

conclusions are drawn in Section IV.



l.Three Valuation Methods

       The three basic approaches to the valuation of companies or corporate assets each

seek to discount after-corporate-tax cash flows at pre-investor-tax discount rates. The

first of these is Myers'(l 974) Adjusted Present Value, or APV method, the essence of

which is to estimate value in two steps. First, a base-case value, under the assumption

of 100% equity financing, is computed and then the costs and benefits of the actual

financing package are added separately. The base-case value is calculated by discounting
the asset's expected after-corporate-tax operating cash flows, C,,, for each period n at an

all-equity, or unlevered discount rate, r.2 The appropriate discount rate for any

additional terms, which involve financing costs or benefits, remains to be determined

below, but in most applications the cost of debt has been used.

       The second approach is the Adjusted Discount Rate, or ADR method. Here, expected
operating cash flows, C,,, are discounted at a rate that reflects the asset's financing

combination. Both the APV and ADA methods thus discount the same cash flows, but they

adjust for financing in different ways. Under the APV method, the adjustment occurs in

one or more separate discounted cash flow terms, while under the ADR method, the

adjustment occurs entirely in the rate that is used to discount the operating cash flow

stream.

       The third approach is the Flows to Equity, or FTE method. Here, the equity value

rather than the total value of the asset is calculated by discounting cash flows to the

equityholders at a cost of equity capital. The cash flows are calculated by subtracting any

after-corporate-tax financing charges, such as interest or lease payments, from the
all-equity cash flows, C,,, and thus they represent actual cash flows to shareholders. By
                                              3



contrast, the cash flows used under the other two methods are hypothetical cash flows

that the shareholders would receive if the asset were entirely equity-financed.

        Under different circumstances, it might be more convenient to choose one of these

valuation methods over the others.3 Nevertheless, all three are based on the same

underlying theory of the valuation process, and if properly used, all three should yield
identical results. We turn next to the issue of which cost of capital expressions are

needed to ensure consistency across valuation methods.

        A limitation of the analysis, which should be noted at the outset, is that all debt is

assumed free of default risk. This assumption is made in part to maintain comparability

with the bulk of the literature and in part to avoid unnecessary complexity. It does

imply, however, that tax factors are the only effect of capital structure to be

incorporated, while factors such as bankruptcy, agency and information costs are

ignored. Some of the consequences of risky debt have been analyzed by Conine (1980),

Myers and Ruback (1988), Sick (1988), and Yagil (1982).


II. Valuation With Coroorate But No Personal Taxes

        A. The Case of Constant. PerDetual Debt

       The most familiar cost of capital expressions have been derived under the
following assumptions: (1) corporations pay taxes at the rate T; (2) there are no

personal taxes; (3) the amount of corporate debt financing is known and constant
forever; (4) the firm's debt is free of default risk, so its cost of debt is rfD, the

required rate of return on riskless debt; and (5) the firm's expected operating cash
flows are constant forever, so that C — C for each period n. All of the notation used in

this case and in the remainder of the paper is summarized in Table I.

       Under these assumptions, the cost of capital and valuation expressions shown in

Panel A of Table II have been derived numerous times in the literature (e.g., Hamada

(1969), Modigliani and Miller (1963), Rubinstein (1973), Taggart (1977)) and
                                            4


have been shown to give consistent results (Ashton and Atkins (1978), Chambers,

Harris and Pringle (1982), Lewellen and Emery (1986), Myers (1974)). Equation
(Al) embodies the Adjusted Present Value idea, in which the base-case value, C/r, is
adjusted for the present value of the debt tax shield, TD. If, for example, C — 100, r =

.2, D — 200 and T .34, V 568. The same value can be obtained under the Adjusted

Discount Rate method by discounting C using either of the expressions for r. With DN

—   .352, Equation (A3), sometimes referred to as the MM formula, yields r*          .176, and
C/r — 568. Alternatively, if tfD — .10, equation (A4) can be used to give rE = .236.

This value can in turn be used with Equation (A2), the weighted average cost of capital,

to give r = .176 and V 568. The cost of equity can also be estimated using the capital
asset pricing model (CAPM) approach, as in (A5). If we assume rm         .15, then      = 2.0

is consistent with r   .20. Equation (AS) then implies L 2.72, and from (A5), rE

.236. Finally, under the Flows to Equity approach, equity value can be estimated directly
by discounting the cash flows to the equityholders at the cost of equity, rE. The cash flows
to equityholders are equal to (C - rfD(l -Ta) D) the after-tax operating cash flows

minus the after-tax debt service. Discounting these cash flows, which equal 86.8 per
year, at rE gives E — 368.

        The example illustrates that each of the three valuation methods yields consistent

results using the cost of capital expressions in Panel A. The list of assumptions needed to

ensure consistency is, of course, quite restrictive. In particular, since the operating

cash flow stream is a level perpetuity and the amount of debt outstanding is constant,

firm value also remains constant through time. This implies that the debt-to-value ratio

is also constant, and thus it is immaterial whether debt is specified in dollar terms, as

in (Al), or in ratio terms, as in (A2), (A3), (A4) and (A6). For an asset with a finite
life, on the other hand, this distinction becomes important, since debt can no longer be

constant both in dollar terms and as a fraction of asset value. This is the case considered

by Miles and EzzelI (1980,1985).
                                             5


       B. The Mites-Ezzell Analysis

       Miles and Ezzell (1980) started with the premise that the firm maintains a

constant debt-to-value ratio. If current firm value is observable, the current debt level

is known arid, In the absence of default risk, the Interest tax shield at the end of the first

period is also known with certainty, since it is based on the current debt level. Thus it is
justifiable to discount the first period's interest tax shield at rfD, the risk-free debt

rate. Miles and Ezzell argued, however, that future firm values, and hence future debt

levels, are currently uncertain. If the firm maintains a constant debt-to-value ratio,

future firm value will be perfectly correlated with the value of the operating cash flow

stream. Therefore, they reasoned, all interest tax shields beyond the first period should

be discounted at r, the unlevered cost of capital.

        Based on this reasoning, Miles and Ezzell (1980,1985) derived the set of

valuation and cost of capital expressions that appear in Panel C of Table II. Unlike the set

of expressions in Panel A, the Miles-Ezzell expressions give consistent results for both

perpetual and finite-lived assets. However, because of their different assumption about

the risk of debt tax shields, these results will, In general, differ from those derived

from Panel A, even in the perpetuity case.

       Consider the numerical example of Section HA., in which C-i 00 (forever), r —
.20, T — .34, ON — .352, r0 .10, r .15 and                 2.0. Using the Adjusted

Discount Rate method and Equation (C3) gives r — .187 and V — 534.9. Or, using (C4)
and (C2), tE — .253 and again r* — .187. Or, using (C 6) and (C5), L — 3.05 and again

rE — .253. Thus the expressions in Panel C yield results that are internally consistent

but different from those derived from Panel A.5 For the perpetuity case, the same

results would be obtained from both panels only if all cash flows were riskiess.

       The essential distinction between the Miles-Ezzell approach and the approach

embodied in Panel A is the assumed time pattern and riskiness of the debt tax shields.

Under the Miles-Ezzell approach, the debt-to-value ratio is held constant, so the risk of
                                             6


the debt tax shields depends on the risk of firm value itself. Miles and Ezzell argue that

this risk is captured by r, the unlevered cost of capital. However, in the special case

where the expected operating cash flow stream is a level perpetuity, the individual cash

flows are risky but firm value is not. Each period's cash flow realization provides no

new information about future firm value. Thus the approach in Panel A, which treats the

dollar amount of debt as fixed and the interest tax shields from this debt as riskiess, may

seem more natural in this special case. In contrast, Miles-Ezzell is the more natural

approach when each period's cash flow realization resolves some uncertainty about

future firm value. In that case, future firm value is uncertain, and if a constant debt-

to-value ratio is to be maintained, the actual amounts of debt and hence the future

interest tax shields become known only as this uncertainty is resolved.

       Another point that emerges from contrasting Panels A and C is the role of the

weighted average cost of capital, which can be used under either valuation regime. In
effect, the market's valuation of debt tax shields Is captured in the cost of equity, rE. If

the cost of equity is estimated in a way that correctly reflects investors' assumptions

about the risk of the debt tax shields, whatever those assumptions may be, the weighted

average cost of capital will yield a valid adjusted discount rate.



Ill. Valuation With Corporate and Personal Taxes

       A. After-Tax Rate of Return Relationships

       When personal taxes are introduced, greater care must be taken in specifying

investors' required returns. Required rates of return are often analyzed on a pre-tax

basis, since these are more easily observable than after-tax returns. Nevertheless, it is

after-tax returns that ultimately interest investors, and these will drive the

equilibrium return relationships. It is useful to note at the outset, in fact, two such

relationships that govern the pricing of debt and equity securities in this tax regime.
                                            7



        In the remainder of this section, it is assumed that all investors pay taxes on
income from debt securities at the rate T and on income from equity securities at the

rate TPE.6 For simplicity, it is assumed that all investors are subject to the same tax

rates. In equilibrium, debt and equity securities of comparable risk must offer

investors identical after-tax returns, since otherwise, investors would be motivated to

rearrange their portfolios. In particular, suppose we have a risk-free debt security
offering a pre-tax return per period of rfD and a risk-free equity security offering a
pre-tax return per period of nE.7 These returns will be set in the market so that:



                              rfD( 1 - T) rfE( 1 - TPE).                                   (1)



        More generally, a tax-adjusted Capital Asset Pricing Model can be derived, as in

Brennan (1970) and Gordon and Malkiel (1981), which characterizes the equilibrium

after-tax returns on securities of both different risk and different tax treatment.

Suppose, for example, that all risky assets are in the form of equity and that the
expected pre-tax return to investors from the overall market portfolio of equities is rm.

Let 1Ej denote investors' pre-tax return on firm i's equity. It can then be shown that, in

equilibrium ,8


        rEJ(l - TPE) - rfD(l - T) — j[rm(1 TPE) - rfD(l - Ip)]                            (2)



where     is the usual measure of systematic risk. Using (1), the after-tax CAPM can

also be expressed more simply as



                              rEJ — tIE + j(rm - tIE).                                    (3)
                                            8


       B. Valuation Under the APV Aporoach

       Consider first the Adjusted Present Value approach to corporate valuation in this

tax regime. For the sake of generality, we analyze a finite-lived asset, treating

perpetuities later as a special case. Starting at the end of the valuation horizon and

working backward toward the present, suppose that the firm will pay a liquidating

dMdend to its shareholders at time N. This dividend consists of the after-corporate-tax
operating cash flow, CN, minus the after-corporate-tax payment of interest and

principal on its beginning-of-period debt, DN.i. Since the personal tax on equity income

is levied against dividends plus capital 9iD.a. the beginning-of-period equity value,
EN.l, serves as a personal tax shield.

       If we follow the certainty-equivalent approach, as used by Sick (1988), letting
CEQN denote the pre-personal-tax certainty-equivalent of CN, then the value of the

firm's equity and debt at N-i can be expressed as:



       EN..l — I                   EQ-r(1 -Tc)DN1-DN.1)(l-TpE)+TpEEN1]                   (4)
                   +rfE(l .TPE)[


       DN..l                                                                             (5)
               1 +rfD(i T)[rfD(1-TP)DN.l+DN.l]


       Noting from (i) that the two discount rates must be the same in equilibrium, we
can combine (4) and (5) to determine VN..l EN1 + DN1:



       VN1((iTPE) + rfE(1-TPE)) a

                                                   (1-T )(1-T E)
               CEQN1(1-TPE) + r,o(1-Tp)[1 -                                              (6)
                                                                      ]D1.
                                                      9


 The expression In square brackets will be recognized as Millers (1977) GL, the net tax

advantage to corporate debt. DMding both sides of (6) by (1 - TPE)(l + rfE) and using

(1) then yields


                          _______ + rfEGLDNI
               VN1 — 1                        1 + rf E                                   (7)
                                + rf E


We can iterate backward in similar fashion, but first an assumption must be made about

whether future debt levels are certain or uncertain. If we assume, as has typically been

done under the APV approach, that all future debt levels are known, it can be shown that

for any period t9



       v—     'S'                        +
                                                      rfTD1

        The first term in (8) represents the firm's base-case value, or the value it

would have if it were entirely equity-financed, while the second term represents the net

tax benefit from corporate debt. In cases for which risk-adjusted discount rates are

appropriate, (8) can also be written in the more familiar form1 0



                    -                          +
                                                          rGD1                           (9)
                        n.t+1

                                                         + rfE)


       In either form, it is important to notice that the second term, the tax benefit

from debt, involves the risk-free equity rate, not the risk-free debt rate. This term is
best thought of as the present value of an annual financing subsidy. As in Brealey and

Myers (1988), for example, the value of a financing subsidy can be calculated as the
                                                10


present value of the annual difference between unsubsidized and subsidized debt service

charges (after corporate taxes), discounted at the unsubsidized market rate (also after-

corporate-tax). In similar fashions if we let S represent the second term in (9), then
(1) plus the definition of         from Table 1 can be used to write S as:



                                       - rfD(l - Tc)}Dn.i
                S— .7                                          .                      (10)
                      n.t+ 1
                               1
                                         (1 + rfE)


In words, a firm could in principle choose between two types of risk-free securities. It
could issue risk-free equity at the rate rfE, or it could issue debt at the tax-subsidized

rate rfD(l - T)• The net advantage to debt is simply the present value of this

opportunity cost saving.1 1

        It should also be noted that the APV approach does not require the assumption that
all future debt levels are known. If they are subject to some uncertainty, DNI in (8)

can simply be replaced by the certainty-equivalent debt level. More generally, if the

debt itself is subject to default risk, Sick (1988) has shown that the numerator of the

second set of terms in (8) can be replaced with the certainty-equivalent interest

payments on the risky debt. Alternatively, if we assume a constant debt-to-value ratio,

as in Miles and Ezzell (1980) or Myers and Ruback (1988), future debt tax shields

take on the risk characteristics of the firm as a whole. While the APV method is often

associated with the assumption of riskless interest tax shields, then, the basic approach

can easily accommodate more general assumptions.

          C. The Adjusted Discount Rate Approach

          The Adjusted Discount Rate method seeks a discount rate, r, such that, at any
time t,

                                N
                                            cn
                                                                                    (11)
                        Vt
                               n=I+1
                                       (1 + r)

The specific form of r* depends on what assumption we make about the time pattern and

risk of future debt tax shields.

          We can derive one ADA expression for the overall cost of capital by first writing

(7) as

                                       CN        rfEGLDN..1
                        VN.i — 1       + r + 1 + nE                                 (12)


If we further assume, as Miles and Ezzell did, that the ratio of debt to firm value is a

constant, (D/V), we can express (12) as



                        VN1 —                                        .              (13)
                                   (1 + r)(1 + rfE(l - GL(r)))
                                                 (1 + rfE)


We can then iterate backward. For example, VN2 is equal to the sum of the values as of

time N-2 of three terms: CN.l, the net tax advantage of interest paid at time N-i , and

VN1. This raises the question, however, of what discount rate to apply to VN..l. Under
                                           12


the Miles and Ezzell argument, the unlevered cost of capital, r, should be used, in which

case backward iteration of (13) yields, for any time t:

                    N
                                      cn
       V                                                  .                         (14)

                                  (1 +rfE)            J




The expression in square brackets in the denominator plays the role of one plus the

adjusted discount rate. Setting the term in square brackets equal to (1 + r) and solving

for r* gives:


                r
                              (DV1 + r
                                                                                    (15)
                    r-rfEGLIy,(l +      rfE)


which is the analogue to Miles and Ezzelrs cost of capital expression, generalized to

include both corporate and personal taxes. Note that, as in the APV approach discussed

above, it is the risk-free equity rate, not the risk-free debt rate that appears in the

expression.
       The preceding analysis, which is summarized in Equations (Dl) and (D3) of

Table II, is based on the assumption that the nearest interest tax shield is risk-free

while all other future tax shields are risky. A second formulation for r* can be derived

if we assume instead that all future interest tax shields are risk-free. As in the regime

that includes only corporate taxes, there is no general Adjusted Discount Rate expression

that is applicable for finite asset lives under this assumption alone. However, if we add

the assumption that the operating cash flow stream is a level perpetuity, the Adjusted

Present Value expression in (9) reduces to Equation (Bi) in Table II. Equation (Bi) can

in turn be solved to yield the Adjusted Discount Rate formula in Equation (B3) which is
                                            13


the analogue to the MM formula (A3) when personal as well as corporate taxes are

relevant.

        A third formulation for r results if we go to the opposite extreme and assume

that all future interest tax shields, Including the nearest one, are risky. In this case, the
second term in (12) is discounted at r, rather than rfE, and the backward iteration

process results in Equations (Fl) and (F3) in Table 11.12 Myers and Ruback (1988)

use a continuous capital structure rebalancing assumption to justify discounting all
interest tax shields at r, and they derive an adjusted discount rate that is algebraically

equivalent to (F3). Sick (1988) has also shown that (F3) is the limiting case of (03)
as we move to continuous-time discounting.

        Finally, we can derive a fourth formulation for r by starting with a risk-
adjusted discount version of (4):


                             CN - rfD(l-TC)DN1 - 0N-1
               EN.l —                  1 + rE                  .                    (16)


Multiplying through by (1 + rE) and solving for VN..l — EN..l + D..1 gives



               V1                 N-1                    DNI
                                                                       .            (17)
                       I + rE(V)+ rfD(1-TC)(V)

If the financing ratios are constant, we can iterate backward in similar fashion to obtain
the value of the firm at any time t:

                       N
                                           cn
               V1.           I         E             0
                                                                   .                (18)
                     n.t+1
                                 + rE+ rto(l-T)
                                            14



       This shows that the weighted average cost of capital is still a valid risk-adjusted

discount rate when there are both corporate and personal taxes. Furthermore, the

development of (18) did not rest on any specific assumption about the risk of interest

tax shields, and hence it is consistent with any of the three assumptions made above. The

weighted average cost of capital thus appears in each of Panels B, D and F in Table II (see

(B2), (D2) and (F2)).
       D. The Flows to Equity Approach

       An estimate of the cost of equity is needed to implement the Flows to Equity

method. The relationship between the levered and unlevered cost of equity in turn

depends on the valuation of the interest tax shields. Hence, each of the three assumptions

used in the preceding section leads to a different relationship. The three relationships

are found by setting (B2) equal to (B3), (D2) equal to (03) and (F2) equal to (F3),
respectively, and solving for rE. The resulting expressions are shown in Table II as

(B4), (D4) and (F4).13 In general, the less risky the interest tax shields are perceived

to be by investors, the smaller is the required premium for financial leverage and the
less steeply sloped is the relationship between rE and (DIE). Hence Equation (B4) has

the flattest slope and (F4) the steepest.

       Alternatively, the cost of equity could be estimated using the CAPM, as in (B5),

(D5) and (F5). It Is important to note, however, that an after-tax CAPM must be used,

not the pre-tax CAPM that appears in (A5), (C5) and (E5). This is because all of the

valuation relationships, starting with (5), are based on investor cash flows and rates of

return after all taxes. Writing the after-tax CAPM equation for a levered firm
(rE   rfE + L(rm-rfE)) and an unlevered firm (r — rfE + u(rm-rfE)), and

substituting in (B4), (04) and (F4), respectively, gives the relationship between
levered and unlevered betas for each of the three assumptions about the risk of interest

tax shields. These are shown in Equations (B6), (D6) and (F6). As in the relationships
                                             15


between rE and r, the levered beta increases more steeply with the debt-equity ratio the

riskier are the interest tax shields.
        E. The Key to Consistent Valuation

        The results of Sections ILB, C and D all lead in the same direction. Starting with

any of the three valuation methods, we branch out into Panels B, D or F depending on

whether future debt tax shields are assumed to be (1) riskless in perpetuity, (2) risky

after the first future period, or (3) risky for all future periods. Given the tax regime,
the choice of one of these three assumptions fixes the relationships between the
unlevered cost of capital, r, the overall cost of capital, r*, and the cost of equity, rE.

Hence, each of the three valuation methods will produce identical results as long as we

use cost of capital expressions from a given panel in Table II. If expressions from

different panels are used simultaneously, on the other hand, these will embody

conflicting assumptions about (1) the tax regime and (2) the time pattern and riskiness
of future debt tax shields. In that event, inconsistent valuations will arise.
        F. A Numencal Example

       The assumed parameter values in Table Ill can be used to construct a numerical

example. The valuation horizon in this example is limited to 10 periods, and both

corporate and personal taxes are assumed to affect corporate valuation.

       Suppose we assume that the Miles-Ezzell (1980) analysis best reflects the

riskiness of interest tax shields. In that case, the set of equations in Panel D of Table II

should be used. Using Equation (D3), r* — .1408. Discounting 10 periods worth of

after-corporate-tax operating cash flows at this rate then gives an estimate of total firm
value of 520.03. Alternatively, (D4) could be used to estimate rE — .19064, and when

this value of rE is substituted into the weighted average cost of capital (D2), the result

is r* — .1408. Or if (06) is used to estimate a levered beta of 1.6533, (D5) gives an
estimate for rE of .19064. Thus, the cost of capital expressions in Panel D give

internally consistent results.
                                          16


       Different approaches to valuation can also be tried. Under the Flows to Equity

method, the period-by-period cash flows to the equityholders must be calculated, and

this requires a schedule of after-corporate-tax debt service charges. If the Adjusted

Discount Rate approach is used to calculate a period-by-period schedule of firm values,
as in column (2) of Table IV, each period t's debt is just .4V, as shown in column (3).

Given rfl) and T, the after-tax debt service can be calculated as In column (4), and this

gives the cash flows to equityholders shown in column (5). Discounting the flows in
column (5) at rE — .19064 gives an estimate of the firm's initial equity value of

312.01. Adding this to the initial debt value of 208.01 then gives and estimate of total

firm value at time 0 of 520.02.

       Finally, the Adjusted Present Value approach, as embodied in Equation (Dl),
could have been used. This requires a schedule of effective interest tax shields

(r1EGLD), as calculated in column (6) of Table IV. Then, iterating backward using

Equation (Dl) successively, the time 0 value of the firm is estimated to be 520.03.

Hence the three major approaches to valuation also give consistent results, as long as

they are implemented using consistent cost of capital expressions and consistent

assumptions about the time pattern of outstanding debt.

       G. Spedal Cases

       The preceding discussion shows how the analyst can achieve consistent valuation

by choosing the appropriate panel in Table II and working within that panel. It does not,

unfortunately, say how the appropriate panel should be chosen, nor how the inputs

needed to work within that panel should be estimated. It should be relatively easy to

determine whether the level perpetuity case of Panels A and B is appropriate, but as

Hamada and Scholes (1985) point out, it may not be obvious which of the two tax

regimes is the more relevant. Moreover, if personal taxes are included in the analysis,
unobservable magnitudes such as the net tax gain to leverage, GL, and the risk-free
                                          17


eqUIty rate, rfE, must be estimated to move from one cost of capital expression to

another.1 4

       Two special cases, which allow these implementation problems to be avoided, are

worth noting. The first of these occurs when all debt tax shields are discounted at r

(Panels E and F of Table II) and the firm adopts a capital structure characterized by
(E/\') — u and (D/V) — (1-u)• In that event, Myers and Ruback (1988) have shown

that when a cost of equity, calculated from (E5) and (E6) or from (F5) and (F6), is

substituted into the weighted average cost of capital (E2 or F2), the result is:


                         — rfD(l-u)(l-TC) + urm.                                        (19)



The important point to note is that, with the assumed capital structure, the overall cost

of capital is the same, regardless of which tax regime holds true. Thus (19) can provide

a useful cost of capital expression when the analyst is uncertain as to which tax regime

more accurately reflects the reality of the corporate and personal tax codes.

       The second special case arises when all cash flows are riskiess. Ruback (1986)

has shown under very general conditions that the market value of a set of nskless cash

flows received by a corporation is equal to the present value of the after-corporate-tax

cash flow stream discounted at the after-corporate-tax riskiess interest rate. This

follows by an arbitrage argument from the observation that such a stream can support

100 percent of its own value in debt financing. That the current results are consistent

with this analysis can be seen from Table Il. In the case in which there are only

corporate taxes, an all-equity-financed riskiess cash flow stream would have an
unlevered cost of capital r — rfD. When (D/V) — 1, then, all of the expressions for r*

(A2, A3, C2, C3, E2, E3) reduce to r* — rfD(l.TC). When there are both corporate and

personal taxes, r — rfE for a riskless, unlevered stream, and when (DN) — 1,
                                          18


Equations (B3), (D3) and (F3) reduce to ra — rfE(l-GL), while Equations (B2), (D2)
and (F2) reduce to rh — rfD(l-TC). However, from (1) and the definition of

rfE(l -GL) — rfD(l -Ta). Hence, all of the cases treated in Table II collapse to the same

overall cost of capital when cash flows are riskiess.



IV. Summary and Conclusions

       This paper has attempted to unity some disparate strands from the corporate

valuation and cost of capital literature. That literature has proposed several different

approaches to valuation, has wrestled with the issue of how best to account for tax-

induced interactions between financing and investment and has analyzed the distinctions

between the perpetuity and finite-life cases. However, the different approaches and

different cases have not all been considered simultaneously in an environment that

allows for different tax rates on corporate income, personal income from bonds and

personal income from equity.

       When these approaches to corporate valuation are analyzed with an eye toward

the conditions necessary to ensure consistency among them, the following conclusions

emerge:

        1. Many of the valuation and cost of capital expressions that have appeared in the

literature differ along two dimensions. The first of these is the assumed tax regime, and

the second is the assumed time pattern and riskiness of future interest tax shields.

       2. Once the analyst has chosen these two assumptions, the cost of capital

expressions within any given panel of Table II, used in conjunction with any of the three

basic valuation methods, will yield identical estimates of firm value. Mixing expressions

across panels, however, implies inconsistent assumptions about the tax regime or the

riskiness of interest tax shields and will not yield internally consistent results.

       3. If one moves horizontally in Table II, from a tax regime that allows for only

corporate taxes to one that includes both corporate and personal taxes, the analogous
                                          19

valuation and cost of capital expressions differ in two ways. First, T, the corporate tax

rate, is replaced by GL, the net tax advantage to corporate debt. Second, r0, the risk-

free debt rate, is replaced by FfE, the risk-free equity rate.15 In particular, this

implies that an after-tax CAPM must be used in conjunction with any adjusted beta

expression (such as B6, D6, F6) when personal taxes are relevant.

       4. The weighted average cost of capital is robust to changes in both the tax regime

and in the perceived risk of interest tax shields. This is because the relationship between
the levered cost of equity, rE, and the unlevered cost, r, changes to reflect both tax

factors and tax shield risk, leaving the weighted average formula intact. To correctly

estimate the weighted average starting from scratch, however, the analyst must use the
correct relationship between r and rE. A special case of the weighted average cost of

capital, proposed by Myers and Ruback (1988), does not require specific knowledge of
the relationship between r and rE, but does require a specific capital structure

assumption.

1. Nearly all of the cost of capital expressions in this paper have been derived

elsewhere, so the primary aim is to synthesize existing results rather than derive new

ones. See Ashton and Atkins (1978), Conine (1980), Hamada (1969), Miles and Ezzell

(1980,1985), Modigliarii and Miller (1963), Myers (1974) and Taggart (1977) for
the case in which there are corporate but no personal taxes. Brealey and Myers (1988),

Chambers, Harris and Pringle (1982), Ezzell and Kelly (1984), Hamada and Scholes

(1985), Lewellen and Emery (1986), Myers and Ruback (1988), Sick (1988) and
Yagil (1982) consider the case in which there are both corporate and personal taxes,

but don't analyze consistency conditions among all the different valuation methods

considered here. The approach in the current paper most closely resembles that of Sick

(1988).


2. C represents the expected after-tax cash flow the company would have gotten in

period n if it had been entirely equity-financed. Note that financing charges, such as
interest or debt repayment, are not deducted from C.



3. For example, the Adjusted Present Value method does not rely on the assumption of

constant financing proportions, so it can be easier to implement when the financing mix

is changing. APV also offers a relatively straightforward way to take subsidized financing

into account. The ADA method is easy to use when the asset to be valued is similar in

terms of both business risk and financing characteristics to another asset for which the

required rate of return is known. The FTE method is useful when the available cash flow

information gives net income figures but doesn't distinguish between cash operating

expenses and financing charges.
                                          26

4. Not all five listed assumptions are necessary to establish the validity of each

expression in Panel A of Table ii individually. However, it is necessary to make all five

assumptions if each of the expressions is to be valid simultaneously.



5. The reader might object that to retain comparability with the example in Section ll.A,

the initial condition should be D 200, rather than D/V — .352. In that event, Equation
(Cl) can be used, setting V1 — Vt — V, to derive V 537.1 and DIV .372. Thus the

results still differ from the ones obtained using Panel A.


6. As in Miller (1977), TPE should be interpreted as an effective tax rate. In actual fact,

the pattern of taxable equity income will be determined by the patterns of dividend
payments and of gain or loss realizations. TPE is the uniform annual tax rate that would

produce tax payments having the same present value as the pattern of actual tax

payments on equity income.


7. In a CAPM context, rfE can be thought of as the equilibrium pre-tax return on a zero-

beta equity portfolio. Alternatively, one could imagine an entirely equity-financed firm
with riskless assets. Such a firm's cost of equity would be rfE. For the analysis that

 follows, it is not necessary that a specific, riskless equity security exist as long as one

 can be created synthetically.



 8. A relatively simple proof can be constructed using the same steps found in Rubinstein

 (1973), but with end-of-period investor wealth calculated after all taxes.



 9. To establish (8), it should be noted that in period N-2 and all prior periods, the

 expressions for the values of debt and equity take the form
                                               27


Dk,— [rfD(l-TP)DN..2 + DN2] ,and EN.,
            l+rfE(l.TPE)


 [(CEQN..l-rfD(I-TC)DN2 - (DN 2-DN I))(l.-TPE) - TPE(EN i-EN2) + EN1]
                                            1 +rfE(l -TpE)

Simplifying, using (7), and iterating backward yields (8).


10. The assumptions needed to justify multiperiod risk-adjusted discounting are
discussed in Fama (1977), Myers and Turnbull (1977) and Sick (1988). They revolve

around the nature of the cash flow process over time.



11. In the case considered in most textbooks, in which personal taxes are ignored, S is

interpreted as a stream of interest tax shields discounted at the pre-tax debt rate.

However, any such expression for S can be written in two ways:



                                                    rrD(1-Tc)]Dn.i
                    (l+rfD)fl
                                —
                                    ',"[rfD
                                        -j
                                                    (1+r10)
            n.I+1                   n.t+1




Moreover, if T = TPE = 0 in (1), r10 is equal to rfE, the required return on risk-free

equity. Thus (10) can be thought of as a natural generalization of the case that includes

only corporate taxes.



12. For completeness, analogous equations for the case in which there are corporate but

no personal taxes are shown in Panel E.
                                           28

13. Yagil's (1982) expression for the relationship between rE and r, derived for the

case of riskiess interest tax shields, is different from (B4), because he defines rE in

after-personal-tax terms.


14. Empirical studies, such as Masulis' (1983) work on exchange offers, afford one
possib'e avenue for estimating GL. High-grade preferred stock might be used to estimate

rfE, although the picture is clouded by the effect of the intercorporate dividend

exclusion. Another possibility is a constructed series of zero-beta equity returns, as in
Black and Scholes (1974). Alternatively, equation (1) plus the definition of        in Table

I can be combined to yield rfE(l -GL)     rfD(l -T) which can in turn be used to estimate

rfE If the analyst is willing to rely on an estimate of GL.



15. Although not written in that form in Table Il, these two rules are also valid for the

weight average cost of capital (B2, D2, F2). That is because, as shown in footnote 14,

rfE(l-GL)      rfD(l-TC)
