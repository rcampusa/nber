                   Crowding Out or Crowding In?
             Evidence on Debt—Equity Substitutability


                               ABSTRACT




       When the composition of assets outstanding in the market changes, the
pattern of expected asset returns also changes, shifting to whatever return
structure will induce investors to hold just the new composition of exisiting
assets. The object of this paper is to determine, on the basis of the
respective risks associated with the returns to broad classes of financial
assets in the United States, and hence on the basis of the implied portfolio
substitutabilities among these assets, how government deficit financing
affects the structure of market—clearing expected returns on debt and equity
securities traded in U.S. markets.

       The empirical results indicate that government deficit financing
raises expected debt returns relative to expected equity returns, regardless
of the maturity of the government's financing.. More specifically, financing
a single $100 billion government deficit by issuing short-term debt lowers
the expected return on long—term debt by .06%, and lowers the expected return
on equity by .33%, relative to the return on short-term debt. Financing
a $100 billion deficit by issuing long—term debt raises the expected return
on long—term debt by .10%, but lowers the expected return on equity by .24%,
again in comparison to the return on short—term debt. These per—unit
magnitudes are not huge,, but in the current U .S. context of government deficits
approximating $200 billion     year after year — they are not trivially
small either..

        These results have immediate implications for the composition of
private financing. In addition, in conjunction with some assumption (for
example, about monetary policy) to anchor the overall return structure,
they bear implications for the total volume of private financing, as well
as for capital formation and other interestsensitive elements of aggregate
demand.

   CROWDING OUT OR CWDING IN? EVIDENCE ON DEBT-EQUITY SUBSTITUTABILITY

       To what extent — indeed, whether — government deficit financing

"crowds out" private financing and private capital formation depends, in

the first instance, on how deficit financing affects the structure of the

market returns on debt and equity securities. How market returns respond

to such influences as issues of government debt depends, in turn, on the

relative asset substitutabilities that characterize security holders'

portfolio behavior,. Unless investors regard debt and equity as perfect

substitutes, even the sign of the effect of government debt issues on the

market-clearing expected return on equity depends on the relative degrees

to which investors treat debt, equity and other classes of assets as portfolio

substitutes. In a world in which firms finance investment by equity (or

soixe combination of debt and equity), therefore, whether government

deficit financing "crowds out" or "crowds in" private capital formation

depends also on relative asset substitutabilities)

       When the composition of the assets outstanding in the market changes,

the pattern of expected asset returns must in general change also, shifting

to whatever return structure will induce investors to hold just the new

composition of existing assets. Under most familiar circumstances, increasing

the market supply of any specific asset raises that asset's market—clearing

expected return.2 By contrast, an increase in the sply of any one asset

may either raise or lower the expected return on any other asset. The

expected returns on assets that investors regard as close substitutes —for

example, government debt and high—grade corporate debt of comparable maturity —
                                          —2—




presumably   move   closely   together. If investors do not regard two assets as

close substitutes, an increase in the market supply of one may well lower

the expected return on the other. The question here, in short, is whether

investors regard debt and equity securities as close or distant substitutes.

       According     to the standard theory describing the portfolio behavior
of risk—averse      investors, the relevant asset substitutabilities that

determine whether "crowding out" or "crowding in" occurs depend on investors

perceptions of the risks associated with holding debt, equity and other

assets. Investors' willingness to hold different assets depends on

their assessments of the respective risks to which holding these assets

exposes them, and their treatment of some assets as substitutes for others

in their portfolios likewise depends on the relationships they perceive among

the associated risks to holding these assets as well as others. If two

assets expose holders to essentially the same set of risks, investors

typically treat the two as close substitutes and allocate their portfolios

accordingly. Assets subject to quite disparate risks are typically more

distant substitutes, or perhaps even complements.

       The object of this paper is to determine, on the basis of the respective

risks associated with the returns to broad classes of financial assets in the

United States, and hence on the basis of the implied portfolio substitutabilities

among these assets, how government deficit financing affects the structure

of market—clearing expected returns on debt and equity securities traded

in U.S. markets. The chief line of analysis followed here is to infer

investors' unobservable perceptions of asset risks by applying a mu1tivaiiate

regression procedure with continual re—estimation over time, based on

actual return data, and then to apply the standard theory of risk—averse

portfolio allocation to infer the relevant parameters of investors' asset

 demands.
                                             —3—




          Any   such   analysis of relative asset substitutabilities cannot, of

course,    answer   by itself the question of the extent to which returns on all

assets together move in response to government deficit financing. Inferences

about joint movements of all asset returns uld           require   in addition some

further assumption —         for   example, about monetary policy — to anchor the

overall return structure. To anticipate, the conclusion that follows from

this analysis is that        financing   government deficits by issuing short—term

debt lowers the return on long-term debt and         lowers   the return on equity by

even more, while financing deficits by issuing long—term debt raises the

return on long-term debt but lowers the return on equity, all in comparison

to   the benchmark of the return on short-term debt.
          Section I briefly sets out the underlying portfolio—theoretic
relationships on which        the analysis relies. Section II      outlines the
inultivariate regression procedure for inferring investors' risk perceptions
over tixr, and documents the main properties of the associated expectations
and expectation errors. Section III examines          the implications that follow
for   investors' portfolio behavior in general, and for the "crowding out"

question in particular, from this representation of investors' perceptions.

Section IV tests the robustness of these results to the particular data used

to construct the asset return series by repeating parts of the analysis using

data exhibiting quite different serial correlation properties. Section V

reports the results (largely unsuccessful) of an alternative approach

applying maximum likelihoood methods to estimate investors' behavior using

data on the aggregate portfolio of U.S. households. Section VI summarizes

the principal conclusions of this analysis, and calls attention to several

important caveats.

If the time unit       is   sufficiently small to render W a good approximation to

E(Wt+i) for purposes of the underlying expansion, then the first (scalar)

term within brackets in (6) is sixiy the reciprocal of the constant coefficient

of relative risk aversion.6

        Matrix B in (5), expressing the response of each proportional asset

demand to movements in the expected real returns on that and           other   assets,

contains the set of relative asset substitutabilities that determine how

increases in asset supplies affect the         market—clearing   structure of expected

returns. The solution for B in (6) makes clear the central role of

investors' risk perceptions in governing this behavior. The asset

substitutabilities in B depend only on the investor's risk aversion and risk

perceptions,        here paraireterized by a variance—covariance matrix 2 that in
general may vary over time.
       The determination of expected returns follows from equating the
aggregate of all        investors'   asset demands   to the net market supplies of

all   assets. Because of the linearity in expected returns, which follows
here from the assunption of constant relative risk aversion and joint normally
distributed assessments of asset returns, the asset demand relationships in
(5) readily admit of aggregation across investors with diverse preferences
and endowments.7 The relevant market-clearing condition is then just

         A =AS                                                                           (3)

where A is now the aggregate vector of all investors' individual asset

demands as in (2), and AS is the aggregate vector of assets supplied

by initial conditions on "outside" issuers.8

        Solution of (8) determines the relative expected returns on all

assets, or, equivalently, the absolute expected returns on all assets but

one. The market—clearing response of any asset's expected return to a change

in the supply of any "outside" asset follows from (5) and (8) as



              =    .        - _1)                                              (9)

thecentral inortance of investors' risk perceptions in governing how
market—clearing expected returns respond to changes in asset supplies is
readily apparent.

II. A Representation of Investors' Risk Perceptions

          Table 1 indicates the 1960-1980 means, together with the associated

unconditional quarterly variances and covariances, of the after—tax real per

annum returns on three broad classes of U.S. financial assets that differ

fundamentally    from one another according to the risks associated with
holding them: Short-term debt includes all assets bearing real returns that
are risky, over a single year or calendar quarter, only because of uncertainty
about inflation. By contrast, long—term debt is risky because of uncertainty
not   only about inflation but also about changes in asset prices directly

reflecting changes in market interest rates. Similarly, equity is risky

because   of uncertainty about inflation and about changes in stock prices.
          The pre-tax nominal return associated with the short—term debt
category here is a weighted average of zero (for money), the Federal
Ieserve average rate on time and saving deposits (for other deposits bearing
regulated yields), and the four-to-six month prime commercial paper rate
(for all other instruments maturing in one year or less), weighted in each
quarter according to the composition of the U.S. household sector's aggregate
portfolio. The pre-tax nominal return on long—term debt is     the   Moodys

Baa corporate    bond yield, plus annualized percentage capital gains or

losses    approximated by applying the standard consol formula to changes
in the Baa yield. For equity the pre-tax nominal return is the dividend-
price yield, plus annualized percentage capital gains or losses, on     the

Standard    and Poor's 500 index. For each asset the corresponding after—

tax real return is calculated by applying the household sector's average

effective marginal tax rates in each year for interest, dividends and

capital    gains to the respective components of the pre—tax nominal returns,

and then subtracting the annualized percentage change in the consumer      price
index.9
          The after—tax real returns on all three classes of assets were

serially correlated during this period, with sisple first-order serial

correlation coefficients of .86 for short-term debt, .51 for long—term

debt, and .33 for equity, based on quarterly observations for 1960-1980.

The unconditional variance—covariance matrix shown in Table 1 therefore

presumably   overstates the uncertainty that investors actually associated
with their expectations of asset returns, ovez each coming calendar quarter,
throughout   this period. The object of the analysis here is to construct

a representation of investors' perceptions of these risks that takes more

careful account of what information investors did or did not have at any

particular time.

        2\s of the beginning of each calendar quarter, investors presumably

know the stated interest rates on short—term debt instruments, the current

prices and the   coupon rates on long—term debt instruments,   the current

prices and (approximately) the dividends on equities, and the relevant tax
rates. The three uncertain elements that they must forecast over the coming
quarter, in order to form expectations of the after-tax real returns on the
three broad classes of assets considered here, are inflation (P1), the capita].

gain or loss on long-term debt       and the capital gain or loss on equity



          The procedure used here to infer investors' risk perceptions   represents
investors as forming expectations of these three uncertain return elements,
at   each point in time, by estimating a multivariate linear regression model

giving the best linear projection of these elements from past values

            The three panels of Figure 1        exhibit   the forecasting performance of

this       continually updated regression procedure for each quarter during
1960-1980. The respective panels' heavy solid lines show the actual
xyvvements of inflation, the capital gain on long-term debt, and the capital
gain       on equity, while the broken lines show the corresponding series of

one—period-ahead forecasts. (Because of the greater volatility of capital

lag lengths L =          1,... ,4,   estimated using data for l953:II—l959:IV) For

1960:11 the procedure is the            sane   except that the data used to estimate

(10) spans 1953:11—1960:1. The procedure is analogous for each subsequent

period, ending with the use of data for 1953:11-1980:111 to estimate (10)

to generate the one—period-ahead forecasts for 1980 :IV.12

             As is clear from the figure, this inherently backward-looking

forecast procedure enjoys the advantages and suffers the shortcomings of

realizations of the three random variables are .90 or price inflation,

.44   for long-term debt capital gains, and .31 for equity capital gains,
again based on quarterly novements during 1960-1980. The simple
correlation coefficients between the realizations and the corresponding
forecasts derived from continual updating of (10) are .88 for inflation,
.42 for long-term debt capital gains, and .23 for equity capital gains.13
       The three panels of Figure 2 exhibit the forecasting performance for
the after—tax real returns iitplied by these one-period—ahead forecasts
of the uncertain asset return elements as in (13). The heavy solid
lines show actual movements of the three asset returns, while the broken
lines show the corresponding series of one-period—ahead forecasts.
(The three panels here are again drawn to different scales). For the
uncertain asset returns, as fo.r the underlying uncertain components, the
forecasting procedure represents the future as resembling the immediate
past, so that the success achieved by the respective forecasts varies
according to the serial correlation in the different asset returns. The
simple correlation coefficients between the realizations of after—tax real
returns and the corresponding forecasts are .83 for short—term debt, P.51
for long-term debt, and .30 for equities.
         Table 2 shows the 1960-1980 means of these one-period—ahead forecasts.
Conparison with the corresponding actual means shown in Table 1 indicates
that, on average, the forecasts generated by this procedure were somewhat
too optimistic about the returns on short-term debt and on equities. The
forecasts of the return on   long—term   debt were somewhat too pessimistic on
on   average. In each case, however, the mean absolute error is less than 1%

III. Implications for Portfolio Behavior
         Ibgether with a value for the market—average risk aversion, the
variance—covariance matrix summarizing investors' risk perceptions
directly implies the key asset substitutabilities that characterize
investors' portfolio behavior. Because the procedure described in
Section II allows for the fact that the information investors have changes
from one period to the next, it generates a different such variance—
covariance matrix for each period. It therefore implies a different
matrix   of asset substitutabilities for each period.

         Figure 3 shows the variation over time of the six elements of matrix

B calculated by applying the transformation given in (6),.up to but not

including multiplication by the reciprocal of the coefficient of relative

risk aversion, to the eighty—four individual quarter conditional variance—

covariance matrices derived via the procedure described in Section l4

The variation of these ,           elements over time reflects a combination
                              1J

of investors' growing amount of information (starting from the 1953:11

base) and their reaction to specific "surprise" episodes that are also

readily visible in the actual return series plotted in Figure 2. More

information   implies smaller variances and covariances, and hence larger
(in   absolute value) responses, while the immediate effect of "surprises" is

just the   opposite. Prominent examples of such "surprises" that are visible
in Figure 2, and that have noticeable effects on the              values   plotted
in   Figure 3, include   the stock market crash in 1962, the       "credit crunch" in

1966, the Penn Central default in 1970, the combination of OPEC and tight

monetary policy in 1974, and the Federal Reserve System's introduction of

new monetary policy procedures in 1979.

         Two more   general   features of these ,       values that persist over
                                                   1J

deficit. Because these results describe effects only on relative returns,

rather than effects on absolute levels of returns, by themselves they

answer    questions about the composition of financing but not about its
total. Nevertheless, in conjunction with some further assumption to
anchor the overall return structure — for example, that monetary
policy accommodates the deficit so as to keep expected short-term
real returns unchanged, or, alternatively, that monetary policy is not
accommodative and hence lets expected short-term real returns rise if
the deficit is large enoi4i — these results also bear straightforward
implications for the total volume of financing and, in turn, for capital
formation and other typically interest-sensitive elements of aggregate
demand.

iv.   Results Based on Alternative Return Data
        One of   the striking features of the observed asset return series noted

                                               serial correlation, even in the
in Section II is the high degree of positive

long-terra debt and equity capital gain terms, that is readily visible in

Figure 1. Under the standard theory of speculative asset markets, it

is plausible to suppose that these serial correlations are in part the

result of the use of time-averaged data.21 Because the heart of the vector

autoregression procedure outlined in Section II consists of exploiting

the serial correlation properties of the series to be projected, it is

important to be sure that the results reported in Section III are not sixtply

an artifact due to time averaging.

        The upper panel of Table 4 shows the unconditional quarterly variances

and covariances of the after—tax real per annum returns on the same three assets

considered in Sections II and iii, calculated from 1969—80 data designed

to eliminate time averaging in so far as is possible. For short-term debt,

the nominal return is a weighted average of zero, the average time and saving

deposit rate for the entire quarter, and the coumercial paper rate for the
                                                     the nominal return is the

 is the Standard and poor's 500 dividend for the quarter plus the annualized

        Except for the inflation rate, these data exhibit serial correlation

properties quite different from those described in Section II and plotted

in Figures 1 and 2. The first-order serial correlation coefficients for

the three after-tax real returns during this period were .70 for short—term
debt, -.32 for long-term debt, and .18 for equity. For the three individual
elements taken to be uncertain in the forecasting procedure outlined in
Section II, the corresponding first-order serial correlation coefficients
are   .81 for price inflation, -.32 for long-term debt capital gains, and .16

for equity capital gains.

         The lower panel of Table 4 shows the mean values of the individual

quarter variance-covariance matrix elements that result from applying the

procedure of (lO)-(15) to these alternative data. PJthough the individual

elements differ from those   shown in Table 2,   here as in Section II the

variances and covariances associated with the continually updated forecasts

are uniformly smaller than the corresponding unconditional variances
                                                                          and

covarianceS.     Except for inflation and the short—term debt return, however,

here the smaller serial correlations lead —— as would be expected with an

autoregressive procedure — to
                                  less successful forecasts. The simple

correlation coefficients between the realizations and the corresponding

 forecasts  from continual updating of (10) for these data are .90 for
 inflation, .16 for the long-term debt capital gain, - .17 for the equity capital
 gain, and .87, .34 and .25 for the after—tax real returns on short-term
 debt, long-term debt and equity, respectively.

          The use of point-in-time rather than time-averaged data apparently

makes little difference for the ixr1ied effects of government deficit

financing on the structure of relative expected returns.      For the short—

term debt return again assumed    to   be fixed, the results shown in Table 5

indicate that the expected long-term debt return and the expected equity
return   fall by .03%   and .31%, respectively, and the expected differential
between   them narrows by .28%, in response to each $100 billion additional

supply of short-term government debt. Similarly, the expected long-term

debt return rises by .09% and the expected equity return falls by .27%,

so that the expected differential between them narrows by .37%, in response

to   each $100 additional supply of long-term government debt.

V. Results Based on an Alternative Estimation Strategy

       The analysis of investors' portfolio behavior in Sections III and IV

draws on the conditional variance—covariance structure inferred by applying

the forecasting procedure described in Section II, but it makes no use

of the corresponding inferred sets of conditionally expected returns.

Given these time series of expected returns, and given comparable data on

investors' actual asset holdings, an alternative strategy for learning about

the asset substitutability matrix B is to estimate (5) by time series

regression.

       Individual investors, either on their own    or   through intermediaries,

are the ultimate holders of the great majority of all private and government

securities issued in the United States. Table 6. indicates the composition

of the aggregate portfolio of financial assets held directly by U.S.

households, as of yearend 1980, exhaustively arranged according to the

three major asset classes under examination here. Comparable data are

readily available for the end of each calendar quarter during 1960-1980.

       Because     there is substantial evidence that individual investors do
not fully rebalance their portfolios within a time span as short as one quarter
year, it is appropriate not to estimate (5) directly but to imbed it within
some model of portfolio adjustment out of equilibrium. The most familiar
such model in the asset demand literature is the multivariate partial
adjustment    form


              =   0(A*   -   A    )                                                (16)
         t           t        t-l

where A* is the vector of equilibrium asset holdings corresponding to c in

(5), and 0 is a matrix of adjustment coefficients with columns satisfying

"adding up" constraints analogous to those applying to B. Substituting for

to common time trends. Fo purposes of             estimation,   therefore, the data for A

         index and the total U.S. population series. In addition, both A

sector's aggregate net purchases or sales of each asset associated with the

sector's net saving. Defining the asset flows in this way is equivalent

to   assuming that investors do not respond within the quarter to that
quarter's changes in their holdings due to changing market valuations, but
do respond to market valuations as of the beginning of each quarter.

to any asset demand response matrix that makes sense in theoretical terms.

                             25
term   debt and equity.

           The lower panel of Table 7 reports analogous results for the estimation

of (17) subject to the further constraint that matrix B be symnetric.

Imposition    of the symnetry restriction is not inconsistent with the data,
but. the   constrained estimates are even less plausible than their unconstrained
                   26
counterparts.    The estimated responses of all three asset demands to

their respective "own" expected returns are negative, and two of the

three asset pairs are not substitutes but complements. 1though asset
complementarity is plausible enough in general, in this context there is
nothing in either the conditional variance—covariance structures summarized
in Table    2 or   the unconditional variance—covariance structure shown in
Table 1 to suggest         complementarity aixong   any of these asset pairs.
        Finally,        and not surprisingly, the effects of government deficit

financing    implied by the two sets of      3.     estimates reported in Table 7

are also uninteresting. The two sets of implied             effects   on expected asset

returns contain two sign contradictions, and each set includes at least

one implied effect in excess of 1QQ% (agai'n, for a $10.0 billion change in

the supply of debt).

                                                                     (1970)
  6. The rationale for mean-variance analysis provided by SamuelsOn
                                               that mean-variance analysis
      and iang (1972), for example, suggests
                                      that depends on (among other factors)
      per se is only an approximation
      a small time   unit. Thetime unit used in the empirical work presented
                                            Although the observed variation
        in this paper is a calendar quarter.this time unit, it is the expected
        of some asset prices is large over
        variation that matters here.
 7. Lintner (1969) showed that, under the assumptions maintained here, the
     risk aversion characterizing the aggregate of investors is the harmonic
     mean of the respective risk aversion characterizing each investor,
     weighted by each investor's respective wealth endowment. (Lintner
     also showed that asset demands like those in (5) readily admit to
     aggregation over investors with diverse return assessments, but the
      analysis here treats all investors as having homogeneous assessments.)
 8. The net supply A is zero for any "inside" asset.
 9. The marginal tax rates applied to interest and dividends are values
     estimated by Estrella and Fuhrer (1983), on the basis of Internal
      Revenue Service data, to reflect the marginal tax bracket of the average
      recipient of these two respective kinds of income in each year. The
      marginal tax rate applied to capital gains is an analogous estimate,
      including allowances for deferral and loss offset features, due to
      Feldstein et al. (1983). Preliminary eerimentation with the respective
      price deflators for gross national product and personal consumption
      eenditures indicated that the results presented in this paper are not
      very sensitive to the choice of specific inflation measure.
10. The omission of a time subscript from A in (15) abstracts     from changes
      overtime in the capital gains tax rate. The rate actually used here,
      from Feldstein et al. (1983), assumes a different value in each calendar
      year, as do the respective rates on interest and dividends, from
      Estrella and Fuhrer (1983).

11.   The estimated vector autoregression also includes a vector of constants.

12.   An alternative procedure would be to "roll" rather than extend the
      sample each period by dropping the earliest observation so as to maintain
      the same sample size as each new observation is added. Limited
      experimentation indicated that using a rolling sample period leads to
      results that differ modestly from those reported below. With a
      rolling sample, the mean variance—covariance matrix corresponding to
      that reported in Table 2 is (1.00; 3.24, 55.21; 5.17, 48.51).
13.   In comparing these "fit" correlations to the corresponding serial
      correlations, it is helpful to recall that investors did not know the
      1960-1980 serial correlation properties of these variables until
      after this period had ended. The forecasting procedure applied here uses
      only    information that investors had at the time they needed to make
      each    quarter's forecast.

14. Matrix B in (6) is necessarily symmetrical, so that three on- and three
     off-diagonal elements suffice to summarize the entire matrix at any point
      in time. The values shown in Figure 3 and Table 3 below are scaled to
      reflect the expression of returns in per cent per annum.
15. The conditions for gross substitutability derived by Blanchard and
     Plantes (1977) do not strictly apply here, because there is no riskless
      asset, but in fact they are satisfied.
16. See Friedman (1984b) for an arguxrnt relating weak asset substitutabilities,
     implied by this and other evidence, to the observed stable total debt—to—
     income ratio in the United States during this period.

17. The asset demand responses reported in Friedman (forthcoming), based
     on the unconditional variance—covariance structure shown in Table 1,
     are of course even smaller in absolute value. For the three off—
     diagonal elements, for example, the mean values corresponding to
     those shown in Table 3 are SL = -.578, SE = -.0635, and LE = -.150.

18. Because (6) is nonlinear, the mean .. values shown here differ slightly
      from the corresponding values that would result from applying (6) to
      mean w. values shown in Table 2.
            1J

19.   This value is about in the middle of the range of available empirical
      estimates. Friend and Blume (1975) suggested a value in excess of two,
      Grossman and Shiller (1981) suggested four, and Friend and Hasbrouck (1982)
      suggested six. Bodie et al. (forthcoming) also assumed a value of four
      in a context similar to the application here.

20. See again footnote 2.

21. The basic point is due to working (1960). The data used to calculate the
     returns used in the analysis reported in Sections II and III are quarterly
      averages.

22. The average rate on time and saving deposits is available only on a
     quarter-average basis.

23. For comparability with Table 3, the results reported in the lower panel
     of Table 5 again use mean 1960-80 asset values in applying (9).

                                                                    the
24. The nonlinear maximum-likelihood procedure facilitates not only
     direct estimation of t-statistics on the ,. coefficients but also  the

      imposition    of   constraints   as discussed below.
25.   The standard errors have the dimension of thousands of constant 1967
      dollars per capita. For purposes of comparison with the values shown
      in Table 6, the l980:IV values of the consumer price index and the
      total U.S. population are 2.658 and 228.6 million, respectively.
26.   The test statistic for the syitmietry restriction is x2(3) =level.
                                                                     2.65,
                                                                           This
