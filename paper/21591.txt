                                            ABSTRACT

We study the short-term trajectories of employment, hours worked, and real wages of immigrants
in Canada and the U.S. using nationally representative longitudinal datasets covering 1996-2008. Models
with person fixed effects show that on average immigrant men in Canada do not experience any relative
growth in these three outcomes compared to men born in Canada. Immigrant men in the U.S., on the
other hand, experience positive annual growth in all three domains relative to U.S. born men. This
difference is largely on account of low-educated immigrant men, who experience faster or longer
periodsof relative growth in employment and wages in the U.S. than in Canada. We further compare
longitudinal and cross-sectional trajectories and find that the latter over-estimate wage growth of
earlier arrivals, presumably reflecting selective return migration.

       Over recent decades, Canada and the United States, two North American neighbors with

contrasting immigration policies, have experienced extraordinary growth in their immigrant

populations. Between 1990 and 2010, the U.S. foreign-born population more than doubled and

Canada’s increased by nearly 56 percent.1 Economic assimilation of immigrants has drawn

considerable policy and academic interest in both countries. But, surprisingly, there is very little

comparative research that investigates the relative labor market experiences of immigrants in the

two countries, and none has captured the post-1990 experience (trajectories). The scant existing

comparative research on immigrant economic assimilation is based on cross-sectional data,

which is likely to yield biased trajectories of employment and earnings on account of selection in

immigration as well as return migration (Antecol, Kuhn, and Trejo, 2006). These biases are

likely to compound in comparative research if, as documented in recent studies, relative selection

patterns differ across the two destinations (Bonikowska et al., 2011; Kaushal and Lu, 2014).

Longitudinal data are also more suitable to study labor market trajectories, whereas cross-

sectional data essentially capture wage levels but not wage growth.

       To bridge this knowledge gap, in this paper we study the employment and earnings

trajectories of immigrants to the U.S. and Canada using longitudinal data covering the most

recent period. These two major immigrant destinations are comparable on many cultural and

institutional domains but also have several critical differences, described below, that may affect

the economic assimilation of immigrants. Because many challenges relating to immigrant

In proportion to overall population, the foreign born constitute a larger share of the Canadian
population (21% as of 2011) compared to the US (13% as of 2011) (Statistics Canada, 2011; US
Census Bureau, 2015a).

incorporation are similar, comparative research has considerable policy relevance for both

countries. In general, cross-national research on immigration is important as it creates

opportunities for nation-states to draw from the experience of others; it also opens domestic

policy in receiving countries to international scrutiny that is often not bound by the nuances of

domestic immigration policy debates.

       The post-1990 immigration, the focus of our study, is important not just for its sheer size

but also for the changing composition (characteristics) of new arrivals, which is at least partly

driven by the divergent immigration policies of the two nations. Since the mid-1990s, Canada

has modified its point system to place greater emphasis on the educational attainment and

English/French language proficiency of immigrants, and less significance on occupational

demand (Beach, Green, and Worswick, 2006).2 Further, the past policy of linking immigration

levels to the economy’s absorptive capacity over the business cycle has been relinquished in

favor of higher immigration irrespective of prevailing economic conditions. In recent years,

Canada has included preference to employer nomination via the Provincial Nominee program

and the Canadian experience class (Pandey and Townsend, 2011; Baglay, 2012).

       The U.S., on the other hand, while continuing with family preference as the primary

mode of granting permanent residency, has made changes to allow an increased influx of

immigrants and temporary workers to cater to the labor market needs of the economy. The

Immigration Act of 1990 doubled the annual quota of employment based permanent immigration
2
  In 1992, the Canadian government allocated 12 points (out of 100) to high education and 15 to
French or English proficiency. By 2006, prospective immigrants with a bachelor’s degree
received 20 points (out of 100), and those with a masters or Ph.D. received 25 points. The points
allocated to language proficiency were raised to 24. Despite the focus on the point system, in
2006 only around 20% of Canadian immigrants were adjudicated under the point system as
principal applicants and another 25% as their family members (CIC, 2013). Research shows that
family members' credentials in the skilled worker category are correlated with those of the
principal applicant (Sweetman & Warman, 2010).

                                                 4
and created as well as expanded several categories of visas enabling short-term temporary

migration for high-skilled workers or students pursuing higher education. In recent years, these

inflows have exceeded new immigration via family unification.3 On the other end, since the mid-

1990s, an increasingly large number of undocumented immigrants, who are mostly low educated

and disproportionately from Mexico, have also entered the U.S. (Passel and Cohn, 2012, Hoefer,

Rytina, and Campbell, 2006).4

       Partly on account of the changes in immigration and temporary migration policies,

selection patterns of immigrants to Canada and the U.S. have changed significantly. Kaushal and

Lu (2014) document a relatively positive selection of immigrants to Canada (compared to the

U.S.) in terms of educational attainment and host country language proficiency, the two

attributes that have gained significance in the Canadian points system. They also find that new

immigrants to Canada have lower initial earnings compared to Canadian natives or recent

immigrants in the U.S., which leads them to conclude that while the Canadian point system has

resulted in positive selection on certain measurable attributes, it has not been successful in

capturing unobserved skills of immigrants that cannot be measured at entry and remain outside

the domain of the points system (i.e., motivations, skill transferability). Bonikowska et al. (2011)

also demonstrate a growing wage disadvantage among university-educated recent immigrants

compared to natives in Canada, but not in the U.S.5



3
  All temporary workers on non-immigrant visas can, and often do, subsequently adjust their
status to permanent residents. A growing proportion of new permanent residents in the U.S. in
recent years have been temporary migrants already residing in the country. In 1986, 37% of the
foreign-born receiving permanent residency were temporary residents; by 2009, the proportion
had increased to 59% (USDHS, 2012).
4
  Net inflows of undocumented migrants have been negligible since 2007 (Passel and Cohn,
2012).

  Researchers attribute the decline in entry earnings of successive immigrant cohorts in Canada
to compositional shifts in language ability and region of birth, deterioration in returns to foreign
                                                  5
       Given these differential selection patterns, an important issue with considerable policy

implications is: How have immigrants to Canada and the U.S. performed over time? Do they

exhibit different patterns of economic assimilation after adjusting for characteristics at arrival?

Do these patterns differ by immigrants’ region of origin? These questions have important

implications for future immigration in both countries and can guide immigration policy in other

immigrant receiving countries. To answer these questions, we study the short-term trajectories of

employment, hours worked, and real wage of immigrants in Canada and the U.S., using

longitudinal data and applying person fixed effects models to control for time-invariant

individual characteristics (including unobserved attributes of immigrants that are constant

throughout the panel survey). Further, we compare our results based on longitudinal data with

those from cross-sectional data to investigate possible bias in the latter.

                                         Previous research

       Research on the labor market assimilation of immigrants has evolved from earlier studies

based on single cross-sectional data to studies of repeated cross-sections of censuses, and in

more recent years, to studies using longitudinal data.6 In both Canada and the U.S., these studies

document that immigrants suffer from an initial earning disadvantage but tend to close this gap

over time. Estimates of earnings growth, however, differ substantially between cross-sectional

and longitudinal studies with the former generating substantially higher estimates than the latter



labor market experience, and non-random sorting of immigrants across establishments in
Canada’s major cities and geographic regions (Aydemir and Skuterud 2005, 2008; Green and
Worswick, 2009).

2012, Picot and Piraino, 2013).

       There is limited comparative research on the labor market assimilation of immigrants in

Canada and the U.S. Aydemir and Sweetman (2008) study the educational attainment and labor

market outcomes of immigrants in Canada and the U.S. across generations using U.S. March

Current Population Surveys from 1998 and 2004 and the 2001 Canadian Census. They conclude

that in both countries the second generation has better educational and labor market outcomes

than the first generation and similar or better outcomes compared to the third generation.

       Only one published paper to our knowledge has explicitly studied the relative labor

market assimilation of immigrants in Canada and the U.S. Using census data, Antecol, Kuhn,

and Trejo (2006) studied employment and earnings assimilation of immigrants in Australia,

Canada and the U.S. during the 1980s. They find that earnings assimilation is higher in the U.S.

than in Canada or Australia, and employment assimilation is highest in Australia, followed by

the U.S., and then Canada. These findings hold in separate analysis for immigrants from Europe

and Asia, thus ruling out the possibility that the U.S. results were driven by Latin American

immigrants. From the assimilation patterns across these three major immigrant destinations,

Antecol and colleagues conclude that host-country labor market institutions (such as higher

unemployment insurance and unionization in Australia and Canada compared to the U.S.) affect

immigrant assimilation.

       Antecol et al. (2006) is based on cross-sectional data, and arguably, their findings could

be affected by selective immigration and return migration. In a study of immigrant earnings

growth in the U.S., Lubotsky (2007) compares cross-sectional and longitudinal trajectories of

immigrants in the U.S., and finds that estimates of earnings assimilation from longitudinal data



                                                7
are about half as large as estimates from repeated cross-sectional data. Picot and Piraino (2013),

on the other hand, show that the immigrant-native earnings gap closes at the same pace in

longitudinal and cross-sectional data. The combined evidence from these studies suggests that

selection in return migration may be different in Canada compared to the US. Comparative

studies using cross-sectional data would yield biased results if the selection pattern in

immigration (and in return migration) is different for immigrants across the two countries. A

comparative study with longitudinal data can address some aspects of selective immigration by

controlling for time-invariant factors such as immigrants’ base year (or entry level)

characteristics.

        Estimates based on longitudinal data are certainly not exempt from possible bias due to

return migration and sample attrition. However, unlike cross-sectional analyses, longitudinal

studies provide unbiased estimates of earnings growth for the immigrant population that is

observed throughout the period of study (i.e. in all waves of the longitudinal data). As a further

step, sensitivity analysis can be conducted using longitudinal data to evaluate the impact of

sample attrition and return migration on the estimates of employment and earnings growth.

Factors Influencing Economic Assimilation

        Immigrant economic assimilation across nations may differ due to both differences in

immigrant characteristics at arrival as well as contexts in receiving countries, particularly

differences in labor market institutions. Characteristics at arrival (immigrant selection) are also

influenced by both immigration policy and receiving country contexts. Previous research

documents that compared to the U.S., new immigrants to Canada have been more positively

selected in terms of human capital attributes, but negatively selected in certain unobserved




                                                  8
attributes that may affect earnings at arrival (Bonikowska et al., 2011; Kaushal and Lu, 2014).7

On account of these unobserved attributes and conditional on observed human capital

characteristics, it is likely that immigrant assimilation may be faster in the U.S. than Canada.

       How will differences in immigration policy influence economic assimilation? The answer

depends on how effectively the immigration policy of each country succeeds in “matching” the

labor market needs of its economy. Since 1990, the U.S. has created a large number of non-

immigrant categories for temporary migration of skilled workers (e.g. H1B visa, L1-visa) and

doubled the quota under employment preference category for permanent migration.8 In most

cases, employers sponsor foreign workers for these visas, and their screening (or selection) is left

to the employers. Thus, immigrants with work visas have jobs upon arrival. In Canada, the

screening of new immigrants predominately comes under the Point system with a set of pre-

determined points for each attribute, often without pre-established employment links. The

relative assimilation of professional immigrants who enter via the two systems is likely to

provide some insight into how effectively these systems help in matching the economy’s needs

for high-skilled workers.9

       In the post-1990 period, a large proportion of immigrants to the U.S. have been

undocumented, and as a result have limited access to public services and almost no access to



7
  Observational studies in Canada indicate that immigrants face a considerable degree of
occupational mismatch, implying presence of obstacles that may limit immigrants in achieving
their full potential (Reitz, 2001).
8
  About 65% of permanent immigration to the U.S. and between 20-26% of the permanent
migration to Canada was family migration during our study period 1996-2008 (Government of
Canada, 2014; US Department of Homeland Security, 2014). However, in recent years, a large
proportion of foreigners who acquire permanent residency in the U.S. via family unification
enter the country on temporary visas – including many with employer-sponsored visas.
9
  Unfortunately, it is not possible to directly test this because our data do not include information
on class of entry. However, fixed effects models do help account for differences in earnings
across entry classes within a country.
                                                  9
programs that ease integration (e.g., unemployment insurance). Given relatively fewer sources of

support, the survival of the undocumented requires that their skills match the needs of the labor

market and those not able to secure jobs are more likely to return to their countries of origin.

Thus, the observed economic assimilation of the undocumented, who are predominantly low-

educated and from Latin America, is likely to be high.

       Labor market institutions in Canada and the U.S. differ in important ways. Canada has

stronger labor unions, higher minimum wages, and more generous unemployment insurance and

welfare systems (O’Connor et al., 1999). The minimum insurable employment effort necessary

to seek unemployment benefits is 12 to 20 weeks in Canada and 1 year in the U.S. (Government

of Canada, 2010; U.S. Department of Labor, 2013). The maximum period that an individual can

receive unemployment benefits is 26 weeks in the U.S. and 36 to 45 weeks (for someone with 1

year of insurable employment) in Canada.10 Riddell and Kuhn (2007) find part-year employment

in New Brunswick (Canada) to be double the rate of part-year employment in Maine (the U.S.)

and attribute two-thirds of the difference to the more generous unemployment insurance system

in Canada. In addition, the wage floor is higher in Canada than the U.S.: for instance, in 2000,

the minimum wage was 43 percent of the average wage in Canada and 36 percent of the average

wage in the U.S. (Neumark & Wascher, 2014). Overall, differences in institutional environments

in the two countries influence the labor force engagement and wage profiles of the native-born,

and may, in a broadly similar way, impact immigrant economic integration. For instance, a

compressed wage distribution may result in lower wage growth for immigrants in Canada (than

in the U.S.), especially at the top or the lower end of the wage distribution, which in turn may



10
   Regional differences in unemployment insurance in Canada, however, may result in
unemployment benefits that immigrants receive in major urban areas with low unemployment
rates to be lower than the benefits that immigrants receive in major urban areas in the US.
                                                 10
reduce incentives to invest in future labor market skills further limiting labor market assimilation

(Antecol et al., 2006).

       Immigrants often face delays or difficulty in obtaining work in the types of occupations

for which they are trained, resulting in lower levels of employment or earnings at arrival than

comparable natives. Extant research shows that immigrants in Canada are less likely than the

native-born to work in occupations for which they have trained, especially in regulated

occupations, like engineering and medicine (Boyd, 2013; Boyd & Thomas, 2002; Boyd &

Schellenberg, 2007; Girard & Smith, 2012; McDonald, Warman, & Worswick, 2012; Wald &

Fang, 2008). In the U.S., research similarly shows that immigrants tend to be over-educated for

the occupations in which they work (Beckhusen, Florax, Poot, & Waldorf, 2013; Chiswick &

Miller, 2009; Mattoo, Neagu, & Ozden, 2008). The issue is likely to be of greater relevance in

Canada, though, as many immigrants are selected on the basis of points determined largely by

human capital rather than employer sponsorship.11 We therefore expect that both levels of

employment and wage growth will be higher in the U.S. than in Canada, as the employer

nomination system facilitates more successful, although not perfect, occupational matching.

       To sum up, differences in immigrant selection patterns, labor market institutions and

immigration policies in the two countries suggest that immigrant economic assimilation is likely

to be faster in the U.S. than in Canada. In the empirical analysis, we study three dimensions of

economic assimilation – employment, hours worked and real wages. Our goal is to study how

these forces jointly shape the labor market trajectories of immigrants in the two countries. The




11
  McDonald et al. (2012) find that foreign-trained doctors in Canada faced a lower probability of
working as a physician than foreign-trained doctors in the U.S., which they attribute to
differences in selection policies.

focus is not on separating the respective role of these forces, which we are not able to do in a

two-country comparison.

                                       Data and Measures

       We use the Canadian Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID) Panels 2-5 for

1996, 1999, 2002, and 2005, and the U.S. Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)

Panels in 1996, 2001 and 2004, covering roughly the same period (1996-2008). Both datasets are

longitudinal. The baseline surveys of both SIPP and SLID are nationally representative (US

Census Bureau, 2015; Statistics Canada, 2012). Their survey administration is somewhat

different. Each SLID panel spans six years, with respondents completing annual interviews. A

new panel is introduced every three years such that at any point in time SLID contains two

panels. SIPP panels, on the other hand, last 3 to 4 years (36 to 48 months).12 Respondents are

interviewed every four months about their employment and earnings in the previous four months.

To improve comparability of these two datasets, we conduct analysis by restricting the Canadian

samples to the first four years of each panel and all outcomes are measured annually.13 Further,

all longitudinal analysis is restricted to samples with at least two observations on a given

outcome.

       The samples are restricted to individuals aged 25 to 59 years in the first observed year

(base year) of the survey for each panel and who arrived in the host country after age 16.14




12
   The 1996 and 2004 Panels span 48 months and the 2001 is 36 months.
13
   We also conducted analysis keeping all six years of data for SLID and the results were similar.
14
   We restrict the sample to immigrants who entered host country after age 16 to ensure our
results are not driven by differences in age at arrival. In the US sample, exclusion of persons who
arrived at age 16 or before lowers the sample by 2.3%, exclusion of students reduces the sample
by 8.1%, exclusion of immigrants from Canada lowers the sample by 0.2%. In the Canadian
sample, overall around 10% of the sample is excluded, with the vast majority of those excluded
being students. For Canada, we could not release excluded numbers for each category separately
                                                 12
Individuals enrolled in school in the reference year are excluded from the analysis as are

individuals who are institutionalized or living in military barracks.15 We also exclude a small

proportion of American immigrants in Canada and Canadian immigrants in the U.S.16 While

these are important demographic groups, they are not the focus of our study.

       We study three outcomes: employment, annual hours worked, and hourly wage last year.

In both datasets, employment is defined as equal to 1 if a respondent reported non-zero working

hours in the past year, otherwise 0. Annual total hours worked are constructed using the total

hours of usually scheduled work from all jobs available in SLID. In SIPP, we multiply the usual

hours worked in a week and weeks worked in that month. Hours worked in each month are

summed to obtain annual hours worked.17 Observations with more than 4,000 annual hours

worked are considered outliers and excluded from the analyses.18 We report results with log

annual hours as the dependent variable and exclude observations with zero hours.19

       In both datasets, hourly wage is derived by dividing annual earnings by the total usual

hours worked in all jobs.20 Throughout the analysis, wage data are expressed in January 1996

prices using the Consumer Price Index for each country. In the wage analysis, observations with



because they often involve small sample sizes and we risk violating the disclosure rules of
Statistics Canada.

       Both SLID and SIPP have data on immigrants’ period of arrival, which are used to

construct variables on years since immigration. In men’s analysis, this variable is grouped into

four categories: 0-5 years; 6-10 years; 11-20 and >20 years, and in women’s analysis, to avoid

very small sized categories, the variable is grouped as: 0-10 years, 11-20 years, and >20 years

since immigration.22 In addition, cohort of arrival is constructed into a set of dummy variables:

arrived before 1970, arrived during 1970-1979, arrived during 1980-1989, and 1990 or later.

Both data sources also provide information on immigrant’s country/region of origin. We classify

respondents into four categories: Africa and the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, and Europe

(including Australia and New Zealand). Educational attainment is coded in four categories: less

than high school, high school degree, some college or associate degree, and bachelor degree or

above. Other demographics included in the regression analyses are: marital status at the end of

each year, whether the respondent has a child under 18 living in the household, and

state/province of residence.

       Empirical analyses with longitudinal data suffer from attrition. Our two datasets, SIPP

and SLID have comparable response and attrition rates.23 We test if attrition influenced our

sample loss was 35% (over 12 waves) in 1996 panel, 31% (over 9 waves) in 2001 panel, and
37% (over 12 waves) in 2004 panel (National Research Council, 2009; US Census Bureau,
2008). By Wave 8, the rates of sample loss for the 1996, 2001, and 2004 panels were 31, 30 and
34 %, respectively (US Census Bureau, 2008). SLID has comparable response rates to SIPP. In

weights and second, conduct additional analyses restricting samples to individuals who are

present in all waves. The results from these analyses, presented in Appendix Tables 2 and 3 are

qualitatively similar to those reported in the paper (based on respondents with at least two

observations in each panel).

                                                Research Strategy

        Our objective is to study the trajectories of the labor market outcomes of immigrants at

the two destinations using longitudinal data pooled across panels. We begin with a model as

described in equation (1) estimated on a sample of nonelderly adults, aged 25 to 59 in the base

year, separately for each country:

        (1) Y it   i 0  X it B   1 *T t   2 * IMM i *T t   it

where Yit is one of the three labor market outcomes of individual i in year t (whether currently

employed, log annual hours worked, or log hourly wage). The vector X denotes individual

characteristics, namely educational attainment (education categories), whether currently married,

and whether has children. Equation (1) includes a full set of individual fixed effects (  i 0 ) that

control for time-invariant individual characteristics including characteristics at arrival. The

variable IMM is equal to 1 if the respondent is foreign-born, and 0 otherwise. Tt is a trend

variable denoting the number of years since the first interview and goes from 0 to 3.



Panel 2 (beginning in 1996), the initial response rate was 89.5%, which had fallen to 82.7% by
the fourth year of the panel. Over time, the representativeness of each panel has diminished, such
that by Panel 5 (starting in 2005), the initial response rate was 78.8%, which fell to 72.8% by the
fourth year of the panel. For details see: http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb-
bmdi/document/3889_D13_T2_V2-eng.pdf. Table 5.2 p16 .
24
   The distinction between sample attrition due to return migration, onward migration and
attrition due to other reasons is important (see Aydemir & Robinson, 2008). Unfortunately, our
data do not provide information that would allow us to separate the cause of attrition.
                                                            15
       Economic assimilation is defined as the difference in annual earnings growth of

immigrants and natives (convergence of earnings) (Borjas 1989, 1994). The coefficient on T

captures the effect of age (experience and other time varying effects) and is restricted to be the

same for immigrants and natives. The coefficient on IMM*T captures the YSI effect.25

       The coefficients of interest are:  1 that estimates the average annual growth in the labor

market outcome for native-born persons and  1   2 that estimates the wage growth for

immigrants; a 2 is the coefficient of economic assimilation and captures the difference in annual

growth of the labor market outcome of immigrants and natives. Further, to estimate if immigrant

assimilation differs by immigrants’ region of origin, the variable IMM is replaced by four

dummy variables indicating immigrants’ the region of origin: Asia, Europe, Africa and the

Middle East, and Latin America. Because labor market experience differs by gender, all analyses

are done separately for men and women. The use of person fixed effects is important as they

control for unmeasured, person-specific factors that may be correlated with both selection of

immigrants into different host countries (or length of stay in the host country) and immigrants’

labor market outcomes (employment, hours worked, and wage).

       Next, to estimate if immigrant economic assimilation differs by length of residence in the

host country, a slightly modified version of equation (1), as follows, is estimated:

       (2) Y it   i 0  X it    1 * T t    2 c * YSI c * T t  e it
                                                c



There is one primary difference between Equations (1) and (2). In equation (2) the variable

IMM is replaced with dummy variables YSI indicating years since immigration categories: 0-5

years, 6-10 years, 11-20 years and more than 20 years in the men’s analysis; and 0-10 years, 11-

25
  We did the analysis including age controls as dummy variables. The results were similar to
those reported. This is expected. Our models include individual fixed effects. Therefore, only a
small proportion of the sample report variation in age dummies across years.
                                                            16
20 years, and >20 years in the women’s analysis.26 Equation (2) also includes a full set of

individual fixed effects, denoted by  i 0 .

         Return migration may be selective on immigrant economic performance in the host

country, which may bias labor market trajectories based on cross-sectional analysis (Ibarraran

and Lubotsky, 2007, Kaushal, 2011).27 In a comparative analysis such bias may also occur if

selectivity in return migration differs for migrants in Canada and the U.S. Our longitudinal

approach yields estimates that describe how the earnings of immigrants change with time in the

host country for the sample of immigrants who are present throughout the period of analysis.

The use of person fixed effects will adjust for those unobserved and observed immigrant

characteristics, e.g. characteristics at arrival, that have a time invariant influence on earnings. We

acknowledge that the longitudinal sample is also affected by return migration (if people

outmigrate between the waves). However, our longitudinal analysis will not be affected by the

mechanical changes in sample composition across years-since-immigration categories due to

return migration that has afflicted all research based on cross-sectional data. To determine the

extent of bias in estimates based on cross-sectional data, we also compare the short-term

trajectories of labor market outcomes from our longitudinal models with trajectories based on

synthetic cohort models, described in detail below, that are commonly used in research based on

Census data (e.g. Antecol et al, 2006).

       Table 1 has descriptive statistics on foreign-born and native-born persons aged 25 to 59

in Canada and the U.S. in the base year (first observed year) of each panel. The immigrant

sample is further restricted to persons who entered the host country after age 16. On average,

immigrant men and women in Canada are four to five years older than immigrant men and

women in the U.S., while the average ages of native men and women are roughly the same

across the two countries. Immigrants in Canada are also more likely to be married. But while

immigrant men in both countries are equally likely to have children, immigrant women in

Canada are somewhat less likely to have children than immigrant women in the U.S.

       As documented in previous research, immigrants in Canada are more educated than

immigrants in the U.S. or the native born Canadian population: 31% of immigrant men and 28%

immigrant women in the U.S. do not have a high-school degree – which is roughly double the

corresponding proportions of high-school dropouts among immigrants in Canada; 63% of

immigrant women and 66% of immigrant men in Canada have at least some college education,

compared to less than half of immigrant men and women in the U.S. with college education. On

the other hand, the U.S. born are somewhat more educated than men and women born in Canada.

       Immigrants in the two countries also differ markedly in terms of their regions of origin.

Approximately 40% of immigrants in Canada are from Europe, Australia and New Zealand; in

the U.S., the corresponding proportion from this region is 14%. Over half the U.S. immigrant

sample, compared to only 12% of the Canadian immigrant sample, is from Latin America; about

40% of the Canadian immigrant sample and a quarter of the U.S. immigrant sample is Asian; and

9% of the Canadian sample and 7% of the U.S. immigrant sample are from Africa and the

Middle East.




                                                18
       In the U.S., immigrant men are somewhat more likely to be employed and immigrant

women are somewhat less likely to be employed than immigrants of corresponding gender in

Canada. Both immigrant and native-born workers in Canada are more than twice as likely to be

covered by a union as immigrant and native workers in the U.S. Overall, workers in the U.S.

work more hours than workers in Canada; and among U.S. workers the annual hours worked are

greater for the U.S. born than the foreign-born. Despite their better educational credentials, the

average wage of immigrant men in Canada is roughly the same as that of native-born men, and

the average wage of immigrant women is about seven percent lower. The average wage of

immigrant men in the U.S. is 18 % lower than that of native men and the average wage of

immigrant women is 10% lower than that of native women, which is expected given their

relatively lower educational credentials.

Multivariate Analysis

Employment and Hours Worked Trajectories of Immigrant Men

       We first present labor market trajectories of immigrant men. Table 2 presents estimates of

the employment trajectories of men using longitudinal data. All models control for respondent’s

educational attainment, marital status, whether respondent has children under 18 in the

household, and person fixed effects. Because the models include person fixed effects, all time-

invariant controls drop out. Model 1 estimates the average trajectory for all immigrants, Model 2

provides estimates by years-since-immigration, and Model 3 provides estimates by region of

origin.28 The trend variable measures years since the first observed year of the panel.




28
  We evaluated how sample attrition may affect the results by comparing models based on
respondents present in at least 2 waves and those present across all waves of the survey. The
results are qualitatively similar (see Appendix Table 3), suggesting that attrition is not likely to
seriously bias the results.
                                                  19
       The coefficient on the trend variable provides the average annual growth in employment

among the native-born during the four years of the longitudinal study and the coefficient on the

interaction term between foreign-born and trend estimates the difference in employment growth

between the foreign-born and native-born. Note that we are not interested in the overall

trajectories of labor market outcomes of immigrants in the two countries, but their rates of

assimilation. The overall trajectory is a combination of two factors: economic conditions in the

host country and immigrant relative performance. We are interested in the latter, which provides

the relative growth in employment (or hours worked or real wage) of immigrants after

controlling for the overall economic trend in the host country.29

       Estimates show that native-born men in both countries experienced a decline in

employment in the four years of the longitudinal study period. Immigrant men in Canada

experienced the same trend as natives; immigrant men in the U.S., on the other hand,

experienced a net growth over the native trend. Further analysis (Table 2, columns 3-6) shows

that this difference in employment trajectories is on account of immigrants with a high-school or

lower education, who saw a net growth in employment (over the native trend) in the U.S. but not

in Canada. The employment trajectories of immigrants with more than a high-school degree are

similar in both countries.

       Employment growth varies by immigrants’ YSI. In both countries, there is a net growth

in employment among recent arrivals. Immigrant men in Canada with more than 20 YSI, on the

other hand, experienced a 1.7 percentage-point annual decline in employment (over the native



29
  The last year of observation in the Canadian data is 2008 – the beginning of a recessionary
period (the U.S. data covers through 2007 only). We conduct analysis excluding 2008 and find
similar results for employment status and hourly wage for both the men’s and women’s analyses.
The increase in hours worked for the 0-5 year male cohort remains similar in magnitude but is
reduced to non-significance.

trend), perhaps due to early retirement. 30 In the U.S., on the other hand, immigrant men in the

country for more than 20 years defied the national trend of decline in male employment. There

are some differences in the employment trajectories of immigrants from different regions of

origin in the two countries. However, further analysis shows that the differences are largely

confined to low-educated immigrants in the U.S., who experienced a higher growth in

employment over the national trend (Table 2, column 5).

       Table 3 presents estimates from models with log hours worked as the dependent variable.

Overall results are similar to those in the employment analysis: on average there is a positive

relative growth in hours worked among immigrant men in the U.S. (relative to U.S. natives), but

not in Canada. Among recent immigrants, there is a positive relative growth in hours worked of

immigrant men in both countries; immigrant men in Canada for more than 20 years also

experienced a decline in hours worked during the study period.

       To sum up, estimates based on person fixed effects models show that on average there is

no evidence of additional growth in employment or hours worked of immigrant men (relative to

Canadian-born men) in Canada, but positive annual growth on both outcomes of immigrant men

(relative to U.S. born) in the U.S. Recent immigrant men in both countries experienced a relative

positive growth in employment and hours worked, but there is evidence of a decline in

employment and hours worked (relative to natives) among earlier arrivals in Canada. In Canada,

there is generally not much difference in employment and hours worked growth of low- and

high-educated immigrant men. In the U.S., on the other hand, employment growth is mostly




30
  We further explored the decline in employment among earlier cohort of immigrants in Canada
by stratifying the data based on age in the base year of the survey in two groups: men aged 25-42
and men aged 43-59. Our estimates indicate that the decline in employment is significant only
for immigrant men aged 43-59.
                                                21
confined to the low-educated, especially for recent arrivals, but hours worked trajectories are

approximately the same for the low- and high-educated.

Wage Trajectories

          Our final outcome is log hourly wage.31 Estimates in Table 4 show that on average there

is no wage assimilation experienced by immigrants in Canada. Immigrants in the U.S., on the

other hand, experienced a 1.3 % annual growth in real wage over the wage growth experienced

by native men. Estimates in Model 2 show that assimilation continues for a longer period after

arrival among immigrant men in the U.S. than among immigrant men in Canada. Immigrant men

in Canada for 0-5 years experienced a 2.2% growth in hourly wage in addition to the wage

growth of 2.2% experienced by native men, but there is no additional earnings growth for

immigrant men living in Canada for more than 5 years. Immigrant men in the U.S. for 0-10 years

experienced a 3% increase in wages in addition to the 1.2% wage growth experienced by all

men, but most of the additional growth is due to male immigrants from Latin America, the most

disadvantaged immigrant group in the U.S. (see e.g. Borjas, 2007). In Canada, on the other hand,

estimates suggest no wage assimilation among immigrant men stratified by their country of

origin.

          The difference in wage assimilation between immigrants in the two countries is wider

among the low-educated. In regressions for Canada, the coefficient on the interaction term

between YSI categories and trend variables are mostly negative and always statistically

31
  The results in Tables 2 and 3 show that employment levels and hours worked (the coefficient
on the trend variable) are decreasing throughout the sample period in both countries. This means
that the composition of those that are working is also changing in these countries. To provide a
complete picture, we present trajectories of employment, hours worked as well as wage. Note
that our longitudinal analysis, unbalanced panel is based on respondents who are in the sample
for at least two waves and balanced panel is based on respondents who are in the sample in all
waves. Thus our analysis is less affected by the compositional changes than a corresponding
analysis based on cross-sectional data.
                                                 22
insignificant for low-educated men. In contrast, annual earnings assimilation (wage growth

above the national trend) is between 3% and 3.7% for low-educated immigrant men during their

first decade of U.S. residence. This could be because of the differences in the structures of labor

market and welfare institutions in the two countries that incentivize faster economic assimilation

in the U.S. and offer fewer incentives for employment and wage assimilation in Canada.32

Alternately, it may also be that due to a lower minimum wage in the U.S. (or the fact that many

low-educated undocumented immigrants get paid less than the minimum wage), low-skilled

immigrants in the U.S. have more catching up to do than low-skilled workers in Canada.

However, our data show that low-skilled immigrant-native wage gaps (adjusted for age and

family composition) are larger in Canada (23.7%) than in the U.S. (18.9%). The short-term

earnings trajectories of recent high-educated (some college or more) immigrant men relative to

natives in both countries are identical, but immigrants living in Canada for more than 20 years

experience a negative assimilation, which is not the case for immigrants in the U.S.

       Table 4 also shows that in the U.S. among men with more than a high school degree,

those from Asia, Africa and the Middle-East have earning growth that is almost 2 percentage

points higher than the earnings growth of the US born population, whereas high educated men

from the two other sending regions –immigrants from Latin America and Europe – experienced

the same wage growth as natives. Our research methodology does not provide any scientific

explanation for this phenomenon. There may be certain other (unmeasured) attributes of

immigrants from Asia, the Middle-East and Africa (e.g. occupation or industry specific-skills)

that may cause this phenomenon.



32
  Immigrant and native outcomes may be differently affected by national policies due to a
number of factors including immigrant eligibility and knowledge of these policies (or programs).
Immigrants may also be culturally averse to utilizing welfare programs.
                                                 23
Women’s Analysis

       Next, we estimate the labor market trajectories of immigrant women in the two countries.

Most previous comparative research has focused on the labor market outcomes of immigrant

men, partly because women are more likely than men to be family migrants rather than labor

migrants. As such, immigrant women’s labor market trajectories are thought to be linked to

spouse’s labor market assimilation and their own fertility choices, making it challenging to study

their assimilation (Mincer, 1962; Schoeni, 1998). Trajectories of women’s labor market

outcomes based on synthetic cohorts from cross-sectional data are especially troublesome as

those are intertwined with differences in immigrant-native fertility patterns and labor force

participation rates, which are both in turn shaped by the economic assimilation of men. Thus,

estimates of immigrant women’s assimilation are likely to confound with long-term trends in

fertility and economic assimilation of immigrant men. The short-term trajectories based on

longitudinal data suffer less from these biases even though they too are influenced by women’s

own fertility decisions and spouse’s economic assimilation. In our analysis, we adjust for

important time-varying determinants of women’s employment such as whether the respondent is

married or has children.

       Estimates in Table 5, Model 1 suggest that overall there is little evidence of any relative

growth in labor market outcomes among immigrant women in Canada (relative to women born

in Canada). Whereas recent (in Canada for <10 years) immigrant women experienced growth in

employment and hours worked (over the national trend), earlier arrivals experienced a modest

negative assimilation on both domains. Lack of growth (or even negative growth) in hours

worked is expected given that in the base year immigrant women in Canada worked more hours

than women born in Canada (Table 1).



                                                24
       Immigrant women in the U.S., on the other hand, experienced both (relative) employment

growth and growth in hours worked, with the latter largely attributable to increased work effort

by women from Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. There is some earnings assimilation

of recently arrived immigrant women in the U.S., but not in Canada. In both countries, earlier

arrivals (in the host country for more than 20 years) experienced a decline in earnings, which

might be an indicator of limited long-term wage growth opportunities in the occupations (low-

end service occupations) or locations (e.g. ethnic enclaves) where a majority of immigrant

women work in the two countries. It is also possible that female earlier arrivals in both countries

seek more flexible jobs with lower wages to take care of children or grandchildren. In general,

while results are broadly similar on some dimensions to men’s analysis, the cross-country

difference seems to be smaller for women than for men.

Comparison: Repeated Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Results

       Previous research in the U.S. and Canada has documented that cross-sectional synthetic

cohort methodology over-estimates wage assimilation. Next, we present immigrant labor market

trajectories using synthetic cohort methodology with multiple cross-sections of data (base years

of each panel). Because previous U.S.-Canada comparative research that used a synthetic cohort

methodology focused on immigrant men, for comparison, we restrict this analysis to the labor

market outcomes of men and adopt models similar to Antecol et al. (2006). Our objective here is

not to compare our findings with those of Antecol and colleagues, as their analysis pertained to

immigrant labor market trajectories in the two countries during the eighties whereas we focus on

a more recent period from 1996-2008. Our objective is to investigate how inferences drawn from

the two analyses, cross-sectional synthetic cohort and longitudinal, differ. The results from the

two analyses could differ simply because of the differences in methodologies or because the



                                                25
longitudinal analysis is based on three to four years of additional data on the actual trajectories of

labor market outcomes of immigrants.33

       Table 6 presents results from the cross-sectional analysis. All regressions control for age

(dummy variable for age categories: 25-30, 31-35, 36-40, 41-45, 46-50, 51-55, 56-60, and 61-

64), education (four categories: less than high school, high school degree, some college or

associate degree, and bachelor degree or above), state/province of residence (dummy variables

for each state/province), year of observation (a dummy variable for each year), cohort of arrival

(arrived before 1970, during 1970-1979, 1980-1989, 1990 or after (comparison category: US

born), and years-since- immigration [0-5 years (comparison category), 6-10 years, 11-20 years,

>20 years). For immigrants, the last three variables – year of observation, cohort of arrival, and

years-since-immigration are collinear (Years-since-immigration=year of observation minus

cohort of arrival). We address this issue by restricting the effect of year of observation to be the

same for immigrants and natives.34 Further following previous research age and education effects

are allowed to differ across years (of observation) by including interactions of year dummy

variables and age category dummy variables and interactions of year dummy variables and

education dummy variables (Antecol et al. 2006). While we present arrival cohort fixed effects,

for brevity, we only discuss coefficients on the Years Since Immigration variables.

       One question that arises is whether the trajectories estimated in Table 6 should be

compared with the longitudinal trajectories that adjust for the national trend or with the




33
   We did the cross-sectional analysis with two samples: (i) all respondents in the first year and
(ii) all respondents in year 1 who are present in at least 2 years. The results from these analyses
were qualitatively similar.
34
   The issue of collinearity is also resolved as we include cohort of arrival and years-since-
immigration as a set of dummy variables as indicated above rather than linear variables.
                                                 26
unadjusted trajectories. Because Table 6 controls for arrival cohorts and year effects, we think

the proper comparison is with the adjusted trajectories.

       Table 6 shows that immigrant men in both countries experience slow and steady

increases in employment with time in the host country and the trajectories are roughly the same

in the two countries. In contrast, the short-term employment trajectories based on the

longitudinal data suggest a non-linear trend in employment growth: recent immigrant men in

both countries experience growth in employment (over the national trend); earlier arrivals

experience a decline in employment in Canada and an increase in employment (over the national

trend) in the U.S.

       In both countries, the cross-sectional trajectories suggest a robust growth in hours worked

in the first 10 years upon arrival, a somewhat modest but significant growth in the later years for

immigrants in Canada, but not in the US. Longitudinal trajectories, on the other hand, suggest a

positive growth for new arrivals in Canada, but there is little evidence of growth for earlier

arrivals. Whereas point estimates suggest a higher growth in hours for recent immigrant men in

the U.S., the growth remains statistically significant, albeit modest, for earlier arrivals as well.

       Finally, adjusting for cohort of arrival, the cross-sectional analysis suggests that

immigrant men in both countries experience a wage growth with one difference: for Canadian

immigrants there is no wage growth in the first 20 years after arrival. This last finding also does

not match with the results from our short-term wage trajectories based on longitudinal data,

which show that wage growth among immigrant men in Canada is confined to recent immigrants

(in Canada for less than 5 years).

                                             Conclusion




                                                  27
       We study the short-term trajectories of employment, hours worked, and real wages of

immigrants in Canada and the U.S., using two nationally representative longitudinal datasets: the

Canadian Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID) and the U.S. Survey of Income and

Program Participation (SIPP) covering 1996-2008. We apply person fixed-effects models to

control for time-invariant individual characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first

longitudinal comparative study of immigrant labor market assimilation in Canada and the U.S.

and the first comparative study of immigrant women’s labor market assimilation in the two

countries.

       Our analysis has three main findings: One, on average immigrant men (pooled across

cohorts) in Canada do not experience significant relative growth in the three labor market

outcomes compared to men born in Canada. Immigrant men in the U.S., by contrast, experience

positive annual growth in all three domains relative to U.S. born men. Further analysis shows

that this difference is largely driven by low-educated immigrant men, who experienced faster or

longer duration of relative growth in all three outcomes in the U.S. than in Canada. We attribute

this in part to the differences in the structures of labor market and welfare institutions in the two

countries that incentivize or necessitate faster economic assimilation in the U.S. The earnings

trajectories of recent high-educated immigrant men in both countries are identical, but high-

educated immigrant men living in Canada for more than 20 years experience negative

employment and wage assimilation, which is not the case for immigrants in the U.S. We think

the last finding could also be related to some extent to Canada’s more generous welfare system

(employment and health insurance) that works to depress labor market engagement, especially

for those getting close to retirement age. Indeed, estimates stratified by age suggest that the

results are less robust for younger immigrants in Canada.



                                                  28
       Two, as expected, on all three domains, recent immigrant men in both countries

experience some form of economic assimilation. However, the relative positive growth in

employment, hours worked, and real wages begins to taper off for groups who have been in the

host countries for a longer period, and in the case of Canadian immigrants there is evidence of

early retirement among those who are in the country for more than 20 years. Our findings differ

somewhat from Antecol et al. (2006), which used repeated cross-sections of data. They too

concluded that immigrant men in both countries experienced positive earnings growth, and that

U.S. immigrants experienced higher earnings assimilation than Canadian immigrants. But in

their estimates, earnings growth remained robust for earlier arrivals, which is contrary to our

finding. They also find that in the U.S. employment growth mostly happened in the first few

years after arrival, but for Canadian immigrants it continued into later years as well, which is

contrary to our finding. The difference in our findings could be on account of the difference in

data and methodologies or due to the difference in period under study (they focus on the 1980s,

whereas our study period is from 1996-2008).

       We also estimated synthetic cohort models using multiple panels of SIPP and SLID data.

Similar to Antecol et al., our cross-sectional analysis also shows that wage growth is robust for

earlier arrivals in both countries, and in fact, for immigrants in Canada, the cross-sectional

estimates suggest that almost all the wage growth is confined to immigrants who are in the

country for at least 10 years (11-20 years and 20+ years). Comparing this with the short-term

earnings trajectories based on longitudinal data leads us to conclude that the cross-sectional

trajectories over-estimate the wage assimilation of earlier arrivals in both countries. Our findings

are similar to those of previous research that have used longitudinal data in the U.S. (see e.g.

Lubotsky, 2007).



                                                 29
        Finally, we find that recent immigrant women in the U.S. also experience economic

assimilation on all three domains, and recent immigrant women in Canada experience economic

assimilation in work effort – employment as well as hours worked, but not in wages. In both

countries earlier arrivals (in the host country for more than 20 years) experienced a decline in

relative earnings, which might be an indicator of limited long term wage growth opportunities in

the occupations (low-end service occupations) or locations (e.g. ethnic enclaves) where a

majority of immigrant women, especially the earlier arrivals, work in the two countries. It is also

possible that earlier arrivals among immigrant women in both countries seek more flexible jobs

that come with lower wages to take care of children or grandchildren.

       To sum up, our estimates suggest a faster economic assimilation of immigrants in the

U.S. than in Canada. The difference in immigrant labor market trajectories that we observe could

be on account of the positive selection of immigrants to the U.S. (compared to Canada) in terms

of unobserved attributes (after adjusting for observed attributes) or they could be due to

differences in labor market and welfare institutions that, as we hypothesize, incentivize or

necessitate greater labor market assimilation in the U.S. than in Canada. It could also be

associated with the differences in immigration policies paired with country-specific labor market

regulations. Observed outcomes for immigrants in these countries could also differ as a result of

differences in macroeconomic conditions. In our paper, we include controls for native

trajectories. But this is a potential source of difference if macroeconomic conditions affect

immigrants and natives differently in the two countries. Further, differences in services provided

to immigrants could be an additional source of difference in their trajectories.

       We cannot definitively ascertain the mechanisms leading to the cross-country differences

we observe because our data do not provide information required to draw such inferences. But



                                                 30
our use of comparable longitudinal data does account for some potential sources of bias and is

valuable in generating more rigorous and accurate estimates than studies relying on cross-

sectional data. Further research using richer data or qualitative approaches is needed to establish

the mechanisms through which the cross-country difference is generated.

  Notes: Descriptive statistics are for individuals aged 25-59 in their first wave of each panel and not enrolled in school during the reference year in the Survey of
  Labour and Income Dynamics for Canada, and the Survey of Income and Program Participation in the United States. Immigrants arriving before the age of 17
  and immigrants from the U.S. to Canada and from Canada to the U.S. are excluded from the sample. N corresponds to number of individuals in their first
  observed year of the hourly wage models. Real hourly wage is expressed in January 1996 U.S. dollar for the U.S. data and January 1996 Canadian dollar for the
  Canadian data. Hours worked and current employment status are calculated on the analytic samples from the employment and hours worked models.

Notes: The sample of analysis is individuals aged 25-59 (in their first wave), not enrolled in school, and responded to the survey in two or more years.
Immigrants who arrived before age 17, immigrants from the U.S. to Canada and from Canada to the U.S. are excluded. Employment status is coded as 1 if a
respondent reports more than 0 hours worked in a year, otherwise 0. Figures in each cell are estimated coefficients on the variables listed as row headings.
Coefficients in each model of each column are from a separate regression. All models control for education, marital status, whether the respondent has children
under 18 in the household, and individual fixed effects.
