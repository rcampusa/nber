                            EARNINGS AND EXPECTED RETURNS


                                            ABSTRACT


       The aggregate dividend payout ratio forecasts aggregate excess returns on both stocks and

corporate bonds in post-war US data. Both high corporate profits and high stock prices forecast low

excess returns on equities. When the payout ratio is high, expected returns are high, The payout

ratio’s correlation with business conditions gives it predictive power for returns; it contains

information about future stock and bond returns that is not captured by other variables, The payout

ratio is useful because it captures the temporary components of earnings. The dynamic relationship

between dividends, earnings and stock prices shows that a positive innovation in earnings lowers

expected returns in the near future, but raises them thereafter.

As of May 1996, the dividend yield (D/p) on the Standard & Poor’s Composite Index was

about 2.2 %, which is remarkably low. This is remarkable because it implies negative

expected excess stock returns, based on simple univariate forecasting regressions using the

dividend yield. The price/earnings ratio (P/E) was about 19, which is not atypically high, and

implies positive expected returns based on similar regressions. Which is right?

       Shiner (1984) and Fama and French (1988) estimate regressions of returns on either

lagged D/P or E/P, and find that both have explanatory power, but that D/P has more. Table

1 replicates the basic dividend yield and earnings yield regressions, using quarterly data on

excess returns, dividends, and earnings from the Standtid & Poor’s Composite Index, 1947-

1994. The first two rows show that the dividend yield does indeed produce better forecasts of

future returns, compared to the earnings yield. The coefficient on the dividend yield is

significant and has more than twice the explanatory power of earnings yield. Fama and French

(1988) explain these results: “Earnings are more variable than dividends.. .If this higher

variab i]ity is unrelated to the variation in expected returns, E/P is a noisier measure of

expected returns than D/P. ”

       Another way to compare the forecasting power of E/P and D/P is to put both in the

same regression. 1 The third row in Table 1 shows that if one includes both E/P and D/P, the

results appear unexpected: the dividend yield is still positive and significant, but now the

earnings yield is negative and significant. What explains these results? The explanation must

be that the higher variability of earnings mentioned by Fama and French (1988) is actually



      ‘ Campbell and Shiner (1988b) run annual excess return regressions with both E/P and
D/P, 1871-1987, but only using a 30-year average of E (Table 2. B).

related to expected returns.

       Thetworegressors        are obviously related, since D/P = E/P *D/E.    D/Eis the dividend

payout ratio. Thethirdrow       of Table 1 says that conditional onthe dividend yield, the

earnings yield is negatively correlated with future returns. One way of restating this fact is

that conditional on the dividend yield, the dividend payout ratio is positively correlated with

future returns. This restatement is shown in the last row of Table 1.

       I proceed as follows. Section 1 documents that the payout ratio, conditional on the

dividend yield, forecasts excess returns on equities. In Section 2, I consider why the payout

ratio forecasts returns. In Section 3, I show that the payout ratio forecasts future dividends. I

examine in Section 4 whether the payout ratio also forecasts excess returns on the bond

market. Sect ion 5 looks at the payout ratio in relation to business conditions, and shows

evidence cons istent with the idea that the payout ratio and the dividend yield are measures of

two different determinants of expected returns: a “price” effect, which measures how high

current stock prices are relative to some long-term average, and a “profit” effect, which

measures how high current profits are relative to some long-term average. Section 6 traces out

the dynamic imp]ications of changes in earnings and dividends on prices. Section 7 examines

the performance of dividend-free measures of the “price” and “profit” effects both in post-war

quarterly data and in annual data 1871-1987. Section 8 provides evidence on the effects of

repurchases on dividends in more recent years,

       The main explanation for the payout ratio’s predictive ability is that the payout ratio is

a good measure of current business conditions. Since expected returns vary over the business

cycle, the payout ratio forecasts future returns.
1. The Payout Ratio and Expected Stock Returns

       Table 2 shows (in the bottom row) basic summary statistics for the main series studied

in this paper, and also presents (in the upper rows) bivariate Granger-causality tests and

correlations across series. Here and for the rest of this paper, I use the natural log of the

payout ratio and of the dividend yield (ln(D/E) = d-e, and ln(D/P) = d-p). Both the payout

ratio and the dividend yield are based on quarterly data compiled by Standard and Poor’s,

using the previous four quarter’s total earnings and dividends for the companies in the S&P

Composite Index (additional information on these and other variables is given in the

Appendix). These two series are shown in Figure 1.

        I focus on excess returns, the total (continuous y compounded) returns including

reinvested dividends on the S&P Composite Index minus the return on a portfolio of one-

month treasury bills. Hereafter, the word “return” means excess return over the riskless rate.

1’annualize returns so that the regression coefficients are comparable across different horizons .Z

Table 2 also shows the three-month t-bill yield, the annualized CPI inflation rate, and growth

rates of earnings and dividends as reported by S&P.

       The main focus of this paper is on post-war data, since there are convincing reasons to

believe dividend policy was very different in previous years. Section 7 discusses the issue of

sample period in greater detail.

       The shaded cells in Table 2 show when the series listed in the row Granger-cause the



        a So that ~ = N * (ln(CSTIND,+~)-ln(CSTINDJ) where CSTIND is an index of total

annual data.
series listed in the column, using four lags of quarterly data. These facts will be useful in

interpreting the regressions presented later on. For now, it’s worth noting the payout ratio

appears to be a very promising variable, in that it Granger-causes all the other variables

(except Ae) and is Granger-caused by none.3

       Table 3 shows quarterly, annual, and biannual regression of returns on dividend yield

and dividend payout. I regress this period’s stock returns against last period’s payout ratio and

dividend yield, and find that both the payout ratio and the dividend yield are helpful in

forecasting returns. The first two rows show the annual results and biannual results using non-

overlapping observations; again, both the dividend yield and the payout ratio are significant

explanatory of future returns, even with only 48 annual and 24 biannual observations.

Inclusion of the payout ratio typically causes R2 to rise by about half again compared to a

regression with only lagged returns and the dividend yield.4

       The last three rows show quarterly results. I focus on quarterly results throughout this

paper, since that is the frequency at dividends and earnings are reported.   In regressions by

themselves, both the dividend yield and the payout ratio are positively correlated with future

returns, although the payout ratio is insignificant] y different from zero. The last row shows



        5 Here and in Table 4, some caution should be used in interpreting regressions of Ae or
Ad on its own lagged value and lagged d-e. In a regression of Ad on lagged Ad and lagged d-
e, the inclusion of lagged d-e is equivalent to including twice lagged d-e and Ae lagged once.
Interpretation is further affected by the fact that the quarterly observations on E and D are
overlapping four-quarter moving averages, so naturally (as can been seen in Table 2) Ae and
Ad are positively autocorrelated.

        4 As a benchmark for the amount of explanatory power added by included the payout
ratio, the biannual regressions with only lagged returns and the dividend yield has an R2 of
0.30 compared to 0.44 in Table 3.
                                                                                                    5

the basic regression of this paper. When included in the same regression, the coefficients on

both the dividend yield and the payout ratio rise; consequently, both are now positive and

significant. Perhaps the fact (row 2) that the payout ratio is not a particularly impressive

univariate predictor of returns (unlike the dividend yield) explains its hitherto obscure role in

empirical asset pricing.

         What does it mean that the payout ratio is not significant by itself, but only in the

presence of the dividend yield? As shown in Table 2, d-e and d-p have a correlation of -0.37

during this period (the annual correlation is -0.41 ).5 Therefore, if both d-e and d-p “belong”

on the right-hand side of the forecasting equation, it’s no surprise that omitting one variable

causes the remaining variable to have a smaller estimated coefficient, due to omitted variable

bias.’

         In summary, both the payout ratio and the dividend yield appear to be positively and

significantly correlated with future stock returns. The payout ratio is slightly less robust than

the dividend yield, since it does poorly by itself. The Appendix studies the robustness of the




        ~The negative correlation of d-e and d-p implies that the temporary components (that
is, the parts not explained by the cointegrating relationships) of p and e are negatively
correlated. For an individual firm, unexpected changes in earnings and stock prices are
generally thought to be positively correlated. See, for example, Kormendi and Lipe (1987).
         Table 2 shows that Ae and excess returns have a quarterly contemporaneous
correlation of -O,17. The negative correlation holds both pre- and post-1970, although the
negative correlation is much more intense in the latter period. Thus it is not solely a
phenomena of the high inflation 1970’s. Real earnings growth and excess returns are also
negatively correlated. I will return to this issue in section 6.

       G Since R2 rises substantial y when d-e is included, it does not appear that collinearity
between d-e and d-p is a serious problem. As further evidence on whether d-e and d-p
measure the same thing, the R2 in a regression on one on the other is 0.13.
                                                                                                   6

qu~terl y results, and finds that the results do not change much if one changes the sample

period, changes the method of measuring the payout ratio, or excludes outliers.

2. Why Does The Payout Ratio Forecast Returns?

       There appear to be four possible explanations of why the payout ratio forecasts returns.

(1) The payout ratio forecasts returns not because it measures expected returns but because it

measures future dividend growth, and thus “cleans up” the dividend yield as a measure of

expected returns. (2) The payout ratio forecasts future returns because it is correlated with

expected returns. (3) The payout ratio forecas~ future returns because it is correlated with

fads, irrationality, or over-reaction by investors.7 (4) The payout ratio significantly forecast

returns because it is one of the 5 % of irrelevant variables which have been found by academic

data-dredging.

       I attack these issues as follows. First 1 study the relationship between the payout ratio

and future dividends and earnings. I consider whether the payout ratio is proxying for future

dividend growth and not expected returns as in (1). I next test whether bond returns are

forecasted by the payout ratio, since if (2) is true, one would expect the payout ratio to predict

bond returns. I next consider whether the payout ratio is a business cycle variable that is likely

correlated with discount rates, as in (2). I test whether the payout ratio contains information

about future returns that is not present in other variables. In considering the business cycle

and dynamic behavior of returns, I comment briefly on (3). I also examine whether one really

needs dividends at all in order to capture the information present in both the payout ratio and


        7 This might be the case if the payout ratio varies systematical y with the causes of fads
(for example, over-optimism in good times, or over-reaction to current earnings).
                                                                                                     7

the dividend yield.

        As to point (4), I can say only that previous research and a long pre-scientific tradition

have identified P/E and D/P as important variables predicting stock returns. If one believes

that P/E and D/P measure expected returns, then it is important to understand their interaction.

3. The Payout Ratio, Dividends, and Earnings

        A useful starting point is the simple Gordon (1962) model of stock prices:


                                           P=~
                                              r –g




where g is the growth rate of dividends and r is the discount rate, and both are fixed constants.

Manipulation of the Gordon equation shows that D/P = r - g, so that D/P is a measure of both

the discount rate and of future dividend growth. Campbell and Shiner (1988a) have a

dynamic, stochastic Gordon model:




where   K   is an unimportant constant. In the static Gordon model r =D/P + g, and in the

dynamic model,
Today’s stock price, p, endogenously adjusts so that expected returns on the stock market

equal the required rate of return. The dividend yield is a good measure of one-period expected

returns, but not a perfect measure, since it may be correlated with future returns and future

dividend growth.

       Using the Gordon model, it is easy to see that d-p is an noisy measure of E[rJ. It is

plausible that d-e is correlated with the measurement error in d-p, since the measurement error

in d-p depends on future dividend growth. If d-e were positively correlated with future

dividend growth but had zero correlation with expected returns, we would expect that d-e

would spuriously appear with a positive and significant coefficient (since it is “cleaning up”

the measurement error in d-p). 8

       Is d-e positivel y correlated with future dividend growth?   Some researchers find that

dividends follow a random walk.9 If this were the case, then the positive and significant

coefficient on d-e could not be caused by its correlation with future dividend growth. Others

find that dividend growth is explained by lagged returns, lagged yields, and lagged earnings. 10




      8 If this were the case, d-e would still be a useful variable for forecasting returns, but it
would not reveal anything about stochastic discount rates.

       g Froot and Obstfeld (1991), using S&P data 1900-1988, find that dividends follow a
random walk; Adl is not explained by lagged Adt or by the lagged dividend yield. Cochrane
(1994) uses annual CRSP data from 1927-1988 and finds dividends follow “nearl y“ a random
walk and are not forecast by lagged dividends or yields.

        ‘0Marsh and Merton (1987) find that using annual CRSP data 1926-1980, Ad, is
explained by lagged returns. Campbell and Shiner (1987, 1988b) find that Adt is explained by
lagged dividend yields, lagged dividend growth, and a long average of the earnings price ratio
using annual real S&P dividends 1871-1986. See also Kormendi and Zarowin (1994) for a
cross-sectional anal ysis.
                                                                                                   9

       Table 2 shows that d-e Granger-causes Ad, using quarter] y data. However, the

correlation of the dividend payout ratio and future dividend growth is negative: when the

dividend payout ratio is low, dividends rise. 11 Thus the correlation of d-e and future dividend

growth goes in the opposite direction needed for the simple “spurious” explanation of the

ability of the payout ratio to forecast returns. 12

       Table 4 shows that in annual data the payout ratio is negatively correlated with future

dividends and positively correlated with future earnings, so that there is a simple error-

correction model inherent in the relationship between these variables. Rows 1-3 certainly do

not suggest that future dividends are completely unpredictable given current information. The

correlation between d-e and future Ad appears somewhat weaker in Table 4 than in Table 2.

Rows 4-5 suggest that the payout ratio is useful in forecasting future Ae, although the

relationship again appears somewhat muddled in row 6 and in Table 2.

       I conclude from the annual results in Table 4 and from the quarterly results in Table 2

that the payout ratio is possibly useful in forecasting future dividends and earnings.

       As an alternate approach to the “cleaning up” issue, Kothari and Shanken (1992)

regress current returns on realized future dividend growth and realized future returns, and on

the lagged dividend yield. Kothari and Shanken find that the coefficient on D/P approximate] y

doubles when one includes future dividend growth and future returns. Table 5 repeats this




       ‘‘ However, Blanchard (1993) finds the opposite result (p. 92).

       ‘z Of course, the negative relationship between d-e and future dividends in Table 4 is at
the annual frequency. It could be that d-e is still positively correlated with future dividends at
more long-term horizons.
                                                                                                10

exercise but includes the dividend payout ratio as well. Inclusion of either future dividends

and returns, or future earnings and returns, does not appear to greatly affect the coefficients on

the payout ratio and the dividend yield from Table 3. I conclude that the payout ratio does not

appear to on]y reflect information about future dividends or earnings, but also information

about future returns.

4. Interest Rate Spreads and Returns on Bonds and Stocks

       If the payout ratio is correlated with time-varying discount rates, one would expect it to

forecast returns on all risky assets, including assets not paying dividends.

       Table 6 explores the ability of the dividend payout ratio to forecast returns on corporate

bonds. Both the dividend yield and the payout ratio appear to be useful variables in

forecasting future bond returns. Both are positively correlated with future returns with

coefficients ofs imilar magnitude; both are more than two standard errors from zero for the

lower quality bonds.

        Table 6 also shows the effect of two interest rate variables studied by Fama and French

( 1989). TERM, the term premium, is the difference between the AAA Corporate bond rate

and the 1-month treasury bill rate. DEFAULT, the default premium, is the difference between

the rate on a portfolio of “All” corporate bonds and the AAA Corporate bond rate. Table 6

also shows these interest rate variables in relation to excess returns on the S&P Composite

Index and on a portfolio of small stocks.

       Like Fama and French (1989), I find that TERM appears to be positive] y and

significantly related to future returns on both stocks and bonds, with slope coefficients that do
                                                                                                  11

not vary much across assets. Like them, I also find that the dividend price ratio is positively

and significant] y related to future returns on both stocks and bonds, with slope coefficients that

increase with riskiness of the assets. I find that DEFAULT appears to contain no information

(in addition to that already contained by d-e, d-p, and TERM) about future returns.’3

        Like the dividend yield, the dividend payout ratio has a coefficient which generally

increases with the riskiness of the asset. This suggests that the two variables play similar

roles: both measure the required rate of return on risky assets. 14 The inclusion of DEFAULT

and TERM generally reduces the coefficient on d-e somewhat. 15 For low-grade bonds and for

the S&P Composite index, however, the payout ratio is still more than two standard errors

from zero. I conclude that the payout ratio contains information about discount factors for

risky assets that is not present in interest rate variables,

          Fama and French (1989) interpret their interest rate spread results to mean that

expected re[urns on stocks and bonds are lower when business conditions are strong. I next

turn to examining whether the payout ratio predicts future returns for the same reason. The

results of the next two sections suggest that the payout ratio is also a cyclical variable.




       13Although the coefficient on DEFAULT increases with the riskiness of bonds, it has
the wrong sign for stocks.

       14The coefficient on the payout ratio is smaller for small stocks than for the S&P
Composite index, although it is imprecise] y estimated. Removing TERM and DEFAULT
from the small stocks equation results in a rise of the coefficient on d-e to about 0.300,
although the standard error is stil I large so the coefficient is insignificant.

        ‘5The payout ratio’s correlation with TERM is about zero and with DEFAULT is 0.25
                                                                                                     12

5. The Payout Ratio and Business Conditions

        Both evidence and theory suggest that expected returns vary over the business cycle. ‘b

        While dividends are smooth, earnings are highly cyclical (the smoothness of dividends

relative to earnings can be seen in Table 2, where dividend growth has half the variation of

earnings growth). Lintner (1956) documents that managers engage in dividend smoothing,

while Lucas (1977) lists as one of the seven main features of business cycles that “business

profits show high conformity and much greater amplitude than other series. ” This means the

payout ratio is a measure of business conditions. The payout ratio should be low when

earnings are strong and high when earnings are weak. This explains why the payout ratio has

forecasting power for expected returns.

       If this explanation is correct, then what matters for forecasting returns is not really the

payout ratio per se, but rather the transitory component of earnings. Since the payout ratio

happens to be an excellent measure of the business cycle and of the transitory component of

earnings, it contains information about future returns.

       The fact that   both   the dividend yield and the dividend payout ratio forecast returns

suggests that there are two components of expected returns. 17 When profits (measured by the

payout ratio) and prices (measured by the dividend yield) are high, expected returns are low. I

call this latter effect a “price” effect rather than a “discount rate” effect to emphasize that it

remains unclear whether the temporary components of stock prices can be rationalized by any


       16For recent evidence, see Chen, Roll, and Ross (1986), Chen (1991); for theory, see
Lucas (1978) and Campbell and Cochrane (1994).

       17Fama and French (1989) and Cochrane (1991) make similar points.
                                                                                                    13

remonable time-varying discount rate. In contrast, the “profit” effect appears to be readily

understandable and fits in nicely with the desirable properties that a discount rate should have,

since it is correlated with transitory components of income and presumably consumption.

       Table 7 investigates whether the payout ratio contains information that is not present in

other variables that move over the business cycle.

       First, Table 7 examines changes in earnings and dividends themselves. Adding

quarterly changes in dividends and earnings does not change much in the regression. Second,

Table 7 examines short-term nominal interest rates and inflation. Figure 1 shows that the

payout ratio was low in the 1970’s, when interest rates and inflation were high, and Table 2

shows that d-e is negatively correlated with interest rates and inflation. Bodie, Kane, and

Marcus (1996) explain that the low P/E ratio’s in the 1970’s reflected “the market’s

assessment that earnings in these periods are of ‘lower quality,’ artificial] y distorted by

inflation, and warranting lower P/E ratios. ”

       As shown in Table 7, inclusion of lagged inflation and lagged t-bill rates results in a

decrease in the coefficient of the payout ratio. While neither the interest rate nor inflation

variables are close to significant, the coefficient on the payout ratio falls so that it has a p-

value of O.12. The payout ratio, inflation, and short-term rate are all jointly significant with a

p-value of 0.02. It is also useful to recall from Table 2 that the payout ratio is helpful in

forecasting future inflation and interest rates.

       Third, Table 7 includes as a dummy variable equal to one if the quarter contains a

month between business cycle peak and trough, as defined by the National Bureau of

Economic Research, This variable, RECESSION, has little effect on the results. Fourth,
                                                                                                    14

Table ‘7includes two ratios which move over the business cycle: the log of the consumption to

GDP ratio, and the log of the investment to GDP ratio. la Again, including these variables

lowered the coefficient and raised the standard error on the payout ratio, so that d-e now has a

p-value of 0.08. Again, the payout ratio, the investment ratio, and the consumption ratio are

all jointly significant with a p-value of 0.02.

          I conclude from Table 7 that there is some evidence that the payout ratio reflects the

same information already present in other business cycle variables, namely inflation, interest

rates, consumption, and investment. Inclusion of these variables primarily raise the standard

error of the estimated effect of the payout ratio, as the coefficient stays around .3. While the

payout ratio is not as robust as the dividend yield, it still appears to be useful information.

          Next, here and in section 7, I test the conjecture that profit and price (as opposed to

dividends) matter by dispensing with the dividend yield or the payout ratio and attempting to

find other variables that capture the fact that dividends are simply a slowly-moving average

adjusting to changes in future earnings. Table 8 shows the results.

          First, using annual data, I include the ratio of the book value of the S&P Index to the

market value. 19 As the first regression shows, the market-to-book ratio appears to contain no

information that it is not already present in the dividend yield .20 Dropping the dividend yield,



       ‘8The consumption to GDP ratio is the same variable used in Cochrane (1994); the
investment to GDP ratio is similar but not identical to the variable in Cochrane (1991).

        19This market to book is based on the S&P Industrial Index, which has a longer time-
series for book value than the Composite Index.

          20This is not surprising— for postwar data, given the evidence in Kothari and Shanken
(1995).
                                                                                                   15

I find that the market-to-book ratio does a tolerable job of capturing the effect of high stock

prices on future returns.

        Next, using quarterly data, I replace the payout ratio with a GDP-based measure of

whether current profits are “high” relative to some more SIOWI
                                                             y moving benchmark.         I use the

ratio of profits after tax reported by the corporate sector to the gross domestic product of the

corporate sector. Alongside the payout ratio, this variable is insignificantly different from

zero. Dropping the payout ratio, this variable does a fair job replicating the effect of the

payout ratio.

       The lesson from Table 8 is that there appear to be two separate determinants of time-

varying expected returns. The first variable measures how high current prices are relative to

slowly-moving measures of value like dividends and book value. This is the component of

stock market predictability that has received the most attention (e. g., from Shiner (1984), and

Fama and French (1988)). The mean-reverting properties of stock prices presumably also

reflect the presence of this effect. The second variable measures how high current profits are

relative to some slowly moving average like dividends or corporate product, In that profits are

a cyclical variable, the “profit effect” has been documented by Fama and French (1989), Chen

(1991), and others.

       If this pattern were due to over-reaction of prices to earnings, we ‘d expect to see

positive contemporaneous correlation of Ae and returns, which we do not observe in the data. 2’




        2’ What we obsene is a negative correlation that is sometimes statistically significant (if
measured as a simple univariate correlation or in Table 5), but insignificantly different from
zero in the VAR estimated in the next section.
                                                                                                    16

So it is not obvious how a simple overreaction story fits in with the profit effect. Of course,

the price effect is still an open question. The payout ratio (along with interest rate variables)

purges the dividend yield of its cyclical variation. So the dividend yield represents the

discount rate changes that are not explained by changes in risk aversion induced by the

business cycle. Thus, there must be changes to the covariance of marginal utility and returns

which remain mysterious in origin.

6. Dynamics of Dividends, Earnings, and Prices

        One way to summarize the data and its implications is by estimating a vector

autoregression (VAR). Impulse response functions from a VAR show the dynamic effect of an

innovation in one variable on the other variables in the system.

        This section relies heavily on Cochrane (1994). He studies a bivariate system

consisting of dividends, prices, and a cointegrating vector (d-p). The inclusion of an error

correction term, d-p, forces dividends and prices to move together in the long-term. ‘z

        In the present paper, there are three variables of interest and two long-term

relationships.   I therefore study a system consisting of three variables, dividends, earnings, and

prices, and two cointegrated vectors (d-p and d-e). This system with two restrictions is

equivalent to an unrestricted VAR in three variables: returns (~-R~), dividend yield (d-p), and

the payout ratio (d-e). 23

        I estimate this unrestricted VAR, using quarterly data from 1947Q1 to 1994Q4, and


        22And is predicated on the assumption that the dividend yield is a stationary variable.

         “ Cochrane (1994) p. 262. These procedures are equivalent up to a lag length
restriction, and under the assumption that d-p and d-e are stationary.
                                                                                                   17

using four quarters of lags. Figure 2 shows the estimated effect of the three types of

innovations - innovations to returns, to the dividend yield, and to the dividend payout ratio -

on cumulated excess returns. Figure 2 shows the standard impulse response function of excess

returns to these three variables, but summing the estimated response over time. Following

Cochrane (1994), these responses can be thought of as the response of (de-trended) stock

prices to the different shocks.

       In Figure 2, I have ordered the data (d-e, d-p, ~-R~) so that changes in the payout

ratio can have a contemporaneous effect on prices, and I have arranged the figure so that it

shows shocks corresponding to an increase in prices, dividends, and emnings. w The figure

shows that the effects of dividend and price shocks on stock prices are quite similar to the ones

Cochrane estimated (using annual data 1927-1988). A price shock obviously initially increases

prices. But this increase in prices is self-correcting; the price level gradually returns to the

level iLwas forecasted to reach before the price shock occurred (it takes about five years for

the innovation to die out). In this sense, price shocks are transitory. A dividend shock also

increases prices. But this increase in prices appears to be permanent; a rise in stock prices that

is accompanied by a rise in dividends never reverses itself.25



       “ An “earnings shock” is a shock to d-e; a shock to earnings that is not accompanied
by a change in dividends.

        ‘5 Some VAR systems are highly sensitive to the ordering (the orthogonalization
assumption) of the variables in the system. Fortunate] y, this one is not. Therefore, consider
the following ordering of the variables: (d-p, ~-R~, d-e). Placing d-p first is equivalent to
placing the contemporaneous dividend yield in the equation for excess returns.
        Consider a change in the price of stocks. If this change is not accompanied by a
change in dividends, then this price change results in an innovation in the dividend yield.
Following Cochrane, call this type of shock a “price shock. ” A price shock is a change in the
                                                                                                 18

       In terms of their impulse response function, earnings shocks appear to occupy a middle

ground between dividend shocks and price shocks. Like price shocks, earnings shocks are not

permanent, and complete] y die out after about five years. Unlike price shocks, earnings

shocks initially grow (over the course of six quarters) instead of gradual] y decaying.

       Stock prices fall when an earnings shock arrives (this contemporaneous decline in stock

prices is less than two standard errors from zero). Stock prices continue to fall (relative to

trend) for the next year or two. The decline in stock prices in the quarters immediately

following the innovation in earnings is more than two standard errors away from zero, using

standard Monte Carlo methods to calculate standard error bands. These results from the VAR

are consistent with the evidence in Tables 2 and 3.

       The time pattern of the response of returns to earnings shocks - initially falling in

response to an increase in earnings, then rising - corresponds to business cycle variation in

expected returns. An innovation in earnings means good times. The discount rate is thus

below average. Since there is some short-term persistence of business conditions, prosperity

continues on for six to eight quarters, but then starts to fade. As the business cycle turns sour,

times are no longer good. Therefore, expected returns rise, since the discount rate is now

above average. Eventually stock prices return to the level at which they were originally

forecast before the innovation in earnings. After four or five years, the net effect of the



dividend price ratio. Now consider the second variable in the system, excess returns. Since
putting d-p first in the ordering is equivalent to putting the current yield in the returns
equation, an innovation in returns is a change in price which is not accompanied by a change
in the yield. In other words, it’s a change in price that is accompanied by a change in
dividends, So call this type of a shock a “dividend” shock. A dividend shock is a change in
returns that is not caused by changes in the dividend yield.
                                                                                                     19

innovation in earnings has died out. Since discount rates vary with the business cycle, they

vary at business cycle frequencies, which is exactly what Figure 2 shows.

       So much for the reaction of future prices to an innovation in current earnings. What

about the contemporaneously negative correlation of earnings and returns? Although this

correlation is not statistically robust, it is interesting to see if it can be explained using existing

models. It can be.

       According to the Campbell-Shiller (1988a) dynamic Gordon equation, an unexpected

positive innovation in earnings will have two effects. First, the Lintner model (and Tables 2

and 4) says a rise in earnings means that dividends are likely to rise in the future, so stock

prices should rise. The second effect of an innovation in earnings is to change the expected

path of future returns. If expected discount rates rise enough in the future, stock prices will

fall. So the net effect on stock prices is ambiguous.

       Let AE be the revision in expectations induced by the innovation in earnings. Suppose

that the innovation in earnings causes an downward revision in expected discount rates from

now unt i1date N, and an upward revision in expected discount rates thereafter.         If:

                                                                    N




then current stock prices will fall in response to an unexpected increase in earnings.

Presumably, it is possible to construct a discount rate process that will satisfy this condition.
                                                                                                  20

7. Dividend-free Measures of Prices and Profits

        The main focus of this paper is the predictability of quarterly asset returns using the

dividend payout ratio in postwar US data. We know how dividends are set empirically (at

least for the postwar period). As Lintner (1956) documented in a series of classic interviews,

most managers have a target level of dividends equal to a fraction of some “permanent” level

of earnings. When the “permanent” level of earnings changes, managers S1OWI
                                                                          y adjust their

dividends toward the new target level. But we do not know why dividends are set this way,

although we have some good ideas. As Modigliani and Miller (Modigliani and Miller (1958),

Miller and Modigliani (1961)) show, there are good reasons to believe dividend policy could

be set in any arbitrary fashion without serious consequence.

        Since (a) dividends are a smoothed, (partially) forward-looking measure of the future

earnings of the firm, and (b) the market value of the firm is the discounted value of the future

earnings of the firm, it is no surprise that (as shown in the previous section) a change in

aggregate dividends is typical Iy accompanied by a permanent change in the market value of the

aggregate stock market. This paper documents that the discount rate used to calculate the

discounted value of future earnings in (b) is actually affected by the current level of earnings.

        However, (a) is not a law of nature, theorem, axiom, or definition.    It is merely an

empirical regularity with ill-understood origins. Therefore it might change in the future and

might not have been true in the past. Black (1976) asks “Why do corporations pay dividends?

Why do investors pay attention to dividends?” Widely-agreed upon answers to these questions

still do not exist.
                                                                                                  21

        In the next section, I discuss evidence that in fact dividend policy has not changed

much in the past decade (although corporate distribution of cash to shareholders has).

However, it would still be useful to have measures of expected returns that do not rely too

much on dividends, since it is conceivable that dividends are a historical y transitory

phenomenon.zs There are reasons to believe that changes in tax policy and the institutions of

corporate governance can cause dividend policy to change. Managers might stop smoothing

dividends, or might smooth them so much that they contain little information.     In this case, the

payout ratio would become less useful.

       The finding of this paper is that high prices and high profits are associated with low

future returns. If these results are based on fundamental principles of human nature, then they

should hold in all periods, not just in postwar data, In postwar data, both the price effect and

the profit effect can be well measured using dividends in the numerator.    There are reasons to

think that dividends will be unreliable in prewar data.

       In Table 9, I therefore construct measures of prices and profits that are dividend-free.

To replace the numerator in the payout ratio, I construct a backward-moving average of

quarterly earnings, using the average of (arbitrarilyy) the past five years of earnings. To

replace the dividend yield term, I use the earnings yield. The third line of the table shows the




        ‘GFor example, the Microsoft Corporation has never in its history paid a dividend, and
needn’ t pay one for the next 100 years. If all publicly traded companies follow Microsoft’s
example, the dividend price ratio and the dividend payout ratio will have zero mean and zero
variance (at least in small samples), and the log of these variables would be negative infinity.
This would render less relevant several decades of research, including the theory and evidence
of Gordon (1962), Shiner (1984), Fama and French (1988), Campbell and Shiner (1988a,
1988b), Campbell (1991), Cochrane (1994), and Campbell and Cochrane (1994).
effect of throwing away all dividend information.

        In terms of explanatory power, this regression does worse than regressions which

include dividends, since the past five years of earnings is evidently an inferior measure of the

permanent component of earnings. Nonetheless, the regressions confirm the basic point: high

P and high E are both negatively correlated with future returns.

        I focus on post-war data in this paper for two reasons. First, previous research has

found a substantial change in dividend-smoothing by firms over time.27 Second, the

Undistributed Profits Tax of 1936-1937, which taxed retained earnings and thus raised firms’

incentive to pay dividends, undoubted] y had an effect on the dividend payout rate. 2s The

dividend price ratio rose from 3.4 % at the end of 1935 to over 7% at the end of 1937. The

tax-induced distortions surely affect empirical attempts to explain dividend price ratios and

returns in this period.

       A full investigation of the prewar evidence is beyond the scope of this paper. Table 9

contains exploratory results, and uses annual data 1871-1987 from Shiner (1989) to test both

whether the price and profit effects are present in the entire sample, and whether these effects




        27Using annual CRSP data, Fama and French (1988) find that the variability of A4
falls more between 1926-56 and 1957-86 than the variability of returns and AeL. They also
find that the speed of adjustment of E to D falls in the latter period. boking at annual S&P
data, Barsky and De bng (1989) reject the hypothesis that the volatility of dividend growth
was constant between 1880-1939 and 1940-1981.

       26See Calomiris and Hubbard (1995) for details on this episode, which is also
mentioned in Lintner (1956).
                                                                                                23

are well captured by the dividend yield and the dividend payout ratio. ‘g

        Table 9 shows that the dividend payout ratio performs abysmally during the 1871-1987

sample period, having an estimated effect of about zero. The dividend-free specification does

much better, and explains more of the variation in returns than the specification using

dividends.

        Table 9 suggests that the price and profit effects are fairly stable over time. Throwing

away dividend information is not a terrible idea for the past century of dam. I conclude that

the price and profit effects are long-term phenomena,

8. Repurchases

        Bagwell and Shoven (1989) document that repurchases greatly increased in the mid-

1980’s.3(’ Repurchases might affect the results in two ways. First, if stock repurchases replace

dividends, then the past history of dividend yields and dividend payout ratios will be a

mislead ing guide to future stock returns. Second, if repurchases were an important phenomena

in the sample period, they might be affecting the dividend yield and dividend payout ratio

results .31




        ‘9These regressions are not exactly analogous to the previous ones because the
available data does not permit calculation of total return including reinvested dividends within
the year.

       30Aside from repurchases, another recent phenomenon may also be affecting dividend
payout ratios. Hines (1996) documents that the payout ratio increases with the foreign income
of US firms.

       3’ For example, if managers repurchase stock instead of paying dividends when they
know that the stock market is undervalued, then both the dividend yield and the dividend
payout ratio would be negatively correlated with future stock returns.
                                                                                                    24

       Figure 1 does not suggest that repurchases lowered the dividend payout ratio in the

mid-1980’s. If anything, the payout ratio rises around the mid-1980’s. Allen and Michaely

(1995), citing evidence from Dunsby (1995), conclude that repurchases do not appear to

significantly substitute for dividends; instead, repurchases represent an increase in the total

cash payout to stockholders.

       Using aggregate data on repurchases, I tested whether the repurchases to earnings ratio,

rp-e, was affecting the results on d-e or d-p.32 First, I note that the correlation between rp-e

and d-e is positive (O.24 from 1973-1994), so it does not appear that dividends are crowded

out by repurchases.   Second, repeating the basic annual regression from Table 3 using data

1973-1994, the inclusion of rp-e has little effect on the coefficients on d-e or d-p, and rp-e is

itself small and statistically insignificant.33 I conclude that repurchases are not driving the

results, have not in the past been useful in forecasting aggregate returns, and so do not need to

be taken into account when constructing forecasts of future returns .34




      3ZI measured rp-e using the Dunsby (1995) Compustat-based data reported in Allen and
Michael y (1995) for 1973-1991 and additional 1992-1994 data based on aggregate estimates
from Poterba and Samwick (1995). These measures of rp-e are based on a different sample of
companies than the S&P 500.

       33Adding rp-e to the annual regression 1971-1994 causes the coefficient on d-e to fall
from 0.42 to 0.36. The standard error on the coefficient is 0.26. The coefficient on rp-e is
0.03 with a standard error of 0.04.

        34In addition to the data on repurchases, the evidence from Tables 8 and 9 suggests that
one can more or less measure the price and profit components of expected returns without
resort to dividends, so it cannot be changes in the distribution of earnings that are
fundamentally at work.
                                                                                                 25

9. Summary and Conclusion

       The payout ratio predicts expected returns on both stocks and bonds. It is probably the

payout ratio’s correlation with time-varying discount factors that gives it predictive power for

returns. The dividend yield and the dividend payout ratio measure two different time-varying

components of expected returns. The first component is that when prices are high, expected

returns are low. Second is that when profits ue high, expected returns are low.

       The evidence presented here does not pose a challenge to existing theory. The resulk

do have practical implications, however. In particular, I have presented evidence that the

following statements are false. (1) As of 1996, dividend yields are not a good indicator of

future stock returns because repurchases have replaced dividends. (2) The best way to use

earnings information to forecast stock returns is to discard current earnings and average past

earnings over long periods of time. (3) If one has D/P, one does not need E/P to forecast

stock returns, since E/P is simply a more noisy measure of same thing D/P measures. (4) The

very low forecasts of expected returns based on D/P as of early 1996 should be moderated by

the fact that E/P is not very low. (5) Aggregate stock prices rise in response to an increase in

aggregate earnings.

       In general, there is no good reason to expect the time-series and cross-section evidence

to be precisely analogous, since the profit effect is probably caused by aggregate attitudes

toward risk. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that some researchers examining cross-

sectional expected returns have found that earnings are sometimes negatively correlated with
                                                                                              26

future returns at the level of an individual firm .35

       Earnings are a useful variable.3b We almost certain] y have better measures of corporate

accounting earnings than we have of aggregate consumption, especially for the 19th century.

So at a minimum, earnings can serve as a convenient measure of business conditions and

therefore of expected returns.

       I conclude from the evidence that dividends are neither necessary nor (in pre-war data)

sufficient to document the price and profit effects. In postwar data however, aggregate

dividends appear to be the most useful and forward-looking measure of the long-run

components in both stock prices and corporate earnings.




         35Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1994) find that stocks with both a high price and
high recent rate of growth - “glamour stocks” - have low future returns. In their terms,
periods when the aggregate stock market has both a high price and high earnings might be
called “glamour periods. ” As previously discussed, the negative correlation of prices and
earnings makes the “glamour” interpretation difficult for time-series. Jaffe, Keim, and
Westerfield (1989) find that, “surprisingly,” US firms with negative earnings have higher
expected returns. After looking at the time series evidence presented here, these results are
still surprising (since presumably much of the variation in earnings across firms is
idiosyncratic) but at least more familiar. Looking at the cross-section of Japanese stock
returns, Chan, Hamao and Lakonishok (1991) report results eerily similar to the ones
presented in Table 1:
         “If earnings yield is considered in isolation . . .it indeed has a positive and
         significant impact on returns. If the book to market ratio is added to the model,
         however, the coefficient becomes insignificant y different from zero. In the
         context of the full model, earnings yield even has a negative impact on stock
         returns, and is in some cases reliably negative. ”


       36I agree with Campbell and Shiner (1988b) that “many studies of financial time series
have avoided the use of earnings data and have thus omitted relevant information about
fundamental value from the anal ysis. ”

Appendix: Data, and Robustness of the Quarter]y Results

Data

        All data on stock, bond, and bill returns come from Ibbotson Associates.

        The basic earnings and dividends data are from the Securi~ Price ltiex Record

published by Standard & Poor’s Statistical Service. Earnings per share is 4-quarter total,

Adjusted to Index, Composite. Dividends per share is 12-months moving total, Adjusted to

Index, Composite.

       Examining regressions of various variables on seasonally dummies, there is no evidence

that the d, e, Ae, Ad, d-p, or d-e series have a seasonal component.

Other measures of the payout ratio

        In Table A, I replicate the quarterly results of Table 3 using four different, alternative

measures of lagged dividend payout. All of these measures have slightly different time

aggregation properties.

       First, I use the quarterly corporate dividend and after-tax profit figures reported in the

National Income and Product Accounts to construct dtF~lPA-e,,mA.These accounts are designed

to reflect seasonally-adjusted economic transactions for the entire corporate sector within the

quarter, and so in principle are different from the moving average of the last four quarters for

just the S&P companies.    Second, I use the “actual quarterly” earnings reported by S&P,

E~,~~~,instead of the four-quarter total. 37 I did not attempt to seasonally adjust this variable.

The third and fourth variables attempt to correct for timing issues in the release of the S&P



       37S&P does not report the analogous statistic for dividends.
                                                                                                   28

quarterly figures. Companies (and therefore S&P) do not announce their earnings for a given

quarter until well into the next quarter. Thus the exact value of E, is not in the information set

of agenw at time t. 3s I therefore tried using d-e lagged an additional quarter. Last, I used

“real-time” D/P and E/P information reported by S&P concurrent] y, d~,RT-e~,RT
                                                                           and di,RT-pL,RT.
                                                                                         I

extracted this information from Citibase. 39

           As can be seen in Table A, these different measures of the lagged payout ratio had little

effect on the qualitative conclusions about yields, payouts, and returns.@ Notice that using

E,,~~R,the “noisy“ measure of current earnings, actually causes both the coefficient on the

payout ratio and the explanatory power of the regression to rise, This finding echoes results

elsewhere in this paper: changes to the payout ratio are temporary changes in earnings, which

explains why they forecast returns, Since Et,~TRis an even better measure than Et of transitory

shocks to earnings, it is not surprising it does a good job of explaining variations in expected

returns.

Subsamples

           Cutting the quarterly sample in half, as shown in Table A, does not appear to result in



        38This is a feature of all studies that use earnings data, not just this one. For example,
the extremely useful data series contained in Shiner (1989) are also contaminated in this
fashion.

        39Unfortunate y, Citibase reports month]y averages of weekly indices, so the
constructed payout ratio is a noisy measure of the actual end-of-quarter payout ratio known at
time t. The weekly P/E series is also only available from S&P starting in 1954.

        @The higher coefficients on d,,RT-eL,~T
                                             and d,,RT-pL,RT
                                                          are due entirely to the different
sample period; using the same sample period and regularly defined d-e and d-p yields very
similar results.
                                                                                                    29

dramatic differences in the relationship between the payout ratio and returns. Although the

estimated coefficient is statistically insignificant in the first half of the sample, the size of the

coefficient is about the same as in the full sample. I conclude that the relationship between

payout and return is probably not an artifact of the inflation of the 1970’s, the 1987 crash, or

the repurchases of the 1980’s and 1990’s .41

Outliers

       Folk wisdom appears to associate low dividend yields not onl y with low returns, but

also with negatively skewed returns. For example, in considering the early 1996 dividend

yield (a record low), it is natural to draw apocalyptic parallels to the last time the dividend

yield was very low: the period immediately preceding the 1987 crash. Is the statistical

relationship between dividend yields, payouts, and future returns caused primarily by a few

ou(1iers Iike October 1987? The answer is no. Removing return observations that are two

standard deviations away from the mean results in little change in benchmark quarterly results

of Table 3 .J: Both the univariate regressions and bivariate regressions of returns on d-e and d-

p look about the same in terms of coefficients and (surprisingly) R’. The one difference is that

d-e is now significantly different from zero by itself, with a coefficient of 0.244 and a standard

error of O.122. I conclude therefore that skewness in returns is not responsible for gross!y

distorting the linear regressions.




       41I also discuss these issues elsewhere in the paper.

        42There were seven such quarters in the sample period, five of which were price
declines.

Miscellaneous Robustness

        Table 3 shows simple OLS regressions and standard errors. Using Newey-West errors

with one lag does not change the conclusions from Table 3 (the standard error on d-e rises

somewhat to O.172). Using real returns or nominal returns instead of excess returns also

results in little change.

Notes to Table 2: “Corr” is the correlation coefficient between the two variables. “P-val” is
the p-value from a Granger causality test for whether the variable in the row G-causes the
variable in the column. This is a test of whether four lagged quarters of the row variables can
be excluded from a linear regression where the dependent variable is the column variable and
the independent variables are four lags of the column and row variables. “Sum” is the sum of
the four quarter] y coefficients on the lagged row variable in this regression. “s. e.” is the
standard error of the estimate of this sum. u is the standard deviation of the column variable
and p is its first-order autocorrelation coefficient.
        r~,fis the three-month t-bill rate at end of quarter t, whereas R~~is the ex-post return on
a portfolio of one-month t-bills, rolled over in the course of three months of quarter t. n, is
the annualized quarterly inflation rate, using the difference in log of the CPI index provided by
Ibbotson Associates. Aet and Ad, are the annualized change in the log of the four quarter total
of earnings per share and dividends per share, between quarter t-1 and quarter t, as reported by
Standard and Poor’s.
        The shaded cells of the table signify that the p-value (from a Granger causality tests for
whether the variable in the row G-causes the variable in the column) is below 0.05.

Notes: e5, is the average of the current and four years past earnings per share. The quarterly
data are the same as in Table 3. All annual data from this table are from the data series printed
in Shiner (1989). Total return in year t is calculated as ~,~= ln(P~+l+ D~-ln(P~, where Pi is
the price level in January of year t+ 1 and D, is dividends paid in year t. The risk-free rate,
Rf,,, is constructed using 6-month commercial paper is described in Shiner (1989). The data
start in 1871; the sample starts in 1876 to allow lags for computing e5.

Notes on Figure 2.

The figure shows impulse response functions from a standard vector autoregression on the
vector (d-e, d-p, ~-R~), with four quarterly lags, using the sample period 1947Q1- 1994Q4.
The impulse response of ~-R~ to the three types of innovations is cumulated, starting in
period zero, to show the effect of a one standard deviation shock on the level of cumulated
excess returns. An “earnings shock” is a negative innovation to d-e. A “price shock” is a
negative innovation to d-p. A “dividend shock” is a positive innovation to ~-Rf.
