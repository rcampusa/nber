        Public programs to provide early-stage financing to firms, particularly      high-technology

companies, have become commonplace in the United States and abroad. The long-run effectiveness

of these programs, however, has attracted little empirical scrutiny. This paper examines the impact

of the largest U.S. public venture capital initiative, the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)

program, which has provided over $6 billion to small high-technology firms between 1983 and 1995.

Using a unique database of awardees compiled by the U.S. General Accounting Office, I show that

SBIR awardees grew significantly faster than a matched set of firms over a ten-year period.       The

positive effects of SBIR awards were confined to firms based in zip codes with substantial venture

capital activity.   The findings are consistent with both the corporate finance literature on capital

constraints and the growth literature on the importance of localization effects.

1.      Introduction

        The federal government has played an active role in financing new firms, particularly in

high-technology industries, since the Soviet Union’s launch of the Sputnik satellite. In recent years,

European and Asian nations and many U.S. states have adopted similar initiatives.         While these

programs’   precise structures   have differed, the efforts have been predicated      on two shared

assumptions:   (~ that the private sector provides insufficient capital to new firms, and (i) that the

government can identify firms where investments will ultimately yield high social and/or private

returns.’ These claims have, however, received little scrutiny by economists.2




   lIt is striking to note the similarities between, for instance, the statement of Senator John
Sparkman [1958] upon the passage of the Small Business Investment Act and the recent testimony
of Dr. Mary Good, Under Secretary for Technology at the U.S. Department of Commerce [1995].
The rationales for such programs are discussed in depth in U.S. Congressional Budget Office
[1985].

    2While both government agencies and academic economists have sought repeatedly to assess the
efficacy of federal programs to aid technology-intensive industries, they have tended to focus on
different questions. Most federal evaluations of these programs have consisted of case studies and
surveys of the commercial activity directjy attributable to the awards.           Examples of such
evaluations of the SBIR program include Myers, Stem, and Rorke [1983], Price, Waterhouse
 [1985], and U.S. General Accounting Office [1987a, 1989, 1992]. Surveys of direct commercial
impacts are subject to several biases. For instance, in the case of the SBIR program, small business
advocates conducted a protracted lobbying campaign to expand the program. Executives active in
this effort may have overstatd the benefits from the awards. At the same time, some firms had
reasons to downplay the commercial benefits of the program. During the early 1990s, a number of
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that developed research originally funded by the
National Institutes of Health were intensely scrutinized.           Firms that received spectacular
commercial benefits from the SBIR program may have been reluctant to acknowledge them, lest
they attract unwelcome attention from reporters and politicians.        Finally, because many firms
pursued SBIR projects closely related to their core technologies, determining the direct impact of
an SBIR award may have been difficult. Studies of federal technology programs by academic
economists, beginning with Levy and Terleckyj [1983], have tended to focus on the short-run
effects of these effofis. In particular, they ask whether federal finds substitute for or stimulate
private R&D spending.        For instance, Irwin and Klenow [1994] show that semiconductor
manufacturers substantially reduced their own R&D spending while participating in the Sematech

                                                  1
       The neglect of these questions is unfortunate            While the sums of money involved are

modest relative to public expenditures on defense procurement or retiree benefit% these programs-

surnmarized      in Table   l—are   very substantial       when compared   to contemporaneous     private

investments in new firms. For instance, the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program

led to the provision of more than $3 billion to young firms between 1958 and 1969, more than three

times the total private venture capital investment during these years (Noone and Rubel [1970]). In

1995, the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program provided almost $900 million to

young technology-intensive      firms.   This was about equal to the annual rate of early-stage

investments by venture capitalists in recent years (Venture Economics [1996], U.S. Small Business

Administration    [1996]). Some of America’s most dynamic technology companies received support

through the SBIC and SBIR programs while still private entities, including Apple Computer,

Chiron, Compaq, Federal Express, and Intel.            Public venture capital programs have also had a

significant impact overseas: for instance, these programs have accounted for more than one-half of

the recent investments in new German technology -intensivefirms        (Wupperfeld [1992]).


       The recent economic literature suggests reasons to be both optimistic and skeptical about

the efficacy of public venture programs.     On the positive side, a growing body of writing suggests

that new firms, especially technology-intensive        ones, may be receiving insufficient capital.   The

literature on capital constraints (reviewed in Hubbard [1996]) documents that an inability to obtain

external financing limits many forms of business investment.          Particularly relevant are works by




consortium. Wallsten [1996] shows that the subset of SBIR awardees that were publicly traded
reduced their own spending on R&D in the years immediately following the award.

                                                       2
Hall [1992], Hao and Jaffe [1993], and Himrnelberg and Petersen [1994]. These show that capital

constraints appear to limit research-and-development        expenditures, especially in smaller firms. It

might be thought that these effects would have been particulady strong during the 1970s and early

1980s, when the venture capital pool was relatively modest in size. As the first panel of Table 2

reports, the pool of venture capital fids   has grown dramatically in recent years.       This has been

largely due to the relaxation of the regulations and informal curbs that precluded many pension

finds from investing in this asset class (Fenn, Liang, and Prowse [1995]). The capital constraints

literature suggests that public awards to high-technology    firms should be associated with significant

growth, as firms pursue value-creating projects that they would otherwise be unable to finance?


        On the opposing side, the corporate finance literature highlights the importance of private

mechanisms to finance young, high-growth          firms.   The dominant form of financing is venture

capita~ which accounts for about two-thirds of the external equity financing raised from pnvate-

sector sources by privately held technology-intensive         businesses   (Freear and Wetzel [1990]).

Venture investors frequently disburse finds in stages. Managers of these venture-backed firms are

forced to repeatedly return to their financiers for additional capital, in order to ensure that the

money is not squandered on unprofitable       projects.     In addition, venture capitalists intensively

monitor managers.     These investors demand prefemed stock with numerous restrictive covenants

and representation   on the board of directors.      (Various aspects of the oversight role played by

private equity investors are documented in Gompers [1995], Lemer [1995], and Sahlman [1990];



    3A related body of literature documents that investments in R&D yield high private and social
rates of return (e.g., Griliches [1986], Mansfield, et al, [1977]). These findings similarly suggest
that a higher level of R&D spending would be desirable.

                                                     3
the theoretical literature is reviewed in Barry [1994].) Government officials are unlikely to have the

expertise or resources to effectively monitor entrepreneurs.        Consequently,   even if an award of

public finds to an entrepreneurial firm leads to a short-run expansion in activities, the increase is

unlikely to be sustainable.




          The academic literature also differs in its predictions of where public grants will have the

greatest impact.    Venture capital financing is concentrated in particular regions and sectors.    The

second and third panels of Table 2 document this pattern, showing the distribution of early-stage

venture financing      by state and Standard Industrial Classification    (SIC) code between 1983 and

1985 (the period in which the SBIR awards under study in this paper were made).                     The

concentration    of awards in California and Massachusetts,       as well as in computer hardware and

sotiare    sectors, is apparent.




          This concentration can be interpreted in two ways. On the one hand, several models argue

that institutional investors frequently engage in “herding”: making investments that are too similar

to one another. These models suggest that a variety of factor=for         instance, when performance is

assessed on a relative, not an absolute, basis-can       lead to investors obtaining poor performance by

making too similar investments.      (Much of the theoretical literature is reviewed in Devenow and

Welch [1996]; Sahlman and Stevenson [1986] present a case study suggesting such behavior by

venture capitalists)     These models suggest that public investments       in sectors and regions less




                                                     4
heavily supported by venture capitalists might lead to superior returns, because value-creating

investments in less popular areas may have been ignored




        On the other hand, recent models of economic growtbbuilding                on earlier works by

economic geographers-have       emphasized powerful reasons why successful high-technology          firms

may be very concentrated.    The literature highlights several factors that lead similar firms to cluster

in particular regions including knowledge spillovers, specialized labor markets, and the presence of

critical intermediate good producers    (The theoretical rationales for such effects are summarized in

Krugman [1991 ].) Case studies of the development           of high-technology   regions (e.g., Saxenian

[1994]) have emphasized the importance of intermediaries such as venture capitalists, lawyers, and

accountants in facilitating such clustering    If these effects are important, and the supply of venture

capital was restricted as discussed above, then we might expect public awards to have particular

impact if they were dispersed in the same regions as independent venture capitalists invested.




       This analysis assesses the long-run success of firms participating in the largest U.S. public

venture capital initiative the SBIR program.    I examind    the employment and sales growth of 1135

firms. Approximately    half of the sample received one or more awards of approximately one-half

million dollars in the first three cycles of the SBIR progra~      the other half were matching firms

constructed to resemble the SBIR awardees as closely as possible. In order to assess the program, I

relied heavily on a unique longitudinal        data-set of awardees compiled      by the U.S. General

Accounting Office (GAO).



                                                    5
        One decade later, the SBIR awardees have enjoyed substantially greater employment and

sales growth than the matching firms. This superior performance, however, was not universal. The

differentials in both employment     and sales growth were confined to firms in zip codes that were

simultaneously the site of substantial venture capital activity. The SBIR awards appear to have had

much less impact on the performance of firms in other regions. The awards contributed both to the

growth of firms that were or were not backed by venture capital, and that were or were not in

industries heavily financed by venture capital.      Some evidence suggests that the positive impact

was strongest for firms in areas with many venture investments but in industries not frequently

financed by venture capitalists.




        While the superior long-run performance          of the SBIR awardees is consistent with the

presence of capital constraints, it is clearly not the only interpretation.    The selection process might

lead to the identification of firms with superior long-run prospects          The provision of funds itself

might make no difference.     Alternatively, the selection of a firm for an SBIR award might serve as

a favorable signal to potential customers and investors.       In other words, the results are consistent

with the second claim of the first paragraph of the introduction being true, but the first claim not

being true.    To address this concern, I employed two sets of matching firms: one set with no

participation in the SBIR program; the other which received at least one much smaller, but highly

competitive,   preliminary   SBIR awmd (termed Phase I awards).               If the SBIR awards simply

identified superior firms, and the capital provided did not make a difference, I anticipated that the



                                                     6
long-run success of the Phase I awardees would be consistently          greater than that of the non-

awardees. The fact that the growth of these two sets of matching firms did not materially differ

from each other—both lagged the performance of recipients of the fill SBIR awardesuggested

that the capital provided was important     The results are also robust to controls for the hypothesis

that SBIR awardees grew because they established relationships with federal officials or politicians,

which led to procurement contracts.




        These findings are relevant for several reasons.     First, they are consistent with both the

corporate finance literature on capital constraints and the growth literature on the importance of

localization effects.   Second, they provide guidance as to what types of public venture programs

are likely to be effective.   In particular, they underscore doubts about recent federal efforts to

encourage the formation of venture finds investing in economically          distressed areas here and

abroad. Finally, the findings are relevant to the intensi~ing    policy debate surrounding the SBIR

program itself.   While the results cannot be unambiguously       interpreted, they call into question

the arguments of university    and medical center administrators     (summarized    in Mervis [1996])

that the program has not produced any economic benefits.




        The plan for the paper is as follows.   In Section 2, I review the structure of SBIR awards,

and why they may address the financing needs of smaller firms.         The third section describes the

data set. Section 4 presents the analysis, and the final section concludes the paper.




                                                   7
2.      The SBIR Program and the Financing of Entrepreneurial Firms

        The Small Business Innovation           Development    Act, enacted by Congress in July 1982,

established the SBIR program.        The progra~modeled         after a pioneering program initiated by the

National Science Foundation in 1977—mandated that all federal agencies spending more than $100

million annually on external research set aside a fixed percentage of these funds for awards to small

businesses     The act required that 1.25% of all external research be allocated for this progrm      (The

set-aside was phased in over five years.)        When the program was reauthorized in 1992, Congress

increased the size of the set-aside. It will reach its new steady-state level of 2. 5°/0in 1997, At this

point, total annual funding is projected to be about $1.1 billion.




        While the eleven federal agencies participating in the program are responsible for selecting

awardees, they must conform to the guidelines stipulated by the act and the U.S. Small Business

Administration (SBA). Awardees must be independently owned, for-profit firms with less than 500

employees, at least 510/0 owned by U.S. citizens or permanent residents.             The structure of the

awards is also constrained to be similar across agencies.        Promising proposals are awarded Phase I

awards (originally no more than $50,000, today $100,000 or smaller), which are intended to allow

firms to conduct research to determine the feasibility of their ideas. Approximately one-half of the

Phase I awardees are then selected for the more substantial Phase II grants. Phase II awards of at

most $750,000       (originally,   one-half   million   dollars) are designed   to support   two years of

development work. The funds are transferred to the small firm as a contract or grant. In return for

the finding,    the company        must provide the agency with a report on the technology           under



                                                        8
development.      Thegovement       receives noequity      inthefim    anddoes   nothave    any ownership

claim on the intellectual property that the firm develops with these funds.           Table 3 displays the

annual expenditure= on the SBIR program, the percentage set-aside, and the number of Phase II

awards.




          One of the key rationales for the establishment of the SBIR program was that imperfections

existed in the market for the financing         of young technology-based        firms.    These firms are

characterized by considerable uncertain y and information asymmetries that permit opportunistic

behavior by entrepreneurs.      As discussed above, the bulk of the equity invested in these firms

comes from venture capitalists,       who have developed        a variety of mechanisms      to limit such

behaviors.




          But venture capital has important limitations.    Venture funds only back a tiny fraction of the

technology-oriented     businesses begun each year: of those firms that submit business plans to

venture organizations, historically only 1YOhave been tided           (Fenn, Liang, and Prowse [1995]).

While this may partially reflect the mixed quality of these proposals, it may also reflect regulatory

constraints on pension funds that have until recently limited the size of the venture capital pool.

Private pension funds were essentially prohibited from venture investments by the U.S. Department

of Labor until 1978. Even afier this policy shifi, private pensions did not invest in venture funds in

significant numbers until the mid- 1980s.      A variety of regulatory and political factors restrained

substantial venture investments by public pension funds until the 1990s.



                                                     9
          Furthermore, the structure of venture investments is inappropriate for many young firms.

Venture finds tend to make quite substantial investments, even in young firms: the mean venture

investment in a start-up or early-stage business between 1961 and 1992 was $1.8 million (in 1992

dollars) (Gompers [1995]).       The substantial size of these investments is largely a consequence of

the demands of institutional investors.    The typical venture organization raises a fund (structured as

a limited partnership)     every few years.     Because investments     in partnerships   are often time-

consurning to negotiate and monitor, institutions         prefer making relatively large investments   in

venture    funds   (typically   $10 million   or more).      Furthermore,   governance    and regulatory

considerations lead investors to limit the share of the find that any one limited partner holds. (The

structure of venture partnerships     is discussed at length in Gompers and Lemer [1996a].)        These

pressures lead venture organizations to raise substantial finds.      Because each firm in his portfolio

must be closely scrutinized, the typical venture capitalist is typically responsible for no more than a

dozen investments.     Venture organizations are consequently unwilling to invest in very young firms

that only require small capital infisions.4




   4There are two primary reasons why venture funds do not simply hire more partners if they raise
additional capital. First, the supply of venture capitalists is quite inelastic. The effective oversight
of young companies requires highly specialized skills that can only be developed with years of
experience. A second important factor is the economics of venture partnerships. The typical
venture fund receives a substantial share of its compensation from the amual fee, which is typically
between 2% and 3% of the capital under management. This motivates venture organizations to
increase the capital that each partner manages. Recently several industry leaders have explored
mechanisms to facilitate investments by institutions in very small venture funds.                 These
partnerships, they hoped, could readily make small investments in start-up firms. These efforts
have encountered considerable difficulties (see Vincenti [1996]).

                                                    10
         The amount that a firm can raise from the leading alternative source of private equity,

individual investors,5 is usually much less than the minimum financing round that a venture find

will consider providing.     Freear and Wetzel [1990] report that median financing round raised by

private high-technology      firms from individual investors was about $200,000.   82% of the rounds

from individuals were under $500,000.        Thus, a substantial gap exists between the resources that

firms can raise from individual investors and from venture capitalists, which SBIR awards may

partially fill.




3.       The Data Set

         Identi@ing the appropriate metric to assess the long-term effects of the SBIR program is

problematic.      Ideally, I would measure both the social and private impacts of the program.   While

case studies of a small number of participants in the SBIR program (along the lines, for instance, of

Mansfield, et al. [1977]) might shed some light on the social benefits, such an effort would be

impossible for a larger sample.b




    5Freear and Wetzel [1990] report that venture capitalists and individual investors were the source
of81 YOof the external equity financing raised from non-govemrnental sources by a sample of 284
privately held high-technology companies.

   ‘These analyses were complemented with eleven interviews of Massachusetts firms that had
received at least one Phase II award from the Department of Defense. I thank Department’s
Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization for their help in identifying these firms
and arranging the interviews.

                                                    11
         Even determining an appropriate measure of private benefits was difficult. Ideally, I would

measure the impact of participating in the program on the firms’ valuations.        Only 2°/0 of the SBIR

awardees in the first three program cycles, however, were publicly held at the time of their initial

Phase I awards. Determining whether participation in the program was associated with an increase

in firm value was consequently          difficult.   I focused instead on two alternatives: the impact of

participation in the SBIR program on sales and employment.            While neither was a perfect measure

of firm value, Paul Gompers and I have shown [1996b] that the valuations assigned to private firms

by venture capitalists are highly correlated with these two scale measures.




         As a consequence of their status as private firms, almost all SBIR awardees did not need to

disclose employment       or sales information        in filings with the U.S. Securities   and Exchange

Commission (SEC). Consequently,            I relied on a unique database prepared by the GAO. The GAO

was mandated       in the legislation     establishing   the SBIR program to periodically    evaluate the

initiative.   In late 1985, the agency generated a sample of 933 firms that received SBIR awards in

the first three program cycles from the twelve federal agencies participating in the program at the

time.   This sample included all firms that had received Phase II awards to that date, as well as a

sampling of the firms that had only received the preliminary Phase I awards.’




    ‘At the time that the survey population was selected, not all firms that received Phase I awards in
fiscal year 1985 had been selected for Phase II awards. Consequently, some firms that received
Phase II awards in the first three program cycles were not included in the survey.


                                                         12
        These firms were surveyed by the GAO in early 1986.               The survey collected basic

demographic data (e.g., the firm’s founding date, employment, revenue, and intellectual property

holdings), the avenues through which the firm had been financed prior to and afier the award, and

the organizational   changes that occurred afier the award (such as a merger or an initial public

offering).   The survey had an 81‘A response rate, which reflected the extensive efforts by GAO,

SBA, and agency officials to track down non-responding        entrepreneurs and to encourage them to

complete the survey.      The GAO completed a follow-up survey in mid-1988.           86°/0 of the original

respondents answered this survey, as well as 46°/0 of the non-respondents          to the first survey.   In

total, 835 firms responded to at least one survey. Of these, 541 received Phase II awards in the first

three program cycles, while 294 only received Phase I awards.




        In addition to the 294 firms that only received Phase I awards, I constructed a matching

sample of 300 firms that received no SBIR funds in the first three program cycles.              I sought to

select firms that closely resembled the 541 Phase II awardees.        I matched firms using Corporate

Technology      Information    Services’   Corporate     Technology    Directory      [1996],   the   most

comprehensive    directory of U. S. high-technology    firms. This directory employs a highly detailed

industry classification    scheme, which allows quite precise matches.g        I recorded the primary

industry classification of each Phase II awardee in the 1986 edition of the Corporate Teckology

Directory, or the first subsequent volume in which the firm was listed. (In all, 74% of the Phase II

awardees were listed.)


   ‘For instance, while the SIC classification scheme places all sofiware firms in class 7372, this
directory distinguishes between firms that manufacture educational software used to teach typing
and for music instruction.
                                                 13
        I then pulled a random selection of 300 of these awardees.           For each selected firm, I

identified in the 1986 Corporate Technolog       Directory the firm in the same classification with the

closest employment level. 9 I excluded as possible matches firms that were units or subsidiaries of

other concerns. I also eliminated firms that had received any Phase I or Phase II awards in the first

three program cycles.        (These were determined      through U.S. Small Business Administration

[1986].) If there were no matches within the class, I chose a firm in a related industry: e.g., if there

were no appropriate match for a firm classified as a plastic composite laminate manufacturer,            I

matched the firm to another composite laminate manufacturer.        From the listing for each matching

firm in the Directory, I collected information on sales, employment, location, and founding date. I

determined   whether the matching       firms had received venture financing using Security Data

Company’s Venture Intelligence Database.        This database provides comprehensive information on

venture capital financing,    and is described in detail inLemer[1995].




        The samples are summarized       in Table 4 and 5. Table 4 describes the construction of the

sampl=; Table 5 compares the Phase II awardees with the matching firms. The firms were similar

in most respects.    The awardees had slightly larger employment          in 1985; the matching firms,




   91t may be questioned why I matched firms exclusively on the basis of their industry and
employment, rather than also matching on geographic proximity, or some other attribute. My
rationale was that my approach would minimize possible biases due to inter-industry differences
that would be very difficult to control for otherwise. (Most studies that control for industry
differences use data at the four-digit SIC code level, which is much more crude than the degree
of industry matching done here.)        Geographic differences, however, could be (and were)
addressed through the use of information about venture activity in each zip code.

                                                    14
greater sales. The SBIR awardees were more likely to have received venture financing by the end

of 1985 ( 10°/0vs. 7°/0for the matching firms) and to be located in either California or Massachusetts

(35% VS.26%).




           A final step in constructing the sample was determining the employment and sales of the

SBIR Phase II awardees and the matching firms at the end of 1995.’0 For publicly traded firms, I

used SEC filings.      For private firms, I employed, in order of preference, the 1996 editions of the

Corporate Technolo~Directory,             Dun’s Marketing Services’ Million Dollar Directory [1996], Gale

Research’s Ward’s Business Directory of U.S. Private and Public Companies                         [1996], National

Register     Publishing       Company’s    Directory   of Leading        Private     Companies      [1996],    and   a

considerable     number of state and industry          business    directories     in the collections      of Harvard

Business School’s Baker Library, the Boston Public Library, and the Library of Congress.                          For

firms that I could not find in published directories, I employed several electronic databases: the

Company        Intelligence      and   Database    America        compilations      available    through      LEXIS’S

COMPANY/USPRIV                libr~,   VentureOne’s    Venture Data System, and the American Business

Disk CD-ROM directory.




           For firms where I could not ascertain employment             and sales, I checked the news stories

compiled in LEXIS’S NEWS/ALLNEWS                  library and the Business Dateline, F&S Index, and Wall



   ‘“In a few cases, firms did not disclose 1985 sales. Furthermore, SBIR awardees were only
requested to report ranges for 1985 sales. Consequently, in all cases where firms did not report
sales, or where reported sales were in one of the ranges above $1 million, I ascertained 1985
sales using the 1986 editions of the same sources used to determine 1995 sales.

Street Journal Index CD-ROM files. These searches of news stories revealed that many of firms

for which I was unable to obtain 1995 sales and employment data had gone out of business.         I did

not include in the analysis the employment and sales of firms that had been acquired, unless the

firm continued to be operated as a separate subsidiary through the end of 1995. Another exception

was cases where the purchase of the firm was an asset sale as part of a bankruptcy, in which case

employment and sales were recorded as zero. In some cases, I was only able to determine a range

in which sales fell. In these cases, I employed the mid-point of this range.




4.      Empirical Analysis

        Table 6 compares the growth of the Phase II awardees with the matching firms. The mean

employment increase from the end of 1985 to the end of 1995 was greater for the awardees (a boost

of 26 ,employees vs. 5), as was the sales increase ($5 million vs. $2 million).   For the mean SBIR

awardee, this represented an 56°/0 increase in employment and a 123°/0 boost in sales (in inflation-

adjusted dollars).   The table also presents various percentile rankings in order to demonstrate that

the differences were not driven by a few outliers.      At each reported percentile    the changes in

employment and sales were more positive for the awardees,         These differences were statistically

significant in t-tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.




        Tables 7 and 8 examine the impact of SBIR awards in light of the concentration of venture

capital financing.   I undertook comparisons    similar to those in Table 6, but with an additional

complication: firms were divided by whether (i) their headquarter     at the end of 1985 was located



                                                  16
in a zip code with a private early-stage venture financing in the years 1983-1985 or (ii) their

primary assigmnent was to a four-digit SIC class with such a financing.   I determined whether any

(and how many) early-stage financing      occurred in each zip code and SIC class through the

Venture Intelligence Database described above.




       The differences between the SBIR awardees and the matching firms in the zip codes with

one or more venture financin~   were pronounced     For instance, employment increased by 47 for

these firms, as opposed to decreasing by 5 for the non-awardees    The differences were much less

pronounced elsewhere (employment      rose by 13, as opposed to by 10). These differences were

statistically significant only among the firms in regions with venture activity.   For the average

SBIR awardee in a zip code with venture activity—which      had 57 employees and $3.9 million in

sales in 1985-employment      over the next decade grew by 83°/0 and inflation-adjusted    sales by

169%. These patterns are depicted in Figures 1 and 2. The first picture shows the number of seed

and early-stage venture capital investments in each county in the continental U.S. between 1983

and 1985; the second depicts the mean employment        growth of SBIR awardees in each county

between 1985 and 1995.”



    1‘These patterns were also robust to the use of a third measure of firm success, the increase in
public market value. For the subset of SBIR awardees and matching firms that were publicly
traded sometime between January 1985 and December 1995, I examined the change in valuations
over this interval. I determined these valuations through the databases of the Center for Research
in Securities Prices and the several Moody’s stock guides. The public market valuation of the
541 SBIR awardees increased by a total of $9.5 billion in this period. (This is the sum of the
increase in the market value of firms that were publicly traded at the beginning of the period and
the valuation of formerly private firms that went public over these years.) The public market
valuation of the 594 matching firms, on the other hand, only increased by a total of $2.6 billion.
The increase in the public market value of the average SBIR awardee was 19 times greater if the
firm was located in a zip code with an early-stage venture financing in the years 1983-1985, a
                                                 17
       The analysis in Table 8, however, reveals few clear patterns.    The differences between the

growth of the SBIR awardees and the matching firms were similar, whether the companies were in

an industry that received venture financing or not.




       These patterns remained pronounced       when I disaggregated    the matching firms.    If the

positive performance of the SBIR Phase II awardees was due primarily to the selection of superior

firms rather than the infision of capital, we might expect the Phase I awardees to similarly display

rapid growth.   These firms, despite receiving much smaller awards, went through an exhaustive

review process: only 12°/0of applicants were selected for these preliminary grants in the first three

program years (U.S. General Accounting Office [1987b]).      (In the Phase II selection process, 50V0

of the applicants received awards.)




       The growth of sales and employment was only slightly greater among the 294 firms that

received SBIR Phase I awards than the 300 firms taken from the Corporate Technolo~        Directo~.

For instance, the mean employment for the Phase I awardees increased by 6.2 jobs, while for the

Directory   firms, the increase was 4.2.     (Recall that the increase in the Phase 11 awardees’

employment was over 26 j ohs, ) The differences between the SBIR Phase II awardees that were

significant in Tables 6 and 7 remained so when the Phase II awardees were only compared either to

the Phase I awardees or to the Corporate Technology DirectoW firms.


difference significant at the five percent confidence level. There were no significant differences
in the changes in public market valuations of SBIR Phase II awardees and non-awardees among
those firms located in zip codes without early-stage venture activity.
                                                  18
        Tables 9 and 10 examine the growth of employment and sales in a regression framework.           I

used   1995 employment        and sales as the dependent       variable% and employed    a variety    of

independent variables and specifications.    The first two regressions in each table used an ordinary

least squares (OLS) specification.     Among the independent variables were 1985 employment           or

sales, a dummy variable indicating whether the firm received any Phase II awards in the first three

SBIR finding cycles, measures of the extent of venture capital activity in the firm’s zip code and

SIC class, and interactions    between the SBIR dummy variable and the venture capital activity

measures. In the reported regressions, I measured the extent of venture capital activity in two ways:

the number of early-stage financing      in the zip code or SIC code, as well as dummy variables

indicating whether there were any such financing.




       I also report a variety of alternative specification.     First, because 1995 employment      and

sales could not be below zero, I used a Tobit specification, which corrected for censored data. (I

also estimated Tobit regressions     using the other sets of independent variables, which produced

results similar to the reported OLS analyses.) Second, rather than using a single dummy variable to

denote SBIR awardees, I disaggregate      the number of SBIR awards. I employed separate variables

for firms that received only one Phase II SBIR award in the first three cycles, two-to-four such

awards, and so forth.    Thir~    I added additional independent    variables to the analysis.   I was

concerned that the results may have been shaped by some unobserved differences between the

SBIR awardees and the matching firms.        I hence controlled for each firm’s age, whether it was



                                                  19
venture-backed by the end of 1985, and the nature of its industry.      Following Gompers [1995], I

controlled for industry effects by using the characteristics of the average public firm in the same

SIC class at the end of 1985. I computed the ratios of market value to book value, tangible assets to

total assets, and R&D spending to sales for all firms with a primary assignment in Compustat to the

same industry as a company in the sample.     If there were fewer than four firms assigned to a four-

digit SIC code, I used all firms with a primary assignment to the same three-digit SIC code. I then

computed the average of these ratios.    In this way, I controlled for industry differences that may

have affected the ability of firms to raise external financing through traditional sources.         For

instance, firms in industries characterized by mostly intangible assets may have found it difficult to

arrange bank financing.




        The results strongly supported the suggestions that the impact of SBIR awards was not

uniform.   The presence of a SBIR award alone had little impact on employment and sales. Rather,

only the interactions between the SBIR indicator and the measures of venture activity in the zip

code were consistently significant in the employment and sales regressions        SBIR awards had a

strongly positive impact on firms that were in areas simultaneously receiving venture financing, but

no significant impact on other firms. This effect wm robust across the different specifications.     In

some regressions, the coefficient on the interaction between the SBIR awardee dummy variable and

the measures of venture activity in the region and industry was significantly         negative.    This

suggested that the beneficial effect of SBIR awards was greatest if the firm was in an area attracting

considerable venture investment, but not in a frequently financed industry.



                                                  20
          I examined the robustness of the regressions in several unreported analyses.           The results

were robust to the use of the total dollar volume of early-stage venture financing            in the zip code

and SIC class between 1983 and 1985, instead of the number of such awards.                    I alternatively

employed      the number of early-stage       financing      in the state and the two-digit    SIC code as

independent     variables.   These two alternative        specification   weakened the significance of the

results, but the coefficients on the interaction terms remained significant at conventional confidence

levels.   I re-estimated the equations only using the Phase II SBIR awardees and the Corporate

7’echnolo~ Directory matching firms, as well as only the Phase 11 and Phase I SBIR awardees.

The smaller sample sizes led to reduced significance levels, but had little effect on the magnitudes

or signs of the coefficients.     The magnitude and significance of the coefficients changed little when

I estimated systems of two equations, with the second equation examining the propensity of firms

to win Phase II awards in the first three program cycles. Finally, rather than employing an OLS or

Tobit specification, I estimatd      a two-stage Heckman regression.       I first examined whether the firm

survived and then the extent of its growth. The interaction terms remained strong] y significant.




          An alternative explanation     for the superior growth of the SBIR awardees is that winners

of SBIR awards were more likely to subsequently               receive procurement   contracts because they

had cultivated    relationships    with politicians   or federal program managers.        To examine this

possibility, I restricted the above analysis to the two agencies which made significant numbers of

SBIR awards but were unlikely to undertake procurement contracts with awardees: the National

Science Foundation      and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).              HHS’s external


                                                      21
research,    and consequently   their   SBIR   awards,   overwhelmingly     came from the National

Institutes   of Health.   The gap between the firms that received Phase II awards from these

agencies and those that only received Phase I awards was even greater than that in the sample as

a whole.     For instance, firms that received Phase II awards from NSF and HHS in the first three

program cycles grew by 32.6 employees between 1985 and 1995; those that only received Phase

I awards grew by 2.1 employees. 12




5.       Conclusions

         This paper examined the long-run impact of awards to new high-technology          firms made

through a major public venture capital initiative, the SBIR program.      First, several rationales why

these awards might or might not have had positive effects on firms were explored, as well as

whether the impacts were likely to be stronger in regions and sectors that attracted substantial early-

stage financing from venture capitalists    I compared the growth of awardem to a set of matching

firms. The SBIR awardees enjoyed substantially greater employment and sales growth, but these

effects were confined to firms in areas that attracted significant venture financing.




    121also compared the awardees from HHS to matching firms specializing in biology and
biochemistry that had received no SBIR awards, with similar results.        Another alternative
explanation for the superior growth of the SBIR awardees is that winners of SBIR awards were
more likely to win subsequent SBIR awards. While this may have been true in the initial years
of the program (e.g., U.S. General Accounting Office [1987b]), conversations with federal
officials suggest that it has been much less of an issue in recent years. Not only were SBIR
awards to firms that had receiving multiple previous grants more likely to be scrutinized by the
GAO, resulting in a reluctance to make such grants, but the 1992 reauthorization of the SBIR
program (Public Law 102-564) added additional criteria for the evaluation of SBIR applications
of firms that had received awards in the past.

                                                   22
        I have already discussed    some of the issues raised by alternative interpretations   of the

results. At least three additional questions can be raised concerning the analysis.   One concern is

whether political pressures will lead to a deterioration of the SBIR program’s effectiveness over

time.   First, as discussed    above,   the percentage   set-aside   for SBIR awards has increased

dramatically.   This may be leading program managers to fund less promising firms.       Second, the

program has attracted congressional     scrutiny due to the geographic concentration of its awards.

Program managers to date have resisted these pressures: the share of finds going to firms in

California or Massachusetts has remained constant at around 40Y0. Because the awards appear to

only have had a positive effect on firms in regions with significant venture financing, the political

pressures towards geographic     dispersion-were     they to succeed in shifting the distribution    of

award~might      have a detrimental effect on program effectiveness’3




        A second concern about the results relates to whether the supply of private equity has

adjusted to address any capital constraints.       As discussed above, the pool of venture capital

expanded during the 1980s. The capital constraints that may have troubled small high-technology

firms during the early 1980s, when these awards were made, may have vanished today.                 The




    13Thepathologies that can result from political pressures on government technology policies are
discussed in Cohen and Nell [1991] and Romer [1993]. On the other hand, SBIR program
managers in most agencies indicate that program quality has increased over time. They argue
that this increase is due to the rising ratio of applicants to awards, and the growing ability of
evaluators to discern the qualities that presage commercial success as well as scientific
excellence. These observations are confirmed by the GAO, which has found [1985, 1987b, 1995]
that in those agencies where a consistent scoring system has been used to rate SBIR applications,
awardees’ scores have risen steadily. In addition, the GAO has found [1985, 1987a] that several
agencies were tardy in coming into compliance with SBA procedures as the program began.

                                                   23
expansion of the private equity market may have obviated the need for such a program, and the

long-run competitive      advantage that SBIR awards confer today may be much lower.             These

questions about the changes in the effectiveness of the program over time will only be answerable

in the future.




           Another   important unanswered    question relates to the social benefits of the program.

Numerous studies have suggested that, because of knowledge spillovers, social rates of return to

privately funded R&D are often much higher than the private returns which the firms performing

the research enjoy. This analysis has focused exclusively on private returns, as roughly measured

through sales and employment growth. The differentials between the private and social benefits of

the SBIR awards might be particularly         large, because many of them involve very early-stage

technologies (where spillovers to other firms may be more frequent) or those important to national

defense.     At the same time, the program’s      critics argue that the SBIR set-aside has led to a

reduction in finding      for academic research, which may have even greater social benefits [e.g.,

Mervis, 1996].       The program’s impact on social welfare is an important, but difficult to resolve,

issue.




           The evidence presented here sugges~ that public initiatives to provide capital for new firms

may have only a limited economic impact. This role, it appears, is much more as a complement to

the venture capital organizations and other private institutions that assist new firms: the impact of

the awards in regions without these private sector mechanisms was minimal.        This raises questions



                                                    24
about recently enacted programs (summarized in Table 1) that encourage public financing of and

guarantees for venture funds that invest in economically disadvantaged areas.




        At the same time, SBIR awards appear to have had a positive and substantial long-run

impact on the firms in regions with considerable venture capital activity,    In particular, awardees

appear to have grown substantially     faster—whether   measured by sales or emplo ymen=than         a

matching set of firms.     These results suggest that economists need to ask somewhat different

questions about such public initiatives.




        As discussed   in footnote 2, a major focus of economic studies of federal technology

programs has been the issue of “crowding out”: has federal finding       led to less private sector

investment, particularly in R&D, than would have occurred otherwise?         It is not clear, however,

that this is the proper question to be asking of programs that assist small, possibly capital-

constrained, companies.   For many of these firms, a major concern of management is extending the

amount of time until they need to seek refinancing or run out of capital.14 Thus, it is not clear

whether the pattern of small firms using public funds to extend the period before they need to seek

refinancing,   rather than using the funds to increase their rate of research funding, should be



    14Theability of SBIR finds to give researchers additional time to prove the viability of a new
technology was repeatedly emphasized in my interviews with awardees. More generally, the
impact that concerns about running out of cash-colloquially     known as “tie    dates’’—have on
the management of new ventures is discussed in Sahlman [1990]. Gompers [1995] documents
how venture capitalists adjust the amount of capital they p;ovide and hence the amount of time
until the firm needs to seek refinancing in response to uncertainty and informational
asymmetries.


                                                 25
considered problematic.     While an assessment of the ultimate success of firms receiving public

venture finding may not answer all the questions about these programs, this type of analysis is an

important complement to studies of the short-run impact on R&D spending.




        Even if, as Wallsten [1996] argues, capital constraints are unimportant and firms simply

substitute SBIR finding for their own expenditures, the funds provided by the program may still be

important.   One of the important benefits conferred by SBIR awards, participants argue, is the

signal that they provide to potential investors and customers.]s      Were SBIR awards purely an

honorary designation, they might more readily be designated for explicitly political considerations.

The presence of a substantial financial component—and       the associated regulatory provisions that

govern such awards-may       limit these pressures, and insure that the awards are an effective signal

of the quality of a firm’s technology.




   15Asillustrations of this claim, several directories of high-technology firms denote companies
that have won SBIR awards, and at least 103 press releases concerning SBIR awards were issued
between August 1995 and July 1996.

Note: The table provides an overview of the SBIR program. It indicates the amount of awards, the number of such
awards, and the share of external R&D spending that all agencies spending more than $100 million on external R&D
were required to set aside for the program. The Department of Defense was allowed an extra year to reach the 1.25°/0
target, and consequently had lower set-aside levels between 1983 and 1986. A1l amount figures are in millions of 1994
dollars.

Note: The table summarizes the change in the employment and sales of the 541 firms that received SBIR Phase II
awards in the first three program cycles and the 594 matching firms in the sample. Firms are divided by whether their
primary industry assignment in 1985 was to a SIC code with one or more seed or early-stage venture financing
between 1983 and 1985. All sales figures are in millions of current dollars.
