                                          ABSTRACT

Globalization, in the form of financial flows, which is always advantageous on an aggregative
level, typically creates winners and losers, if left exclusively to market forces. The effects of
financial globalization on income inequality depends on whether the country exports its capital to
the rest of the world or imports capital from abroad. In the capital-exporting case, financial
globalization drives up return to savings and drives down wages. In the capital-importing case,
financial globalization tends to raise wages but lower return on savings. Therefore, the
distributive policies of the welfare state in its role of spreading the gains from financial
globalization to various income groups varies, depending on whether the country exports, or
imports capital. The paper demonstrates that typical welfare-state redistribution policies,
governed by a majority of the population, spreads the globalization‚Äôs gains from trade to all
income groups, even those who are low skilled and have small capital endowments. Therefore,
financial globalization of a welfare- state economy generates a Pareto improvement. At the same
time, globalization, through enhanced capital mobility and high-skill emigration diminishes the
generosity of the welfare state.

Abstract


Globalization, in the form of financial flows, which is always advantageous on an aggregative

level, typically creates winners and losers, if left exclusively to market forces. The effects of

financial globalization on income inequality depends on whether the country exports its capital to

the rest of the world or imports capital from abroad. In the capital-exporting case, financial

globalization drives up return to savings and drives down wages. In the capital-importing case,

financial globalization tends to raise wages but lower return on savings. Therefore, the distributive

policies of the welfare state in its role of spreading the gains from financial globalization to

various income groups varies, depending on whether the country exports, or imports capital.


The paper demonstrates that typical welfare-state redistribution policies, governed by a majority

of the population, spreads the globalization‚Äôs gains from trade to all income groups, even those

who are low skilled and have small capital endowments. Therefore, financial globalization of a

welfare- state economy generates a Pareto improvement. At the same time, globalization, through

enhanced capital mobility and high-skill emigration diminishes the generosity of the welfare state.




   I.      Introduction




The Economist put it succinctly: ‚ÄúGlobalization is a tax problem for three reasons. First, firms

have more freedom over where to locate. This will make it harder for a country to tax a business

much more heavily than its competitors will. Second, globalization makes it hard to decide where

a company should pay tax, regardless of where it is based. This gives them [the companies] plenty

of scope to reduce tax bills by shifting operations around or by creating transfer pricing. Third,

globalization nibbles away at the edges of taxes on Individuals. It is harder to tax personal income




                                                 2
because skilled professional workers are more mobile than they were two decades ago." (The

Economist, 31st May, 1997).


Financial globalization triggers a race-to-the-bottom tax competition. The consequent erosion in

the tax base, especially on capital, erodes fiscal finance. Reaping the benefits of trade and financial

integration, in advanced countries, is not automatic. It requires improved safety nets.




The paper focuses on the role of the welfare state in spreading the gains from financial

globalization to various income groups under different majority voters, who are sharply different

in their wealth and labor market skills.




 The paper is organized as follows. Sections II-V provides some background discussion on

financial globalization, tax competition, and the size of the welfare state, which serves to motivate

the analysis. Section VI develops a stripped down model. Section VII presents the financial-

globalization consequences, derived from the model for the welfare state and income inequality.

Section VIII elaborates on the role of the welfare state in compensating losers. Section IX analyzes

the effects on utility levels of changes in the ease of high-skilled emigration. Section X concludes.




   II.      Financial Globalization

                                                  3
The recent wave of financial globalization in the world economy got started in earnest in the 1990s,

with rising cross-border financial flows among industrial economies and between industrial and

developing economies.2 This was spurred by liberalization of capital controls in many of these

countries. It is useful to begin with a standard financial globalization basic benchmark. Complete

international financial integration requires that in the long run, (when prices adjust to various

shocks and markets clear) the following arbitrage equation hold.

   Globalization has a new face. China‚Äôs emergence as a great economic power has induced a
significant shift in the patterns of world trade, with major effects on income inequality in its trade
partners. Alongside the consumer benefits of expanded trade there are substantial adjustment costs
and distributional consequences for them. Import competition from China, which surged after
2000, was a major force behind both reductions in US manufacturing employment and‚Äîthrough
input-output linkages and other general equilibrium channels‚Äîweak overall job growth. However
that import competition from China did not have large aggregative effects in the United States, but
it had substantially different employment repercussions in different commuting zones. The relative
reductions of employment were regionally concentrated. The US rise in wage inequality that is,
the rise of the college wage premium, is only partly the result of trade globalization; more
important factors are technological progress (biased towards skilled labor) and the decline of the
power of labor unions that were behind strong industrial wages.

China is also a key player in world finance, affecting all other open capital-market economies.
Indeed, several indicators point to a strengthening of China's role as an investor country in recent
years. By 2017 China is one of the most important FDI source, and destination, among the
economically more advanced economies, such as the US, EU, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan
and Singapore. Chinese inward FDI as percentage of GDP has been: 13.7 in 2014, 10.9 in 2015,
12.1 in 2016, and 12.6 in 2017. Chinese outward FDI as percentage of GDP has been: 2.4 in
2014, 9.8 in 2015, 12.1 in 2016, and 12.6 in 2017.

    world financial markets.


    III. Tax Competition



      Financial globalization triggers tax competition among countries, and the possibility of a ‚Äúrace

to the bottom‚Äù. As a result, the tax burden may shift from the highly mobile factors (e.g. capital

and top-skilled labor) to the weakly mobile factors (e.g. low-skill labor). This shift has first-order

implications for both the functional and the size distribution of income. A country that imposes

high tax rates may push mobile factors (especially capital) abroad where the country cannot

effectively tax them, eroding its own tax base and lowering domestic economic activity at the same

time. International tax competition and border tax adjustments of income tax have regained recent

public and scholarly attention since the legislation of the 2017 US Tax Bill, centered on corporate

tax cut and moving from corporate residence based in the direction of corporate source-based, and

curbing profit shifting.4 It     may significantly affect corporate financing and location decisions

pressure could result in an erosion of foreign countries‚Äô tax bases and an associated loss in tax

revenue triggering a new wave of international tax competition. 6

based (territorial).

  The 2017 large tax cut, mainly aimed at corporations and business owners. The real logic behind
corporate tax cuts is that they‚Äôre supposed to lead to higher investment. This investment, in turn, would
gradually increase the stock of capital, simultaneously driving down the pretax rate of return on
investment and pushing up wages, thanks to a long -term increase in domestic investment, mainly
financed by inflows of capital from abroad. The pre-reform US tax system was based on worldwide
(residence-based) taxation, under which income was taxed at an equal rate regardless of where profits
were earned. Since repatriation of foreign profits triggered high US taxation, US multinationals had an
incentive to refrain from bringing home their foreign earnings. In the light of substantial amounts of
‚Äútrapped earnings‚Äù abroad, tax holidays became a strategic tax planning tool of US multinationals. Along
with the transition to a territorial international tax system, the reform further provides for a one-time
deemed repatriation tax of deferred foreign corporate profits at a rate of 15.5% (cash assets) and 8%
(illiquid assets).

  Michael Devereux, Rachel Griffith and Alexander Klemm (2002) analyze the development of taxes on
corporate income in EU and G7 countries over the 1980s and the 1990sthey establish that tax revenues on
profitable investments had fallen. In particular, taxes on income earned by multinational firms are subject
to tax competition forces. Additional evidence pertaining to international tax competition for
relatively mobile portfolio investments, so that a country with more mobility has lower capital
tax rates, is abundant. See empirical support for the hypothesis in Hines (1999), Sorensen
(2002), Besley, Griffith and Klemm (2001), Devereux and Griffith (2002), and Lassen and
Sorensen (2002), Razin, Sadka, and Nam (2004), and Krautheim and Schmidt-Eisenhor (2011).

One can clearly detect in Figure 2 a noticeable breakpoint pointing to a significant

corporate income tax cuts, at the end of the 1980s in the wake of the single market launch

in mid 1990s. Overall, the mean EU effective corporate tax rate went down from 42% in

1975 to 32% in 2000, and the standard deviation went down from 8% in 1975 to 5.8% in

2000.


IV. Welfare-State Generosity


The general rules of making the welfare state less generous are quite straightforward:

lower taxes on capital income, and highly mobile labor, and curtail benefits.

In recent years, at the same time that the financial integration of the world economy built

up, most of the large industrialized economies have embarked on a track of trimming the

generosity of their pension and other welfare-state programs. This is not a coincidence.

Financial integration lower the tax on the mobile factor, capital, and weakens the capital

income tax base. Caminada et al (2010) explored EU welfare-state indicators. Using a

variety of indicators of social protection: social expenditures, both at the macro and at

the program level, replacement rates of unemployment, and social assistance benefits and

poverty indicators.8 Together, these indicators may provide a relatively broad picture of

the evolution of social protection in the EU. Table 1 demonstrates that the initial level of

public social expenditure prior to the creation of the EU has a negative effect on the on

EU provision of public social services well after EU has been established. We conjecture

that these patterns may have to do, among other things with the globalization forces that

were unleashed by the integration of Europe.

 They linearly regress the annual growth rate of several social protection indicators on the initial level of
the social protection indicator at the beginning of the period. The coefficient for absolute Œ≤-convergence is
estimated using an ordinary least square regression model of cross-sectional data. If the coefficient Œ≤ is
negative (positive), we say that there is absolute convergence (divergence) in social protection levels
across countries. The higher the value of Œ≤, the faster the social protection indicator in the poor region
converges toward the level of the rich one. The hypothesis to test is that coefficient Œ≤ is negative.

     V. Emigration of High Skilled


Another side of globalization is the international migration of skilled workers (the so‚Äêcalled brain drain).

It deprives the origin country from its scarce resource‚Äîhuman capital. Migrants are not random

samples of their home countries‚Äô populations; they are typically better educated. For example, the

demographer Feliciano (2005) who studies 32 U.S. immigrant groups find that nearly all immigrants are

more educated than those who remain in their home countries. 9


Using global bilateral migration databases, Kerr et al. (2016) observe that recently the number of

migrants with a tertiary degree rose by nearly 130 percent from 1990 to 2010, while low-skill

migrants increased by only 40 percent during that time. High-skilled migrants are departing from

a broader range of countries and heading to a narrower range of countries‚Äîin particular, to the

United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.10



9
  Docquier and Rapoport (2012) review the economics research on the brain drain, showing that high‚Äê
skill migration is becoming a dominant pattern of international migration and a major aspect of
globalization. The fact that international migration from poor to rich countries is becoming more of the
brain drain type is a serious source of concern in developing countries and for the development
community. Through the brain drain, it would seem, globalization is making human capital scarcer
where it is already scarce and more abundant where it is already abundant, thereby contributing to
increasing inequality across countries, including among the richer ones.


10
   The United States serves as a magnet for top scientific immigrants. Immigrants hold a
disproportionate share of jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math in the United States
(see Hanson and Slaughter (2016)). Top-talent drain from Israel is disproportionately high
among the highly educated immigrants. In general, the number of foreign scholars in America as
a percentage of scholars in the home country ranged from 1.3 percent in Spain to 4.3 percent in
the Netherlands. At 12.2 percent, Canada is an outlier, though this is much more of a two-way
street than in any of the other cases. While Canada is an outlier, Israeli scholars in America are in
a class by themselves. Israeli academics residing in the States in 2003‚Äì2004 represented 24.9
percent of the entire senior staff in Israel‚Äôs academic institutions that year‚Äîtwice the Canadian
percentage and over five times the percentage in the other developed countries. Razin (2018a)
observes that Israel is ranked at the very top for college graduate √©migr√©s to the United States per
10,000 residents, with number of about 41. Only Ireland with 49 is ranked above Israel. South

VI.   A Stripped-down Model


To put financial globalization, tax competition, high-skilled emigration, and the generosity of the

welfare state into a coherent analytical framework we develop here an international-tax-

competition model where the welfare state parameters (taxes and social benefits) are determined

through majority voting (Razin and Sadka 2018). We consider a two-period small open economy,

which responds to exogenously given world interest rate, taxes, an imperfect accessibility to

international capital markets and strong elements of source-based taxation. The welfare state

provides a uniform social benefit. This social benefit captures the various ingredients that the

welfare state accords, such as health services, education, in-kind transfers, and so on. Domestic

taxes on labor income and capital income are proportional.


We employ a stripped-down model, which includes the bare elements that will enable us to study

key implications of international capital flows and international tax competition on the welfare




Korea, also suffering from brain drain, has only about 25 college graduate √©migr√©s per 10 000
residents. At the policy level, they compare the points-based skilled migration regimes, as
historically implemented by Canada and Australia, with the employment-based policies used in
the United States through visa-control mechanisms, like the H-1B visa program. Because of the
links of global migration flows to employment and higher education opportunities, firms and
universities also act as important conduits, making employment and admission decisions that
deeply affect the patterns of high-skilled mobility.


                                                14
state. We assume a pure source-based (territorial) taxation. This means that the country does not

impose taxes on foreign-source income. 11


The representative producer equity-finance its activity, and all international capital flows are in

the form of equity securities.12 We consider a two-period small open economy, which responds to

exogenously given world interest rate, taxes, and an imperfect accessibility to international capital

markets. There is one all-purpose composite good (allowing us to abstract from trade issues) which

can serve for both consumption and capital investment.




There are two types of factors of production‚Äîcapital (K) and labor (L). The workers have two

types of skills‚Äîlow (l) and high (h).


The production function is Cobb-Douglas,


(3)       ùêπ ùêæ, ùêø      ùê¥ùêæ ùêø      ,




11
  Under the source (territorial) principle of international taxation only income from domestic
sources are subject to a tax, whereas foreign‚Äêsource income is exempt. Under the residence
principle, in contrast, income is taxed on a world‚Äêwide basis. Razin and Sadka (2017) illustrate
diagrammatically the efficiency dis‚Äêadvantage of the equilibrium under the source principle,
compared to the residence equilibrium. Because the consumption possibilities frontier shrinks
under the source principle, relative to the frontier under the residence principle, the latter is
more efficient. However, tax revenue collection is larger under the former, because of the
existence of tax havens and lack of sufficient international tax coordination.

 Evidently, debt flows have a special tax treatment deserve a rigorous separate analysis; they
12

will not be considered here.
                                                 15
With constant returns to scale, where A       0 is a total productivity parameter, and ùõº and 1    ùõº are,

respectively, the capital and labor shares.


Individuals live for two periods (1, and 2), so that there are essentially two consumption goods:

first-period consumption (ùëê ) and second-period consumption (ùëê ). Labor is internationally

immobile, whereas capital is mobile. Individuals can direct their savings at home and/or abroad.




Total size of the population is normalized to one. Labor supply (L) is measured in efficiency units.

We assume that there are ùõæ high-skill individuals, each providing one efficiency unit of labor, and

1    ùõæ low-skill individuals, each providing ùúå      1 efficiency units of labor. Thus, total labor supply

in efficiency units is given by


 4       ùêø    ùõæ   ùëö       1       ùõæ ùúå.


Where ùëö denotes the emigration of skilled individuals. Emigration depends on skilled utility

level:

Where ùë¢‚àó is the (exogenously given) utility level attained by s-individuals who reside abroad.

Note that the number of emigrants depends positively on the foreign-domestic utility difference

(that is ùë¢‚àó   ùë¢ .


The lower the skilled utility, ùë¢ , is, the higher is the rate of emigration, ùëö .


                                                   16
In the simulations we specify the emigration function as follows.

Where Z > 0 and 0 < z < 1 are parameters.


Capital is invested in the first period and output accrues in the second period. Factor remunerations

are also paid in the second period.


The wage per efficiency units and the domestic return to capital are given by the marginal

productivity conditions:

And,

Where the composite-good price is normalized to one. The specification in equation (4) assumes

that capital fully depreciates at the end of the production process.




                                                 17
The degree of globalization is captured by the ease of moving capital abroad. Capital flows
                                                           13
internationally, albeit at some cost- ùõø per unit.               A domestic individual who invests abroad can

thus gain 1        1       ùë°‚àó ùëü‚àó   ùõø , where r* is the world rate of interest, and ùë° ‚àó is the tax rate levied

abroad under a source-based taxation. In a small open economy context, the three variables, ( ùë° ‚àó

, ùëü ‚àó ùëéùëõùëë ùõø ) play an equivalent role, where the only relevant variable is 1                  ùë°‚àó ùëü‚àó      ùõø. Denoting

the domestic tax rate on capital by ùë° , capital-export arbitrage possibilities yield:




(7)                    1     1     ùë° ùëü     1      1    ùë°‚àó ùëü‚àó       ùõø.


For the sake of simplicity, we consider only the case where the equilibrium levels of saving abroad

is positive; that is there are capital outflows but not capital inflows.


With capital-import equilibrium, however, we should focus on the incentives of the foreign saver.

For simplicity, we assume that the cost of exporting capital applies symmetrically to foreign

investors, i.e. their return on investment in the studied country is given by 1                     1     ùë° ùëü      ùõø ,

whereas investing abroad yields a return of ùëÖ ‚àó .




13
  The parameter ùõø captures (albeit in a mechanic way) a group of frictions, contractual and
informational. Such frictions, which affect the volume and the composition and the volatility of international
capital flows, cause deviations from the ‚Äúlaw of one price‚Äù. As an example, foreign direct investors get more
efficient outcomes than foreign portfolio investors because the former have more direct control over management.
Thus, they are able to make a better-informed decision of how to run the business. However, the better information
mires FDI investors with the ‚Äúlemons‚Äù problem: If the investors‚Äô liquidity dries up, forcing the investors to sell off
foreign subsidiaries, market participants would not know whether the subsidiary is liquidated because of the
investors‚Äô liquidity problems or because of bad inside information about the profitability of the subsidiary.
Consequently, the market will place a discount on assets sold by an FDI investor, who has the inside information,
unlike the FPI investor.

                                                          18
With homogenous capital goods, perfect information, and absent any uncertainty, in equilibrium

there can be either inflows or outflows of private capital, but never both. Denote by ùëÜ ‚àó the foreigner

capital exports, it takes place if14



                                   ùëÜ‚àó     0 ùëñùëì        ùëÖ‚àó       ùõø       1    ùëü 1   ùë° .




Therefore, in the case of capital-import equilibrium, arbitrage in the world capital market yields

an equality between the net of tax world return to saving, minus the capital import friction cost ùõø

, with one plus the net of tax return to domestic savings.


                        1     1     ùë° ùëü      ùõø    1        1        ùë°‚àó ùëü‚àó


That is, in the case of capital-importing country, capital-import arbitrage in the world capital

market yields an equality between the net of tax world return to saving, minus the capital import

friction cost ùõø , with one plus the net of tax return to domestic savings.


As before, the degree of globalization is captured by the ease of moving capital abroad.

Specifically, we assume that there is some cost, ùõø, per unit of investment abroad. By raising the

cost parameter, we raise or lower the intensity of capital imports into the home country.




14
     ùëÜ‚àó   0 implies that domestic saving abroad, ùëÜ ‚àó is positive, and the capital‚Äêexport equilibrium will emerge.

                                                               19
Each high-skill individual is endowed with one unit of the composite good in the first period; a

low-skill individual is endowed only with ùúÉ                 1 units. Thus, an h-skill individual enjoys both

higher initial endowment (‚Äúwealth‚Äù), and higher labor market skill than the l-skill individual.


We assume Cobb-Douglas preferences for both types of individuals,

15
  We have done various simulations with different specification: (1) social benefit and private consumption are
perfect substitutes; (2) The social benefit sub‚Äêutility enters the utility function multiplicatively. However,
qualitative results are similar for a variety of these specifications.

The welfare state employs taxes on labor income (ùë° ) and capital income ( ùë° ) in the second period

and provides the social benefit (b).


We denote by ùëÜ ‚àó the aggregate domestic saving which is channeled abroad, so that the first-

period resource constraint is:


     (13)     ùêæ       ùëÜ‚àó          ùõæùëê       1     ùõæ           ùëö ùëê               ùõæ     ùëö      1       ùëö ùúÉ.


The second-period resource constraint is:

The government budget constraint is active only in the second period, and its budget constraint is

given by


   (15) (1-ùëö          ùëè       ùë°        1   ùõæ ùúå           ùõæ           ùëö     ùë§       ùë° ùëüùêæ.


Note that by Walras‚Äô Law, the government budget constraint is redundant. (Note also that with

source-based taxation, the return on ùëÜ ‚àó is not taxed at home.)


The policy employed by the welfare state depends on which of the two groups of individuals (l

and h) form the majority. That is whether ùõæ is greater or smaller than1                                      ùõæ     ùëö . The policy

variables areùë° , ùë° and b. When the low ‚Äìskill group form the majority (that is,                                      ùõæ      0.5), the

                                                                         21
policy variables are chosen to maximize        ùë¢        ùëê ùëê     ùëè . In addition, when the high-skill

individuals are in the majority (that is, ùõæ   0.5), the policy variables are chosen so as to maximize

ùë¢     ùëê ùëê          ùëè .


Although taxes are levied, and social benefits are granted, only in the second period. Nevertheless,

these policy variables are determined, announced, and committed to, already in the first period by

the fully informed and dynamically consistent policy makers.




In the case of capital-import equilibrium, financial globalization will raise wages and lower return

on savings, raising income for both income groups even in the absence of welfare-state

redistribution policies.


We abstract from this case in the numerical simulations.


            VII.    Characterizing the political-economy equilibrium: the case of capital-

            exporting country




Our objective is to study how these policies respond to changes in the process of globalization,

driven by changes in the parameters ùë° ‚àó , ùëü ‚àó , and ùõø. In particular, the response of b may be viewed

as the effect on the generosity of the welfare state, and the effect on ùë°   captures the international

tax competition. We are also interested in the effects on the consumption-equivalent utility levels

to gauge the effects of globalization on income distribution, and the benefits from globalization.


For this purpose, and given the multitude forces at play, we resort to numerical simulations.

                                                   22
The degree of globalization measured by the cost parameter ùõø. We study therefore the implications

of changing ùõø for the economy in general (e.g. the allocation of capital between domestic and

foreign uses), and for the tax burden, its composition, and the generosity of the welfare state, in

particular.16


As expected, Figures 3 and 4 show that financial globalization (i.e. lowering ùõø


Shifts capital from home abroad. This is true no matter whether the high-skill or the low-skill form

the majority. Naturally, both capital invested at home and abroad, are higher when the high-skill

form the majority, than when the low-skill form the majority.

Also, as domestic capital falls with financial globalization, the rate of return of domestic capital

rises and the wage rate falls.


Turning our attention to the welfare-state system, Figures 5 and 7 show that financial globalization

shifts the tax burden away from domestic capital income to labor income. It also lowers the total

tax burden, and consequently, the provision of the social benefit (b). These results obtain regardless

of which skill type form the majority. Naturally, the tax rates on capital and labor are higher when

a low-skill type form the majority, than when the high-skill type forms the majority.

Comparing the levels of the social benefit under the two regimes, there are two forces at play. On

the one hand, the tax rate is higher under a low-skill majority. On the other hand, the economy is

less productive when the low-skill labor is the larger component of the labor force. This force


                                               28
reduces the total tax revenues. In our simulations, the second effect dominates. As a result, the

social benefit (b) is lower under the low-skill regime.


Turning now to who is the winner and who is the loser from financial globalization, we note that

the issue is far from being a straightforward application of a gains-from-trade argument. For an

existence of Pareto improvement to work in a multi-consumer economy, it is an essential to have

a specific way for the redistribution policy, so as to compensate the losers by taxing the winners.

However, our model‚Äôs redistribution system is constrained by who is the majority, low-skilled or

high-skilled.

Figures 8 and 9 indicate that thanks to the existence of the welfare state tax-transfer policies,

financial globalization leads to a Pareto improvement. Both skill types, regardless of who form the




                                                        31
majority, benefit from financial globalization.17 We can also demonstrate that both skill types

benefit. 18




17
  Note that we assume perfect substitution between the two labor skill types and complementarity
between capital and labor. If there is complementarity‚Äê relation between all factors of production, our
result is still valid. Krusell et al (2000), who analyzed US data, decompose capital into equipment and
structures. They were able to track wage gap for the years 1960 to 1990 and show that capital
accumulation explains most of the rise in wage inequality. Note, however that capital which leaves the
domestic economy as a result of financial globalization (and escape tax under the source‚Äêterritorial tax
principle domestic taxes), with input‚Äêsubstitutability between low‚Äêskilled labor and capital, tends to
raise low‚Äêskilled wages and raise the domestic return to capital that they own.


18
   As utility is ordinal, we cannot just compare whose utility rises by more. Instead, we calculate
a sort of consumption equivalent to the utility. Specifically, we ask what a uniform percentage
increase in both present and future consumption generates the same increase in ordinal utility as
generated by the financial globalization (the change in ùõø). Formally, denote this percentage
increase      by     ùë• ùõø ,i       l, h.     Define     consumption       equivalent      utility by
    ùëêÃÖ 1 ùë• ùõø              ùëêÃÖ   1 ùë• ùõø               ùëè      ùëêÃÉ      ùëêÃÉ           ùëè , where ‚Äú-‚Äúrefers
to the pre-change in ùõø , and ‚Äú~‚Äù refers to the post- change in ùõø. i = l, h. This yields: 1 ùë• ùõø
     .

VIII. Role of the welfare state


To highlight the role of the welfare state in safeguarding the globalization gains for all (the

unskilled-poor individuals and the skilled-rich individuals), we consider in this section the extreme

case where the welfare state does not exist (that is, ùë° , ùë° and b are all set equal to zero).




Figure 10: Financial Globalization without welfare state: utility of the high skill type




                                                  33
Figure 11: Financial Globalization without welfare state: utility of the low high skill type




Figure 12: Financial Globalization without welfare state: The Gini coefficient




                                                 34
Figures 10-12 demonstrate that without having the welfare state redistribution, the consequences

of the financial globalization are that the high skill-rich individual gain, while the low-skill poor

lose. Consequently, income inequality worsens. Thus, as shown in the previous section, the welfare

state tax and transfer features, although politically controlled by the self-interest majority, are key

to guarantee the spread of financial globalization gains to all.


IX. High-Skilled Emigration and Utility Levels



                                                  35
Emigration of high skill labor is directly affected by the globalized world economy and the

redistribution domestic policies. The mobility of high-skilled labour puts restrictions on how high

the rates of taxes can be raised in relation to the kinds of benefits and services that are provided..

The model predicts that the negative impact of brain drain on the utility levels of ‚Äúthose left

behind‚Äù depend on the ease in which high skill labor emigrates, which income group is the

majority, and sets domestic redistributive policies, and the friction cost associated with capital

moving abroad.


Recall that       ùëö      ùëö ùë¢‚àó      ùë¢    = ùëç ùë¢‚àó     ùë¢


Where Z > 0, and z > 0 are parameters.


Where ùë¢‚àó is the (exogenously given) utility level attained by s-individuals who reside abroad. Note

that the number of emigrants depends positively on the foreign-domestic utility difference (that is

ùë¢‚àó    ùë¢ . The lower the skilled utility, ùë¢ , is, the higher is the rate of emigration, ùëö .


When Z rises, emigration is facilitated by the relaxation of immigration constraints imposed by

the migration-destination country, or by better matching of skills between the migration-origin and

migration destination countries.




                                                 36
Naturally, as the ease-of-emigration parameter Z increases, emigration rises, as shown in Figure

13 (a); the welfare state generosity measure (b) falls as the ease of emigration rises, due to a

diminished labor income tax base (figure 13(b).

X. Conclusion


Capital market globalization affects income distribution in a variety of ways: through its effects

on location and sectoral nature of investment and portfolio composition of savings, wages and

                                               38
rents, etc. Furthermore, globalization introduces tax competition among countries, and a possibility

of a ‚Äúrace to the bottom‚Äù. As a result, the tax burden may shift from the mobile factors (e.g. capital

and top-skilled labor) to the weakly mobile factors (e.g. low skill labor). This shift has first-order

implications for both the functional and the size distribution of income. A country that imposes

high tax rates may push mobile factors (especially capital) abroad where the country cannot

effectively tax them, eroding its own tax base and lowering domestic economic activity at the same

time. A simple framework to study the issue of tax competition is with the aid of a stylized model

with a pure source-based (territorial) taxation. This means that the country does not impose taxes

on foreign-source income. 19


The creation of the single European market works like a ‚Äúnatural experiment‚Äù that helped testing

the effect of financial globalization on the welfare state. This event triggered a race-to-the bottom

tax competition which reduces capital income tax revenues. It generated cross-country re-

allocation of capital which had first-order effects on income inequality, by chipping away at the

domestic tax base. The easing a country access to the world capital markets typically induces also

political-economy grounded policy changes that impact income inequality. The downscaled

welfare state nevertheless is able to spread the gains from financial globalization among most

income groups, regardless of who the decisive voter is determining the tax-transfer policies.


Many large industrialized economies have embarked in recent years on a track of trimming the

generosity of their pension and other welfare-state programs. The general rules are quite


19
     International tax competition and border tax adjustments of income tax have received increasing public

and scholarly attention since the introduction of the US 2017 US Tax Bill, which shifts corporate taxation

to the source (territorial) principle.



                                                      39
straightforward: raise retirement age and curtail benefits. Following the report of the Greenspan

Committee (January, 1983), the U.S. has gradually raised the retirement age to reach 67 in the

year 2027. Similarly, but much later France, in July 2003 decided to require public sector

workers (about one-fourth of the French workforce) to contribute to the state pension system for

40 years, instead of 37.5 years. Also, Germany, which already raised its retirement age from 63

to 65, is currently contemplating raising it further to 67 between 2011 and 2035. With respect to

curtailing benefits, this is usually accomplished by abandoning wage-indexation in favor of

price-indexation. Naturally, as real wages rise over time (due mostly to productivity increases),

price-indexation is less generous to pensioners than wage-indexation; see Cogan and Mitchell

(2003) for the U.S. and Thode (2003) for Europe. Financial globalization across various

economies is a universal phenomenon to reckon with today. Can the welfare state, financed

partly by high capital taxes survive international tax competition brought about by such

globalization? Evidently, the answer is in it can; and it seems to be crucial to spread the gains

from financial asset trade across various income groups. To demonstrate these points we apply a

political economy model where the pillars of the welfare state system are determined by the

majority group, poor-low skilled or rich-high skilled to assess the forces of globalization.

We have shown that the social benefits decline as financial globalization increases. What are the

gains are for the low-skilled workers that offset the reduction in benefits? It is essentially that

they are getting a higher rate of return on their savings due to greater access to world markets.

But in essence their well-being is subject to two conflicting forces that are at play: one hand the

return to their savings rises with the globalization; on the hand, wages and social benefits fall. If

their initial wealth is sufficiently low, and if the low-skilled have preferences that lead them to

save much less relative to their wealth than the high-skilled-rich, then the gains-to-all result



                                                  40
might not hold. However, even in this case they are better off having a welfare state system in

place rather than its absence, to compensate them from depressed wages and declining provision

of social benefits.20

Dovetailing on globalization is the ageing process in many advanced economies. One would

naturally expect that as the share of the elderly in the population rise when the population ages;

their political influence would strengthen the pro welfare-state coalition. Similarly, one would

expect this coalition to gain more political power as more low-skill migrants are naturalized.

Thus, aging and low-skilled migration seem to tilt the political power balance in the direction of

boosting the welfare state, imposing a growing burden on the existing workforce. However, this

political-balance force conflicts with the fiscal-burden force if aging comes together with low-

skill migration, which increases the share of net recipients of the generous welfare state. Recall

that the old derive most of their income from capital because they retired from work. Therefore,

at first thought, it may seem that as the share of the old in an aging population rises, then an

attempt to rely more heavily on capital taxes would face a stiffer political resistance. However,

after a careful scrutiny of this hypothesis we come to an unconventional conclusion: Aging

plausibly tilts the political power balance in favor of larger capital-financed welfare state.

Literature cited provides also supportive empirical evidence from the EU for this conclusion. Is

the latter conclusion relevant? After all, aging is not the only process witnessed nowadays.


Immigration is a counter force to ageing because it typically skews towards young ages.

Immigration produces sizeable demographic changes over time that have first-order effect on



20
  Swank and Betz (2003) find that net of the impacts of other political forces, the universal welfare state, as
measured by an index of coverage, generosity and active labor market programs, significantly depresses the votes
of the populistic new political right. Its political clout has increased in Europe by globalization forces (especially
volume of refugees and asylum seekers.

                                                          41
redistribution policy. Most advanced economies face a generational distribution problem that

migration might help with, but migration affects young and old, rich and poor, differently. The

welfare state of these advanced economies is also a magnet for migrants, especially the low-skill.

On the one hand, the native-born older population need young immigrants to support the welfare

state; on the other hand, these immigrants may increase the fiscal burden on the native-born young.

How these tensions are to be resolved in the political economy context Razin (2018), Razin, and

Sadka (2005, 2018) .address the impact on income inequality, and redistribution policy because of

a large wave of skilled immigrants.


Ottaviano and Peri (2012) calculate the effects of immigration on the wages of native US workers

of various skill levels in two steps. In the first step, they use labor demand functions to estimate

the elasticity of substitution across different groups of workers. In the second step, they use the

underlying production structure and the estimated elasticities to calculate the total wage effects of

immigration in the long run. In the data-preferred model, they find that there is a small but

significant degree of imperfect substitutability between natives and immigrants which, when

combined with the other estimated elasticities, implies that in the period from 1990 to 2006

immigration had a small effect on the wages of native workers with no high school degree (between

0.6% and +1.7%).21 It also had a small positive effect on average native wages (+0.6%) and a

substantial negative effect (‚àí6.7%) on wages of previous immigrants in the long run.


Appendix




21
  Ottaviano and Peri (2012) emphasize that a production function framework is needed to combine own-group
effects with cross-group effects in order to obtain the total wage effects for each native group. In order to obtain a
parsimonious representation of elasticities that can be estimated with available data, Authors adopt alternative
nested-CES models and let the data select the preferred specification. New to this paper is the estimate of the
substitutability between natives and immigrants of similar education and experience levels.

Globalization and income distribution has been studied mostly from the          international- trade

paradigm perspective.     Stolper and Samuelson (1941), early on, explained how increased

international trade with capital-intensive good and labor-intensive good, for labor‚Äìabundant and

capital-abundant countries, should reduce the relative wage in the capital-abundant country; hence,

increasing the income gaps between capital and labor. However, Krugman (2008) points that while

standard economic analysis predicts that increased U.S. trade with unskilled labor‚Äìabundant

countries should reduce the relative wages of U.S. unskilled labor, a slew of empirical studies in

the 1990s found only a modest effect. Yeaple (2005) demonstrates that a reduction in variable

trade costs prompts more firms to adopt the better technology in the differentiated product sector.

The most-able workers among those who operate the inferior technology switch employment to

firms who operate the more advanced technology, As a result, the least able workers among those

who operated the inferior technology switch employment to the traditional sector. Hence, the wage

gap between able and less able workers rises. Helpman (2018), however, with a comprehensive

review of the literature and evidence, concludes that the aggregative effects of trade-globalization

are modest.
