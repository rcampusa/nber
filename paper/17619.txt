                                               ABSTRACT

In the past, industrial countries have tended to pursue countercyclical or, at worst, acyclical fiscal policy.
In sharp contrast, emerging and developing countries have followed procyclical fiscal policy, thus
exacerbating the underlying business cycle. We show that, over the last decade, about a third of the
developing world has been able to escape the procyclicality trap and actually become countercyclical.
We then focus on the role played by the quality of institutions, which appears to be a key determinant
of a country’s ability to graduate. We show that, even after controlling for the endogeneity of institutions
and other determinants of …scal procyclicality, there is a causal link running from stronger institutions
to less procyclical or more countercyclical fiscal policy.

1     Introduction

The cyclical behavior of …scal policy di¤ers across countries by income group. In the past, while

industrial countries have tended to pursue …scal policy that is countercyclical or at worst acyclical,

developing countries have tended to follow procyclical …scal policy: they have increased spending (or

cut taxes) during periods of expansion and cut spending (or raised taxes) during periods of recession.

Many authors have documented that …scal policy has tended to be more procyclical in developing coun-

tries than industrialized countries.1 Most studies look at the procyclicality of government spending,

because tax receipts are endogenous with respect to the business cycle. Indeed, an important reason

for procyclical spending is precisely that government receipts from taxes or mineral royalties rise in

booms, and the government cannot resist the temptation or political pressures to increase spending

proportionately, or even more than proportionately. A similar procyclical pattern can be found on

the tax side by focusing on tax rates rather than revenues, though cross-country evidence is harder to

come by. Vegh and Vuletin (2012a) …nd that tax rate policy has been mostly procyclical in developing

countries and acyclical in industrialized countries.

    In terms of government spending, the contrast between the two groups of countries can be clearly

seen in Figure 1, which updates evidence presented in Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Vegh (2004). The

…gure depicts the correlation between (the cyclical components of) government spending and GDP for

94 countries (21 developed and 73 developing countries) for the period 1960-2009. Black bars represent

industrial countries while light bars represent developing countries. A positive (negative) correlation

indicates procyclical (countercyclical) government spending.2 The visual image tells the whole story:

light bars lie overwhelmingly on the right hand side (positive correlations) while black bars dominate

the left hand side (negative correlations). Indeed, more than 90 percent of developing countries (67

out of 73) show procyclical government spending, while around 80 percent of industrial countries (17

(2005), Mendoza and Oviedo (2006), Alesina, Campante and Tabellini (2008), and Ilzetzki and Vegh (2008).
    2 Needless to say, correlations do not tell us anything about causality which, in principle, could go in either direction.

Ilzetzki and Vegh (2008), however, show that, even when properly instrumented, output does cause government spending,
as emphasized by the …scal procyclicality literature.

out of 21) show countercyclical government spending.

   Why would policymakers pursue procyclical …scal policy? After all, such policy cannot be optimal

since it will tend to reinforce the business cycle, exacerbating booms and aggravating busts. The most

convincing explanations in the literature fall in two, not necessarily inconsistent, camps: (i) imperfect

access to international credit markets and lack of …nancial depth (Gavin, Hausmann, Perotti and

Talvi, 1996; Gavin and Perotti, 1997; Riascos and Vegh, 2003; Caballero and Krishnamurthy, 2004)

and (ii) political distortions (Velasco, 1997; Tornell and Lane, 1999; Talvi and Vegh, 2005).3 Lack

of access to credit markets in bad times will naturally leave governments with no choice but to cut

spending and raise taxes, whereas political pressures for additional spending in good times are hard to

resist, particularly when there may exist a genuine need for more government spending in critical social

areas. Improving access to credit in bad times (including o¢ cial …nancial assistance from multilateral

…nancial institutions such as the IMF) and designing rules and institutions that aim at ensuring that

…scal revenues are saved in good times so that they are available in bad times would go a long way to

alleviate the scourge of procyclical …scal policy.

   In fact – and as we will argue in this paper – over the last decade several developing countries

have been able to “graduate” in the sense of overcoming the problem of procyclicality and becoming

countercyclical.4 Theoretical work by Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2011) and Nakata (2011)

clearly suggests that this shift in the cyclical properties of …scal policy is welfare improving since

the optimal …scal policy in a stochastic model with sticky prices is countercycical. In fact, both

papers show that countercyclical …scal policy is even more e¤ective when monetary policy has become

powerless because the policy interest rate has hit the zero bound. Intuitively, suppose the economy is

hit systematically (in a stochastic sense) by, say, shocks to the discount factor. In bad times (when the

preference shock induces household to save more), it becomes optimal for the government to increase

spending (even to the point of making the zero bound marginally non-binding if it was binding to
  3 Calderón and Schmidt-Hebbel (2008) provide evidence for the empirical relevance of these two channels.
  4 Our work can be viewed as complementing, on the …scal side, recent work by Reinhart, Rogo¤, and Qiang (2010)
who study graduation from default, in‡ation, and banking crises, and Vegh and Vuletin (2012b) who study graduation
from monetary procyclicality.

    Chile is undoubtedly the poster child of this graduation movement. As discussed in Frankel (2012),

since 2001 Chile has followed a …scal rule that has a structural (i.e., cyclically-adjusted) …scal balance

as its target.6 By construction, such a rule ensures that temporarily high …scal revenues are saved

rather than spent. But, as we will show below, Chile is not the only country that seems to have escaped

the procyclicality trap.

    Our analysis con…rms previous …ndings in the literature regarding the role of increased …nancial

integration and lower output volatility in reducing …scal procyclicality.                 The paper’s main focus,

however, is on the role played by the quality of institutions. We argue that the quality of institutions

seems to be a key determinant of a country’s ability to graduate and show evidence that as the quality

of institutions increases over time, the level of procyclicality falls.

    The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 shows the shift in …scal policy in many emerging and

developing countries over the last decade. Section 3 traces this shift to the quality of institutions and

presents some basic regressions that establish a negative correlation between …scal procyclicality and

the quality of institutions. Moreover, we show that a marked improvement in institutional quality

witnessed during the last 25 years in some developing countries seems to be at the root of their

“graduation.” Sections 4 and 5 go a step further and control for other determinants of procyclicality

and address endogeneity concerns. We show that there is a strong case to be made that causality indeed

runs from the quality of institutions to less procyclical or countercyclical …scal policy. Concluding

remarks can be found in Section 6.
   5 Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2011) derive this result taking monetary policy as given. Nakata (2011),

however, shows that countercyclical …scal policy is optimal even if monetary policy is chosen optimally.
   6 The original target was a structural surplus of 1 percent, re‡ecting the need to repay Central Bank debt associated

with the bailout of private banks in the 1980s. As this debt was paid o¤ over time, the targeted structural balance was
reduced to 0.5 percent in 2008 and 0 percent in 2009.

2     Graduating class

This section documents the important shift in the cyclical behavior of …scal policy over the last decade

in the developing world. To this end, we divided the 1960-2009 sample used in Figure 1 into two sub-

samples: 1960-1999 and 2000-2009. Figure 2 replicates Figure 1 for the period 1960-1999 and conveys

essentially the same message. Figure 3, on the other hand, focuses on the period 2000-2009. Once

again, the visual image conveyed by Figure 3 is striking when compared to Figure 2. Speci…cally, the

number of light bars on the left-side of the picture (i.e., negative correlations) has greatly increased.

Around 35 percent of developing countries (26 out of 73) now show a countercyclical …scal policy, up

from 8 percent (6 out of 73) in Figure 2.

    To illustrate graduation, Figure 4 presents a scatter plot with the 1960-1999 correlation on the

horizontal axis and the 2000-2009 correlation on the vertical axis. By dividing the scatter plot into

four quadrants along the zero axes, we can classify countries into four categories:


    1. Established graduates (bottom-left): These are countries that have always been countercyclical.

      Not surprisingly, 87 percent of the countries in this category are industrial countries, including

      the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia.


    2. Still in school (top-right) These are countries that have continued to behave procyclically over

      the last decade. Again not surprisingly, 96 percent of these countries are developing countries,

      including Venezuela, Peru, and India.


    3. Back to school (top-left): These are countries that were countercyclical during the 1960-1999

      period and turned procyclical over the last decade. This small group of countries is split fairly

      evenly between developed and developing countries. It includes Greece and Jamaica.


    4. Recent graduates (bottom-right): These are countries that used to be procyclical and became

      countercyclical over the last decade. They are mostly represented by developing countries (24

      out of 26, or 96 percent) and include Chile, Brazil, and Botswana.



                                                   5
     In sum, the evidence suggests that about a third of the developing world (24 out of 73 countries)

has recently “graduated” from procyclicality.

     The evidence of countercyclicality among many emerging market and developing countries matches

up with other criteria for judging maturity in the conduct of …scal policy: debt-GDP ratios, rankings

by rating agencies, and sovereign spreads. Low income and emerging market countries in the aggregate

have achieved debt-GDP levels around 40 percent of GDP over the last four years. The IMF estimates

the 2011 ratio at 43 percent among emerging market countries and 35 percent among low-income

countries. This is the same period during which debt in advanced countries has risen from about 70

per cent of GDP to 102 percent. The …nancial markets have rati…ed the historic turnaround. Spreads

are now lower for many emerging markets than for some “advanced countries.” As of early 2012,

Singapore has a higher credit rating than France or the US; Chile has a higher credit rating than

Japan; Korea and China have higher credit ratings than Spain; Malaysia, South Africa, Brazil, and

Thailand all have higher ratings than Italy; Colombia has a higher rating than Iceland or Ireland;

Indonesia and the Philippines have higher ratings than Portugal; and various African countries have

higher ratings than Greece.

     Largely as a result of their improved …scal situations during the period 2000-2007, many emerging

markets were able to bounce back from the 2008-2009 global …nancial crisis more quickly than advanced

countries.7




3       Graduation and institutional quality

What explains the ability of some countries, particularly emerging market and developing countries,

to escape the trap of procyclical …scal policy? Many researchers have pointed to the importance of

institutions in determining various aspects of public policy.8 In this spirit, this section shows that

institutional quality (IQ) explains some of the most recent changes in cyclicality of …scal policy. To
    7 See,
        for example, Didier, Hevia, and Schmukler (2012).
    8 Theimportance of institutions for …scal policy has been emphasized by Buchanan (1967), von Hagen and Harden
(1995), Alesina and Perotti (1996), Poterba and Von Hagen (1999), Persson and Tabellini (2004), and Calderón and
Schmidt-Hebbel (2008), among others.



                                                       6
this e¤ect, we construct an index of IQ by calculating the average of four normalized variables from

the International Country Risk Guide dataset:


      Investment pro…le: An assessment of factors a¤ecting investment risk that are not covered by

      other political, economic and …nancial risk components. The risk rating assigned is the sum of

      three subcomponents: contract viability/expropriation, pro…ts repatriation, and payment delays.


      Corruption: An assessment of corruption within the political system.


      Law and order: An assessment of the strength and impartiality of the legal system and the

      popular observance of the law.


      Bureaucratic quality: An assessment of the strength and expertise to govern without drastic

      changes in policy or interruptions in government services.


   The IQ index ranges between 0 (lowest institutional quality) and 1 (highest institutional quality).

   We …rst establish a link between the four way classi…cation in Figure 4 and IQ. To this e¤ect,

Column 1 in Table 1 reports the average IQ for each of these groups. As hypothesized, the highest

IQ is for the “established graduates” group. Next is the “back to school” group with an average

index of 0.6, followed by the “recent graduates” group with an average index of 0.55. The “still in

school” countries have the lowest institutional quality (0.48). All these IQ di¤erences are statistically

signi…cant at the 1 percent level.

   We then construct a scatter plot relating IQ and procyclicality, shown in Figure 5. We can see a

clear negative relationship between IQ and cyclicality of …scal policy. The higher (lower) the IQ in

a country, the more countercyclical (procyclical) is …scal policy. Based on the estimated regression,

an IQ level of 0.79 supports acyclicality. A higher (lower) level of IQ supports countercyclicality

(procyclicality).

   In order to further explore the importance of IQ in the process of graduation from procyclicality,

we decompose IQ values in each country into two components;  and        .  refers to



                                                   7
the initial (or earliest) IQ observed. In most countries this value corresponds to the IQ level in 1984.9

   is then de…ned as the di¤erence between the current IQ value and  . In other words,

      IQ¬ . Columns 2 and 3 in Table 1 show the average  and                 for each of

these groups.

   We should take the …ndings for the “back to school”group with a grain of salt given the small sample

included in this group; only 8 countries (see top-left quadrant in Figure 4). Column 2 shows that, as

expected, the highest initial IQ (0.84) is for the “established graduates” group. Mean tests support

the idea that initial IQ for “established graduates”is statistically higher than for the other graduating

categories at the 1 percent level. “Still in school” and “recent graduates” have initial IQ values

that are statistically indistinguishable from each other. Column 3 of Table 1 shows that “established

graduates”have the highest IQ inertia; i.e., lowest         values in absolute terms. Moreover, this group

has seen a slight decline in IQ in recent times. On the other hand, “recent graduates” is the group

with the highest recent increase in IQ. Mean tests support the idea that            for “recent graduates”

is statistically higher than for the other graduating categories at the 1 percent level. To sum up,

“established graduates”have the highest initial IQ and show no major improvements over time. Both

“still in school” and “recent graduates” share similar initial IQ conditions. However, the increase in

IQ recently observed is much higher in “recent graduates” than the one observed in “still in school.”

   Although one thinks of institutions as slow-moving, they can change over time. Figure 6 provides

some examples of the within-country relation between IQ and cyclicality of …scal policy by plotting for

three di¤erent countries the correlation between government spending and GDP computed over a 20-

year rolling window and the level of IQ. Panel A shows the case of Australia, an “established graduate.”

IQ levels have been consistently around 0.80 and …scal policy has always been countercyclical. At the

other extreme, Panel B shows the case of Venezuela, a “still in school”country. IQ levels have ranged

between 0.24 and 0.58 and …scal policy has been consistently procyclical. Panel C shows the case

of Chile, a “recent graduate.” The IQ increased from values close to 0.5 in the early 1980s to more
  9 The only exceptions are Rep. of Congo (1985), Gambia (1985), Niger (1985), Sierra Leone (1985), Yemen (1990),

and Azerbaijan (1998).




                                                       8
than 0.8 since the mid 2000s. In line with our arguments, …scal policy shifted from being strongly

procyclical –with values close to Venezuela’s –to countercyclical.

   Chile’s experience is a good illustration of how a country with good IQ in the general sense of

rule of law can help lock in countercyclical …scal policy through speci…c budget institutions. Frankel

(2012) analyzes how Chile did it, with the structural budget reforms of 2000 and 2006. Fiscal rules,

such as euroland’s Stability and Growth Pact, often accomplish little in themselves, because they are

not necessarily enforced or credible. Rules can even worsen the general tendency of governments to

make overly optimistic forecasts for economic growth and budget balance.10 Chile’s key innovation was

to give responsibility for forecasting to independent experts commissions, insulated from politicians’

wishful thinking. Its approach could be emulated by others.

   Finally, we use panel data regressions to exploit within-country variability as opposed to cross-

country variability. Table 2, column 1 shows the estimates for                2   and    3   when estimating the following

equation
                                                            
                             =   1   +   2    +   3   (  ) +   4    +      +                         (1)


where   and   are the cyclical components of government spending and output. Our main result

continues to hold:       an increase in IQ reduces the degree of procyclicality. In line with our cross-

country regression (see Figure 5), we …nd an IQ threshold of 0.79 for graduation. Our results do

not change when we allow each coe¢ cient in equation (1) to vary by graduating class, as reported

in Columns 2a-2d.        The only case for which our main results are not supported is for “established

graduates.”This is mainly due to the small sample (15 countries) and, more importantly, to the small

within-country variability of IQ described before for this set of countries.

   We now decompose the variable IQ into its initial value  , which is constant over time,

and    , which varies over time. Table 2, column 3 shows the estimates for                           2,   3   and   4   when

    The underlying idea is to …nd out whether it is the highly inertial/static component of IQ that

matters for …scal policy –à la Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2001) –or the dynamic component

of IQ. For the whole sample (column 3) both factors, historical as well as more recent changes in IQ,

seem to matter. Our results do not change when we allow each coe¢ cient in equation (2) to vary by

graduating class, as reported in Columns 4a-4d. Some interesting asymmetries emerge between the

“still in school” and “recent graduate” categories. Column 4b indicates that for the “still in school”

group, historical factors dominate. This is consistent with very static IQ measures (compared to those

of “recent graduates”) during the last 25 years. Instead, for the“recent graduates” group, it is the

more recent change in IQ (i.e.,           ) that seems to be mainly driving the results. This suggests that

changes in IQ are an important determinant of graduation.

    Our analysis so far has suggested that IQ is an important determinant of procyclical …scal policy. In

particular, we have put forward the notion that about a third of developing countries have graduated

from …scal procyclicality due to important improvements in IQ during the last decade. Our analysis,

however, could su¤er from both omitted variables and endogeneity problems. The next two sections

address these concerns.




4     Other determinants of cyclicality

While it seems natural to think that institutions a¤ect the way in which …scal policy is conducted, our

…ndings so far could re‡ect the e¤ect of omitted variables that are related to institutions. To address

this concern, we include in our panel regressions three sets of control variables aimed at capturing

alternative theories regarding cyclicality of …scal policy.

    First, we control for the degree of …nancial integration and depth. Among others, Gavin, Hausmann,


                                                                 10
Perotti and Talvi (1996), Gavin and Perotti (1997), and Riascos and Vegh (2003) have argued that

limited access to international capital markets (particularly in bad times) may limit the ability of

governments to pursue countercyclical policies. In the same spirit, Caballero and Krishnamurthy

(2004) have stressed the role of …nancial depth. We measure …nancial integration using the Chinn-

Ito …nancial openness index (Menzie and Ito, 2006) and …nancial depth using liquid liabilities over

GDP (Levine, Loayza and Beck, 2000; Loayza and Ranciere, 2006; Levine, Beck and Demirguc-Kunt,

2010).11 The panel data correlation between the Chinn-Ito …nancial openness index and IQ is 0.55; the

panel data correlation between liquid liabilities and IQ is 0.53. Table 3, columns 2 and 3 show that more

…nancial integration and depth are indeed associated with more countercyclicality/less procyclicality.

   Second, we control for the variability of tax revenues –proxied by output variability –to account

for the channel emphasized by Talvi and Vegh (2005) who argue that, in the presence of political

distortions, the larger is the variability of tax revenues the more procyclical …scal policy will be, as

policymakers try to reduce the …scal surplus in good times to prevent wasteful spending. We measure

output variability using the square of the cyclical component of real GDP.12 In Table 3, column 4

shows that, as in Lane (2003), higher output volatility does indeed increase the degree of procyclicality

of …scal policy.

   Third, we address political economy arguments that stress common pool problems and fragmented

policymaking (Velasco, 1997; Tornell and Lane, 1999). For these purposes, we use a measure of political

checks and balances from the Database on Political institutions.13                    Stronger checks and balances

constrain politicians in their policy space. Politicians are also held more accountable to the public,

relative to an autocratic regime. In a more democratic regime, the expected returns to rent-seeking

activities are lower. In Table 3, column 5 shows that stronger checks and balances decrease the degree

of procyclicality of …scal policy.

   We also test whether debt-GDP ratios and foreign reserves holdings (in months of imports) matter

for …scal behavior over the business cycle. Recent low debt-GDP ratios and massive foreign reserves
 1 1 Similarresults follow if private credit is used instead of liquid liabilities.
 1 2 The panel data correlation between output variability and IQ is -0.19.
 1 3 The panel data correlation between checks and balances and IQ is 0.43.




                                                               11
in emerging markets may have contributed to reduce those countries’ default risk, allowing them to

run countercyclical …scal policies. In Table 3, columns 6 and 7 support these presumptions.

    In Table 3, column 8 shows that even after accounting for standard determinants of …scal cyclicality,

institutional quality remains a strong determinant. There is no indication that problems related to

omitted variables are driving our results.




5     Addressing endogeneity

This section addresses potential endogeneity problems. One could argue that the observed negative

relationship between …scal policy cyclicality and IQ may re‡ect the fact that countercyclical (procycli-

cal) …scal policies that tend to stabilize (destabilize) the economy might improve (worsen) institutional

quality. That is to say, the causality may run from cyclicality of …scal policies to institutional quality

and not the other way around. For example, procyclical …scal policies could increase the chances of gov-

ernments running into debt sustainability problems during busts. These critical …nancing needs could

then lead to expropriation, repudiation of contracts, and/or intervention in independent branches of

governments such as the judiciary system or the central bank. Moreover, the turmoil typically associ-

ated with debt crises can exacerbate corruption in the political system thus weakening the foundations

of an e¢ cient and professional public administration. Similar arguments could also be made regarding

the endogeneity of the control variables included in Section 4. For example, one could argue that it

is procyclical …scal policies that ultimately increase output volatility instead of the latter being the

cause of procyclical …scal policies.

    We address such endogeneity concerns by instrumenting not only for IQ but also for the other six

control variables. The literature on institutions has not found yet time-varying instrumental variables

for the quality of institutions. Hence –and as is standard in this literature –we rely on cross-country

regressions (Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson, 2001; Easterly and Levine, 2003; Glaeser, La Porta,

Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer, 2004; Rodrik, Subramanian, and Trebbi, 2004; La Porta, Lopez-de-

Silanes and Shleifer, 2008).


                                                   12
   We follow Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson’s (2001) approach to instrument average IQ using

European settlers’mortality and latitude (absolute value). They argue that European mortality rates

(recorded among soldiers, bishops, and sailors stationed in the colonies) between the 17th and 19th

centuries shaped, at least in part, the type of settlements and colonization strategy. In places where

Europeans faced high mortality rates, they could not settle and they were more likely to set up worse

(extractive) institutions. An archetypal example of this strategy is the Belgian colonization of the

Congo. On the other hand, low mortality rates supported the development of important European

settlements. In these “neo-europe” states, the settlers tried to replicate European institutions, with

emphasis on private property, and checks against government power. Primary examples include Aus-

tralia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States. Assuming high path dependence, early sound

institutions would endure over time until the present.

   We instrument …nancial integration and depth using legal origin (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes,

Shleifer and Vishny, 1997), output volatility using terms of trade volatility, and indebtedness using

debt-GDP ratio in 1900. We instrument checks and balances using constraints on the executive and

democracy in 1900. The constraints on the executive in 1900 range from cases in which there are no

regular limitations on the executive’s actions to situations in which accountability groups have e¤ec-

tive authority equal to or greater than the executive in most activities. Democracy in 1900 comprises

several dimensions of political competitiveness.

   It has been argued that, in light of the severe real dislocations resulting from international …nancial

crises, many developing countries accumulate reserves as a form of self-insurance against capital ‡ow

volatility (Aizenman and Marion, 2003; Stiglitz, 2006). Following this rationale, we instrument foreign

reserves using average frequency of currency crashes in mid 20th century; in particular, for the period

1940-1960.

   Table 4 shows the cross-country correlations between all pairs of variables used in the analysis.

With the exeption of foreign reserves, the …ndings support our panel data regressions results reported

above in that higher IQ, …nancial integration and depth, and checks and balances are associated



                                                   13
with countercyclicality, and higher output volatility and debt-GDP ratios are related to procyclicality.

Instruments are also correlated as expected, both among themselves and with the variables they will

be instrumenting for.

   Table 5 shows, as in Lane (2003), OLS cross-country regressions where the dependent variable is

the correlation between the cyclical components of real government expenditure and GDP. Columns 1

to 14 analyze the impact of each variable one at a time, both for the sample of 94 countries used so

far in the paper as well as for the smaller sample of 52 countries that will be used in our instrumental

variables regressions.

   Two results are worth noting. First, with the exception of foreign reserves and debt-GDP ratios,

cross-country regressions support our panel data regression …ndings. That is to say, higher IQ, …nan-

cial integration and depth, and checks and balances increase countercyclicality and output volatility

increases procyclicality. Second, the results obtained for the sample of 94 countries also hold for the

smaller sample of countries that will be used in our instrumental variables regressions. Columns 15 and

16 include all control variables together. As in our panel regressions, institutional quality is strongly

signi…cant in all cases.

   Next, we address endogeneity problems. Table 6 shows how the proposed instruments relate to

all seven cyclicality regressors. As shown by Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001), European

settlers’mortality is positively related to IQ. So is latitude. Similar results are obtained for …nancial

integration and depth. Moreover, as suggested by La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny

(1997), countries with British legal origin show higher development of their …nancial markets than

those of French origin. Terms of trade volatility seems to be a good predictor of output volatility, and

constraints on the executive and democracy in 1900 are found to be strongly related to recent checks

and balances. Debt-GDP ratios in 1900 and currency crashes in mid 20th century are also strong

predictors of debt-GDP ratios and foreign reserves, respectively. Indeed, the suggested instruments

have very high predictive power overall: the 2 ranges from 0.25 and 0.32 for foreign reserves and

debt-GDP ratios to almost 0.7 for institutional quality.



                                                   14
    Having checked that the proposed instruments seem to be good predictors for the variables they

are instrumenting for, we proceed to estimate instrumental variables regressions. Table 7 shows the

corresponding regressions. Columns 1 to 7 only instrument for IQ. Column 1 only includes IQ as

regressor. Columns 2 to 7 sequencially add other determinants. In all cases we cannot reject the

overidenti…cation tests. The instruments are valid instruments (i.e., uncorrelated with the error term)

and the excluded instruments are correctly excluded from the estimated equation. As suggested in

Table 6, all instrumental variable regressions con…rm that the excluded instruments are not weak

instruments (i.e., they are strongly correlated with the endogenous regressors). We thus conclude that

institutional quality remains a critical determinant of procyclicality even after accounting for possible

endogeneity problems.

    Finally, the regression shown in Table 7, column 8, corrects for the endogeneity of the rest of

the right-hand variables. IQ remains strongly negatively related to the cyclicality of …scal policy

con…rming that there is a strong causal link running from better institutions to less procyclical/more

countercyclical …scal policy.




6     Conclusions

We have shown that, over the past decade, a substantial number of emerging and developing countries

have “graduated” from …scal procyclicality in the sense of being able to shift from procyclical to

countercyclical …scal policy. Further, we have argued that a critical determinant of whether a country

has been able to graduate or not is institutional quality. We have formally linked the degree of …scal

procyclicality to institutional quality and shown that, even when correcting for endogeneity and other

determinants, there is a strong causal link running from better institutions to less procyclical/more

countercyclical …scal policy.

    While institutional change is certainly not easy and often occurs only slowly over time, the payo¤

in terms of enabling countries to escape the …scal procyclicality trap can be large. Chile is perhaps the

best example of a country that has succeeded in developing stronger …scal institutions over time and,


                                                   15
as result, has been able to conduct countercyclical …scal policy over the last decade. This graduation

process, however, can be a long and arduous road and does require clear economic leadership and a

strong political consensus.

Appendix 1. Definition of variables and sources
Gross Domestic Product
   World Economic Outlook (WEO-IMF) and International Financial Statistics (IFS-IMF) were the main data sources. Series
   NGDP (gross domestic product, current prices) for WEO and 99B for IFS-IMF. For Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Libya,
   Qatar, and United Arab Emirates data were provided by the Middle East Department at the IMF. Data period covers 1960-
   2009.
Government expenditure
   World Economic Outlook (WEO-IMF) was the main data source, series GCENL (central government, total expenditure
   and net lending). Due to unavailability of central government data, general government data were used for Azerbaijan,
   Ecuador, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates. For Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, and United
   Arab Emirates data were provided by the Middle East Department at the IMF. For Brazil data was from Instituto de
   Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada (IPEA). Data period covers 1960-2009.
GDP deflator
  World Economic Outlook (WEO-IMF) and International Financial Statistics (IFS-IMF) were the main data sources. Series
  NGDP_D (gross domestic product deflator) for WEO-IMF and 99BIP for IFS-IMF. For Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kuwait,
  Libya, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates data were provided by the Middle East Department at the IMF. Data period covers
  1960-2009.
Financial depth
    Measured as liquid liabilities over GDP. Loayza and Ranciere (2006) and Levine et al (2010) were the main data sources.
    Data period covers 1960-2006.
Financial integration
    Measured with the Chinn-Ito financial openness index; Chinn and Ito (2006). Such index measures a country's degree of
    capital account openness. Data period covers 1970-2009.

Debt-GDP ratio and Debt-GDP ratio in 1900
   World Economic Outlook (WEO-IMF), World Development Indicators (WDI-World Bank), and Reinhart and Rogoff
   (2011) were the main data sources. Measured as total central government debt over GDP at the beginning of year. For
   Azerbaijan we used public and publicly guaranteed debt service. For Côte d'Ivoire, Haiti, Italy, Kuwait, Myanmar,
   Netherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Poland, Qatar, Romania, Singapore, Tanzania, and United Arab Emirates we used total
   general government debt. If country was not independent in 1900, we used the colonizer's respective ratio when measuring
   1900 Debt-GDP ratios.

Foreign reserves
    World Development Indicators (WDI-World Bank) and International Financial Statistics (IFS-IMF) were the main data
    sources. Total reserves comprise holdings of monetary gold, special drawing rights, reserves of IMF members held by the
    IMF, and holdings of foreign exchange under the control of monetary authorities. The gold component of these reserves is
    valued at year-end (December 31) London prices. This item shows reserves expressed in terms of the number of months of
    imports of goods and services they could pay for [Reserves/(Imports/12)] at the end of previous year.

Currency crashes in mid 20th century
   Reinhart and Rogoff (2011) and authors' calculations based on exchange rate data from Global Financial Data were the
   main data sources. An episode of currency crash is counted for the entire period in which annual depreciations exceed the
   threshold of 15 percent per annum. We calculate the average frequency of currency crashes for the period 1940-1960.
Terms of trade of goods and services
   World Economic Outlook (WEO-IMF) was the main data source. Series TT (terms of trade, goods & services) for WEO.
   Data period covers 1962-2009.
Institutional quality
    International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) was the source of data. Institutional quality is a normalized index that ranges
    between 0 (lowest institutional quality) and 1 (highest institutional quality). The index was calculated by the authors as the
    average of four components: investment profile, corruption, law and order, and bureaucratic quality. Data period covers
    1984-2008.
Checks and balances
   Beck, Clarke, Groff, Keefer, and Walsh (2001) was the source of data. An 18-category scale, from 1 to 18, with a higher
   score indicating more political checks and balances. Data period covers 1975-2009.
European settler mortality
   Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2001) was the source of data. Mortality rates of soldiers, bishops, and sailors stationed
   in the colonies between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries.
Latitude
    Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2001) was the source of data. Absolute value of the latitude of the country (i.e., a
    measure of distance from the equator), scaled to take values between 0 and 1, where 0 is the equator.
Colonial dummies
    Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2001) was the source of data. Dummy indicating whether country was a British,
    French, German, Spanish, Italian, Belgian, Dutch, or Portuguese colony.
French legal origin dummy
    Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2001) was the source of data. Legal origin of the company law or commercial code of
    each country.
Constraint on executive in 1900
   Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2001) was the source of data. Seven-category scale, from 1 to 7, with a higher score
   indicating more constraints. Score of 1 indicates unlimited authority; score of 3 indicates slight to moderate limitations;
   score of 5 indicates substantial limitations; score of 7 indicates executive parity or subordination. Equal to 1 if country was
   not independent at that date.
Democracy in 1900
   An 11-category scale, from 0 to 10, with a higher score indicating more democracy. Points from three dimensions:
   Competitiveness of Political Participation (from 1 to 3); Competitiveness of Executive Recruitment (from 1 to 2, with a
   bonus of 1 point if there is an election); and Constraints on Chief Executive (from 1 to 4). Equal to 1 if country not
   independent at that date.

Notes: The cyclical components have been estimated using the Hodrick-Prescott Filter. A positive (negative) correlation indicates procyclical (countercyclical) fiscal policy. Real government expenditure is defined as
central government expenditure and net lending deflated by the GDP deflator. Country correlations between the cyclical components of real government expenditure and real GDP (i.e., Corr(G, GDP)) are calculated for
the period 1960-2009. Institutional quality is a normalized index that ranges between 0 (lowest institutional quality) and 1 (highest institutional quality). The index is calculated as the average of four components:
investment profile, corruption, law and order, bureaucracy quality. Country average institutional quality (i.e., av. IQ) is calculated for each country for the period 1984-2008. See Appendix 2 for correlation values and
average institutional quality for each country.

        Notes: The cyclical components have been estimated using the Hodrick-Prescott Filter. A positive (negative) correlation indicates
        procyclical (countercyclical) fiscal policy. Real government expenditure is defined as central government expenditure and net
        lending deflated by the GDP deflator. Country correlations between the cyclical components of real government expenditure and
        real GDP (i.e., Corr(G, GDP)) are calculated as 20-year rolling windows for the period 1960-2009.
        Institutional quality is a normalized index that ranges between 0 (lowest institutional quality) and 1 (highest institutional quality).
        The index is calculated as the average of four components: investment profile, corruption, law and order, and bureaucratic quality.
        Actual institutional quality (i.e., for each year) is used.
        Institutional quality is shown on the right axis and the correlation between the cyclical components of real government
        expenditure and real GDP is shown on the left.

                                        Notes: Institutional quality is a normalized index that ranges between 0 (lowest institutional
                                        quality) and 1 (highest institutional quality). The index is calculated as the average of four
                                        components: investment profile, corruption, law and order, and bureaucratic quality. IQ refers
                                        to the current institutional quality value. IQinitial refers to earliest IQ value available for each
                                        country; in most cases it corresponds to the 1984 value. The only exceptions are Rep. of Congo
                                        (1985), Gambia (1985), Niger (1985), Sierra Leone (1985), Yemen (1990), and Azerbaijan

Notes: See Appendix 1 for definition and source of variables. t-statistics are in square brackets. The weak-identification test is the first-stage F test of excluded
instruments; the null hypothesis is that the model is weakly identified (i.e., the excluded instruments have a nonzero correlation with the endogenous regressors but
small). The over-identification test is the Hansen's J statistic; the null hypothesis is that the instruments are exogenous (i.e., uncorrelated with the error term). Constant
term is not reported.
˟, *, ** and *** indicate statistically significant at the 15%, 10%, 5% and 1% levels, respectively.
