                                          ABSTRACT

We document that following a turnover of the Party Secretary or mayor of a city in China, firms
(especially private firms) headquartered in that city significantly increase their “perk spending.”
Both the instrumental-variable-based results and heterogeneity analysis are consistent with the
interpretation that the perk spending is used to build relations with local governments. Moreover,
local political turnover in a city tends to be followed by changes of Chairmen or CEOs of state-
owned firms that are controlled by the local government. However, the Chairmen or CEOs who
have connections with local government officials are less likely to be replaced.

1. Introduction
Government plays an important role in any modern economic system. In western-style democracy, it is

well understood that firms try to influence policymaking via lobbying and other activities that can result

in what is known as “regulatory capture” (Stigler, 1971; Peltzman, 1976; Laffont and Tirole, 1991). 1

Lobbying is regulated, and thus firms are required to report their lobbying activities to regulatory agencies

(e.g., in the US, Federal Election Commission). As a result, researchers have used lobbying and

legislative data to study the extent of and the impact of lobbying. 2

     It is well recognized that the relationship with government plays an even more critical role for firms

in emerging markets where the government casts a big shadow on the firms’ operations. Politically

connected firms may enjoy benefits such as preferential access to external financing, lower financing

costs, receiving government contracts and bailouts, tax benefits, subsidies, favorable policies and

legislative conditions, all of which can enhance their operations and increase their values (Fisman, 2001;

Faccio, 2006; Faccio et al., 2006; Bunkanwanicha and Wiwattanakantang, 2009). However, much less is

known about how firms “invest” in their relations with governments in emerging markets where the rules

of political lobbying are less well-established. This may be partly due to the difficulty in measuring

relationship building, because such activities are not clearly regulated. In this paper, we attempt to fill this

gap by examining how firms invest in their relationships with local governments in China following the

turnovers of local politicians using a large, partially hand-collected, panel dataset.

     As the largest emerging economy, China is a particularly important country to study how firms

interact with the government outside of western-style democracies. As forcefully argued in Xu (2011), the

institutional foundation for Chinese economic reform can be characterized as a Regionally Decentralized

Authoritarian (RDA) regime. RDA is a combination of political centralization and economic regional

decentralization. National government maintains strict control over the political and personnel governance

1
  Zingales (2017) argued and provided anecdotal evidence that powerful firms have incentives to influence politics, and to gain
political power in order to become more powerful in the marketplace by changing the rules of games.
2
  For example, according to the Center of Responsive Politics, individuals, firms, and trade associations in the United States spend
more than $3 billion each year to hire professional lobbyists to influence policy-making. Kang (2016) studied the returns to
lobbying for firms in the energy sector in the United States.




                                                                 1
structure in that the appointment and promotion of subnational government officials are controlled by the

central government; yet regional governments, namely, provinces, cities/municipalities and counties, have

overall responsibility for initiating and coordinating reforms, providing public services, and making and

enforcing laws within their jurisdictions.

     This fundamental institutional feature of China suggests that firms are likely to build relationships

with local government officials who have the jurisdiction over them. We thus conjecture that after

political turnovers of local government officials, firms might use “perk spending,” namely, travel

expenses, business entertainment expenses, overseas training expenses, board meeting expenses, company

car expenses, and meeting expenses, to invest in the connections with their local governments. After

political turnovers, firms may face the risk of losing existing connections and being adversely affected by

new government policies introduced by the new local government officials. This gives them an extra

incentive to build relations. Moreover, it is relatively easy for firms to disguise relation-building expenses

as productivity-related perk spending. For example, Cai et al. (2011) argue that Chinese executives

commonly use perks, such as meals, entertainment, and travel (ETC), to network with government

officials, suppliers, clients, and creditors. Therefore, our first hypothesis is that firms would increase their

perk spending to invest in political connections after political turnovers in their local governments.

     Moreover, the connection with local governments can be established through personnel changes at

the firms, e.g., replacing senior management by people with connections to the new local government

officials. This mechanism is likely to be more important for state-owned enterprises, which have weaker

incentive for profit maximization and face stronger influences from their local governments. Hence, our

second hypothesis is that state-owned firms, particularly those controlled by their local governments, tend

to change their key personnel (Chairmen or CEOs) following the local political turnover.

     China’s capital market provides an ideal setup for testing these hypotheses. First, the Chinese

economy is known as a relational economy. Guanxi is crucial for firms to do business when their

contracts and property rights are not well protected by formal institutions (Xin and Pearce, 1996; Tsang,

1998; Allen et al., 2005). Among the different kinds of guanxi, political connections are among the most

important (Shih et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013; Piotroski and Zhang, 2014)). Second, perk expenses and




                                                       2
senior management changes are disclosed by publicly listed Chinese firms, making the measurement

possible. Third, there are frequent political turnovers in local Chinese governments because the central

government has a policy of appointing new political leaders in each city every several years to incentivize

career politicians and prevent local officials from building up too much power. In our sample period of

2003-2014, there are 1,123 city government official turnovers, with significant variations across regions

and over time. 3

     We document that, when a new Party Secretary, or a mayor, takes office in a city, the publicly-listed

firms in that city increase their “perk spending,” after controlling for local economic conditions such as

local GDP and population growth. The increase in perk spending does not appear to be due to the changes

in local economic environment, the changes in the firms’ business investment, or due to changes in their

main customers and suppliers. This effect is also economically significant. In the year after a new mayor

or Party Secretary is appointed, on average, a local firm in the city increases its perk spending by about

2.98 million RMB, which is about 18% of the average annual perk spending.

     Although this result is consistent with our hypothesis, it could also be driven by omitted variables

that affect both political turnovers and perk spending. To address this concern, we construct instrumental

variables based on the officials’ age and tenure in the previous year. The idea is that the likelihood for an

official to leave his or her current position increases with his or her age and the number of years since the

appointment to the current position. There is no obvious reason why officials’ age and tenure directly

affect future perk spending. Our estimates based on these instruments suggest that political turnovers

cause an increase in perk spending by local firms.

     We are fully aware that our evidence is circumstantial. We find that firms increase their perk

spending after political turnovers, but we do not have direct evidence that the increased perk spending is

used for building up relations with local governments. Hence, to shed further light on our interpretation,

we examine the cross-sectional and time series heterogeneity in the effect of local political turnover on

perk spending. In particular, we find that perk spending increases more when the incentive to build

Appendix.




                                                                3
relations with the local government is stronger. For example, when the new Party Secretary or mayor is

originally from a different city, local firms presumably have fewer existing connections with the incoming

official and need to invest more to build up their relations. Also, when the incoming official is young, the

relation is perhaps more valuable, since the official is expected to be in power for longer and is more

likely to be promoted, leading to more perk spending. For firms whose senior management has no

political experience, or for private firms, we also find stronger increases in perk spending when new local

government officials are appointed. Moreover, we find that the perk spending appears to respond less to

political turnovers when it is costlier for officials to accept perks from local firms. For example, after the

18th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, President Xi Jinping’s unprecedented

anti-corruption campaign might have made officials more reluctant to accept perks due to the elevated

risk of being disciplined. Similarly, after a recent arrest of a local politician in a city, the incoming

officials would become more reluctant to accept perks. These variations in the effect of political turnover

on perk spending lend further support to our interpretation that the increase in perk spending is to build

relations with local governments.

    What do firms get in return for their perk spending? We find that firms with more perk expenses get

more future benefits from the local government in the form of government subsidies or accesses to

financing, especially long-term financing. This effect is also stronger after political turnovers, which is

consistent with our interpretation that relation building is more valuable after political turnovers. However,

we do not find evidence that firms with more perk expenses have better future performance as measured

by return of assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). One possible interpretation is that firms’ perk

expenses are mostly a “rat race”, that is, firms build relations with the local government just to avoid

falling behind other firms, but they do not get ahead of other firms when firms are all doing the same

thing. Another possibility is that more government subsidies are simply wasted on perks or tunneled to

become private benefits of firms’ managers, and that the better financing terms are wasted on inefficient

investment project.

    To test our second hypothesis, we examine firms’ personnel changes during political turnovers, and

obtain two main results. First, we find that local political turnovers tend to be followed by more changes




                                                      4
of chairmen or CEOs for firms in that city. This result is primarily driven by the changes at firms that

local politicians can influence, such as state-owned enterprises controlled by the city. This effect

disappears when we conduct the tests on private firms or on SOEs controlled by the central government.

Second, consistent with the interpretation that appointed CEOs or chairmen are likely to be “friends” of

current local government officials, we find that they are less likely to be replaced as long as the officials

who appointed them are still in office.

    Our paper contributes to the literature on how firms build relations with their governments. Prior

literature finds that firms can build political connections through a wide range of means including hiring

executives with prior political experiences and/or government affiliations (Fan et al., 2007; Akey, 2015),

contributing to electoral campaigns (Claessens et al., 2008; Cooper et al., 2009; Ovtchinnikov and

Pantaleoni, 2012; Akey, 2015), lobbying (Borisov et al., 2016), and corporate investment (Bertrand and

Mullainathan, 2003; Aggarwal et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013). Our paper differs from theirs in that we focus

on an important emerging economy – China, and that we examine how firm perk spending is used as a

means to build political networks with governments and how such perk spending affects firm

performance. Furthermore, we find that another important aspect of relationship building is perhaps

through personnel changes: local political turnovers tend to be followed by more changes of Chairmen or

CEOs for firms in that city.

    Our study also adds to the literature that examines the effects of political turnovers on corporate

decisions, such as investments (e.g., Julio and Yook, 2012; An et al., 2016), tax avoidance (Chen et al.,

2015), and cash holding (Xu et al., 2016). Our evidence suggests that firms respond to political turnovers

by increasing perk spending to building up connections to local governments.

    The existing literature has two opposite views on the role of perk spending. One view is that perks

are a way for executives to misappropriate some of the surplus the firm generates (Jensen and Meckling,

1976; Jensen, 1986; Yermack, 2006). The contrasting view is that perks are offered to incentivize

executives to enhance managerial productivity, and thus is part of the optimal incentive contracts (Fama,

1980; Rajan and Wulf, 2006; Marino and Zábojník, 2008). We add to these studies by providing yet

another role played by perks: building networks with government officials.

     The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we develop our main hypothesis; in

Section 3 we present the data and discuss our empirical design; in Section 4 we report our main empirical

results; in Section 5 we perform additional analysis that suggests newly inducted local politicians also

tend to replace the CEOs and chairmen of the local SOEs under their control; and in Section 6 we

conclude.




2. Institutional background and hypothesis development

2.1. Institutional background

There are five levels of government hierarchy in China: the central government, and the four levels of

local governments: the provincial level, the city/municipality level, the county level, and the town level.

Our analysis focuses on the city level. According to the 2014 China City Statistical Yearbook, there are

297 cities across 31 provinces and four centrally administrated cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and

Chongqing). The top two leaders at the city level are the city’s Communist Party Secretary and the mayor,

reflecting the dual presence of the Communist Party and the government at each level of China’s political

hierarchy (Li and Zhou, 2005). City official turnover is under the control by the Organization Department

of the Provincial Party Committee. Typically, a city official’s term is five years, and his/her turnover

occurs around the meetings of the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China.4

However, many city officials do not complete the five-year terms and leave for other positions. For

example, in the first year of a term, an official has around 20% chance of leaving his/her position. This

conditional probability increases steadily over the official’s tenure. In the fifth year, for example, an

official has a 60% chance of leaving his position. 5




4
  Regarding city officials’ tenure, the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
issued the “Provisional Regulations on Terms of Cadres of the Party and Government” in August 2006, which states that mayors
and officials at the county level and above should serve five-year terms and that these terms should be relatively stable. An added
regulation also stipulates that cadres may not serve in the same position for more than two terms (Article 6) and may not serve in
positions of the same rank for more than 15 years (Article 7).

  See Table 3B in the Online Appendix for details.




                                                                6
2.2. Hypothesis

Given the importance of political connections in the Chinese economy, it is natural to expect that firms

may find it valuable to invest in the relations with their local governments. Our overarching hypothesis is

that firms would increase their investment in political connections after major political turnovers in their

local governments. First, firms may want to increase their investment in relations after political turnovers

because this is the time when they may need to establish new connections rather than simply maintaining

their existing ones since their existing connections lose value due to the turnover. Moreover, connections

with new leaders are more valuable because they are expected to be in power for longer. Finally, new

officials might make new policies that alter the business environment where firms operate (Gulen and Ion,

2016). Thus, firms face the risk of being adversely affected by new government policies, and hence are

more eager to build connections with local governments after new officials take offices.

     Given the opaque nature of the investment in government relations in emerging economies, we

attempt to measure it indirectly. Adithipyangkul et al. (2011) and Cai et al. (2011) argue that Chinese

executives commonly use “perks,” such as meals, entertainment, and travel (ETC), to network with

government officials, suppliers, clients, and creditors. These networking activities help executives build

their relational capital to facilitate their firms’ activities. Yeung and Tung (1996) suggest that the buildup

and maintenance of guanxi requires perk spending. Moreover, the compensation of Chinese officials is

generally low relative to that in other countries and relative to that in the private sector in China. 6

Officials might be motivated to seek alternative compensation in monetary and non-monetary forms. Perk

expense of local firms may be a convenient way for officials to extract rents due to their opaque nature.

These illegitimate expenses are commonly reimbursed as management expenses in Chinese accounting

practice (Cai et al., 2011). Vast anecdote evidence shows that this is a common practice in China.7


6
  On April 29, 2013, the International Business Times reported that Xi Jinping, China’s president, made US$19,000 a year
(compared to US President Barack Obama’s US$400,000 a year).
7
  Car expenses: Due to the regulation of prohibiting using government cars for private purposes, government officials tend to use
cars provided by firms. See, for example, China Enterprise News, April 9, 2013.
http://news.163.com/13/0409/07/8S0KPDP20001124J.html; Travel expenses: 3 AVON senior Chinese executives were suspected
of supporting government officials’ oversea travelling, which was classified as travelling costs in the firm’s balance sheet,
http://news.163.com/10/0414/07/647DQROL000146BD.html; Business entertainment expenses: The entertainment expenses,
including eat and drink, for government officials are usually paid by firms, (see, e.g.,
http://news.163.com/15/0513/18/APH1K5DS00014JB5.html.




                                                               7
    Moreover, the investment in the government relation may manifest itself through personnel changes.

For example, after a political turnover at a local government, firms’ senior management may be replaced

by people with connections to the new local government officials. State-owned enterprises are more likely

to adopt this approach perhaps because they have weaker incentive for profit maximization and face

stronger influences from their local governments.


3. Data

Our sample consists of firms that are listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock

Exchange in China from 2003 to 2014. Our sample starts in 2003 because few firms disclosed their perk

expenses before 2003. We manually collect perk expense data from firms’ annual reports. The rest of the

financial data are from the China Stock Market and Accounting Research (CSMAR) database.

Macro-economic statistics at the provincial and city levels are from the National Bureau of Statistics

(NBS). We also manually collect the information on the executives from the firms' prospectuses and

annual reports.

    To measure local political turnovers, we manually collect the detailed information on mayors and city

level Party Secretaries such as their names, positions, tenure terms, ages, and résumés from city

government official websites. These résumés also contain detailed personal information such as education

and work experience prior to their current positions. If the information is not available on the official

website, we then manually search the information through Baidu (www.baidu.com), China's most popular

search engine. We then merge officials' personal data with firm-level perk spending and financial data by

matching the province, city, and fiscal year. We classify a firm into a city according to the location of its

corporate headquarter. We exclude firms in the financial industry. Our sample has 7,935 firm-year

observations. To mitigate the effect of outliers, we winsorize the continuous variables at the 1% level in

both tails. In our analyses, the sample size may vary due to missing values in some key variables in

different regression models.




                                                     8
3.1. Political Turnover

To measure the major personnel change in a city, we construct a dummy variable Inductionc,t, which is 1 if

a new mayor or Party secretary takes office in city c between July 1 of year t-1 and June 30 of year t, and

0 otherwise. 8 That is, if an official takes office between January 1 and June 30 in year t, we treat year t as

his first year in power. If an official takes office between July 1 and December 31 in year t, then we treat

year t+1 as his first year in power.

3.2. Perk Spending

In the “Footnotes to Financial Statements” section of the annual reports, firms disclose the content of

“other cash flows related to operating activities”, from which we identify possible items related to perk

spending. We follow Adithipyangkul et al. (2011), Gul et al. (2011) and Xu et al. (2014) to calculate the

overall perk spending. Specifically, we construct our main measure, Perk6, by aggregating the following

six items: travel expenses, business entertainment expenses, overseas training expenses, board meeting

expenses, company car expenses, and meeting expenses. Then, we construct the following measures,

Ln_Perk6, Perk6_Rev and Perk6_Asset, where Ln_Perk6 is the logarithm of Perk6; Perk6_Rev and

Perk6_Asset are Perk6 normalized by the firms’ revenues and assets, respectively. After merging the perk

spending data with political turnover data, we can use three subscripts to describe the perk spending. For

example, Perk6i,c,t refers to the perk spending of firm i, whose headquarter is in city c, during year t.

      As robustness checks, we also constructed two alternative measures of the aggregate perk spending.

Following Cai et al. (2011), we calculate “Entertainment and Travel Cost”, ETC for short, as the sum of

three items: travel expenses, business entertainment expenses, and company car expenses. Following

Chen et al. (2016), we construct the perk spending measure, Perk8, as the sum of Perk6 and two other

items, work-related expenses and communication expenses.

                                                        [Table 1 About Here]




8
  In Table 5A of the Online Appendix, we report results using an alternative definition of “induction” that accounts for the month
of the new leaders’ appointment: If a mayor or a secretary in city c takes office in month m of year t, then his/her Induction_newc,t
equals (12-m+1) / 12, while Induction_new c,t+1 equals (m-1) / 12 in year t+1. The results are similar.




                                                                 9
      Table 1 presents the summary statistics for our sample. One average, a firm’s perk spending is about

0.736% of its revenue. Its standard deviation is 1.122%, suggesting that there is significant cross-sectional

variation across firms. Firms at the 75% quantile have nearly 4 times more perk spending relative to their

revenues (0.803%) than those at the 25% quantile (0.202%). The average perk size is about RMB 16.774

million per firm–year in our sample, with an inter-quartile range of about RMB 3.010 million (25th

percentile) to RMB 14.175 million (75th percentile).

      The mean of Induction is 0.370, which indicates that about 37% of firm-year observations in our

sample period experience at least one major personnel change in their local city governments. In Table 2,

we report the correlation matrix of the main variables, with Spearman’s rank-order (respectively,

Pearson’s linear) correlations reported in the upper-right (respectively, bottom-left) part of the matrix. We

can see that political turnover and perk spending are positively correlated. Specifically, the Spearman’s

rank-order correlation between Induction and Perk6_Rev is approximately 0.045, and it is highly

significant at the 1% level.

                                                       [Table 2 about Here]




4. Political Turnover and Perk Spending

4.1. Panel regressions

To examine the effect of political turnover of key city government officials (Party Secretary or mayor) on

perk spending of firms in the city, we first run the following panel regression:

                        𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 × 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛾 × 𝑀𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑐,𝑡                       (1)

where Perki,c,t is a measure of perk spending of firm i, which is headquartered in city c, in year t.

Inductionc,t is a dummy variable, which is one if there is a change of mayor or Party Secretary in city c

during year 𝑡; and 𝑀𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 includes a list of firm-level, CEO-level and regional-level control variables.9

9
  In the online appendix (Table 5B), we also attempted to differentiate the effects of the induction of Party Secretary and mayor
separately. We find that the effects of induction on perk spending are quantitatively similar for the new mayors and new Party
Secretaries. We also tried an alternative definition of induction of the Party Secretary recognizing that sometimes Party Secretary




                                                                10
      Firm-level control variables include the following. FirmSizei,c,t is the natural log of the book value of

the total assets of firm i, which is headquartered in city c, in year t. Leveragei,c,t is the debt to asset ratio,

ROAi,c,t (Return on Asset) is the net income divided by total assets. Duali,c,t is a dummy variable which is

one if the board chairman is also the CEO, and zero otherwise. InDiri,c,t is the independence of the board,

measured as the ratio of the number of independent directors over the total number of directors on the

board. SOEi,c,t is one if the firm is a state-owned enterprise and zero otherwise. InsHoldPeri,c,t is the

percentage of the shares owned by institutions. DirHoldingi,c,t is the percentage of the shares owned by the

board directors. Analystsi,c,t is the logarithm of the number of analysts following the firm. The second set

of control variables is about CEO characteristics. Male_CEOi,c,t is one if the CEO of firm i in year t is a

male, and zero otherwise. Salary_CEOi,c,t is the natural logarithm of the annual salary of the CEO of firm

i in year t. Age_CEOi,c,t is the age of CEO of firm i in year t. The third set of control variables is about the

region. GDP_Growthc,t is the GDP growth of city c in year t. Pop_Growthc,t is the population growth rate

of city c in year t.

     After controlling for the observables that may affect a firm’s perk spending for its normal business

activities, a positive coefficient β can be viewed as the excess perk spending after a major personnel

change in the city-level local government. That is, the excess perk spending cannot be attributed to the

firms’ usual business activities. This is consistent with our hypothesis that after a major personnel change

in the local government, firms increase their investment in building relations with the government, and

this extra expense shows up in the annual reports as higher-than-usual spending on travel expenses,

business entertainment expenses etc.

                                                        [Table 3 About Here]

     The regression results are reported in Table 3. In Column (1), the dependent variable is Perk6_Rev,

and the coefficient of Induction is 0.057 (with t-statistic 2.80). This is consistent with our hypothesis that

after the turnover of the Party Secretary or the mayor of a city in China, firms headquartered in that city

significantly increase their “perk spending”. The economic magnitude of this increase is also significant.


in a city is promoted from the mayoral position in the same city. In the alternation definition, we define the first year of the Party
Secretary as the start year form a mayor taking office, rather than from her/his taking office as a secretary. The results are similar.




                                                                  11
The average revenue is our sample is RMB 5,235 million. Hence, our estimate implies that during the first

year after a major personnel change in a local city government, an average firm that is headquartered in

this city has an extra RMB 2.98 million (=5,235×0.057%) perk spending that cannot be attributed to usual

business activities. Note that the average perk spending in our sample is RMB 16.774 million. That is,

this excess perk spending is almost 18% of the average perk spending.

     Columns (2)-(5) report regression results based on alternative measures of perk spending: ETC_Rev,

Perk8_Rev, Ln_Perk6, and Perk6_Asset. For all specifications, the coefficients of Induction are positive

and significant at the 1% to 10% level, suggesting that perk spending increases after political turnovers.

We also rerun the regression using a sub-sample without firms in the four major cities of Beijing,

Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing. The results, reported in Column (6), remain similar. The coefficient of

Induction is 0.068 (with t-statistic 3.12).10

                                                          [Table 4 About Here]

     We then conduct a number of placebo tests. Specifically, we rerun the regression in (1) of Table 3 by

replacing its dependent variable by Perk6_Revi,c,t+j for j=-2, -1, 1, 2. That is, we now examine if the perk

spending increases during the two years before a political turnover, or in the first and second years after a

political turnover. Table 4 reports the regression results. It shows that the coefficient of Induction is

insignificant for all cases in the placebo tests. Hence, our evidence suggests that only in the first year after

a new mayor or Party Secretory takes office, do firms headquartered in this city significantly increase

their perk spending.

4.2. Instrumental variables

Our prior evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that firms increase their perk spending to establish

connections after a political turnover in their local city governments. However, one can imagine that

omitted variables might affect both political turnovers and perk spending. In this section, we try to

address this concern using instrumental variables.


10
   We also construct a subsample of firms from cities with more than 4 listed firms. Then, we include city-fixed effects and rerun
the regressions in Table 3. The coefficient of Induction is positive in all specifications, and it is statistically significant in 4 of the
6 specifications. These results are reported in Table 4 of the Online Appendix.




                                                                    12
     Our instruments are dummy variables which are designed to predict the likelihood for an official to

leave his current position. The idea is that an official is more likely to leave his current position if he is

older, or he has been at the current position longer. Specially, we set D_Agec,t to one if the age of the

mayor (or the Party Secretary) of city c is greater than or equal to the median age when a city mayor (or a

Party Secretary) leaves his position, and zero otherwise. Similarly, we use “Tenure” to refer to the number

of years an official has been in office since his latest appointment at the current position. We set

D_Tenurec,t to one if the tenure of the mayor (or the Party Secretary) of city c is greater than or equal to

the median tenure when a city mayor (or a Party Secretary) leaves his position, and zero otherwise.

     In Appendix C we show that these two instruments are positively related to the hazard rate for an

official to leave his current position.11 But it is not obvious why an official’s age and tenure can directly

affect perk spending for reasons other than building connections. 12 Hence, we use both instruments to run

the following regressions.

      First Stage:        𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑐,𝑡 = 𝛼1 + 𝛽1 × 𝐼𝐼𝑐,𝑡−1 + 𝛾1 × 𝑀𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑐,𝑡                                          (2)

     Second Stage: 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃6_𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 = 𝛼2 + 𝛽2 × 𝐸𝐸𝐸_𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛾2 × 𝑀𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑐,𝑡                                    (3)


where 𝐼𝐼𝑐,𝑡−1 denotes instrument variable in year t-1, 𝐸𝐸𝐸_𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑐,𝑡 is the projected value of

Inductionc,t obtained from the first-stage regression, and 𝑀𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 stacks the list of control variables as in the

regressions in Table 3. The results of the first- and second-stage are reported in Table 5.

                                                    [Table 5 About Here]


     Column (1) shows that the coefficient of D_Agec,t-1 is 0.361 (with t statistic 2.40). Hence, this

instrument is highly relevant for political turnover, i.e., a city official is more likely to leave his position if

he is older. Column (2) reports the second-stage results. The coefficient of 𝐸𝐸𝐸_𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 is 0.087

(with t statistic 2.23). That is, consistent with our hypothesis, political turnover increases perk spending.


11
   In the Online Appendix, we show graphically that the probability of leaving the office is increasing in age (Figure 1) and latest
tenure (Figure 2) for both Party Secretaries and Mayors. We also show the distribution of age, tenure and latest tenure when Party
Secretaries and Mayors leave their offices (Figure 3).
12
   One intuitive story is that when an official anticipates that he will soon leave his position, he may try to extract more perks
before losing his power. However, this story is inconsistent with the evidence in Table 4, which shows that perk spending tends to
be slightly lower during the couple of years prior to an official leaving office.




                                                                13
Columns (3) and (4) report the results based on the instrument D_Tenurec,t-1 and Columns (5) and (6)

report the results based on both instruments. The results remain similar in both cases.

4.3. Cross-sectional and time-series variations

The above results suggest that major personnel changes in a city’s government causes an increase in perk

spending by firms in that city. However, we acknowledge that our evidence is circumstantial for the

interpretation that the perk spending increase is due to the investment in building relations with local

governments. Nevertheless, it is not clear how the local political turnover should increase the perk

spending through normal economic activities after controlling for local GDP and population growth. If the

increase in perk spending is merely a response to the change in the local economic environment, this

change has to be something that is not reflected in the local GDP or population growth.

    To further evaluate our interpretation, we examine the cross-sectional and time-series variations of the

effect on perk spending. Under our interpretation that the perk spending is used to build relations with

local governments, we should expect the effect to be stronger when firms’ incentive to build relations is

stronger or when officials’ incentive to accept perks is stronger. In the following, we examine three types

of variations.

                                              [Table 6 About Here]

     First, the variation can result from the differences across the appointed officials. For instance, if the

newly-appointed official is originally from a different city, it is more likely that fewer firms have existing

connections with the new official, and hence the incentive to build relations is stronger. To test this, we

construct a dummy variable, Localc,t, which is 1 if the newly-appointed mayor or Party Secretary of city c

in year t was working in the city before the appointment, and 0 otherwise. We augment the regression in

Table 3 by including an interaction term Induction×Local. The results are reported in Column (1) of Table

6. Consistent with our hypothesis, the interaction coefficient is -0.036 (with t statistic -1.90). Note that the

coefficient of Induction is 0.072 (with t statistic 2.48). These estimates imply that if the appointee is local,

its effect on perk spending is weakened by half. Similarly, the effect is expected to be weaker if the new

official is older perhaps because the connection is less valuable since the new official is not expected to




                                                      14
be in power for long, and is less likely to be further promoted. We create a dummy variable Old, which is

1 if the appointee is older than 59. As shown in Column (2), the coefficient of the interaction term

Induction×Old is -0.034 (with t statistic -2.27). The coefficient of Induction is 0.069 (with t statistic 2.50).

Hence, for the old appointees, the effect on perk spending is weakened by almost 80%.

     Second, the variation can result from the differences across firms. For example, if a firm is generally

more politically connected, the change in the city Party Secretary or mayor is likely to have a smaller

interruption of its connections with the local government. Hence, its adjustment in perk spending should

be smaller than less connected firms. We use three variables as proxies for a firm’s political connection.

The first one is a dummy variable PCi,c,t, which is one if the chairman or CEO of firm i is a former

government official, i.e., a member of the Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative

Conference, or a member of the National Congress of Communist Party of China; and zero otherwise.

The idea is that if the chairman or CEO of a firm used to be a politician, a change in local politician

should be a smaller interruption to the firm’s political connection. Hence, its perk spending would

respond less to the local political turnover. The second variable is SOEi,c,t, which is one if firm i is a

state-owned enterprise and zero otherwise. The third variable is Big Firmi,c,t, which is one if asset value of

firm i is larger than the median asset value of the ﬁrms in the same industry in year t, and zero otherwise.

The idea is that state-owned enterprises and larger firms are better connected, and hence political

turnovers should have a smaller effect on their perk spending. Consistent with our conjecture, Columns

(3)-(5) show that the interaction coefficients of Induction with the three proxies are all significantly

negative. Quantitatively, the effect is quite large. For state-owned enterprises, for example, the effect on

perk spending is reduced by around 80%.

     Finally, the variation can result from the changes in the cost of investing in political connections. For

example, after the 18th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, the unprecedented

anti-corruption campaign might have made officials more reluctant to accept perks due to the elevated

risk of being disciplined. Hence, we expected the effect of the personnel changes on perk spending to be

weakened after the meeting. To test this, we define a dummy variable Post Meetingt, which is one if it is

after 2012. Column (6) shows that the coefficient of Induction is 0.071 (with t statistic 2.80) and the




                                                      15
interaction coefficient of Induction×Post Meeting is -0.045 (with t statistic -2.40). That is, after the 18th

Nation Congress, the effect of political turnover on perk spending is reduced by around 60%. Similarly,

after a recent arrest of a local politician in a city, the incoming officials would become more reluctant to

accept perks. To test this, we manually collected information of arrested city officials, and there are totally

79 cases of arrested officials in our sample period.13 Then we define a dummy variable Arrestc, t, which is

one if there was an arrest of a local official in city c in year t-1. Column (7) shows that the coefficient of

Induction is 0.040 (with t statistic 2.32) and the interaction coefficient of Induction×Arrest is -0.061 (with

t statistic -1.75). That is, a recent arrest reduces the effect on perk spending. This effect is so strong that

the total induction effect on perk spending becomes negative.

        These cross-sectional and time-series variations in perk spending lend further support to our

interpretation that the increase in perk spending is to build up relations with local governments.

4.4. Robustness checks: Alternative explanations

In this subsection, we examine several alternative explanations for the main results obtained from the

above regressions. First, we examine if firms face major changes in their business environment after

political turnovers. Political leaders often start new strategies, policies, and infrastructure constructions in

their first year of induction, especially in emerging market (An et al., 2016). This changing business

environment may increase firms’ costs as they start new projects, and break old ties with business partners.

Thus, the rise in perk consumption after new government officials taking office may be due to changes in

the business environment, rather than the purpose of building up relations with local governments. In

order to test this alternative explanation, we examine whether political turnover affects local firms’

investment expenditure and relationship with their main customers and suppliers in Table 7. The

dependent variable Invest_tai,c,t in Columns (1) is the investment of firm i, measured as the difference

between cash flow for purchasing and selling fixed assets, divided by total assets at the beginning of the

year.      The     dependent       variables      in    Columns        (2)   and     (3),    Changeratio_Customeri,c,t   and

Changeratio_Supplieri,c,t are the turnover ratio of top 5 customers and suppliers of listed firm, which are

respectively the fraction of the firm’s top 5 customers and suppliers that changed in year t. From the first

13
     The distribution of arrested officials by province and year is provided in the Online Appendix (Table 2).




                                                                  16
three columns, we can see that the appointment of new officials does not significantly change local firms’

investment or their relationship with their main customers and suppliers.            Hence, we do not find

evidence of major change in business environment after political turnovers.

    Second, the uncertainty during political turnover may adversely affect firms’ business performance

(Bo, 1996; Xu et al., 2016). Since our main variable is the ratio of Perk6 to revenue, our findings may

result from the decline of revenues, rather than the rise of perk spending. To test this alternative

explanation, we regress firms’ revenues on Induction. As shown in Column (4), local political turnover

has no significant effect on local firms’ revenues.

                                               [Table 7 About Here]

4.5. Perk spending and firm performance

Do firms benefit from their perk spending? One hypothesis is that the government may directly provide

subsidy to firms with stronger relationships with the government. To examine this, we construct

Subsidy_Revi,t, which is the government subsidy (including fiscal subsidy, tax returns and tax reduction)

to firm i divided by its sales in year t. If the subsidy is not disclosed, we set Subsidy_Rev to 0. Then, we

regress it on Perk_Rev and control for the subsidy in the previous year and the set of control variables in

our main test in Table 3. As shown in Column (1) of Table 8, the coefficient of Perk_Rev is 0.012 (with t

statistic1.83). This is consistent with our conjecture that firms build their connections to their local

governments through perk spending, and in return they get more subsidy from their local governments.

We then include the interaction term Induction×Perk6_Rev in the regression. As shown in Column (2), the

interaction coefficient is 0.11 (with t statistic1.90) while the coefficient of Perk6_Rev is 0.006 (with t

statistic1.25), that is, the effect of perk spending on subsidy occurs mostly during political turnovers.

                                              [Table 8 About Here]

     A second hypothesis is that connections with the local government officials may help a firm obtain

bank loans, especially long-term loans. To test this, we construct Leveragei,c,t, the ratio of firm i’s total

liabilities in year t to its lagged total assets in year t-1; and LongTermi,c,t, firm i’s long-term loan divided

by its lagged total liabilities in year t-1. We then run similar regressions. As shown in Columns (3)




                                                      17
through (6) of Table 8, perk spending is positively associated with higher debt ratio, especially the

long-term debt ratio, and this association is stronger during political turnovers.

                                                       [Table 9 About Here]

      The above evidence suggests that firms with higher perk spending receive more future government

subsidy and have better access to bank finance. A natural question is whether they also have better future

performances. To examine this, we regress future firm performance measures such as ROAi,c,t+1 and

ROEi,c,t+1 on Perk6_Revi,c,t. We include the same set of control variables and year-, industry-, and

province-fixed effects as in our earlier regressions. The results are reported in Table 9. As shown in

Columns (1) and (2), the coefficient of Perk6_Revi,c,t is insignificant. In Columns (3) and (4), we include

the interaction term Induction×Perk6_Rev in our regressions. In both cases, the interaction coefficients

are still insignificant.

      That is, we do not have evidence that firms with higher perk spending have better future

performance. This result may be somewhat surprising. From Table 8, we do find that firms’ perk spending

leads to more government subsidies and better financing, but from Table 9 they are not reflected in better

future performance of the firms as measured by the ROA or ROE, once we control for their lagged values.

One possible explanation is that firms’ perk expenses are mostly a “rat race”, that is, all firms have to

invest in relationship building with the local government just to avoid falling behind other firms, but they

do not get ahead of other firms. 14 Another possibility is that more government subsidies and better

financing from the local government are tunneled to become private benefits of firms’ managers.


5. Political turnover and firm management turnover

Our results so far suggest that perk spending is one way for firms to build connections with politicians. In

this section, we examine another type of government relationship building: top manager turnovers. In

China, the government retains the ultimate decision right on the appointment of SOEs’ CEOs and


14 This is reminiscent to the finding in Kang (2016) that lobbying in the US has a statistically significant but small effect on the
probability of a policy being legislated into law (only 0.05 percentage points), partly because the effects of lobbying expenditures
by supporting and opposing lobbies partially cancel each other out.




                                                                18
chairmen (Fan et al., 2007). The appointments of CEOs and Chairmen are carried out by the Organization

Department of the CCP at the level corresponding to the government which owns the SOEs. Many of

these senior managers in SOEs are typically quasi-government officials rather than professional managers.

Their promotion and demotions are likely to be less associated with operating performance and more

related to political considerations such as loyalty in carrying out policy mandates and connections with

powerful politicians. Thus, their career paths often overlap with local or central government officials

(Wong, 2014). Hence, we hypothesize that local political turnovers will lead to the changes of Chairmen

or CEOs for local SOEs in that city.

        To test this hypothesis, we construct a dummy variable, Turnover_Chairmani,c,t, which is 1 when the

chairman of firm i in city c leaves office in year t, and 0 otherwise. Similarly, we define a dummy

variable Turnover_CEOi,c,t for CEO turnovers. Then we regress these two dummy variables in year t+1

on Inductionc,t. We control for Firmsize, Leverage, ROA, as well as the characteristics of top managers,

including Tenure and Age in the regressions. As the impact of managers’ tenure and age on their turnover

may be non-linear, we also add their square terms in the regressions. We also include a control variable

STi,c,t, which is 1 if firm i is a “ST or PT firm”, and 0 otherwise. 15

                                                     [Table 10 About Here]

       The results are shown in Table 10. Panel A reports the results for turnovers for CEOs. The

regressions in Columns (1)-(3) are for the samples of non-SOEs, SOEs owned by the central government,

and SOEs owned by provincial governments, respectively. For these three samples, the coefficient of

Induction is insignificant. In contrast, for the sample of SOEs owned by city governments, the coefficient

of Induction is 0.388 (t=3.11), suggesting that a change in leadership of a city government increases the

probability of CEO changes in the firms headquartered in that city. The results for chairman turnovers,

reported in Panel B, are similar. The coefficient of Induction is only significant for city-SOE samples.

15
     In 1998, the China Securities Regulatory Commission introduced the ST and PT designation policy to the Chinese stock
market. Under the CSRC’s guideline, a firm can become an ST (PT) firm if it experiences a net loss for two (three) consecutive
years. Such firms will receive stricter scrutiny from regulators, including a narrower daily price fluctuation range (5% versus 10%
for normal stocks) and mandatory audited semi-annual financial reports. When a firm is denoted as a ST or PT firm, their
managers are more likely to be changed.




                                                               19
     One interpretation of the above results is that newly appointed city officials replace Chairmen and

CEOs of local SOEs by their “friends.” This interpretation implies that during the tenure of an official, the

chairmen and CEOs, who are “friends” of the official, are less likely to be replaced. Since the friend

network is not observable, we test this prediction indirectly. Specifically, we construct a dummy variable

Friendi,c,t for CEO or chairman i in year t as follows. The dummy variable is set to be 1 if the city official

who “appointed” CEO i (or chairman i) is still in office in year t. That is, if manager i is appointed when

official j is in office, we view i as a friend of j. The hypothesis is that if j is still in office, i is less likely to

be replaced.

     To test this hypothesis, we regress Turnover_CEOi,c,t+1 on Friendi,c,t. The results are reported in Panel

A of Table 11. Consistent with our hypothesis, it shows that if a CEO of a city-SOE is a friend of city

officials, he is less likely to be removed during the tenure of those officials. In contrast, this result does

not hold for non-SOEs and SOEs owned by central and provincial government. The results on the

turnovers of Chairmen, reported in Panel B, are similar. The coefficient of Friend is insignificant for

non-SOE and is only significant for city-SOE and provincial-SOE samples.

                                                  [Table 11 About Here]

     In summary, these results are consistent with the interpretation that, after political turnovers, the

connections between local governments and SOEs are established partly through appointing Chairmen

and CEOs with connections to the newly-appointed government officials.


6. Conclusion

     In this paper we empirically study how firms build their relationship with local government officials

in China. We focus on two mechanisms: perk spending and personnel changes. We find that, following

the turnover of the Party Secretary or mayor of a city in China, firms (especially private firms)

headquartered in that city significantly increase their “perk spending” (e.g., travel expenses, business

entertainment expenses, overseas training expenses, board meeting expenses, company car expenses, and

meeting expenses). Using the age and tenure of incumbents as instruments, our evidence supports the

interpretation that the perk spending increase is due to local political turnover. Moreover, we also find that



                                                          20
the perk expenses increase more when the demand to build relation is stronger, e.g., when the incoming

official is young, or is from a different city, and when the firm is less connected. This effect is weaker

when officials are more reluctant to accept perks due to elevated risks of discipline, for example, after the

18th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, or after an arrest of local politicians for

corruption cases. Our evidence also shows that firms with more perk expenses receive more future

benefits such as government subsidy and access to financing, but do not have better future performance as

measured by returns on assets or equity.

     Interestingly, the second relation building mechanism, personnel change, is only effective among

local SOEs. Local political turnover tends to be followed by changes of Chairmen or CEOs of

state-owned enterprises located in that city, particularly for those controlled by the local government. In

contrast, private firms and SOEs that are controlled by the central government do not seem to engage in

personnel changes following the turnover in the local government leadership. We also find that those

Chairmen or CEOs of local SOEs are the protégés of the local government officials: they are less likely to

be replaced in the future as long as their “mentors” remain in offices.

                                Appendix C: Survival analysis of officials’ leaving office

                                In panel A, we first plot the hazard rate using the Kaplan-Meier method, a nonparametric approach
                                that estimates a survival function without covariates and computes the hazard rate (1-conditional
                                survival probability). In Panel B, we examine whether age and latest tenure of officials will impact
                                conditional probability of officials’ leaving office by taking into account other city level feature that
                                could potentially affect the probability at a given time, such as GDP_growth and Pop_growth. The
                                dependent variable is the hazard ratio for Cox proportional hazard regression.

Table 3: The impact of political turnover on perks

This table presents the regression results of the impact of political turnover on perk spending. The dependent
variables are Perk6_Revi,c,, ETC_Revi,c,t, Perk8_Revi,c,t, Ln_Perk6i,c,t, and Perk6_Asseti,c,t in Columns (1) through (5),
respectively. In Column (6), the dependent variables are Perk6_Revi,c, and the sample does not include observations
on “major 4” cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing). The independent variables Inductionc,t is the
political turnover. Year-, industry-, and provincial-fixed effects (IYP) are included in all regressions. All variables
are as defined in the Appendix A. The t-statistics reported in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by
city. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

 Table 5: Two-stage IV specification

 This table presents the results of the following two-stage regressions.

             First Stage:   𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑐,𝑡 = 𝛼1 + 𝛽1 × 𝐼𝐼𝑐,𝑡−1 + 𝛾1 × 𝑀𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑐,𝑡
           Second Stage: 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃6_𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 = 𝛼2 + 𝛽2 × 𝐸𝐸𝐸_𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛾2 × 𝑀𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑐,𝑡

 where 𝐼𝐼𝐶,𝑡−1 denotes the instrumental variable in the first stage. One instrumental variable is D_Agec,t, which is
 one if the age of the mayor (or the party secretary) of city c is greater than or equal to the median age when a city
 mayor (or party secretary) leaves his position, and zero otherwise. The other instrument is D_Tenurec,t. “Tenure”
 refers to the number of years an official has been in office since his appointment, or last reappointment, at the
 current position. D_Tenurec,t is one if the tenure of the mayor (or the party secretary) of city c is greater than or
 equal to the median tenure when a city mayor (or party secretary) leaves his position, and zero otherwise.
 𝐸𝑥𝑝_𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑐,𝑡 is the projected value of Inductionc,t obtained from the first-stage regression. 𝑀𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 includes the
 list of control variables as in Table 3. We further control for year, industry, and provincial fixed effects and cluster
 the standard errors at the city level in all regressions. All variables are as defined in the Appendix A. *, **, and ***
 indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 6: The incentives to build up political connections

This table reports the results from regressions that extend the regression (1) in Table 3 by including an interaction
term Inductionc,t×Di,c,t, where Di,c,t is a dummy variable. In Column (1), Di,c,t is one if the newly-appointed official
is from city c, and zero otherwise. In column (2), Di,c,t is one if the newly-appointed official is older than 59, and
zero otherwise. In Column (3), Di,c,t is one if the CEO or chairman of firm i is a former government official, a
member of the Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, or a member of the National
Congress of Communist Party of China, and zero otherwise. In Column (4), Di,c,t is one if firm i is a state-owned
enterprise, and zero otherwise. In Column (5), Di,c,t is one if firm i’s total assets is larger than the median of asset
value of firms in the same industry in year t, and zero otherwise. In Column (6), Di,c,t is one if t is after 2012, and
zero otherwise. In Column (7), Di,c,t is one if there was an arrest of government official in city c in year t-1, and zero
otherwise. All other variables are defined in Appendix A. Year-, industry-, and provincial-fixed effects are included
in all regressions. The t-statistics reported in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by city. *, **, and
*** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

 Table 7: Alternative explanations: The effects of political turnover on firms' operations

 This table presents the results of the impact of political turnover on firms' other financial variables. The dependent
 variable in Columns (1), Invest_tai,c,t, is the investment expenditure, measured as the difference between cash flow
 for purchasing and selling fixed assets, divided by total assets at the beginning of the year. The dependent variables
 in Columns (2) and (3), Changeratio_Customeri,c,t and Changeratio_Supplieri,c,t, are turnover ratio of firm i’s top 5
 customers and suppliers, respectively. Log(Revenue) i,c,t in Columns (4) is the natural logarithm of revenue. The
 independent variables are the same as those in Table 3. The t-statistics reported in parentheses are based on
 standard errors clustered by city. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels,
 respectively.

     Table 8: Benefits from perk spending

     This table presents the regression results on the effects of perk spending on government subsidy and access to
     financing. Subsidy_Revi,c,t+1 is the ratio of firm i’s government subsidy to revenue in year t+1, where the
     government subsidy includes fiscal subsidy, tax returns and tax reduction. Leveragei,c,t+1 is the ratio of firm i’s total
     liability to total asset in year t+1. LongTermi,c,t+1 is firm i’s long-term loan in year t+1 divided by the total liabilities
     in year t. All other variables are defined in Appendix A. Year-, industry-, and provincial-fixed effects are included
     in all regressions. The t-statistics reported in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by city. *, **, and
     *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 9: The impact of perk spending on firm performance

This table presents the results from regressions where the dependent variables are ROA i,c,t+1 and ROE i,c,t+1. All
other variables are defined in Appendix A. Year-, industry-, and provincial-fixed effects are included in all
regressions. The t-statistics reported in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by city. *, **, and ***
indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 10: The impact of official turnover on top manager turnover

This table presents the results of the impact of official turnover on top manager turnover over the sample period
2003–2014. Turnover_CEOi,c,t+1 in Panel A is a dummy variable that equals 1 when the CEO of firm i is replaced
in year t+1, and 0 otherwise. Turnover_Chairmani,c,t+1 in panel B is a dummy variable that equals 1 when the
chairman of firm i is replaced in year t+1, and 0 otherwise. The regression in (1) is based on the sample of
non-SOEs. The regressions in Column (2) is based on the sample of SOEs. Moreover, Column (3)-(5) are
respectively the sub-sample of SOEs controlled by the central government, by the provincial government, and by
the city government. All other variables are defined in Appendix A. Year-, industry-, and provincial-fixed effects
are included in all regressions. The t-statistic reported in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by city.
*, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 3: Conditional probability of officials’ leaving office

This table presents the conditional probability of officials’ leaving office. Specifically, conditional probability of
officials’ leaving office by age is shown in Panel A, while that of their latest tenure is shown in Panel B. Moreover,
we plot these two types of probability in Figure 1 and 2, respectively.


Panel A: Conditional probability of leaving office by age
This panel shows the conditional probability of leaving office grouped by the local officials’ age. Conditional
probability of leaving office (Ratio) is calculated as the proportion of officials who leave office in certain age
(Leaving) to the sum of officials who were in position and those who leave office in certain age (Sum).

Panel B: Conditional probability of leaving office by latest tenure
This panel shows the conditional probability of leaving office grouped by the local officials’ latest tenure, where
the Tenure_latest is the tenure from the latest normal government succession around the meetings of the National
People’s Congress at city level. Conditional probability of leaving office (Ratio) is calculated as the proportion
of officials who leave office in certain age (Leaving) to the sum of officials who were in position and those who
leave office in certain age (Sum).

Table 4: Controlling city fixed effects

This table presents the results by further controlling city fixed effects in the regressions. In this table, we drop those
cities with less than 4 listed firms. Year, industry, and city fixed effects (IYC) are included in the regressions. All
variables are as defined in the Appendix A. The t-statistics reported in parentheses are based on standard errors
clustered by city. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 5A: The impact of political turnover on perks: Alternative definition of Induction

This table presents the regression results of the impact of a new measure of political turnover (Induction_newi,t) on
perk consumptions. If a mayor or a secretary in city c takes office in month m of year t, then his/her Induction_newc,t
equals (12-m+1) / 12, while Induction_new c,t+1 equals (m-1) / 12 in year t+1. The dependent variables are
respectively Perk6_Revi,c,t, ETC_Revi,c,t, Perk8_Revi,c,t, Ln_Perk6i,c,t, and Perk6_Asseti,c,t in column (1)-(5). In
column (6), we rerun the regression by dropping the “major 4” cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing).
Year, industry, regional fixed effects (IYR) are included in the regressions. All variables are as defined in the
Appendix A. The t-statistics reported in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by city. *, **, and ***
indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

             Table 5B: Different types of government officials’ turnover

             This table examine different types of political turnover in terms of appointing a new mayor or new communist
             party secretary for the city, as well as the results of alternative measures of Induction.. In Panel A, we examine
             the impact of appointing a new mayor, a new secretary or both in column (1)-(3). In Panel B, we change the
             definitions of government officials’ turnover. Specifically, in column (4), if a mayor is promoted from an acting
             mayor in the same city, we define the first year as the start year form an acting mayor taking office, rather
             than from a mayor taking office. In column (5), if a secretary is promoted from a mayor in the same city, we
             define the first year as the start year form a mayor taking office, rather than from her/his taking office as a
             secretary. In column (6), we include these two new definitions together in the regression. We further control
             for year, industry, and regional fixed effects and cluster the standard errors at the city level in all regressions. All
             variables are as defined in the Appendix A. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%
             levels, respectively.
