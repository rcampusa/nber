       Multinational firms that use domestic technologies in foreignlocations are requiredto pay

royalties from foreign users to domestic owners. Foreign governments often tax these royalty

payments. High royalty tax rates raise the cost of imported technologies. This paper examines

the effect of royalty taxes on the local R&D intensities for foreign affiliates of multinational

corporations, lookingboth   at foreign-owned   affiliates in the United States and at American-owned

affiliates in other countries. The results indicate that higher royalty taxes are associated with

greater R&D intensity on the part of affiliates, suggesting that local R&D is a substitute for

imported technology.

 1. Introduction.

                Many governments encouragethe developmentand use of new technologies within the

borders of their countries.   It is   not difficult to understand why they do so. It is widely believed that

the positive correlation between local economic affluence and the presence of technologically

advaiced industries implies that the use of new technologies enhances overall productivity. More

direct evidence generally supports the conclusion that the economic benefits of research and

development (R&D) activity extend to local firms other than those undertaking the R&D.' Since

there are reasons to expect that externality-generatingR&D activites may be underprovided by

markets in which developers of new technologies do not capture all of the economic benefits that the

technologies provide, various governments offer R&D-related tax subsidies.2 Governments that do

not offer R&D tax subsidies are often concerned that perhaps they should. There are, however, many

open questions about the impact of tax policy on the level of R&D.
               Tax systems influencethe level and content of R&D activity through a variety of

channels. This paper focuses on R&D by multinational firms, and the impact of one particular set of

taxes: withholding taxes on cross-border royalty payments. Firms that develop new technologies in

their home countries and use the technologies in foreign locations are required to pay royalties from

foreign affiliates to domestic parent companies. Governments tax these royalty payments. High tax

    21n theory, the welfare consequences of subsidizing R&D are ambiguous, because
                                                                                            competitive
pressures might generate too much R&D in certain industries in the absence of a subsidy, and because
foreign competitors may benefit from domestic subsidies (or in other ways influence the domestic
market). See Dixit (1988) and Reinganum (1989) for surveys of the theory. The United States
introduced the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit, and increased the tax deductibility of the R&D
expenses of certain multinational corporations, in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. This
legislation appears to have been motivated by considerationof economic externalities, though the focus
of Congressional sentiment as described in U.S. Congress, Joint Committee on Taxation (1981) is on
comparisons of U.S. research intensity with the research intensities of other countries.

rates make royalties, and the technotogy imports that they accompany, more expensive for the foreign

affiliates that pay the taxes.

                 to theory, higher costs of imported technology might encourage oc discourage local

R&D by affiliates of multinational corporations. If local R&D is complementary with imported

technology, then high royalty tax rates should discourage local R&D, while if local R&D is a

substitute for imported technology, then high royalty tax rates should encourage local R&D.

                 This paper has two objectives. The first is to identify the degree to which R&D

activity by multinational firms is sensitive to local tax conditions. The second objective is to

determine whether imported technology and local R&D are complements or substitutes.

                 The results suggest that R&D responds significantly to local tax rates, and that local

R&D is a substitute for imported technology. These results appear both in the behavior of American

investors in other countries, and in the behavior of foreign investors in the United States. Firms

appear to react to high royalty tax rates by paying fewer royalties and performing additional R&D

locatly. To the extent that royalty payments reflect actual technology transfer (rather than adept

accountingpractices), the behavior of multinational firms implies that local R&D is a substitute for

imported technology.

                 Section 2 of the paper briefly describes the tax treatment of multinational firms,

paying particular attention to technology-relatedissues. Section 3 describes a simple model of firm

behavior that traces the link between taxation and the degree of complementarity or substitutability of

local R&D and imported technology. Section 4 describes the data that serves as the basis of the

empirical work. Section 5 presents evidence on the relationship between royalty tax rates in foreign

countries and the R&D intensities of local affiliates of American multinational firms. Section 6

examines the same relationship for foreign firms investing in the United States. Section 7 is the

conclusion.

2. Multinational Firms. Taxation, and International Technolpay Transfer.

                 This section examines the role of multinational firms in international technology

transfer, and reviews the tax treatment of R&D expenditures and royalty receipts by multinational

firms.



International Technology Transfer

                There is considerable interest in understanding the role that multinational firms play in

transferring technologies across borders. There are two methods by which multinational firms

provide new technologies to the countries in which they invest. The first method is to develop new

technologies locally, through R&D or other similar type of activity. The second method is to import

technologies produced elsewhere.

                The foreign affiliates of American firms use both methods to bring technologies to the

countries in which they operate, and there exists sufficient information to assess quantitatively the

relative significance of each method. Direct informationon the R&D activities of the foreign

affiliates of U.S. firms is reported in surveys conducted by the United States Commerce Department.

Information on technology imports by these affiliates is considerably sketchier. One can, however,

infer the approximate magnitude of technology imports from royalties paid by the affiliates to U.S.

parent firms and third parties in other countries, since royalty payments should, in principle, reflect

the values of imported technologies.

                Table 1 reports detailed informationabout the aggregate technology-related behavior

of the foreign affiliates of U.S. firms in 1982 arid 1989.   It is noteworthy that these affiliates paid
more in royalties to their parent firms ($9.8 billion in 1989) than they spent on R&D ($7.9 billion in

1919), though, as the table indicates, there was extensive use   of both methods of technology
acquisition. The survey distinguishestwo categories of R&D expenditure: R&D by affiliates for
                                                        4
themselves, and R&D by affiliates for others (the latter of which is R&D performed on a contract

basis). R&D by affiliates for themselves constitutes roughly 80% of their total R&D expenditures.

                  American firms spend a considerable amount of money on R&D performed in foreign

countries, but in recent years, foreign-owned firms in the United States have spent even more than

that on R&D performed here. Figure        1   illustrates the R&D expenditure levels of foreign affiliates of

U.S. firms and foreign-owned firms in the United States over the 1977-1990 period. Due to the

R&D-intensity of the U.S. economy relative to the rest of the world, and the strength of foreign

direct investment into the United States since 1973, foreign firms have spent more on R&D inside the

United States than American firms have spent on R&D outside the United States in every year since

1982, and the gap between the two expenditure levels is widening (see Figure 1)?

                  There is considerable interest in the role   of multinational firms in transferring

technology across borders, and the impact that government policy can have on the rate and direction
of technology transfer. Though these issues have been extensively studied,4 one of the open

questions is the degree to which imported technology is a substitute or complement for local R&D.



US Taxation     of Foreign Income5


    3Exchange rate fluctuations can confound the interpretationof Figure 1, since changes in the value
of the dollar relative   to foreign currencies affect the dollar-denominated relative magnitudes of R&D
performed in the United States and abroad, even if nominal expenditures are unchanged. This
consideration is not significant in this case, however, since a simple adjustment for the changing value
of the dollar relative to a trade-weighted averageofforeign currencies produces a figure that very closely
resembles Figure 1.

    4See, for example, Teece (1976), Germidis (1977), Mansfield, Teece, and Romeo (1979), Mansfield
and Romeo (1980), Davidson and McFetridge (1984), Lipsey, Blomstrom, and Kravis (1990), Zejan
(1990), Blomstrom (1991), Ethier and Markusen (1991), Wang and Blonistrom (1992), and Blomstrom
and Kokko (1993). These studies together consider the effect of a large number of variables on
technology transfer and R&D activity, though they do not considerthe effect of royalty tax rates on local
R&D intensities.

    5Parts   of this brief description of the tax system are excerpted from Hines    (1991).
                                                      5
                 The United States taxes income on a "residence" basis, meaning that American

corporations and individuals owe taxes to the U.S. government on all of their worldwide income,

whether earned in the United States or not. The top U.S. corporate tax rate is now 35 percent. Since

foreign profits are usually taxed in host countries, U.S. law provides a foreign tax credit for income

taxes (and related taxes) paid to foreign governments, in order not to subject American multinationals

to double taxation. The foreign tax credit mechanism provides that an American corporation earning

$100 in a foreign country with a 12 percent tax rate (and a foreign tax obligation of $12) pays only

$23 to the U.S. government, since its U.S. corporate tax liability of $35 (35 percent    of $100) is
reduced to $23 by the foreign tax credit of $12. The foreign tax credit is, however, limited to U.S.

tax liability on foreign income; if, in the example, the foreign tax rate were 50 percent, then the firm

pays $50 to the foreign government but its U.S. foreign tax credit is limited to $35. Hence an

American firm receives full tax credits for its foreign taxes paid only when it is in a "deficit credit"

position, i.e., when its average foreign tax rate is less than its tax rate on domestic operations.   A
firm has "excess credits" if its available foreign tax credits exceed U.S. tax liability on its foreign

income. Firms average together their taxable incomes and taxes paid in all of their foreign operations

in calculating their foreign tax credits and the foreign tax credit limit.6

                Deferral of U.S. taxation of certain foreign earnings is another important feature of

the U.S. international tax system. An American parent firm is taxed on its subsidiaries' foreign



    6ln order to qualify for the foreign tax credit, firms must own at least 10% of a foreign affiliate, and
only those taxes that qualify as income taxes are creditable. Furthermore, income is broken into different
functional "baskets' in the calculation of applicablecredits and limits. Income earned and taxes paid in
the conduct of most types of active foreign business operations are grouped in one "basket;" petroleum
industry income is grouped in a separate "basket;" and there are separate "baskets" for items such as
passive income earned abroad. The "basket" distinctions imply that a firns might simultaneously have
excess foreign tax credits in the petroleum "basket" (which is common, since foreign tax rates on oil
income are typically quite high) and deficit foreign tax credits in the active income "basket." Such a firm
would have to pay some U.S. tax on its active foreign income, even though it has excess foreign tax
credits on its petroleum income.
                                                        6

income only when returned ('repatriated') to the parent corporation. This type of deferral is

available only to foreign operations that are separately incorporated in foreign countries

(subsidiaries"   of the parent) and not to consolidated ("branch") operations.     The U.S. governnsent

taxes branch profits as they are earned, just as it would profits earned within the United States.

                 The deferral of U.S. taxation may create incentives for firms with lightly-taxed

foreign earnings to delay repatriating dividends from their foreign subsidiaries.1 This incentive arises

in those cases in which firms expect never to repatriate their foreign earnings, or if they anticipate

that future years will be more attractive for repatriation (either because domestic tax rates will be

lower, or because future sources of foreign income will generate excess foreign tax credits that can be

used to offset U.S. tax liability on the dividends).S   It appears that, in practice, American
multinationals tend to pay dividends out of their more heavily taxed foreign earnings first.9

Consequently, the average tax rate that firms face on their foreign income need not exactly equal the

average foreign tax rate faced by their branches and subsidiaries abroad.

                 Branch earnings and dividends from subsidiaries represent only two forms of foreign

income for U.S. income tax purposes. Interest received from foreign sources also represents foreign

income, though foreign interest receipts are often classified within their own 'basket" and hence are



    7The incentive to defer repatriation of lightly taxed subsidiary earnings is attenuated by the Subpart
F provisions, introduced in U.S. law in 1962, that treat a subsidiary's passive income, and income
invested in U.S. property, as if it were distributed to its American owners, thereby subjecting it to
immediate U.S. taxation. The Subpart F rules applyto controlled foreign corporations, which are foreign
corporations owned at least 50% by American persons holding stakes of at least 10% each. Controlled
foreign corporations that reinvest their foreign earnings in active businesses can continue to defer their
U.S. tax liability on thoseearnings. See Hines (1994b), Hines and Rice (1994) and Scholes and Wolfson
(1992) for the behavioral implications of these rules.

    81t is interesting to note that the deferral of US tax liability does not itselfcreate an incentive to delay
paying dividends from foreign subsidiaries, since the US tax must be paid eventually. See Hartman
(1985).

    9See the evidence presented in Hines and Hubbard (1990).

not averaged with other income in calculating the foreign tax credit. Royalty income received from

foreigners, including foreign affiliates of U.S. firms, is also foreign source income. Foreign

governments often impose moderate taxes on dividend, interest, and royalty payments from foreign

affiliates to their American parent companies; these withholding'°taxes are fully creditable against

an American taxpayer's U.S. tax liability on foreign income.



The Tax Treatment ofR&D Expenditures and Royalty Rece(pts

                American multinational firms that perform R&D in the United States intending to use

the resulting technology both in the United States and abroad face a complex tax treatment of their

transactions, Since passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, American multinationals are no longer

allowed to deduct 100 percent of their U.S. R&D expenses against their U.S. tax liabilities. Instead,

U.S. law requires American firms to allocate R&D expenses between U.S. and foreign source based

on the fraction of a firm's sales that are foreign.1 The practical importance of this system is that

firms with excess foreign tax credits receive usable tax deductions for only a fraction (equal to the

ratio of domestic sales to total worldwide sales) of their U.S. R&D expenses. This system is based

on the ides that multinational firms performing R&D in the United States use only a fraction of the

output of their R&D activities to enhance their sales in the United States, and consequently, that only

a fraction of their R&D costs should be deductible against U.S-source income.


                Royalties received by American parent firms for R&D used abroad represent taxable


      C)Taxes on cross-border flows, such as dividends, interest, and royalties, are known as 'withholding
taxes due to some of the specifics of their administration. Strictly speaking, these taxes represent
obligations of the recipients of the cross-border flows and not the payors; this arrangement permits
immediate full crediting of withholding taxes by recipients who are eligible to claim foreign tax credits.
The taxes are called "withholding' taxes because the local payor is the withholding agent for the tax, and
is therefore liable to its host government for full payment of the taxes.

      See Hines (1993, 1994a) for descriptions of the precise formulas used and quantitative assessments
of their impact on R&D spending levels.
                                                       S


foreign-source income of the American firms. American firms with deficit foreign tax credits must

pay U.S. income tax on these royalty receipts, while firms with excess foreign tax credits can apply

the excess credits against U.S. taxes due on the royalties, thereby eliminating the U.S. tax liability

created by the royalty receipts.

                   Most of the world's governments impose withholding taxes on cross-border royalty

payments from affiliates located within their countries. These royalty tax rates are frequently reduced

according to the terms of bilateral tax trestles. For example, the United States imposes a 30 percent

tax on royalties paid to foreign corporations, but this tax rate is often reduced, in some cases to zero,

when recipients of royalty payments are located in countries with whom the United States has a tax

treaty in force.



3. Framework mr Analysis.

                   This section analyzes the implications of systems of international taxation for the R&D

behavior of multinational firms.

                   Consider a multinational firm that establishes a foreign affiliate to produce and sell

goods in the foreign country in which the affiliate is located.12 The affiliate generates sales using

local inputs of capital, labor, and intermediateproducts; in addition, the affiliate uses technology from

its parent and the technology it generates on its own to produce goods for sale. The reduced-form

function that describes the impact of technologies on the affiliate's sales can be formalized as:

S(R, R*,   ), in which S denotes sales in the local (foreign) market, R is technology provided by the
parent firm to the affiliate in this market, R* is the technology that the affiliate generates on its own,



    1-'This analysis abstracts from the possibility that the activities of foreign affiliates directly enhance
the sales of its domestic parent firm. One of the practical difficulties that American firms encounter in
such situations is that royalties paid by U.S. parents to their foreign affiliates are severely tax-
disadvantaged. See Hines (1994a)for a discussion of this issue.
                                                      9

and    denotes other features of the local market (as well as the affiliate's profit-maximizing

employment of local factors).

                American tax law and the tax laws of most other countries'3require that foreign

affiliates pay rents or royalties to their parent firms for the fair market value of technologies

transferred from the parent firms to the affiliates. Of course, in practice is it frequently difficult to

establish the fair market value of technology transferred from one party to another within a controlled

group, since there may exist no market prices for the types of technology in question. In such

circumstances, tax-avoiding firms that transfer technology from the parent to its foreign affiliates

often have incentives to select royalty payments that transfer taxable income Out of high-tax

jurisdictions and into low-tax jurisdictions. Governmentsare aware of this incentive, and try to use

their enforcement power to prevent royalties from deviatingtoo greatly from reasonable values.'4

                One way to describe government enforcement efforts is to introduce an additional cost

that firms bear when royalties deviate from market values. The cost includes the cost that firms incur

in justifying their royalty delcarations to tax authorities.   If this adjustment cost rises sufficiently with
the size of the deviation of reported royalties from market values, then      it will ultimately limit the

degree to which firms modify royalty payments simply for tax purposes.

                A quadratic model of adjustment costs provides a convenient framework to use in

analyzing the impact of government enforcement efforts. One can distinguish R, the true value of

transferred technology, from r, the royalty paid to the parent firm by the affiliate receiving the

technology. If the rate of adjustment cost is quadratic in the deviation of declared royalties from the

technology's market value, then adjustment costs equal a[(R-r)2/R2]for each unit of technology


    130f the twenty-five industrialized countries surveyedby Lawlor (1985), twenty-four apply the arm's
length principle to the taxation of related-party transactions; Hong Kong is the lone exception.
    '4For evidence on the overall effectiveness of transfer price enforcement, see Kopits (1976), Grubert
and Mutti (1991), Harris et al. (1993), and Hines and Rice (1994).
                                                     10

transferred.   a is taken to be a constant parameter.   Total adjustment costs equal the product   of R and

this term, or a(R-r)2/R.

                 The affiliate's technology-related taxable income represents the difference between

sales revenue generated by the technology and the affiliate's costs. These costs include the affiliate's

own R&D expenditures, the royalties it pays to the parent firm, and the adjustment cost.'5 The

parent firm receives a royalty from its affiliate, and may incur a cost of producing the technology that

it transfers to the affiliate. In order to fix ideas for the analysis that follows, the model describes the

behavior of a multinational firm that has excess foreign tax credits and that values on a one-for-one

basis its after-tax profits in foreign subsidiaries.'6 The multinational firm maximizes after-tax

profits, iv:



                 iv   = (lr)[S(R, R*,    )-   R* - r - n(R-r)21R] + (l_w*)r - cR                         (1)




     "This treatment of the foreign affiliate abstracts from its activities that are unaffected by R&D
activitiesor technology imports. The affiliate, and not the parent firm, is assumed to bear the adjustment
cost because doing so simplifies the algebra that follows. A more general treatment that allocates
adjustmentcosts between affiliatesand parent firms yields qualitativelysimilar results. See, for example,
the treatment of adjustment costs in Hines and Rice (1994).

     '6A finn values its subsidiaries' profits on a one-for-basis either if there is no tax due upon
repatriation or if the firm can use deferral strategies of the type described in Hines and Rice (1994) to
rednce the present value of repatriation taxes. A firm with deficit foreign tax credits maximizes an
expression that is similar to (1), with the difference that the terms (l_r*) and (l_w*) are replaced by (i-a),
in which r is the home-countrytax rate. The first-order conditionsdescribing the behavior of such a firm
imply that the firm sets r = R, and that, in this static setting, host-country tax rates do not influence its
behavior, in practice, the behavior of American multinational firms should reflect some kind of average
of these two extremes. The analysis that follows assumes that all American firms have excess foreign
tax credits, so, to the extent that many firms do not, the empirical estimates understate the responsiveness
of the affected group to local tax conditions. The home countries of foreign investors in the United States
have tax systems that differ considerably in their treatments of R&D expenditures and royalty and
dividend income from foreign sources. The empirical work in this paper distinguisheshome-country tax
systems only by whether firms are permitted to claimforeign tax credits, which omits some more subtle
distinctions and may, thereby, introduce measurement error in the tax variables.

in which   r is   the foreign statutory tax rate, w* is the withholding tax rate imposed by the foreign

government on outgoing royalty payments, and c is the per-unit cost incurred by the parent firm to

develop andlor transfer the technology represented by R. The first term in expression (1) represents

the after-foreign-tax profits earned by the affiliate; the second term is the parent firm's after-

withholding-tax royatty receipts; and the third term is the parent firm's cost of developing the

technology that it transfers to the affiliate. tn some cases, parent firms costlesslytransfer to their

subsidiaries technologies developed for other purposes, so it is possible that c   = 0.
                  The first-order condition describing the firm's optimal choice of r is:



                  (1-rt)[2re(R-r)IR - 1]   + (l-w) =       0                                             (2)



which yields:




                  r = R{l + (r*w*)I[2a(tT*)I}                                                            (3)




The first-order condition describing the firm's optimal choice of R is:



                  (lr*)[ôSIOR - a(R-r)R+r)IR1 - c       = 0                                              4)


Imposing (3) and simpli1'ing yields:

The first-order condition describing the firm's optimal choice of R* is considerably simpler:

                   The conditions(3), (5), and (6) characterize

choices of R, R*, and r. Inspection of (5) and (6) indicates that taxation does not affect the required

marginal productivity of R&D performed in the foreign locatidn, while taxation does affect the

required marginal productivity of R&D performed in the home country. Consequently, as long as tax

rates are set in a manner that is exogenous to the unobservable factors that determine R&D intensity,

it   is possible to use the tax variables that appear on the right side of (5) to estimate the extent to

which domestic technology is a substitute or complement for foreign R&D.



4. Data.

                   There are two available sources of detailed information on the R&D activities of

multinational firms located in a large number of countries. The first source is the 1989 Benchmark

Survey of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the United States Department of Commerce.

This survey, the results of which are reported in United States Department of Commerce (1992), is

the most recent comprehensive survey of the activities of the foreign affiliates of American

multinational firms. The survey covers activities during 1989. tn order to protect the confidentiality

of survey respondents, BEA does not divulge the responses of individual firms, and reports country

aggregates only for those countries in which there are sufficient numbers of U.S. firms with sizable

activities that aggregate figures do not reveal information about individual firms. Useful R&D and

royalty data are available for affiliates in 43 foreign countries for 1989.

                   The second source of information is the 1987 survey of foreign direct investment in

the United States, reported in United States Department of Commerce (1990). This survey describes

the activities of foreign-owned firms in the United States during 1987. Due to data suppressions and
                                                      13

other limitations, useful data are available on investors from 27 different countries during 1987,

                 The goal of the statistical work is to examine the relationship between royalty tax

rates and levels of R&D activity, both for American firms investing in foreign countries and for

foreign firms investing in the United States. The difficultythat such a study encounters ia that R&D

levels differ for reasons that have nothing to do with tax rates. One nontax factor that is clearly

associated with R&D spending is the degree of R&D intensity in the countries in which multinational

firms have operations. The foteign affiliates of American multinationalslocated in countries whose

economics are R&D-intensive tend to perform more R&D than do affiliates located in other countries.

Similarly, foreign-owned affiliates in the United States tend to invest more in R&D if their parent

firms are located in technologically-intensivecountries.'7

                Information is available from the National Science Foundation (1991) on the R&D

intensities of a large nsmber of countries. The National Science Foundation constructs indices that

reflect national R&DIGNP ratios; due to data limitations, these ratios are not all calculated using data

for the same year, though most observations represent the period 1986-1988." In the empirical

work that follows, the variables that influenceR&D demand are interacted with these country-level

measures of R&D intensity. This procedure represents a simple, if rather unsubtie, adjustment for

heterogeneity among countries in the extent to which their firms undertake R&D. Local R&D



     '7At a first pass, this association is suggestive of a complementary relationship between local R&D
and importedtechnology, since affiliatesof multinationalfirms headquartered in R&D-intensive countries
probably face lower real costs of importing technology than do affiliates of fsrms from other countries.
But differences in the technologicalintensities of parent firms also reflect heterogeneity between affiliates
that can invalidate such an inference.

    "R&DIGNP ratios change little from year to year, as evidenced by the time-series data on France,
Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States presented in Table 2. These economies,
which are among the most R&D-intensivein the world, exhibit only gradual movements in R&D intensity
relative so each other. This pattern suggests that time-invariant cross-sectional differences in R&D
intensity are likely to be much more important than any differences crested by the asynchronous nature
of the data reported by the National ScienceFoundation.
                                                     14

intensity can have an important impact on the demand for imported technology as well, so the R&D

intenaity variable appears in the royalty equations. Since R&D intensity is likely to have less direct

an impact on royalties than it does on R&D expenditures, the R&D intensity variable enters the

royalty equations independentlyof the other explanatoryvariables.

                Information on tax systems and tax rates is reported by Price Waterhouse (various

isaues). In the empirical work that follows, firms are assumed to face effective tax rates on their

technology-related activities equal to statutory corporate tax rates in host countries. Tables 3 and 4

report means and standard deviations of the variables used in the empirical work.



5. Foreign Affiliates of Asnerican Multinational Cornorations,

                The model described by equations (fl-(6) carries the implication that technology-

related royalty payments and R&D spending levels should respond to local tax rates. Specifically, the

model predicts that higher withholding taxes on royalties will reduce royalty payments both by

discouraging technology transfers, and by reducing the ratio of reported royalties to the valuet    of

technologies transferred.

                The regressions reported in Table 5 test these implications on the data that describe

the behavior of the foreign affiliates of American multinational corporations for the year 1989. Table

5 presents estimates of the coefficients that correspond to the implied specification of the royalty

demand equation that emerges from (3) and (5). The dependent variable is a ratio, the numerator of

which is royalties paid by the foreign affiliates of U.S. firms to their parent companies, and the

denominator of which is total sales by the affiliates.'9 Data represent country aggregates.


    '9The equations reported in TableS were all re-run using total royalties pald in place of royalties paid
to U.S. parents, with very similar results. (And notsurprisingly, since, as Table 1 indicates, 80 percent
of all royalties paid by the foreign affiliates of American firms go to theparent companies of the affiliates
paying the royalties.) The regressions reported in TableS use royalties paid to parent companiesbecause
only for those royalties is it clear at what rate the royalties will be taxed.
                                                    15

                The estimates reported in column I   of Table 5   imply that royalty payments respond

negatively to royalty tax rates and are close to unaffected by statutory tax rates. The coefficients

indicate that, at a statutory tax rate of 35 percent, a 10 percent reduction in the withholding tax rate

on royalties stimulates additional royalty payments equal to 0.1 percent   of sales.   The implied

elasticity of royalty payments with respect to the royalty tax rate, calculated using these estimates and

mean values of the variables as reported in Table 2, is approximately -O.4.      If sales are unaffected
by changes in royalty tax rates, then this figure implies that doubling the royalty tax rate reduces

royalties by 40 percent, a sizable fraction.

                Since sales may respond to tax rate changes, this calculation may understate the

responsivenessof royalties, but nevertheless strongly suggests that the true elasticity lies between zero

and -1. It is, however, important to note that the aggregate nature of the data may introduce

considerable measurement error that biases the estimated coefficient toward zero. The sign of any

bias introduced by omitted variables is ambiguous, though the magnitude could be large.

                The results presented in column 2 of Table 5 indicate that royalties also respond

significantlyto differences between royalty withholdingtax rates and statutory tax rates. As

peedicted, the local R&D/GNP ratio is positively correlated with royalty payments. Alternative

specificationsreported in columns 3-5 of Table 5 yield similar conclusions:high tax rates on royalties

are associatedwith lower ratios of royalty payments to total sales.

               The specificationsused to obtain the results described in Table 5 were changed in a

number of ways, in every case generating similar results. One specificationissue concerns the

appropriate choice of denominator for the dependent variable. Specifications in which labor

compensation replaces sales as the denominator of the dependent variable yield results that are almost


    Exercises such as this one are fraught with dangers, since variables may exhibit considerable
differences between their conditionaland unconditionalmeans. The calculation in the text is meant only
to be illustrative.
                                                   16

identical to those reported in Table 5. Doe to the somewhat heterogeneous nature of royalties, it

seems most appropriate to scale this variable by sales. In the regressions reported in Tables 6 and 9,

the dependent variables that represent R&D expenditures are scaled by labor compensation in

manofacturing for somewhat different reasons. Manufacturing affiliates account for approximately 90

percent of the R&D activity of foreign-owned affiliates in the U.S. and of the foreign affiliates of

U.S. firms. Labor expenditures share with R&D expendituresthe feature of immediate deductibility

for tax purposes,2' and are more reasonably thooght of as the prodoct of firm choices than are sales,

which may be functions of R&D. All of the R&D demand equations in reported in Tables 6 and 9

were re-run acaling the dependent variable by labor expenditures, with results that are very similar to

those reported in the tables.



A Firsf Approach to Estimating the Impact    of Taxes on R&D
                The results reported in Table 5 indicate that royalty payments by the foreign affiliates

of U.S. multinational firms respond to tax rates in the predicted manner. The model described in

equations (l)-(6) does not, however, carry a prediction about the sign of the effect of tax rates on

R&D expenditurelevels, and the object of the regressions reported in Tables 6 and 7 is to measure

the sign of any effect that may be present. The regressions reported in Tables 6 and 7 address this

measurement problem using very different methodologies, though, as it happens, the results point to

conclusions that are quite similar.

                Table 6 presents regressions that estimate of the impact of the tax treatment of



    "Of course, some countries (including the United States) offer tax credits and other inducements to
firms that perform R&D (and in some cases to firms that hire labor). A brief survey ofcountry practices
indicates, however, that sizable R&D subsidies are rare for example, see Hall (1993) for an analysis of
the magnitude of the marginal subsidy provided R&D in the United States by the Research and
Experimentation Tax Credit], and that the primary subsidy comes from the immediate deductibility of
R&D expenses that almost all industrialized countries provide.
                                                     17

royalties on the R&D-intensities of foreign affiliates of U.S. firms, using specifications drawn from

the model described in equations (l)-(6). The dependent variable is the ratio of R&D expenditures in

1989 to manufacturing labor compensation in 1989. The results in the table are strongly suggestive

of an important impact of royalty taxes on R&D activity, but not all of the estimated coefficients in

the table are significant. The strongest and most parsimonious specification is presented in column 2

of Table 6, and here the estimated coefficients suggest that an unfavorable tax climate for royalties is

associated with greater R&D activity. Imported technology and local R&D appear to be substitutes.

                Columns 3-5 of Table 6 report the results of alternative specificationsof the modal.

Two aspects of these results are noteworthy. The first is that the estimated coefficients on the

variable [1/U .r*) (R&D/GNP)] are always insignificant. This variable appears as one part        of the
first term on the right side of (5), and the estimated coefficient captures the effect of c, the cost of

developing technology at home to transfer to affiliates abroad. The insignificanceof the estimated

coefficient implies either that firms transfer nonrival technologies to their affiliates, so c = 0, or that

the cstimating mcthodology is not powerful enough to identify an important effect. The second

noteworthy aspect of the results is that the specificationsthat include quadratic tax terms generate

insignificant results. These results may reflect the limited ability of the estimators to distinguish the

effects of collinear variables in a small sample.

                Using the coefficient estimate from the equation presented in column I of Table 6, the

implied elasticity of R&D activity with respect to the withholding tax rate on royalties (evaluating all

variables at their sample means) is approximately 0.16. This figure is smaller than the implied

royalty elasticity calculated from Table 5, which is reassuring, since own-price elasticities are usually

stronger than cross-price elasticities. This estimated elasticity suggests that local R&D is a mild

substitute for imported technology, but it is helpful to consider additional evidence before drawing

any conclusions.
 A Second Approach to Esthnating the Impact of Taxes on R&D

                   One of the difficulties that arise in estimating the impact of royalty tax rates on local

 R&D levels is that many omitted variables influenceR&D spending. It is possible that these variables

 are correlated with royalty withholding tax rates in a way that biases the estimated tax rate

 coefficients, and generates a misleading conclusion concerning the substitutability of R&D for

 imported technology. The regressions reported in Table 6 control for local technological

 environments simply by interacting the tax variables with the (R&D/GNP) measure.

                   An alternative approach is to use available information that distinguishes the R&D

 activity of foreign affiliates of American firms for their own purposes from R&D activity that they

undertake on behalf of others. Both types of R&D activity are likely to be influenced by local

economic and technological conditions.      It is, however, possible that the latter type of contract-style
R&D performed for others is generally unaffected by the availabilityof technology imports from

parent firms. If not, then R&D performed for others serves as a control group with which to

compare R&D performed by affiliates for their own purposes. Under the hypothesis that R&D

performed for others is unaffected by technology imports, the fraction of an affiliate's total R&D

activity undertaken for itselfis a positive function of royalty taxes   if local R&D and imported
technology are substitutes, and a negative function of royalty taxes if local R&D and imported

technology are complements.

                  There are 38 countries in the sample for which the BEA data distinguish R&D

performed by affiliates for themselves from R&D performed by affiliates for others. Table 7 presents

estimated coefficients from regressions in which the dependent variable is the ratio of R&D performed

by affsliates for themselves to total R&D by affiliates. The results once again suggest that local R&D

is   a substitute for imported technology. In the regression reported in column 1 of Table 7, the

estimated coefficient on royalty withholding tax rates is positive and significant; the same is true of
                                                      19

                                                                                reported in column 2.
  The coefficient estimates reported in colunm 2 indicate that a 10
                                                                    percent change in the difference
  between foreign withholding and statutory tax rates (normalized by one minus the foreign
                                                                                           statutory
  tax rate) is associated with a 2.6 percent change in the
                                                           intensity of R&D activity by affiliates for
 themselves.

                  Columns 3-5 of Table 7 report the results of alternative specifications of the R&D

 demand equation. The coefficient estimatesfrom these specifications are consistent with those

 reported in columns 1-2, and are also consistent with the results reported in Table 6. In particular,

 the estimated coefficient of the variable lI(l-rt) is again insignificant. The estimates
                                                                                          reported in
 column 1 of Table imply that the elasticity of R&D spending with respect to
                                                                             royalty withholding taxes
 (evaluatingall variables at their sample means) is approximately 0.11, which resembles the elasticity

 calculated from estimates reported in Table 6.

                 The regressions reported in Tables 6 and 7 offer consistent evidence that the
                                                                                               aggregate
behavior of the foreign affiliates of American multinational firms exhibits substitution of local R&D

for imported technology,    it is important to note, however, that there can be more than one
interpretation of this pattern at the level of individual firms. One possibility is that tax differences

influencethe behavior of firms located in different countries. A second possibility is that tax

differences encourage specific firms to locate in certain countries and not in others, without

influencing the R&D intensities of individuatfirms.n A third, and perhaps the most likely,

possibility represents some combination of the first two. The use of aggregate data makes it

impossible to use the observed pattern of behavior to distinguish these explanations, though, for many

purposes, it many not be necessary to distinguish them.


     Lipsey, Blomstrom, and Kravis (1990) examine the impact of host-country characteristics on the
attributes - particularly R&D intensitites - of multinational firms choosing to locate within the
                                                                                                  country.
They do not, however, consider the impact of tax policies.

6. Foreign-Owned Affiliates          in the United States

                   Thebehaviorof foreign-owned affiliates in the United States offers additional

evidence on the responsivenessof R&D activity to royalty tax rates. This evidence must, however,

be interpreted with caution,owing to hetergeneouscircumstances of foreign firms that invest in the

United States and the small sample size of 27 foreign countries for wbich sufficient data are available.

                   Home-country tax treatments of foreign multinational firms that invest in the United

States differ according to individual circumstances and national law. There are two dimensions along

which the variation between investors is most important. The home governments             of some foreign

investors tax the worldwide incomes of their residents while granting credits       for foreign taxes paid,

while other governments exempt all foreign-source income from tax.0            A second dimension along

which tax systems differ concerns the degree of integration of personal and corporate taxes. For

some countries, their corporation taxes largely represent advanced withholdingtaxes against personal

tax liabilities.

                   The specification of royalty equations corresponding to the system described by (l)-(6)

is somewhat different in the case of foreign investors in the United States than       it is in the regressions

reported in Table 5. To start, the tax rate      r   is the United States tax rate, which is the same for all

foreign investors. The value of c, the cost of producing technology for export, need not be similar

for different foreign investors,      and is captured in the estmating equations by the inclusion   of

R&D/CINP as an explanatory variable. And there may be important differences between the

incentives facing investors from foreign tax credit countries and investors from countries that do not

grant foreign tax credits.

                   Table   S   presents estimates of the determinants of royalty payments by foreign-owned




    00f course, this dichotomous breakdown greatlyoversimplifies the many distinctions and subtleties
that foreign tax systems exhibit.
                                                    21

affiliates in the United States in 1987. The coefficient on the withholding tax rate in the regression

presented in the column 2 of Table 8 implies that raising the tax rate by 10 percent reduces the

royalty/sales ratio by 0.74 percent. The estimated coefficient lies just at the margin of statistical

significance. To understand its magnitude in a different way, the implied elasticity of royalties/sales,

evaluating all variables at their population means, is approximately -0.12. If sales are unaffected by

cbanges in royalty tax rates, then this figure implies that doubling the royalty tax rate reduces

royalties by 12 percent.

                Column 3 of Table 8 presents the same regression in which the withholding tax rate is

now transformed to be zero for all investors from foreign tax credit countries. The results are very

similar to those reported in column 2. Columns 4 and 5 report results of regressions in which

squares of the withholding tax rates are introduced; the coefficient estimates are insignificant,

reflecting the multicollinearity of the two tax rate variables and the limited amount of variation in a

sample of this size.

                Table 9 presents estimated coefficientsfrom regressions that investigate the correlation

between the R&D intensity of foreign-owned affiliates in the United States and the tax variables that

influencethe cost of imported technology. One striking feature of all of the regressions presented in

Table 9 is the strong correlation between the R&D-intensity of foreign-owned affiliates in the United

States and the R&D-intensity of the countries in which their parent firms are located. Column 2

presents the simplest specification that includes tax rate variables; the estimated coefficient on the

interaction between the withholding tax rate and home-countryR&D intensity is positive and

significant. The implied elasticity of R&D with respect to the cost   of imported technology (evaluated
at sample means) is approximately0.3. This is a very sizable elasticity, particularly in view of the

smaller own-price elasticity of royalties implied by the estimates reported in Table 8. Furthermore,

the reponsiveness of royalties to withholding tax rates reflects changes in reporting behavior in
                                                    22

addition to changes in amounts of technology transferred. The elasticity implies that, in the absence

of an effect arising through the scale of operations, doubling the withholding tax rate raises R&D

expenditures by 30 percent. This estimated response magnitude is very large, and may reflect the

imprecision of estimaces drawn from so small a sample. Nevertheless, it is striking that the pattern of

substitutability between R&D and imported technology appears for foreign investors in the United

States as well as American investors in other countries?4

                Column 3 of Table 9 presents estimates from the specification in which the

withholding tax rate is interacted with a variable that equals zero if the investor's parent company is

located in a foreign tax credit country, and equals one otherwise. The results are qualitatively very

similar to those presented in column 2, with the difference that the estimated R&D appears in this

specificationto be even more responsive to withholding tax rates. Columns 4 and 5 present

regression results for specifications that include quadratic withholding tax rate terms, which again
exhibit symptoms of multicollinesricy.

                Evidence on the behavior of foreign-owned affiliates in the United States suggests

conclusionsthat are very similar to thosethat emerge from the behavior of the foreign affiliates of

American corporations. Foreign investors in the United States pay fewer royalties, and use more

R&D-intensive operations, when facing higher tax rates on royalties paid to theft home countries.

The restricted size of the sample of investing foreign countries makes statistical inference difficult, but

the estimated coefficients indicate a responsivenessthat is somewhat greater than that for the foreign

affiliates of American corporations.




    24Unfortunately, BEA does not require foreign-owned firms in the United States to distinguish the
R&D they perform for their own use from R&D that they perform for others, so it is not possible to
estimate equations of the type reported in Table 7 for foreign investors in the United States.

7. Conclusion.

                 This paper uses informationon the behavior of the foreign affiliates of U.S. firms and

foreign-owned affihiases in the United States to estimate the relationship between technology imports

and local R&D. The idea is to use the tax treatment of royalty payments to identi& the degree   of
substitutability between these sources of technology. Evidence from the actions of American and

foreign firms indicates that R&D expenditures respond to local tax rates, and that technology imports

and local R&D are substitutes. The substitutabilityof these two sources of technology carries

numerous implications for the impact of tax policy on R&D activity, particularly when contrasted

with the complementarity that is sometimes thought to characterize their relationship.

Note: The regressions reported in Tables 8 and 9 use these variables. The first two variables
represent country-level aggregate activities of foreign-owned affiliates in the United States in 1987, as
reported in U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis (1990). The variable
(R&D/GNP) represents country R&D/GNP ratios reported by the National Science Foundation
(1991). The variable w represents the withholding tax rate imposed by the United States on royalty
payments from the United States. The variable FTC equals unity if an investor's home country taxes
worldwide income and grants foreign tax credits to its residents, and equals zero otherwise.
Observations are country-level aggregates of the behavior of all U.S-owned affiliates.
