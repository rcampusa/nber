This paper examines the employment effects of the earned income tax credit (EITC). We use a
unique dataset, created by matching administrative data from public assistance records,
unemployment insurance records, and federal tax returns for a sample of California residents. We
conduct a set of four tests to assess our ability to isolate the causal effects of the EITC on employment.
The first test is based on the intuition that if the EITC alters employment, all else being equal,
employment rates for two-or-more child families should grow relative to the employment rates of
one-child families, as credit amounts available to these groups of families diverged over the 1990s.
The second test examines whether or not people eligible for the EITC actually file tax returns and
claim it. The third test is based on the intuition that, if the EITC, and not other factors such as the
strong economy in the 1990s, is causing employment differences between families with two or more
children relative to those with one child, we should expect to see no employment differences (after
conditioning on other characteristics) between families with two children and families with three or
more children, since the EITC did not change differentially for the latter two groups. The fourth test
conditions the sample on those who do not file tax returns and again examines employment changes
in the 1990s for families with two or more children relative to families with one child.
Using fixed-effects empirical employment models estimated on a sample of single-parent families,
our coefficient estimates are consistent with the EITC having a substantial, positive effect on the
employment of families who have used or will use welfare.

                         Examining the Effect of the Earned Income Tax Credit
                        on the Labor Market Participation of Families on Welfare


         Between 1990 and 1999, real spending on the earned income tax credit (EITC) increased to $31.9

billion from $9.6 billion (in 1999 dollars). It is by far the largest cash or near-cash antipoverty policy in

the United States. Moreover, with phased-in increases enacted in 1990 and in 1993, it became the most

rapidly growing (substantial) item in the federal budget.

         Employment rates of single women with children also rose sharply over this period, and welfare

caseloads fell precipitously. Between March 1990 and March 2000, employment rates of single women

with children rose to 73.9 percent from 55.2 percent. Welfare caseloads fell to 2.3 million families from

4.1 million (though caseloads rose until 1994, when they peaked at 5.0 million families).1

         The coincident timing of these trends raises a question: did the EITC play a substantial role in the

increase in labor force participation of single women with children?2 Not surprisingly, given the important

role the EITC plays in the nation’s safety net, a number of previous studies examine this topic.3 These

papers come to a consistent conclusion: the EITC has a significant, empirically large effect on labor force

participation of single women with children.4




         1
           Employment rates and caseload numbers come from Tables No. 577 and No. 544, respectively, from
Statistical Abstract of the United States 2000.
         2
          Standard labor-leisure models unambiguously predict that EITC increases (or increases in other wage
subsidies) will increase employment among low-skilled workers.
         3
          For published work, see Dickert, Houser, and Scholz (1995); Eissa and Leibman (1996); Keane and
Moffitt (1998); Ellwood (2000); Meyer and Rosenbaum (2000, 2001); Grogger (2003); and Eissa and Hoynes
(2004). Hotz and Scholz (2003) survey EITC research.
         4
          Hotz and Scholz (2003) compute employment elasticities with respect to net income (associated with
EITC changes) from selected previous studies that range from 0.69 to 1.16. Grogger’s (2003) estimates were not
included in our earlier study, but he concludes that the EITC “may be the single most important policy measure for
explaining the decrease in welfare and the rise in work and earnings among female-headed families in recent years”
(p. 408). Eissa and Hoynes (2004) focus on the employment and hours decisions of secondary workers in married
families and find small, negative effects of the credit on work. Cancian and Levinson (2003) use data from the
National Survey of America’s Families and focus on Wisconsin’s supplemental EITC for families with three or
more children. Unlike other studies on the topic, they do not find statistically significant EITC employment effects.
                                                         2

         At least three concerns arise with previous work examining the EITC’s employment effects. The

identification strategy in most papers is to compare employment changes of groups eligible for the EITC

(generally single mothers) with employment changes of groups ineligible for the EITC (generally single

women without children) before and after EITC increases.5 But other factors changed over the periods in

which the EITC increased, and these other factors might have different employment effects for women

with and without children. Many states, for example, made extensive changes to welfare both before and

after the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) abolished AFDC

in 1996. And aggregate GDP increased 120 consecutive months beginning in March 1991, resulting in the

longest economic expansion in U.S. history.

         A second issue arises with the difference-in-difference approach: namely, that the composition of

the groups may change over time. There are a priori reasons to be concerned about potential

compositional bias in these repeated cross-sectional studies.6 Between 1984 and 1996, for example, the

period examined in Meyer and Rosenbaum (2001), the number of single mothers in the Current

Population Survey (CPS) increased 30.5 percent, to 7.7 million families from 5.9 million families.7 The

difference-in-difference identification strategy will be biased in indeterminate directions if employment

propensities of the sample changed over time after accounting for observed characteristics (Heckman,

1996).



         5
           Keane and Moffitt (1998) estimate utility function parameters of households that are consistent with
participation decisions in multiple welfare programs, accounting for the precise budget sets that occur in the 1984
SIPP. Dickert, Houser, and Scholz (1995) do not observe EITC variation in their cross-sectional study and
consequently they infer the potential effects of the EITC from observing the correlation between employment and
differences in the return to work across states. These employment differences, however, may be due to unobserved
state-specific factors unrelated to differences in the return to work generated by the tax and transfer systems.
         6
         All previous studies use repeated cross-sectional data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the
Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) except for Cancian and Levinson (2003).
         7
          As discussed in Hotz and Scholz (2002), the ratio of AFDC recipients reported in the CPS to
administrative counts of recipients fell from 86.7 percent in 1990 to 79.6 percent in 1996. The ratio of AFDC dollars
to administrative totals was 78.4 percent in the 1984 CPS and 67.7 percent by 1996. By all accounts the SIPP and
CPS are of high quality, but these trends raise a concern about the ability of studies using the CPS or SIPP to
accurately characterize the tax and transfer environment facing low-income families.
                                                           3

        Third, all previous EITC employment studies have been indirect in the sense that they have

inferred the EITC’s effects based on the relationship between employment and EITC policy changes. But

if EITC changes cause employment changes, we should see similar changes in EITC claims. Because of

data limitations, no previous study has directly examined EITC claiming and employment.

        This paper addresses these and other concerns. We use data only from California to mitigate the

influence of changes in welfare and other social policies on employment and to better account for local

labor market conditions.8 Using data with county identifiers, we are able to include considerably more

detailed covariates to proxy for local labor market conditions than have previous studies.9 Moreover,

California also made relatively modest changes to AFDC and TANF compared to other states in the

1990s. We nevertheless also condition on several features of the county-administered welfare programs in

California.

        Ours is also the first EITC employment study to use longitudinal data, which allow us to account

for unobserved, household-specific, time-invariant factors that affect employment. Longitudinal data also

help us avoid bias due to (unobserved) changes in the composition of “treatment” and “comparison”

groups in repeated cross-sectional studies.

        At the core of our empirical analysis is a set of four tests that we use to assess the causal effects

of the EITC on employment. The first test examines employment using a different identification strategy

than most previous studies that typically compare employment rates of women with children to other

groups. Beginning in 1991, the maximum EITC available to families with two or more children increased

relative to the EITC available for one-child families. While the difference in the maximum credit by

number of children was initially modest, starting in 1994, as a result of changes in the EITC included in


        8
            See Ellwood (2000) for more on these issues.
        9
         Bartik and Eberts (1999) criticize studies that include only unemployment rates to account for labor
market conditions, writing, the “… unemployment rate by itself may be a woefully incomplete measure of economic
conditions affecting potential welfare recipients.” They argue that more textured measures of the economic
environment facing welfare families matter in understanding caseload changes.
                                                          4

the 1993 federal budget act, this differential increased substantially, the maximum credit rising from $77

in 1993 to $490 in 1993 to $1,404 in 1996 (see Table 1). If the EITC alters employment, all else being

equal, employment rates for families with two or more children should grow relative to the employment

rates of families with one child, as credit amounts available to these groups of families diverge.10 Our

empirical approach formalizes this strategy as a “difference-in-difference” estimator, controlling for

covariates and household-specific fixed effects, to identify the effects of the EITC on employment.

         The second test makes use of a unique match of administrative data on welfare receipt,

unemployment records, and the federal tax returns filed by California residents, which allow us to

examine directly the employment and EITC-claiming behavior of low-income families. No previous

EITC employment study has used data on whether or not people eligible for the EITC actually file tax

returns and claim it. If the employment patterns previous studies attribute to the EITC are, in fact, caused

by the credit, those who are affected by the credit should file and claim it.

         If the EITC, and not other factors such as the strong economy in the 1990s, is causing

employment differences between families with two or more children relative to those with one child, we

should expect to see no employment differences (after conditioning on other characteristics) between

families with two children and families with three or more children, since the EITC did not change

differentially for the latter two groups. Our third test examines this proposition.

Our fourth test conditions the sample on those who do not file tax returns, and again examines

employment changes in the 1990s for families with two or more children relative to families with one

child. If the EITC is the factor causing employment changes in the data, we would expect to see no




         10
            In a sensitivity analysis section, Meyer and Rosenbaum (2001) examine differences in labor market
effects generated by the EITC for families with two or more children relative to families with one child, as is done in
our paper. They find much smaller EITC effects in this alternative specification and the coefficients are insignificant
in their larger, CPS Outgoing Rotation Group sample. Cancian and Levinson (2003) use a similar approach and find
insignificant EITC employment effects.
                                                      5

differential employment changes for the two groups (again, after conditioning on other characteristics)

among those not filing tax returns (and hence not claiming the credit).

        Using fixed-effects empirical employment models estimated on a sample of single-parent

families, our coefficient estimates are consistent with the EITC having a substantial, positive effect on the

employment of families who have or will use welfare. Patterns of EITC claiming mirror the employment

patterns. Moreover, the differential employment responses occur only for families with two or more

children relative to one child, and not for families with three or more children relative to families with

exactly two children. Finally, there is no differential expansion of employment for families with two or

more children relative to one-child families for those who do not file tax returns. If factors other than the

EITC were driving the employment patterns observed in the data, it is unlikely that they would only affect

those who file tax returns and not affect the employment of families with three or more children relative

to families with two children.

        We also discuss sensitivity analyses that show our results are robust to alternative modeling

choices. The most striking aspect of the sensitivity analysis, however, is that the EITC has no discernible

effect on employment for AFDC-UP (two-parent) families.

        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 1 we describe the structure and

history of the EITC, the various data sources we use and how we construct our analysis sample of

households who were on welfare in California for some period of time during 1990s. In Section 2 we

present unadjusted difference-in-difference estimates of the annual effects of the EITC on employment

rates and rates of EITC claiming for the period 1992–2000. In Section 3 we present refined estimates for

both of these outcomes using multivariate regression methods. In Section 4 we present the results for the

four tests described above as well as the results of several additional sensitivity analyses we conducted.

We conclude the paper with a summary of our findings and a discussion of how they compare with those

found in previous studies.

1.       THE EITC AND CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE DATA

         In 1999, taxpayers with two or more children could receive an EITC of 40 percent of income up

to $9,540, for a maximum credit of $3,816. Taxpayers (with two or more children) with earnings between

$9,540 and $12,460 receive the maximum credit. Their credit is reduced by 21.06 percent of earnings

between $12,460 and $30,585. Table 1 shows the complete evolution of income eligibility thresholds,

credit rates, and phase-out (or implicit tax) rates.

         To receive the credit, taxpayers file their regular tax return and fill out the six-line Schedule EIC

that gathers information about qualifying children. The EITC is refundable, meaning that the Treasury

Department pays it out regardless of whether the taxpayer has any federal income tax liability. There are

several basic tests for EITC eligibility. The taxpayer’s earned income and adjusted gross income must be

below a threshold that varies by year and by family size. To receive the credit available to families with

children,11 the qualifying child must be younger than 19, younger than 24 if a full-time student, or any age

if totally disabled. The claimant must be the parent, the grandparent, or foster parent of the child.12 The

qualifying child must live with the taxpayer at least six months during the year.

         A key development for the purposes of this paper was put in place as part of the 1990 EITC

expansions. After 1990, for the first time, families with two or more children were able to receive a larger

EITC than they could if they had only one child. The difference through 1993, however, never exceeded

$77. As part of the 1993 EITC expansion, the differences became much larger: the maximum difference

was $490 in 1994, $1,016 in 1995, and $1,404 in 1996 (and indexed for inflation thereafter). As noted in

the introduction, if the EITC alters employment, all else being equal, employment rates for two-or-more-




         11
          A small credit available for childless taxpayers between the ages 24 in 65 with very low incomes was
added in 1994. The credit rate for these taxpayers is 7.65 percent and the maximum credit in 1999 is $347.
         12
          Until late 1999, a foster child was any child for whom the claimant cared for “as if the child is his or her
own.” Now the caring stipulation still holds, but the child must also be placed in the home by an authorized
placement agency.

child families should grow relative to the employment rates of one-child families starting in 1994, as

credit amounts available to these groups of families diverge.

        For those out of the labor market, the EITC provides an unambiguous, positive incentive to work.

We focus on this feature of the credit in this paper.13


1.1     The Core Administrative Data Sources

        California’s Medi-Cal Eligibility Data System (MEDS) provides information on program

participation and demographic characteristics of participants in Medi-Cal, the California state Medicaid

program, and AFDC/CalWORKS, the California state welfare program.14 MEDS also provides AFDC

participation histories of individuals in our samples starting in 1986.

        We measure labor force participation using quarterly data from 1991 through 2000 on

employment (and earnings) from the California Employment Development Department (EDD) Base

Wage Files. The EDD Base Wage File contains employer-reported taxable wage payments for jobs

covered by unemployment insurance (UI) and disability insurance (DI).15 Hotz and Scholz (2002) survey

studies that examine the accuracy and coverage of unemployment insurance data for the low-income

population. In brief, UI data exclude some groups of workers, such as the self-employed, military, federal

employees, and independent contractors. Nevertheless, employment rates derived from UI data appear to

be similar to those that result from survey data. We expect UI-based employment rates to be lower

because of coverage problems with flexible workers and independent contractors. But surveys suffer from

nonresponse, so undercounts in both data sources typically appear to be similar in practice.


        13
             See Hotz and Scholz (2003) for a summary of papers examining the effects of the EITC on hours of work.
        14
           More generally, the MEDS is a statewide administrative system that contains information on monthly
participation in the state’s Medicaid program (Medi-Cal), AFDC/TANF programs, as well as the Food Stamp, SSI,
and California’s General Assistance (GA) programs. MEDS data are used by the Department of Health and Human
Services for quality control analyses and are thought to be high quality for the welfare and Medicaid populations.
        15
          The file generally includes individuals paid cash wages of more than $100 in a calendar quarter, and
domestic workers paid cash wages more than $750 in a calendar quarter.

         To examine tax filing and EITC claiming, we use data from federal tax returns filed by

households in the MEDs data for the years 1991 through 2000.16


1.2      Sampling

         Our core data come from a sample of all assistance units ever on welfare in California between

1987 and 2000, drawn by scholars at RAND from the statewide MEDS data. The number of California

welfare recipients is very large, so the sample was drawn to maintain approximately equal numbers of

observations in each county (with every observation included in smaller counties). Sampling is based on

the county in which recipients are first observed receiving cash assistance, and time-invariant sampling

weights are applied to each person. Approximately 50 percent of all adults ever on welfare over this

period are included in the baseline RAND sample.17 We start with the RAND sample because it was

linked to employment data beginning in 1991 from the California unemployment insurance system.18

         Sampling refinements are invariably needed when working with administrative data. We drop

roughly 6 percent of households in which no adult is a member of the AFDC assistance unit, since we do

not have earnings and demographic information on the potential EITC claimant.19 We drop 8.4 percent of

households that have three or more adults in AFDC-UP (two-parent) cases or have two or more adults in

AFDC-FG (one-parent) cases at the time of sampling because we are unable to construct useful decision

rules about which adult can claim a child for purposes of the EITC. We also exclude a small number of


         16
           All tax data are processed at the California Franchise Tax Board, where strict procedures are followed
(such as presenting data only in grouped format and removing all identifying information) to ensure compliance
with tax privacy laws.
         17
           The original RAND sample was intended to be a 17 percent sample of adults and children on welfare. But
once a person was drawn into the RAND sample, all people in all of the sampled person’s cases were included. The
resulting sample reflects roughly (depending on the year) 50 percent of all adults ever on welfare.
         18
          Statewide unemployment insurance data from early in the analysis period was destroyed sometime in the
1990s, making the RAND sample an essential starting point for the analysis.
         19
           We define a child as being 18 years old or younger throughout the year. This age limit corresponds to the
age of a qualifying child for EITC purposes. These child-only cases occur when the children are eligible for AFDC
but the adults who live with the children are ineligible.
                                                     10

cases in which we were unable to determine the date at which they entered the sample, in which adults

were missing a birth date, in which the gender or race/ethnicity of the adults were missing, and in which

no children were present in the case. Overall, we are left with 626,700 usable cases, or 82.5 percent of the

original RAND sample.

        We construct two data sets from this set of usable cases. To mimic the data used in previous

EITC studies, we construct a set of annual cross-sectional samples for the years 1991–2000. We also

construct a panel of annual data for the cases in the RAND sample.

        In principle, we could construct a panel of annual data for 1991 through 2000 for each case in the

RAND sample, since, as noted above, we have annual employment data from UI Base Wage records and

annual data on tax filing and EITC claiming from federal tax returns. Unfortunately, the MEDS data are

our only source for annual information on the number and ages of children when households do not file

tax returns, and households are only in MEDS when they receive welfare. Our identification strategy is

predicated on examining employment differences between families with one and with two or more

children under the age of 18.

        Given that we do not have comprehensive information on the number of children in the

household (and their ages) for all of the years in our data, we use the following strategy to construct our

longitudinal data set. For each case in the (usable) RAND sample, we draw at random a “base year” from

the years that the case was on welfare during the period 1991–2000. Using this base year, we construct a

case’s panel using the J years immediately preceding the base year, the base year, and the K years

immediately following the base year. Note that depending on the base year that is drawn and the values

for J and K, we can end up with “unbalanced” panels, given that we do not have data for years prior to

1991 or after 2000.

        The choice of the lengths of these “lags” and “leads” (for J and K) balances three considerations.

First, the longer the time span before and after the base year, the greater the chance we will make errors in

assessing the number of children in the family. We know the ages of children as of the base year so we
                                                           11

can precisely determine their date of birth. We do not observe births occurring after the base year, at least

not for cases that do not continue on welfare. Therefore, information on the number (and ages) of children

in the household will likely be more accurate using data prior to the base year than using data after the

base year. Second, all else being equal, having longer panels means we have more data, which will

increase the precision of our estimates. Third, with fixed-effect models of employment or EITC claiming,

households that change status from one child to two or more children or vice versa identify the

coefficients of interest. This status changes for two reasons in our sample: children are born, or their age

exceeds the EITC qualifying child age limit. Given the birth dates of children born as of the base year, we

can determine births in years prior to the base year. We observe aging out as we examine employment in

years following the base year.

        In extensive analyses of our data using different lengths of lags (values for J) and leads (values

for K), we found that households with children that are too old to be used as EITC qualifying children

have substantially different observable characteristics than the typical (or mean) household on welfare in

California.20 In particular, they are older, have more children, have different racial and ethnic

composition, and have different earnings. Given these differences in observable characteristics, we think

it is likely that there also are substantial unobserved differences. In contrast, families with children born in

the four years prior to the base year are indistinguishable (besides having a young child) from all families

on welfare.

        To balance the above considerations and given the findings from our analyses of the properties of

panels with varying lag and lead lengths, we utilize four-year panels that include the three years prior to

the base year (J = 3) and the base year and no years after the base year (K = 0). Again, we note that the

panels for a given case can be shorter than four years if the base year drawn (at random) for a case was

1991, 1992, or 1993.


        20
             These analyses are available from the authors on request.

        For the (repeated) cross-sectional data set used in the analyses below, we used the data for the

year following the randomly drawn base year (again, between 1991 and 2000) for each case in the RAND

sample. This approach ensures that we have the required information on the ages and number of children

for the years in which we examine households’ employment and EITC claiming behavior. Furthermore,

our approach avoids the use of data that over samples long-term welfare recipients, which might distort

our analyses of employment and EITC claiming behavior.

        For most of the analysis, we focus on AFDC-FG (single-parent) cases, which account for 84.1

percent of the total cases (or 527,125). Single parents are by far the largest share of the welfare population

and have considerably lower employment rates than two-parent families, and hence are more likely to be

affected by the EITC. We conduct sensitivity analyses using the AFDC-UP (two-parent) cases.

        Appendix Tables 1a and 1b show the weighted characteristics of the primary cross-sectional

(Table 1a) and longitudinal analysis samples (Table 1b). Overall, average employment rates were around

48 percent. In detail not shown in the table, employment rates in the annual cross-sectional samples

increase from 36.3 percent in 1991 to 65.4 percent in 2000. Recall that every household in these cross-

sectional samples was on welfare in the year prior to when we record employment. Thus, the economy,

the EITC, welfare reform, or other factors appear to have greatly increased employment of welfare

recipients over the period examined. The racial and ethnic characteristics of the population changed over

time as well—the proportion of cases headed by a Hispanic increased 14 percentage points and the

proportion of cases headed by a black increased 3 percentage points, while the proportion of white

families fell by roughly 16 percentage points. Other features of the caseload remained roughly constant

over time. More than half the cases in the sample have two or more children, while roughly 30 percent

have exactly two children.

2.       EMPLOYMENT RATES AND EITC CLAIMING BY FAMILY SIZE AND YEAR IN THE
         CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS SAMPLE

         In this section, we present unadjusted (for covariates) difference-in-difference estimates of

household (adult) employment and EITC claiming. Let Yict denote an outcome variable for the adults in

the ith household from county c in (calendar) year t. In our case, there are two outcome variables, whether

one or more adults in a household are employed in the labor market (Empict) and whether a household

files a tax return and claims the EITC (ClaimEITCitc), where these two outcomes are defined as follows:

               ⎧1, if at least 1 adult in i th household in county c is employed in year t
      Empict = ⎨                                                                                                 (1)
               ⎩0, otherwise


                ⎧1, if i th household in county c files tax return and claims EITC in year t
 ClaimEITCict = ⎨                                                                                                (2)
                ⎩0, otherwise


         As noted earlier, we use the differential change in the EITC by family size before and after 1994

to identify the EITC’s employment effect and effect on EITC claiming. In particular, we use the following

“difference-in-difference” estimator:

                                     β s* ≡ (Yt ′′2+ − Yt ′′1 ) − (Yt ′2+ − Yt ′1 ) ,                            (3)



for t ′′ ≥ 1994 > t ′ , where Ys1 is the mean outcome in year s for households that had only one child, and

Ys 2+ is the corresponding mean for households that had two or more children.21 Absent cohort, welfare

entry, or other sample compositional effects—a major qualification that we address in the following




         21
           Each year we include a household in the sample if an adult (defined as being 18 or older) and at least one
child (defined as being under 18) are present. Based on birth dates, we compute ages of household members each
analysis year and reclassify a household appropriately. For example, consider a woman with two children, born in
1992 and 1994. Prior to 1992, we drop this household since no children existed. We classify the household as having
a single child from 1992 to 1994 and as having two children after that. If the panel were longer, in 2011 the eldest
child would be too old and the household would revert to a one-child classification.
                                                          14

sections—we expect, if the EITC stimulates employment and/or rates of EITC claiming, to see higher

rates of these outcomes for two-plus child families relative to one-child families as the EITC differential

between the two types of families begins to increase substantially in 1994.22

        We first present estimates for employment rates in Table 2a. The “Diff-in-Diff” column of Table

2a suggests that the EITC expansion beginning in 1994 may have had a significant, positive effect on the

employment rates, though if the EITC is the causal mechanism, either its influence is occurring with a

considerable lag or other factors not accounted for in the table mask the EITC’s effect. In particular,

employment rates for both one-child families and for families with two or more children are steady in the

1991–93 base period and then begin to rise sharply in 1994. However, the employment increases for

families with one child and for families with two or more children are equivalent until 1997, the year after

the EITC changes are fully phased in. The differences in employment rates for families with two or more

children and one-child families are large and highly statistically significant beginning in 1998. Of course,

these patterns may be the result of other factors changing over this period, including the economy, the

welfare system, and compositional issues related to entry and exit of our sample.

        A unique feature of our analysis is having access to the individual tax returns household file.

Table 2b shows a similar set of difference-in-difference calculations where the outcome is filing a tax

return and claiming the EITC. The temporal pattern of EITC claiming is similar to the pattern for

employment. Households with two or more children are between 2 and 2.5 percentage points less likely to

claim the EITC from 1991 through 1995. This differential starts narrowing in 1996 and by 2000 families

with two or more children are 4.2 percentage points more likely to claim the EITC. As with the

employment estimates, many things could account for the patterns of EITC filing that we observe.

        We refine our analysis of employment and claiming the EITC in the next section.



        22
             Recall that the full $1,404 maximum differential in the EITC by number of children does not occur until
1996.

3.        MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF EMPLOYMENT AND EITC CLAIMING

          The unadjusted difference-in-difference estimates presented in Tables 2a and 2b may not isolate

the effects of the EITC on employment or EITC claiming for at least three related reasons. The first is that

the number of children a household has may have a separate influence on these outcomes over and above

the influence of the EITC. Second, and related to the first, economic models of household time allocation

and fertility decisions imply that the number of children (and their age composition) and employment

outcomes are jointly determined by observable and possibly unobservable factors that determine

household’s tastes, home and market productivity, etc.23 Third, there are potentially other policy changes,

most importantly changes in welfare policy, that occurred around the time of the EITC expansion in the

1990s that may have affected the employment decisions of households with differing numbers of

children. In an attempt to account for factors that may compromise the validity of the unadjusted EITC

effect estimates in Tables 2a and 2b, we also present several alternative sets of “adjusted” difference-in-

difference estimates using regression methods.

          The first set of adjustments is based on the following regression function:

indicators of county-level labor market conditions; County_mict is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the ith

         The parameters, βs, in (4) denote year-specific differential effects of having two or more children

on the outcome and, thus, are the adjusted (for covariates) version of the unadjusted difference-in-

difference estimator, ( β s* ), defined in (3) and for which estimates are presented in Tables 2a and 2b.

Estimates of these and the other parameters in (4) can be obtained by estimating (4) by ordinary least

squares (OLS), using the repeated cross-sectional data described in Section 1.2.

         Using the longitudinal data, we also estimate a generalization of the regression specification in

(4), modifying it to allow for household-specific fixed effects as follows:

         The time-invariant households variables (Xic) are not included in (5) as these factors will be

absorbed by the φis. In essence, controlling for the φis allows us to account for all time-invariant

characteristics of the household, such as educational attainment, work readiness, motivation, etc., that

might affect household employment decisions and the likelihood of filing a tax return and claiming the

EITC.

         We note that both of the outcomes we analyze, Emp and ClaimEITC, are dichotomous dependent

variables so that the specifications in (4) and (5) characterize linear probability models.24 In both of these

specifications, while we assume that εict is independent across households, we do adjust the standard

errors on the regression coefficients for correlations within a household across time.

         Two crucial assumptions are needed for our empirical model to be sensible. First, any

independent effects on employment of being in the “treatment” or “control” groups do not vary

temporally. Put differently, one-child and multi-child families (the building blocks of the treatment and

control groups) respond identically to changes in economic conditions and welfare policies over the

period being analyzed after conditioning on other characteristics.25 We include an extensive set of

covariates to increase the likelihood that this condition holds, and examine the robustness of our results in

longitudinal and cross-sectional samples. Our four-part test of employment effects also addresses this

concern. Second, we assume that the distribution of employment propensities (conditional on covariates)

for the populations of one-child and multi-child families remain stable before and after the EITC

expansion. Our longitudinal analysis mitigates, if not eliminates, this potential problem, at least relative to

papers in the existing literature.26

         We now briefly describe the actual variables that compose the vectors Xic, Wct, and Lct included in

regression specifications (4) and (5).




         24
           We present fixed effect linear probability results in our longitudinal analyses since they are particularly
easy to interpret and they are computationally less demanding given our large samples than panel logits or
alternative approaches.
         25
           See Heckman and Robb (1985) and Moffitt and Wilhelm (2000) for further details on difference-in-
difference estimators.
         26
           With repeated cross-sectional data, maintaining the second assumption is more problematic. It requires
the distribution of employment propensities (conditional on covariates) for the populations of childless, one-child,
and multi-child single women to remain stable over the period being analyzed. To the extent that different groups of
households enter the sample before and after the intervention and these groups differ, even if only with respect to
their time-invariant employment propensities, the assumption is unlikely to hold with repeated cross-sectional data.

3.1      Other Influences of Children and Household Characteristics

         Employment rates tend to increase as people and children age. We include a detailed set of

covariates to account for the composition and characteristics of the family. We include 18 variables

counting the number of children at each age, from 0 to 17, in the household in the particular analysis year.

We also include a set of dummy variables corresponding to the number of children in the household in

each year. In empirical specifications that exclude household fixed effects, we also include indicator

variables for female, Hispanic, black, Asian, or mixed or other races or ethnicities (leaving whites as the

excluded category). We also include a variable for the mean age of adults in the household.


3.2      Influences of California’s Welfare Programs

         Beginning in October 1992, California altered its AFDC program, under a series of waivers

granted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.27 Judged by the standards of welfare

experimentation and reform elsewhere, the changes were fairly modest. The most important change was

to reduce the maximum amount of AFDC cash aid by 15 percent.28 Static models of labor supply, under

usual assumptions about income and substitution effects, predict that the combination of the reduction in

the guaranteed levels of AFDC benefits and other features of the package will tend to increase

employment. Evaluations of California’s welfare changes, however, suggest the effects of the changes

(collectively known as “California Work Pays”) were modest (Becerra et al., 1998; Hotz, Mullin, and



         27
          Hotz, Mullin, and Scholz (2002a, 2002b) evaluate the effects of these changes on employment, income,
and welfare use.
         28
           The other changes were also designed to encourage employment. These changes (a) eliminated the 100
hour (per month) work limitation once a household started receiving AFDC-UP; (b) eliminated the time limit for the
$30 and 1/3 income disregard; (c) encouraged pregnant teens and teen parents to stay in or return to school by
providing child care, transportation, and other assistance, and created disincentives for bad grades or for dropping out
of school; (d) raised (modestly) asset limits for families once they start receiving benefits; (e) allowed AFDC-eligible
persons to decline an AFDC cash grant, but still receive Medi-Cal (the Medicaid program in California) and child care
assistance; and (f) made California’s Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) training program and the Greater
Avenues for Independence (GAIN) program more work-oriented.

Scholz, 2002a, 2002b).29 Consequently, welfare changes seem an unlikely candidate for explaining

substantial changes in employment among California’s welfare population.

         Nevertheless, we include in the empirical model a measure summarizing county-level enrollments

as a percentage of each county’s AFDC caseload in California’s welfare-to-work program, Greater

Avenues for Independence (GAIN). Counties could implement different GAIN programs and were free to

change them over this period.30

         In the analysis of the repeated cross-sectional data, we also include a set of indicator variables for

each entry cohort onto welfare. These control for differences in labor force participation associated with

the passage of time after initial AFDC receipt. They also help account for differences in entry cohorts

across years that may be related to economic conditions. These indicator variables drop out of the

longitudinal analyses, since the household-specific fixed effect accounts for time-invariant characteristics

of households.

         Low-income households in California (and elsewhere) are potentially eligible for other social

assistance programs that may affect their decisions to work. These other programs, such as Medi-Cal,

Food Stamps, and SSI, did not change much or at all over this period. They also generally did not vary

across California’s 58 counties. Thus, we do not attempt to control for the effects of other programs on

labor force participation, beyond including year dummies in the analysis.31

intake or recertification interviews in 1993 and 1994. Their evidence suggests little was done to convey the broad
message of work pays to clients. They write, “Only one office had a Work Pays poster within sight of clients. Two
workers were observed to have Work Pays buttons. When asked about the button, however, one of the two reported
that she had obtained it from her union—as part of a campaign to make ‘work pay’ for county employees” (p. 12).

            In the empirical models using cross sectional data we also include a full set of county dummies. The
results are also unaffected by including a full set of county-by-year interaction variables, which account for county-
specific trends.

        In the sensitivity analysis, we add a variable showing county-level spending by year in state-

provided child care assistance. Public child care expenditures were small in California in the early 1990s,

but increased sharply late in the decade (Marrufo, O’Brien-Strain, and Oliver, 2003). These expenditures

could influence employment patterns, so we control for them to help ensure that our results are not driven

primarily by changes in child care spending.


3.3     Influences of Local Labor Market Conditions

        Some of the changes in welfare caseloads and employment rates of low-skilled workers during

the 1990s may be attributable to changes in labor market conditions. To account for the role of the

economy, we examine several labor market characteristics, including the overall employment rate in the

58 California counties; the share of employment in manufacturing, service, and retail trade (the

employment share in government services is the excluded category); income per worker in each county,

and income per worker in each sector in the county (again, excluding government services).

        There is substantial cross-county variation in local economic conditions across California. We

summarize these trends and differences by graphing the annual employment to population ratios across

California regions in Figure 1.32 Employment-to-population ratios are less than 55 percent in the northern

and mountain counties of California (they are less than 35 percent in Calaveras County), whereas they

exceed 75 percent by the late 1990s in the Bay Area. Statewide, average county-level employment-to-

population ratios fell from 62 percent to 61 percent during the recession early in the decade and increased

to 68 percent by 2000.

        Figure 2 presents similar statistics, showing annual real earnings (in $1,000s of 1992/93 dollars)

per service sector worker across California regions. Average annual earnings in the mountain and



        32
          Similar figures for disaggregated sectors are available on request. These data were obtained from the
website of the Labor Market Information Division (LMID) of the State of California’s Economic Development
Department.
                                                    23

northern counties ranged from $20,700 to $25,000, but range from $37,100 to $52,300 in the Bay Area.

Statewide average annual earnings range between $33,200 and $38,900. These figures document the

unusually large variation in economic conditions across California counties.

        As mentioned above, we also include indicator variables for years in our empirical model to

account for aggregate business-cycle effects. Descriptive statistics are given in Appendix Tables 1a and

1b for the variables that we use in the X, L, and W vectors when estimating regression models (4) and (5).


4.      IDENTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF THE EITC

        Our first test examines employment differences between families with two or more children

relative to one-child families, using two different empirical models: a fixed-effects model with additional

time-varying household and county-level covariates and a (repeated) cross-sectional model with time-

varying and invariant covariates. If the EITC increases employment, we expect to see employment for

families with two or more children rise relative to the employment of one-child families after 1993.

        If the EITC causes differential employment increases, families should file tax returns and claim

the EITC. Our second test examines this intuition by estimating fixed-effects and repeated cross-sectional

empirical models of households claiming the EITC.

        Our identification strategy implies that if the EITC affects employment and we have accounted

suitably for other factors affecting employment, employment rates should increase for families with two

or more children relative to one-child families. But employment rates of families with three or more

children should not differ from those with exactly two children because the EITC expansions treat these

groups identically. To construct our third test, we define a new dummy variable that identifies households

with exactly two children and include that, interacted with year dummies, in the longitudinal empirical

model (5). The two-child dummy variable is defined as:

                                               ⎧0, if Kidsit < 2 or Kidsit ≥ 3
                    [ 2+ Kidsit − 3+ Kidsit ] = ⎨      1, if Kidsit = 2
                                                                               .

         Our hypothesis is that the coefficients on this dummy variable interacted with year dummies

should be insignificant individually and jointly for the years following the differential EITC expansion by

family size.33 The idea is that if factors unrelated to the EITC are causing the differential employment

changes by family size, they would also result in differences between families with two children and three

or more children (and 22 percent of the sample has three or more children). In this way, the specification

check helps us distinguish EITC changes, which only affect relative employment of families with one and

two or more children, from other potential explanations.

         If the EITC causes differential employment increases, we would expect them to be present only

for families who file tax returns. Our fourth test examines this intuition by conditioning the sample of

households who do not file returns: we do not expect to see employment increase over time for families

with two or more children relative to one-child families in this alternative sample.34


4.1      Tests 1 and 2: Multivariate Model Estimates of Employment and EITC Claiming

         Table 3 presents results for our repeated cross-section and fixed-effects regression specifications.

(All specifications have a similar structure, though specifications without household fixed effects include

additional covariates, as noted above. Complete results are available on request.) The dependent variable

indicates whether or not the adult in the household participated in the labor market (i.e., had positive EDD

earnings) during the year. In the repeated cross-sectional models (estimated with OLS methods),


         33
          The difference-in-difference estimate for families with two children relative to one-child families is the
sum of the coefficients on the “ [2 + Kidsit × Year _ st ] ” and “ ⎣⎡2+ Kidsit − 3+ Kidsit ⎦⎤× Year _ st ” terms. The
difference-in-difference estimate for families with three or more children relative to one-child families is the
coefficients on the “ [2 + Kidsit × Year _ st ] ” terms. It follows that the test of whether there is a difference between
the effects for families with two children relative to the effects for families with three or more children is whether
the “ ⎡⎣2+ Kidsit − 3+ Kidsit ⎤⎦× Year _ st ” term is zero for each year and whether they are jointly equal to zero across
years.
         34
           The fourth test, of course, conditions the sample on an endogenous variable, tax filing. We nevertheless
think the test is informative in the sense that if some spurious factor (and not the EITC) were generating the
empirical patterns found in the first three tests, we would expect the spurious factor to also affect the employment of
households not filing tax returns.
                                                       27

employment is measured in the year following the date of sampling (which occurs in the fourth quarter of

the previous year). Each OLS regression includes an extensive set of covariates, shown in Appendix

Table 1a. The disadvantage of the repeated cross-sectional specification is that it does not include the

household-specific effects. The advantage is that there are likely to be fewer errors in measuring the

number and ages of children in the household and other household characteristics. We prefer the fixed-

effects estimates, but finding results consistent with the longitudinal analysis with the repeated cross-

sectional data would strengthen our interpretation.

        The results for the first test mirror the unconditional employment estimates given in Table 2a.

Reading on the right-hand side of the table (the fixed-effects estimates), the estimates on the variables “2+

Kids in Yr” for Yr = 1994,…,2000, show that employment rates for those with two or more children are

statistically indistinguishable from the employment rates of one-child families in 1994 and 1995,

conditioning on the fixed effects and other covariates. Employment rates for families with two or more

children are 1.2 percentage points higher in 1996, 2.6 percentage points higher in 1997, 3.2 percentage

points higher in 1998, 3.4 percentage points higher in 1999, and 3.0 percentage points higher in 2000,

relative to employment rates for one-child families.

        The repeated cross-sectional results in Table 3 are similar to the previous results, though they

provide somewhat weaker evidence of positive EITC employment effects. Employment for families with

two or more children increases significantly in 1998 through 2000 relative to employment of families

with one child.

        Results for the second test are given in Table 4, which shows repeated cross-sectional OLS and

panel data, fixed-effects specification estimates of EITC claiming. The estimates from both models mirror

the employment results from Table 3. EITC claiming by families with two or more children is

insignificantly different from EITC claiming by one-child families in 1994 and 1995. Between 1996 and

2000 families with two or more children are significantly more likely to claim the EITC than are families

with one child (the fixed-effects estimates are only marginally significant in 2000 and the repeated cross-
                                                       28

sectional estimates are insignificant in 1997). If the EITC is responsible for the employment differentials

between families with two or more children compared to one-child families, the Table 4 estimates reflect

the pattern of EITC claiming we would expect to see.

          The empirical models in Tables 3 and 4 include a number of additional correlates of employment

and EITC claiming (complete results are available on request). There are very strong year effects, with

employment increasing by 24 percentage points from its low point in 1993 to its high point in 2000. EITC

claiming increases by 35 percentage points between 1992 and 2000. As shown in Table 1, the EITC

increased substantially over the 1990s, both in levels (for all families with children) as well as increasing

disproportionately for larger families (which is the focus of this paper). Along with the broad EITC

expansion, groups around the country engaged in considerable outreach.35 The fact that EITC claiming

increased more rapidly than employment suggests that the combination of larger potential EITC payments

along with outreach efforts induced more households, especially those with positive earnings, to claim the

credit.

          The family size variables have opposite effects on employment and EITC claiming. Employment

increases steadily with the age of the children. Relative to the excluded category of 18-year-old children,

households with a child under 2 are 9 to 16 percentage points less likely to work. GAIN enrollments

appear to increase employment and EITC claiming, but the economic magnitude of the estimated

correlation is small. Conditioning on other covariates, counties with 100 percent of their caseload enrolled

in GAIN have employment rates (EITC claiming rates) 1.6 (2.3) percentage points higher than counties

where nobody enrolled in GAIN.




          35
          The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, for example, has had a long-standing national EITC outreach
campaign. For a recent example, see http://www.cbpp.org/eic2005/. There are many other examples from every part
of the country.

         Employment and EITC claiming are affected symmetrically by local labor market conditions.

Both, not surprisingly, are positively correlated with county employment-to-population ratios and with

the average earnings per worker in the county of residence. Residents of counties with high average

manufacturing sector earnings have low employment and EITC claiming rates, suggesting that

manufacturing companies are not primary employers of households in our sample.


4.2      Tests 3 and 4: Employment Effects by Family Size and for Nonfilers

         The third test focuses on whether the differential employment trends observed in the data for one

and two-or-more child families also hold for families with three or more children compared to two-child

families. If the employment patterns are different for larger families, then factor other than the EITC

likely are causing the employment differences documented in Table 3.

         Column (1) in Table 5a repeats the fixed-effects estimates from Table 3. Column (2) shows the

crucial “specification check” estimates. The coefficients on the [2+ Kids − 3+ Kids in Yr] variables in

column (2) are individually insignificant. Moreover, the bottom of the table reports the F-test, showing

they are jointly insignificant. Thus, if something other than the EITC is causing employment rates of

families with two or more children to increase by 3 percentage points relative to employment rates of one-

child families in the second half of the 1990s, it must not differentially affect families with three or more

children relative to two-child families. Table 5b shows similar patterns for EITC claiming.

         In the fourth test, we restrict the sample to households that do not file tax returns. The sample is

sizable, with 564,612 observations.36 Moreover, while these households do not file tax returns, a

substantial fraction are employed on average in any given year (in the overall sample around 45 percent

are employed). The results for this test are given in column (3) of Table 5a. There are no employment



         36
           Of course in the fixed-effects specification, a given household can appear in the sample as many as four
times. All standard errors reported in the paper are adjusted for the fact that the error term will not be independently
distributed for observations that arise from the same household.

differences between families with one child, two children, or three or more children. Thus, whatever is

causing increases in the employment of families with two or more children relative to one-child families,

it only occurs for those who file tax returns.

         We think the most sensible interpretation of the evidence from the four-part test is that the EITC

is responsible for the differential employment increase of families with two or more children relative to

one-child families.


4.3      Other Sensitivity Analyses37

         Empirical projects inevitably require judgments about model specification. In the following

subsection, we briefly discuss the consequences of making different modeling assumptions.


4.3.1    Altering the Base Year Definition

         In all specifications presented to this point, we use average employment or average EITC

claiming between 1991 and 1993 as the reference period for the regressions. We do this because the

maximum EITC differential between families with two or more children and one child was

inconsequentially different from $0 during these years. But pooling the reference period masks another

subtle specification check for our model. Namely, there should be no significant employment (or EITC

claiming) trends prior to the period when the EITC began to diverge for the two groups of households.

Unfortunately, because data are not available prior to 1991, we cannot go back further to examine

employment and EITC claiming trends.

         There is no evidence of employment trends between 1991–1993. In the fixed-effects employment

specifications shown in Table 5c, for example, the coefficient (standard error) on the “2+ Kids in 1991”

4.3.2   Altering the Definition of Employment

        In our analysis thus far, we have classified a household as being employed if it reported having

any labor market earnings reported to the UI system in a given year. One may not think that a household

that only earns a hundred dollars or so in the labor market is really employed when thinking about the

economic importance of the effects documented in this paper. To address this concern, we estimated our

fixed-effects empirical models defining employment as having earnings exceeding $500 in the year (the

left-hand panel of Table 5d), and as having earnings exceeding $1,000 in the year (the right-hand panel of

Table 5d).

        The patterns are similar to the baseline estimates. The consequence of increasing the earnings

threshold above which we define a household as being “employed” is that the magnitude and the

significance of the coefficient estimates decreases somewhat as the threshold is increased.


4.3.3   Focus on AFDC-UP Cases

        It is well known that the EITC can have negative employment incentives on the intensive margin

for married couples if one partner’s earnings place the couple in the phaseout range of the credit (see, for

example, Eissa and Hoynes, 2004). For our analysis, however, we define employment as the first dollar of

the couple’s earnings, so by this definition, the credit still has unambiguously positive employment

incentives (on the extensive margin). Roughly 70 percent of the AFDC-UP cases, i.e., cases on welfare

with two (unemployed) parents, have some earnings in a given year.

        We find no evidence that the differential expansion of the EITC for families with two or more

children increased employment of adults in AFDC-UP households. In the fixed-effects empirical models

(equation 5), the “2+ Kids” by year interaction terms are all individually and jointly insignificant. If we

look more closely at employment patterns by the number of children, it looks like the economy or welfare

reform or some other factor perhaps began to affect the employment of AFDC-UP families in 1999 and
                                                      40

2000, and these influences had larger effects for families with three or more children. But the patterns are

not what one would expect to see if the EITC were the factor causing the changes.


4.3.4 Can Changes in Child Care Spending Explain the Employment Trends for Single-Parent Families?

        Public expenditures for child care were quite low for most of the period we examine in the paper.

But late in the 1990s, state child care spending increased sharply (Marrufo, O’Brien-Strain, Oliver, 2003).

This also is the period when the employment of single parents with two or more children increased

relative to parents with one child. Moreover, the increases come after the differential EITC expansions,

which raises the question of whether some other factor is causing the patterns observed in the data. To

some extent we have already discussed this issue, because the changes would need to affect employment

of families with two or more children relative to one-child families, but not affect employment of families

with three or more children relative to two-child families. It is unlikely that child care expenditure

increases would have this empirical pattern. But it is nevertheless straightforward to include a measure of

county (public) child care expenditures for the welfare caseload in our empirical fixed-effects regression

models of employment.

        Two results stand out from this alternative specification. First, the central coefficients on

employment are unchanged (they actually get slightly larger). The coefficients on the specification check

terms remain insignificant, individually and jointly. Second, the estimated coefficient on the child care

variable is consistently negative and precisely estimated. We think the most likely explanation for this

finding is “policy endogeneity.” Counties with more severe employment problems, particularly in the late

1990s after a decade-long economic expansion, implemented more aggressive child care subsidy

programs. This response by counties would account for the negative correlation between child care

spending and employment that we find in our data. Regardless of the explanation, the expansion of child

care spending does not account for the differential employment patterns by number of children

documented in this paper.

5.      CONCLUSIONS

        The EITC transfers a large amount of money to working poor families and reduces poverty. There

is also a considerable amount of evidence that the credit not only redistributes resources, but also

encourages employment, thereby avoiding one of the negative behavioral incentives of traditional income

transfer programs. No previous EITC employment study, however, has used data on whether or not

people eligible for the EITC actually file tax returns and claim it. Our analysis of tax data reinforce the

finding that the EITC appears to positively influence employment. Patterns of EITC claiming appear to

mirror employment patterns in the data. Consistent with the nature of the expansion of the EITC by

number of qualifying children in the 1990s, we only find differences in employment between families

with two or more children relative to one-child families, and not between families with three or more

children relative to two-child families. This result rules out alternative explanations that imply that

employment should increase (or decrease) with the number of children in a household. Moreover, we find

no EITC-like employment effects in samples where households do not file tax returns.

        In addition to having access to tax data, our work also adds several distinctive features to the

EITC employment literature. We use a different identification strategy than most papers on the topic,

where we compare employment rates of families with two or more children to employment rates of one-

child families over a period where the EITC increases more rapidly for families with two or more

children. We estimate our empirical model with longitudinal data, which allow us to account for time-

invariant characteristics of households that may affect employment. And our analysis is based on

California, which allows us to account in a detailed way for local labor market and transfer program

characteristics that likely affect employment.

        We also focus on the portion of the population that is of considerable interest to policymakers:

women with children who are trying to make the transition from welfare to work. Existing studies

typically focus on single mothers using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the Survey of

Income and Program Participation. But labor force participation rates of single mothers in the CPS are
                                                       42

around 80 percent. Labor force participation rates in our sample of welfare recipients start around 35

percent. Around 28 percent of single mothers in the CPS receive welfare. All households in our sample

received welfare at some point. Our results indicate that the positive employment effects of the EITC for

single mothers documented in other studies also apply to the more economically disadvantaged

population of welfare recipients.

        By documenting the regression-adjusted pattern of employment changes by year for families with

two or more children relative to one-child families, we provide new evidence that the employment

responses to EITC policy changes occur with a lag of one or two years.

        Our preferred estimates from Table 3 suggest that the differential EITC expansions increased

employment by as much as 3.4 percentage points for families with two or more children relative to

families with one child. As shown in Table 2, overall employment rates increased between 1991 and 2000

by 26.6 percentage points for one-child families and by 31 percentage points for families with two or

more children. The average employment increase for the two groups was 28.8 percentage points: the

differential EITC expansion accounted for 11.8 percent of the average increase in employment over this

period. This would seem somewhat smaller than what is implied by the Meyer and Rosenbaum (2001)

and Grogger (2003) results.38 But this illustrative calculation may provide an unduly pessimistic view of

the EITC. The EITC expanded for all families with children over this time period. The differential EITC

expansion can explain, in the regression-adjusted fixed-effects specification, 77 percent of the difference

in the change of employment between families with two or more children and one-child families.

        Another way of assessing the magnitude and consequences of our estimated effects of the EITC is

to examine the implied elasticity of employment with respect to a household’s disposable income. Hotz,

Mullin, and Scholz (2002a) report that average annual disposable income for single-parent welfare cases


        38
          Meyer and Rosenbaum (2001) find that EITC changes account for roughly 60 percent of the increase in
the employment rate of single mothers from 1984 to 1996 and roughly 31 percent of the increase from 1992 to 1996.
Grogger’s (2003) conclusion is quoted in footnote 4.
                                                        43

in their four-county California sample in 1998 was around $10,000.39 The average EITC differential for

families with one and two or more children in their sample was $439 in 1998. Hence, the EITC increased

disposable income by roughly 4.4 percent. Employment rates for families with two or more children in

1998 were around 60 percent, and the EITC expansion increased employment of families with two or

more children by 3.2 percentage points, or 5.6 percent (3.2/(60-3.2)). This implies an employment

elasticity with respect to disposable income of 1.3, which is at the upper end of the range of such

estimates for the previous studies of the employment effects of the EITC discussed in Hotz and Scholz

(2003).

          Carrying the back-of-envelope calculation further, a $439 relative increase in the EITC for

families with two or more children resulted in a 3.2 percentage-point increase in employment. For one-

child families, the average EITC receipt increased by $677 between 1993 and 1998, at least partly as a

consequence of legislated EITC expansions in 1990 and 1993. If the estimated employment effects are

linear (in the sense that a $439 effective increase in the EITC increases employment by 3.2 percentage

points), the EITC can account for 21 percent of the 23.4 percentage-point increase in employment of one-

child families between 1993 and 1998. Similar calculations imply that EITC can account for 29 percent of

the 28.1 percentage-point increase in employment for families with two or more children.

          Our paper shows that the EITC can be an important tool in efforts to increase employment of
