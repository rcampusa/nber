                                               ABSTRACT

What are the important tradeoffs in consulting a single expert for both diagnosis and treatment? On
one hand, an integrated diagnostician may have the incentive to recommend treatments that are not
in the buyer's best interests. On the other hand, joint production of diagnosis and treatment by an integrated
diagnostician may be more efficient. We examine an important special case of this problem: the costs
and health outcomes of elderly Medicare beneficiaries with coronary artery disease. We compare
the empirical consequences of diagnosis by an "integrated" cardiologist -- one who can provide surgical
treatment -- to the consequences of diagnosis by a non-integrated cardiologist. Diagnosis by an integrated
cardiologist leads, on net, to higher health spending but similar health outcomes. The net effect contains
three components: reduced spending and improved outcomes from better allocation of patients to
surgical treatment options; increased spending conditional on treatment option; and worse outcomes
from poorer provision of non-surgical care. We conclude that accounting more completely for doctors'
incentives to refer patients in setting reimbursements, or in the alternative, allowing doctors more freedom
to make and receive payments for referrals, could reduce spending and improve quality.

Introduction

       Anyone who has consulted a doctor, plumber, or auto mechanic has experienced

the tradeoffs in consulting a single expert to both diagnose and treat a problem in the

presence of asymmetric information. On one hand, integrated diagnosticians -- those

who also sell treatments -- may have the incentive to give advice that is not in the buyer's

best interests. As the theoretical models in Taylor (1995) and Wolinsky (1993) point out,

because the buyer has imperfect information on the scope of the problem (if he did not,

he would not have needed to consult a diagnostician in the first place), the diagnostician

inevitably has the incentive to recommend treatments that are more profitable, even if

they are more costly, lower quality, or less appropriate. On the other hand, joint

production of diagnosis and treatment may be more efficient. The diagnostician may

have better information about how to treat the problem than he could (or would) provide

to an independent third party. Or, the diagnostician may be able to treat the problem

himself less expensively or more effectively ("half the cost is opening the engine block").

       We examine an important special case of this problem: the costs and quality of

care of a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries with coronary artery disease. We

compare patients who were diagnosed by an "integrated" cardiologist -- one who also

provides surgical treatment -- to patients who were diagnosed by a non-integrated

cardiologist. We decompose the total effect of diagnosis by an integrated cardiologist into

the parts due to the change in the type of treatment and the parts due to the relative

efficiency of each type of treatment. With this information, we quantify the potential

upsides and downsides to diagnosis by an integrated expert. We identify these effects

based on differences across geographic areas in the number of integrated cardiologists per




                                                                                             3
capita. Our estimates are consistent under the assumption that unobserved patient

characteristics and other determinants of spending are similar in across areas with many

versus few integrated cardiologists; we explore the validity of this assumption below.

       The paper proceeds in four sections. Section I reviews the previous empirical

literature on the problems of obtaining diagnosis and treatment from a single expert when

that expert has better information than the buyer on the source of the buyer's problem.

Section II discusses the details of the problem that we study and presents our models.

Section III describes our data. Section IV presents our results, and Section V concludes

with the implications of our results for economic theory and health policy.



I.     Empirical Work: Agency Problems When Diagnosticians Provide Treatment

       Several recent papers have investigated the extent of moral hazard in integrated

diagnosticians' advice. Thomas Hubbard (1998, 2002) analyzes data from the California

vehicle emissions inspection market, in which inspectors can also provide repairs to help

vehicles pass. He finds that vehicle pass rates at small garages are greater than those at

chain stores and government-owned facilities, holding other factors constant. He

concludes that inspectors' desire for repeat business leads them to pass vehicles more

frequently, and so is sufficient to overcome the potential moral hazard problem in

integrated diagnosis-repair markets.

       Other work concludes that expert moral hazard is a more significant market

failure. Steve Levitt and Chad Syverson (2005) compare data on sales of homes owned

by real-estate agents and by non-agents. They find that agent-owned homes sell for more

than comparable homes and stay on the market longer, holding all else constant.




                                                                                             4
Toshiaki Iizuka (2004) studies the Japanese prescription drug market, in which doctors

not only prescribe drugs but also purchase and dispense them. He shows that elimination

of the profit incentive for physician prescriptions would reduce drug expenditures in

Japan by 14%, holding retail drug prices and other factors constant.

        Our paper is also related to the long-standing health services literature on

supplier-induced demand. These papers, starting with the classic study by Fuchs (1978),

document the positive correlation across areas between the supply of doctors and the cost

and intensity of medical care. However, this literature does not identify the specific

mechanism causing the observed correlation: the relationship between density of doctors

and intensity of care could be due to physicians' moral hazard, to differences in patient

preferences across areas, or to something else.1

        Our paper fills many of the gaps in these literatures. It examines the effects of

integration in an important but understudied context: the use of costly and risky imaging

of people's coronary arteries to detect blockages that, if untreated, can lead to heart

attacks and other serious health events. It quantifies the impact of integration on both

financial and health outcomes, allowing us to make tentative welfare conclusions about

the integration of diagnosis and treatment. And, it identifies the mechanisms through

which integration can have both an upside and a downside for patients under what we

show to be plausible assumptions.



II.     Integration of Diagnosis and Treatment in Cardiac Care

 But see Gruber and Owings (1996), who identify the effect of supplier-induced demand by estimating the
correlation across areas between birth rates and rates of use of cesarean sections.


                                                                                                      5
           Diagnostic angiography, also known as catheterization, was invented in 1959 by

Mason Sones at the Cleveland Clinic.2 The invention of catheterization, a technique for

imaging the locations of coronary artery blockages, significantly altered the course of

modern cardiac care. Most notably, catheterization was the first step toward the

invention of a new procedure in the 1970s called percutaneous transluminal coronary

angioplasty. Angioplasty uses a surgically-inserted balloon-tipped catheter to clear

arterial blockages that, if untreated, can lead to serious adverse health events like heart

attacks. Prior to the invention of angioplasty, the only surgical treatment for such

blockages was bypass surgery, which grafts a blood vessel from a patient's leg into his

chest to improve the flow of blood around the blockage. Although bypass surgery is

more appropriate than angioplasty for some patients, it is much more invasive, and so

results in higher procedural mortality and morbidity.

           In addition to transforming the treatment of arterial blockages, the invention of

angioplasty transformed the industrial organization of cardiac care. Prior to angioplasty's

invention, there were two types of cardiac doctors: cardiologists, who diagnosed patients

and offered non-surgical treatment (e.g., prescription drugs); and cardiac surgeons, who

did not diagnose patients and offered surgical treatment in the form of bypass. After its

invention, as summarized in table 1, there were three types of cardiac doctors: non-

interventional, or medical, cardiologists, who diagnosed patients and offered non-surgical

treatment; cardiac surgeons, who did not diagnose patients and offered surgical treatment

in the form of bypass; and a new type of "integrated" cardiologist, called an

interventional cardiologist, who both diagnosed patients and offered surgical treatment in

the form of angioplasty.

    This historical narrative is a summary of Mack (2003).


                                                                                               6
          The experiment in this paper is to compare the type of treatment, spending, and

health outcomes for otherwise similar patients diagnosed by an interventional versus a

non-interventional cardiologist. We do this with two statistical models.

          The first model specifies the type of treatment of patient j = 1,…,N as a function

of the patient's personal characteristics Xj (age, gender, black/nonblack race, specific

diagnosis, and illness severity at the time of the diagnosis) and the characteristics of the

patient's hospital and diagnosing cardiologist. If the patient is initially diagnosed by an

interventional cardiologist, then Ij = 1; otherwise, Ij = 0. In addition, the diagnosing

cardiologist and hospital of diagnosis have other characteristics Zj.

          Cardiologists offer one of three treatment recommendations: angioplasty

(denoted by an indicator variable Aj = 1), bypass surgery (denoted by an indicator

variable Bj = 1), or drugs and other non-surgical care (denoted by an indicator variable Cj

= 1).

          We specify treatment choice as a multinomial logit function, i.e.,

                           α + β A I j +δ A X j + γ A Z j                                          α + β B I j +δ B X j + γ B Z j
                       e                                                                       e
Pr(Aj = 1) =                         α + βτ I j +δτ X j + γ τ Z j
                                                                        , Pr(Bj = 1) =                       α + βτ I j +δτ X j + γ τ Z j
                                                                                                                                            , and
                 1+              e                                                       1+              e
                      τ = A , B ,C                                                            τ = A , B ,C


                                        1
Pr(Cj = 1) =                         α + βτ I j +δτ X j + γ τ Z j
                                                                    .
                 1+              e
                      τ = A , B ,C


          The second model specifies spending and health outcomes, conditional on type of

treatment, as a linear function of Xj, Ij, Zj, Aj, Bj, and Cj:

        φ + θX j + λI j + πZ j + σ A A j + σ B B j + σ C C j + ω A A j * I j + ω B B j * I j + ω C C j * I j
Yj =
                    + ζ A Aj * Z j + ζ B B j * Z j + ζ CC j * Z j + ε j

where Yj is total spending or health outcome in the year after diagnosis, and E( | …) = 0.



                                                                                                                                                    7
         The main concern with multinomial logit estimates of                 and OLS estimates of

( , ) is selection bias -- unobserved differences in the health or preferences of patients

treated by an interventional versus a non-interventional cardiologist. For example, a

patient with characteristics X diagnosed by an interventional cardiologist and hospital

with characteristics Z may be sicker than an observably identical patient diagnosed by an

observably identical non-interventional cardiologist at an observably identical hospital,

which could lead him to have different treatments, spending, and health outcomes even in

the absence of a causal effect. To address this concern, we estimate the treatment type

equations with a two-stage method that substitutes the predicted values of I and Z for the

actual values, using each patient's three-digit-zip-code average level of I and Z as

excluded instruments (standard errors are calculated using the bootstrap method,

sampling with replacement 100 times). We estimate the spending and health outcome

models by instrumental variables, again using each patient's three-digit-zip-code average

level of I and Z as excluded instruments (with heteroscedasticty-robust standard errors).

To the extent that there are no differences across areas in the unobserved determinants of

patients’ health spending or health status that are correlated with the area density of types

of cardiologist or hospital, estimates of the effect of I versus N from this model will be

consistent.3 We investigate the validity of this assumption below.



III.     Data

         We examine a 20% random sample of all patients who received a diagnostic

catheterization in 1998, in either an inpatient or outpatient setting. We restrict our sample

3
 To the extent that there are spillover effects of interventional cardiologists in an area -- that is, the
presence of interventional cardiologists affects the treatment decisions of non-interventional cardiologists --
estimates from the area effects models will be consistent for the sum of the direct and the spillover effects.


                                                                                                             8
to patients who were enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare continuously for the 365 days

preceding and the 365 days following their catheterization. We identify the doctor who

performed each patient’s catheterization in our study period using physician claims data.

We classify each patient’s diagnosing doctor (also using physician claims data) as

interventional if the doctor billed Medicare for any angioplasties in 1998 or 1999 or non-

interventional if the doctor billed Medicare for neither angioplasty nor bypass in 1998 or

1999. We delete the handful of patients were diagnosed by a cardiac surgeon (i.e., if the

doctor billed Medicare for a bypass surgery in 1998 or 1999).

       We calculate the following patient characteristics X from these longitudinal

claims data: three sets of 32 indicator variables to capture all of the patients' ICD-9

diagnoses at the time of his catheterization, at his most recent past acute care hospital

admission in the preceding 365 days (if any), and at his most recent past non-acute care

hospital admission in the preceding 365 days (if any); the total number of days in the

acute-care and non-acute care hospital in the preceding 365 days; the total Medicare

expenditures on acute-care and non-acute-care hospital services in the preceding 365

days; and age, gender, and race. We calculate the following physician and hospital

characteristics Z: catheterization volume of the diagnosing cardiologist; angioplasty or

bypass-surgery volume of the treatment physician (if any); catheterization volume of the

hospital at which the test occurred; angioplasty or bypass volume of the hospital at which

the treatment occurred; and the size (number of beds) and system, teaching, and for-

profit/nonprofit status of the hospital at which the diagnosis occurred. To identify the

cost consequences of these differences in treatment paths, we calculated the total

Medicare hospital and physician spending (including all deductibles and copayments)




                                                                                             9
incurred by each patient in the 365 days following his diagnosis. To identify the

outcome consequences, we calculated the rate of readmission for heart failure (HF) and

heart attack (AMI) in the 365 days following the diagnosis (excluding readmissions

within the first 30 days, because they may be associated with the initial diagnostic

process), and the mortality rate in the 365 days following the diagnosis.

       Table 2 investigates the validity of the key assumptions necessary to identify the

causal effects of diagnosis by an interventional cardiologist. The first column of the table

presents descriptive statistics for the half of the sample of patients from areas with a high

density of interventional cardiologists; the second column presents statistics for the other

half of the sample. The first row shows that the probability of diagnosis by an

interventional cardiologist is strongly correlated with the area density of interventional

cardiologists. Patients from areas with many interventional cardiologists are 21.5

percentage points more likely to be diagnosed by an interventional cardiologist, around

25 percent more likely.

       However, there is little evidence that these areas differ in terms of patients' health

status in the year before diagnosis with cardiac illness. According to the second and third

rows, patients from high-density areas spend fractionally fewer days in the hospital and

$62 less on hospital care in total, with neither difference statistically significant. Thus,

unobserved heterogeneity across areas in patient health is unlikely to bias our estimates

of the effect of diagnosis by an interventional cardiologist.

       According to the fourth row, patients from high-density areas spend $578 less on

all Medicare covered services in the year after diagnosis, which is statistically significant

at conventional levels. This suggests that unobserved heterogeneity across areas in other




                                                                                               10
factors such as patients' taste for intensive medical treatment would, if anything, lead to a

downward bias in our estimates of the effect of diagnosis by an interventional

cardiologist on the cost of care in the year after diagnosis. The usual omitted variable

problem in studies of supplier-induced demand is that areas with a greater number of

physicians or specialists have higher health spending overall; but, in our experiment, the

opposite is true.



IV.     Results

        Table 3 presents the effects of diagnosis by an interventional versus a non-

interventional cardiologist on Medicare-covered spending and health outcomes in the

year after diagnosis. The table has three panels. The top panel of the table presents the

aggregate effects, E(Y | I=1) - E(Y | I =0). The leftmost four columns present the raw

difference in means; the rightmost four columns present the difference, adjusted for

selection and the characteristics of patients, doctors, and hospitals. The top panel shows

that treatment by an interventional cardiologist leads to significantly higher spending in

the year after diagnosis, but statistically indistinguishable health outcomes. Adjusted for

selection and differences in characteristics, patients diagnosed by an interventional

cardiologist experienced $2,847 higher spending (standard error $747), about 10%

greater than average (from table 2, average spending is $28,553 = ($28,264 + $28,842) /

2). However, the effect of diagnosis by an interventional cardiologist has no significant

effect on health outcomes. These estimates are unlikely to be due to unobserved

differences across areas in demand or patient preferences. According to table 2, omitted




                                                                                            11
variable bias should if anything lead to underestimation of any positive gap in spending

between interventional cardiologists and non-interventional cardiologists.

         The total effect of diagnosis by an interventional cardiologist consists of several

opposing component parts. The second and third panels of table 2 decompose the total

effect into five factors.4 The first group of factors includes two that are due to the

redirection of patients who would have otherwise received bypass or non-surgical

treatment by interventional cardiologists into the treatment they provide -- angioplasty.5

The second and third rows of the table show that the redirection of bypass patients to

angioplasty results in significant spending reductions of $1,024 per patient; the

redirection of non-surgical patients results in significant spending increases of $535 per

patient. This is not surprising, given the average subsequent-year spending (unadjusted

for selection or characteristics) by type of treatment is $49,222 for bypass patients,

$29,681 for angioplasty patients, and $18,569 for non-surgical patients (not published in

any table). The redirection of patients to angioplasty has a small but significant adverse

effect on health outcomes, leading to increases in readmission with AMI in the 31-365

days following diagnosis of approximately a tenth of a percentage point (on a base of 2

percentage points, not published in any table).

         Perhaps more surprising are the effects of the second group of factors, those due

to interventional cardiologists' relative efficiency in managing patients with each type of

treatment. According to the fourth row, diagnosis by an interventional cardiologist leads

 The following table presents the probability of each type of treatment by type of diagnosing cardiologist:

Treatment B: bypass                          0.217                               0.240
Treatment C: non-surgical                    0.479                               0.534

to significantly higher spending on angioplasty patients ($1,179, standard error $327)

with no improvement in health outcomes. According to the fifth row, diagnosis by an

interventional cardiologist also leads to much higher spending on bypass patients

($1,744, standard error $461), but dramatically lower mortality (1.195 percentage points,

standard error 0.517). On a base of one-year mortality of 10.5 percentage points (not

published in any table), this amounts to more than 10%. According to the sixth row,

diagnosis by an interventional cardiologist leads to statistically indistinguishable

increases in spending on non-surgical patients, but dramatically higher mortality (0.889

percentage points, standard error 0.560; significant at the 10 percent level).



V.     Conclusions

       What are the important tradeoffs from integrating diagnosis and treatment in the

presence of asymmetric information? Economic theory suggests two opposing effects.

Diagnosticians who sell treatment may give advice that is not in the buyer's best interests,

but joint production of diagnosis and treatment may be more efficient. Despite the

obvious importance of this question, and its prevalence in a wide range of markets other

than health care, little empirical work has examined integration's effects.

       This paper examines the treatments, health spending, and health outcomes of

elderly Medicare beneficiaries with a common form of coronary artery disease. We

compare beneficiaries who were diagnosed by a cardiologist who provides integrated

by a cardiologist who is not integrated (a.k.a. a non-interventional, or medical,




                                                                                           13
cardiologist). We find, on net, that diagnosis by an interventional cardiologist leads to

increases in health spending of approximately 10 percent, but not better health outcomes.

        This aggregate effect masks several important, opposing components. First is the

unsurprising moral hazard effect: diagnosis by an interventional cardiologist leads to

significantly more angioplasties -- the surgical treatment that interventional cardiologists

provide. However, because several of the new angioplasty patients used to receive (much

more costly) bypass surgery, the extra angioplasties lead to slightly lower health spending

overall -- approximately $500, or around 2 percent -- and small but statistically

significant increases in adverse health outcomes.

        The effects due to interventional cardiologists' relative efficiency in managing

patients with each type of treatment are more surprising. Interventional cardiologists do

not manage angioplasty patients more efficiently; angioplasty patients diagnosed by an

interventional cardiologist have higher spending and about the same health outcomes.

The big advantage to diagnosis by an interventional cardiologist accrues to patients who

are treated with bypass surgery by a cardiac surgeon. These patients have significantly

higher health spending and dramatically lower mortality rates. This could be due to

interventional cardiologists' sorting patients into bypass surgery or allocating patients to

cardiac surgeons more effectively. The big disadvantage to diagnosis by an

interventional cardiologist accrues to patients who are treated non-surgically; these

patients have significantly higher mortality. This could be due to interventional

cardiologists' lack of ability or incentives to treat non-surgical patients effectively.

        Our results point out an important inconsistency in Medicare reimbursement

policy, and indeed an important general problem in contracting in the presence of




                                                                                            14
asymmetric information. Explicit "kickback" payments from treating to diagnosing

doctors are banned by law (for public purchasers such as Medicare and Medicaid) and by

contract (for private purchasers like insurance companies and large employers).

However, the principle underlying this ban is not generally applied to doctors' decision to

provide integrated diagnosis and treatment, even though integration can have the same

effects on incentives and behavior as kickbacks do. In addition, allowing integration but

banning kickbacks effectively allows rent capture by integrated but not non-integrated

doctors, which can distort treatment decisions even further.6

           How should these incentive problems be resolved? A blanket ban on the

integration of diagnosis and treatment would be completely impractical. Every doctor

provides both diagnosis and therapeutic services; interventional cardiologists are only one

example. Thus, we conclude that paying integrated doctors differently, or allowing

doctors more freedom to make and receive payments for referrals, could reduce cost and

improve quality.

           For example, our results suggest that interventional cardiologists' important

strength may be more in the triaging of surgically-treated patients than in the provision of

angioplasty. If further research finds this to be true, then paying interventional

cardiologists more for diagnosis and less for treatment could help reduce spending and

improve outcomes. Our results also suggest that interventional cardiologists' important

weakness may be in the management of non-surgical patients. If further research finds

this to be true, then paying interventional cardiologists to refer patients to non-

interventional cardiologists for non-surgical treatment, or allowing non-interventional

cardiologists to pay for referrals, could also improve productivity in health care.

Appendix: Derivation of Decomposition

        The expected difference in medical expenditures or health outcomes for a patient
diagnosed by an interventional versus a non-interventional cardiologist can be written as
the difference between the sums of the products of the probabilities of each type of
treatment (A: Angioplasty; B: bypass; C: non-surgical) and the expected outcome
conditional on treatment (subscripts and conditioning on X and Z are suppressed for
simplicity in notation):
(1)     E(Y | I=1) – E(Y | I=0) = Pr(A | I=1)*E(Y | I=1, A) – Pr(A | I=0)*E(Y | I=0, A)
                       + Pr(B | I=1)*E(Y | I=1, B) – Pr(B | I=0)*E(Y | I=0, B)
                       + Pr(C | I=1)*E(Y | I=1, C) – Pr(C | I=0)*E(Y | I=0, C)

But because a patient must always receive some treatment (1 = Pr(A | I=1) + Pr(B | I=1) +
Pr(C | I=1) = Pr(A | I=0) + Pr(B | I=0) + Pr(C | I=0)), the expected difference in
utilization or outcomes can be written as the sum of five components:
(2)      E(Y | I) – E(Y | I=0) = [Pr(B | I=0) – Pr(B | I=1)] * [E(Y | I=1, A) – E(Y | I=1, B)]
                        + [Pr(C | I=0) – Pr(C | I=1)] * [E(Y | I=1, A) – E(Y | I=1, C)]
                        + Pr(A | I=0) * [(E(Y | I=1, A) – E(Y | I=0, A)]
                        + Pr(B | I=0) * [(E(Y | I=1, B) – E(Y | I=0, B)]
                        + Pr(C | I=0) * [(E(Y | I=1, C) – E(Y | I=0, C)]

        As long as interventional cardiologists are less likely than non-interventional
cardiologists to treat patients non-surgically and with bypass, the first term of this
decomposition can be interpreted as the portion of the expected difference in utilization
or outcomes due to the redirection of bypass patients to angioplasty; the second term as
the portion due to the redirection of non-surgical patients to angioplasty; the third term as
the portion due to the difference in utilization or outcomes of angioplasty patients
diagnosed by an interventional cardiologist; the fourth term as the portion due to the
difference in utilization or outcomes of bypass patients diagnosed an interventional
cardiologist; and the fifth term as the portion due to the difference in utilization or
outcomes of non-surgical patients diagnosed by an interventional cardiologist.
