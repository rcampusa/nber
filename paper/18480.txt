Labor Market, Financial Crises and Inflation: Jobless and Wageless Recoveries

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper uses a sample of 116 recession episodes in developed and emerging market economies
to compare the labor-market recovery during financial crises with that of other recession episodes.
It documents two new stylized facts. First, labor-market recovery from financial crises is characterized
by either higher unemployment ("jobless recovery") or a lower real wage ("wageless recovery"). Second,
inflation determines the type of recovery: low inflation (below 30 percent annual rate) is associated
with jobless recovery, while high inflation is associated with wageless recovery. The paper shows
that this pattern of labor recovery from financial crises is consistent with a simple model in which
collateral requirements are higher (lower) when a larger share of labor costs (physical capital expenditure)
is involved in a loan contract.

    The slow recovery of unemployment has been one of the most salient features in the
policy debate that accompanied the Great Recession. The fact that, in the context of
high unemployment, US output has recovered its precrisis level has lead many analysts,
in both academic and policy circles, to label the pattern a “jobless recovery” (see Figure
1). In Europe, the pattern of unemployment recovery seems to be even more dramatic: Six
years after the recession began, unemployment has not yet begun to recover its precrisis
level.
    This paper casts light on the reasons for jobless recovery in the Great Recession by
studying labor-market recovery in a sample of 116 postwar recession episodes–prior to
the Great Recession–in developed (DMs) and emerging market economies (EMs). We
document two new stylized facts. First, in “low-inflation” recession episodes (i.e., annual
inflation below 30 percent), financial crises tend to be followed by greater unemployment
than in other recession episodes. Second, in “high-inflation” recession episodes, financial
crises are not followed by jobless recoveries but by “wageless recoveries,” characterized
by a lower real wage once output recovers its trend. These findings are summarized in
Figure 2, which compares the behavior of DMs’ and EMs’ respective labor markets during
financial crises, relative to other episodes.

    In DMs, where inflation in the postwar era has been relatively low, financial crises
have been followed by recoveries in which joblessness was significantly higher than in
other recessions. This is in line with Reinhart and Reinhart (2010): During the ten years
following financial crises, unemployment rates remain on average five percentage points
above the average rate ten years prior to the crisis. Similar evidence is provided by Knotek
and Terry (2009), who show that, for the “big five” banking crises (Spain 1977, Norway
1987, Finland 1991, Sweden 1991, Japan 1992), unemployment rates have been higher

and more persistent than in recessions not associated with banking crises.
    In EMs, there is a much higher dispersion in inflation rates during financial crises.
Exploiting these differences in inflation rates, we find again a sluggish adjustment of labor
markets during the recovery from financial crises, but the nature of such adjustment
varies with inflation. High-inflation recession episodes are not associated with jobless
recoveries but with wageless recoveries. In contrast, low-inflation EMs display a pattern
similar to that observed in DMs, with financial crises associated with more intense jobless
recoveries. The findings are in line with models of nominal wage rigidities, where a price
spike would lower the rate of unemployment (for a recent study in this direction showing
the importance of wage rigidity in a crisis environment, see Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe,
2013).
    The paper conducts an econometric analysis finding that the association between fi-
nancial crises and jobless and wageless recoveries, as shown in Figure 2, is robust to


                                                                                       3
controlling for countries’ characteristics (such as labor-market indicators, secular growth,
financial development, and country size) and to characteristics of the recession episodes
(such as duration of the episode or the depth of the output contraction). To provide evi-
dence on the effect of financial crises in this association, we also carry out an instrumental
variable (IV) strategy using credit-market outcomes prior to the recession episode in order
to identify the exogenous effect of financial crises on jobless recoveries.
   A common explanation given for the high unemployment observed in the Great Reces-
sion is that output has not recovered its trend. In this line, several papers have recently
argued that jobless recoveries are not a pattern observed in the data, based on the stability
of Okun’s law (e.g., Ball, Leigh and Loungani, 2013; Galı́, Smets and Wouters, 2012). We
show that a key difference between our findings and the results obtained in this literature
is related to the measure of jobless recovery used. Estimations of Okun’s law typically
focus on the cyclical component of unemployment. In our study, we measure jobless re-
covery as the change in unemployment rate from output peak to recovery. In fact, if we
were to measure jobless recoveries as deviations from the “natural rate,” we would also
find little trace of jobless recovery. Our evidence suggests that jobless recoveries mostly
occur at lower frequencies than the ones typically studied in Okun’s law regressions. At
first sight, this result could be interpreted as a sign that financial crises are related to
changes in the natural rate of unemployment (for a theoretical formulation and evidence
related to this hypothesis, see Acemoglu, 2001; Dromel, Kolakez and Lehmann, 2009).
However, our evidence that high-inflation recession episodes do not display jobless recov-
ery suggests that this might be better characterized as persistent unemployment in the
presence of low inflation and nominal rigidities—and therefore that a policy of generating
a spike in inflation might succeed in reducing the unemployment rate.
   To rationalize the findings of our empirical study, we develop a simple analytical
framework in which financial crises—formalized as an exogenous contraction of collateral
constraints—can lead to jobless recoveries. The key assumption is that collateral require-
ments are lower for projects and firms possessing easily recognizable collateral, such as
physical capital. We thus show that, as a result of a collateral crunch, firms choose to
employ more capital-intensive techniques, implying jobless recovery under wage rigidity.
It is worth noting that, despite the simplicity of the model, collateral and other financial
issues have not played a central role in the theoretical literature concerned with jobless
recoveries (see Schreft, Singh and Hodgson, 2005; Shimer, 2012; Berger, 2012; Jaimovich




                                              4
and Siu, 2012; Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2012).1 We then test the role of collateral for
the sample of DMs, using data on asset prices (house prices) as a proxy for collateral
values, and we find that, in a low-inflation context, the recovery of collateral variables is
significantly associated with jobless recoveries.
        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 describes the sample of reces-
sion episodes and the variables used in the empirical analysis. Section 2 documents the
association between financial crises and jobless and wageless recoveries and provides evi-
dence from an instrumental variables strategy. Section 3 studies the results’ robustness to
the inclusion of additional controls and to the use of other measures of financial crises and
jobless recovery. Section 4 presents an analytical framework to rationalize the association
between financial crises and jobless recovery. Section 5 concludes.


1        Data and Descriptive Statistics

1.1       Sample Construction

1.1.1       Developed- and Emerging-Market Recession Episodes

To analyze the relationship between financial crises and labor-market recovery, we con-
struct two samples of recession episodes: one for DMs and one for EMs. Constructing two
separate samples allows us to use quarterly data in the DMs.
        Using quarterly data, we construct a sample of recession episodes during the period
1950–2006 for 11 DMs: Austria, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Swe-
den, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. We use the NBER (for the
US) and the ECRI (for the other economies) recession dates to identify the occurrence of
a recession event.2
        For EMs, due to limited data availability, we use annual data and construct a sample
of recession episodes from 1980 to 2006. Following Calvo, Izquierdo and Talvi (2006), we
identify the occurrence of a recession event as a period of negative annual change in GDP.
To reduce heterogeneity among EMs, we focus on countries that are integrated into the
world capital market, defined as countries included in JP Morgan’s Emerging Market Bond
    1
      Financial considerations do play a key role in the dynamics of employment in both the theoretical and
the empirical literature (for a recent survey see Brunnermeier, Eisenbach and Sannikov, 2012). However,
the phenomenon of jobless recovery is different from that of employment fluctuations; it implies delinking
employment from output.
    2
      NBER and ECRI follow similar methodologies to define and date recessions. Countries were selected on
the basis of data and recession dates’ availability. Japan was not considered due to its strong idiosyncratic
differences during this period. We did not include in the sample the 1995 episode in Austria, defined by
the ECRI as recession, because there was no output contraction.



                                                     5
Index (EMBI). Countries included in the sample are Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile,
Colombia, Croatia, the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador,
Hungary, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Panama,
Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia,
Turkey, Ukraine, Uruguay, and Venezuela.3
       For each recession episode in a DM or EM, we define an output peak, trough, and
recovery point using the cyclical component of output per capita. In particular, given
a recession episode, we define an output peak as the period displaying the maximum
cyclical component of output per capita in the window with a positive cyclical component
of output per capita preceding the recession event.4 The recovery point is defined as
the period, after a recession event, in which output per capita recovers its trend level.
The output trough is defined as the period between output peak and recovery point
displaying the minimum level of the cyclical component of output per capita. Since we
are studying the pattern of the recovery from recession episodes, we do not include in
the sample episodes in which output per capita did not fully recover its trend before the
occurrence of another recession episode. We compute the cyclical component of output
using a Hodrick–Prescott (HP) filter with a smoothing parameter of 1600 for quarterly
data and 100 for annual data (Hodrick and Prescott, 1997; Ravn and Uhlig, 2002). Defining
the recovery point of output per capita in terms of its trend level ensures that differences
among episodes are not driven by different recoveries to trend. Results do not significantly
change if we define the recovery point as the point in which output recovers its precrisis
level rather than its trend. Data on output and population are obtained from OECD,
WEO, and WDI datasets.
       With this methodology, we obtain a sample of 45 DM recession episodes, and 71 EM
recession episodes, listed in Table 8 of Appendix A. Next we classify recession episodes
according to the inflation rate exhibited during the recession episode.


1.1.2      Low- and High-Inflation Recession Episodes

A major difference between DMs and EMs is that recession episodes in the latter tend
to display much higher inflation, as shown in Figure 3. In the presence of nominal wage
   3
      Since we are interested in analyzing the recovery of unemployment in market economies during the
crisis, we excluded from this sample episodes associated with the dissolution of the Soviet Union (in
particular, the recession episodes that started prior to 1991 in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia,
Hungary, Poland, Russia and Ukraine).
    4
      If no observation with a positive cyclical component of output exists between the trough of a previous
recession episode and beginning of the recession event, the output peak is simply defined as the period
displaying the maximum cyclical component of output per capita between the trough of the previous
recession episode and the beginning of the recession event.

rigidities, inflation is a potential mechanism to induce a contraction of real wages and thus
restore full employment (see, for example, Galı́, 2011; Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2013).
To explore this hypothesis, we divide the sample of EMs into “low inflation” episodes and
“high inflation” episodes. For each episode, we compute the maximum level of inflation for
the entire episode. We compute inflation using the producer price index (wholesale price
index or the consumer price index when not available) obtained from the IMF dataset
and national sources. The maximum annual level of inflation observed in a DM recession
episode is 24.6 percent. We define a high- (low-) inflation episode as one in which the
maximum level of the annual rate of inflation is above (below) 30 percent.5 The thresh-
old considered is the upper bound identified in Dornbusch and Fischer (1993) to define
moderate inflation, and the cutoff above which Calvo and Reinhart (2002) define high
inflation. With this threshold, low-inflation EMs have an average inflation of 11.9 per-
cent, not statistically different from the average DM inflation (9.4 percent). The standard
deviation is also similar: 7.4 percent for low-inflation EMs and 6.2 percent for DMs. Thus,
the distribution of low-inflation EMs is comparable, in terms of inflation during recession
episodes, to that of DMs.
   5
    In Calvo, Coricelli and Ottonello (2014), we conduct a threshold estimation, following Hansen (2000),
to identify a level of inflation from which EM financial-crisis episodes have a different degree of jobless
recovery. Results confirm the presence of a threshold around 30 percent (point estimate of 31.7 percent).
We also study whether, in EM financial crises, one can establish a linear relationship between the inflation
experienced in the episode (the level of inflation or the change in inflation) and unemployment recovery.
We uncovered no strong evidence supporting the statistical significance of a linear relationship between a
continuous measure of inflation and unemployment recovery.

1.2     Definition of Variables

In this section we describe the data sources and the construction of the variables used in
the empirical analysis.


1.2.1    Measures of Jobless and Wageless Recovery

To measure jobless recovery, we compute, for each episode, the change in the unemploy-
ment rate between output peak and output recovery point (∆PR u). Looking at the change
in the unemployment rate permits us to abstract from historical differences in the aver-
age unemployment rate in these economies, which is likely to be determined by structural
characteristics and labor-market institutions. In the Section 3, we study the robustness
of the results to alternative measures of jobless recovery. Similarly, to measure wageless
recovery, we computed, for each episode, the change in the (log) real wage between out-
put peak and output recovery point (∆PR w). The data on unemployment and wages were
obtained from WEO, ILO and ECLA datasets and from national sources. Nominal wages
were deflated by the wholesale price index or producer price index, obtained from OECD
and IFS datasets and national sources.


1.2.2    Financial-Crisis Episodes

For each recession episode, we construct a dummy variable (fin crisis) that takes the
value of one if a banking crisis event or a debt default/rescheduling event occurs in a
window from 1 year before the output per capita peak to 1 year after the output per
capita recovery point. This classifies 13 DM episodes as financial crises (29 percent of the
sample) and 57 EM episodes (80 percent of the sample), detailed in Table 8 of Appendix A.
Data on banking crises and debt default/rescheduling events are obtained from Reinhart
and Rogoff (2009b).


1.2.3    Control Variables

The baseline empirical analysis includes two sets of controls (the set of controls is fur-
ther expanded in Section 3). First, we control for labor-market indicators (denoted by
labor mkt P ) computed at the output peak. As emphasized in the labor-market literature,
labor-market institutions are likely to affect the response of unemployment to shocks,
including the recovery of unemployment following recession episodes (see, for example,
Bertola, Blau and Kahn, 2002; Blanchard, 2006; Furceri and Mourougane, 2009; Bernal-
Verdugo, Furceri and Guillaume, 2012). We use two variables: a de jure indicator of


                                             8
labor-market legislation (lamrig P ) from the recent dataset on labor-market regulations
constructed by Campos and Nugent (2012);6 and a de facto measure of labor-market
rigidities, namely the natural rate of unemployment (natural u P ), which is likely to be
affected by labor-market institutions. For DMs, we use the natural rate of unemployment
reported in the IMF–WEO dataset. For EMs we compute the average rate of unemploy-
ment in the whole sample period as a proxy for the natural rate of unemployment (to
the best of our knowledge, there is no dataset available that reports the natural rate of
unemployment for a large set of EM countries).
       Second, we control for the secular growth experienced throughout the recession episode,
denoted by gd. With g denoting the annual secular growth rate of a given country and
d the duration of a recession episode, the secular growth experienced throughout the re-
cession episode is defined as gd = g × d. The secular growth rate for a given country
is computed as the average per capita growth rate for the sample period. The duration
of the recession episode is defined as the number of years from output peak to recovery
point. Controlling for this variable is relevant since countries can have different long-run
growth rates and recession episodes might differ in their duration, which can affect jobless
and wageless recoveries. For instance, in a standard growth model, higher technological
progress would lead to a higher growth of real wages.


1.3      Descriptive Statistics

Table 1 presents summary statistics for the sample of recession episodes, splitting the
sample into DM and EM episodes and the latter into low- and high-inflation episodes.
Columns 1–3 indicate that the average DM recession episode displays a statistically sig-
nificant jobless recovery (from output peak to recovery, unemployment increases 2.2 per-
centage points) but no negative effect on wages (from output peak to recovery, wages
increase 8.4 percent). If we split the DM sample between financial crises and other reces-
sion episodes, we see that financial crises display a greater increase in unemployment: 3.6
percent in financial crises vs. 1.6 percent in other recession episodes (see also Figure 2).
       Columns 4–6 indicate that the average EM recession episode displays both statistically
significant jobless and wageless recovery, driven by financial-crisis episodes (other recession
episodes do not display a statistically significant jobless or wageless recovery). However,
Columns 7–12 show that splitting the sample in low and high inflation uncovers two very
   6
    The variable lamrig is an index of labor-market legislation rigidity, constructed in Campos and Nugent
(2012) by reviewing labor-market legislation. This new index extends both in terms of country coverage
and of time span the widely used OECD dataset on employment protection legislation (see also Botero
et al., 2004).

different patterns: low-inflation financial-crisis episodes display a statistically significant
jobless recovery (from output peak to recovery, unemployment increases 2.8 percentage
points) and no wageless recovery, while high-inflation financial-crisis episodes display no
statistically significant jobless recovery and a large and statistically significant wageless
recovery (from output peak to recovery, real wages contract 13 percent). As an illustration
of this pattern see Figure 2.
     Table 1 also shows the descriptive statistics of the baseline controls, which indicate
that financial crises tend to occur more often in a context of higher labor-market rigidi-
ties, and to have a larger duration (which is reflected in the control variable gd). DM
financial crises tend to occur more often in the context of a high natural rate of unem-
ployment, whereas EM financial crises tend to occur in the context of a low natural rate
of unemployment. These differences in the raw data point to the relevance of controlling
for different characteristics of the recession episodes and of labor markets to identify the
association between financial crises and labor-market recovery (Section 3 expands further
this set of controls).

2        Econometric Analysis

2.1       Methodology

The baseline empirical model relates jobless and wageless recoveries to financial crises,
controlling for labor-market characteristics and secular growth:


                               ∆PR zi = α + βfin crisis i + Xi0 + i .                          (1)


where ∆PR zi denotes the jobless recovery measure (∆PR ui ) or wageless recovery measure
(∆PR wi ) in recession episode i, X is a vector of controls including labor-market controls
(labor mkt P,i ) and secular growth (gdi ), and i is a random error term (variables are
defined in Section 1). The coefficient of interest is β, the difference in jobless recovery or
wageless recovery displayed by financial-crisis episodes relative to other episodes.
        The ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates of Equation (1) provide evidence for the
association between financial crises and jobless recovery, but they cannot suggest any
causality: Financial crises can be endogenous to jobless recoveries. For example, an in-
crease in the unemployment rate driven by technological factors could induce a fall in
house prices and a decrease in collateral values, triggering a financial crisis. We provide
some evidence on the effect of financial crises on jobless and wageless recoveries using
an IV strategy. The instrument is a variable that captures credit-market outcomes prior
to the recession episode, as is typically done in the literature to predict financial crises
(see, for example, Mendoza and Terrones, 2012; Schularick and Taylor, 2012; Gourinchas,
Valdes and Landerretche, 2001). Specifically, we use the cyclical component of real per
capita credit at the output peak (credit P ).7 Data on credit were obtained from the IFS
dataset and from national sources.
        Table 2 shows the first-stage relationship for DMs and EMs. The first-stage coefficients
are statistically significant at the one- and 10-percent levels, showing that credit booms
prior to recession episodes are associated with a higher probability of the recession being
financial.

eries, are reported in Table 3. Results for DMs are reported in Panel A. Columns 1–4

    The cyclical component of real per capita credit was obtained using an HP filter. Results do not
change when we use a log quadratic trend to compute the cyclical component.

show the association between jobless recoveries and financial crises. The OLS estimates,
reported in Columns 1 and 2, indicate that there is a positive and statistically significant
association between financial crises and jobless recoveries. Columns 3 and 4 show that the
IV estimates are also positive and significant, providing evidence that the exogenous com-
ponent of financial crises helps explain jobless recoveries. Note that the IV coefficients are
larger than those of the OLS model, suggesting that the endogeneity of unemployment
and financial crises could underestimate the effects. The magnitude of the coefficients
suggests that jobless recoveries can be significantly larger during financial crises: When
output per capita recovers its precrisis trend, the divergence from the unemployment rate
at its precrisis level tends to be between 1.8 and 2.8 percentage points greater than in
a regular recession. Note that these figures are similar to those observed in the United
States and Europe during the global financial crisis that started in 2008 (see Figure 1).
Columns 5–8 show the association between wageless recoveries and financial crises. None
of the coefficients of the OLS or IV regressions is statistically significant. Therefore, in
DMs, evidence suggests that financial crises are associated with jobless recoveries but not
with the dynamics of real wages. In particular, there is no trace of wageless recoveries.
     The results for low-inflation EMs are reported in Table 3, Panel B. As for DMs,
evidence from OLS and IV estimates suggests that financial crises are associated with
jobless recoveries (Columns 1–4) but not with wageless recoveries (Columns 5–8). The
magnitude of the coefficient of jobless recoveries are similar to the one found for DMs.
     The results for high-inflation EMs are reported in Table 3, Panel C. In sharp contrast
with DMs and low-inflation EMs, financial crises in high-inflation EMs experience wageless
rather than jobless recoveries. In Columns 1–4, both the OLS and IV estimates show that

financial crises have no statistically significant association with unemployment recovery.
On the other hand, the association between financial crises and the recovery of real wages
is negative and statistically significant, as shown by the OLS estimates in Columns 5
and 6. Moreover, Columns 7 and 8 show that the IV estimates are also statistically
significant, providing some evidence that the exogenous component of financial crises can
be important in wageless recoveries.


3     Robustness

In this section, we investigate the robustness of the results reported in Section 2. In
particular, we explore the robustness of the conclusions when i) we use an alternative



                                                       13
measure of financial crises, ii) we include additional controls, and iii) we use alternative
measures of jobless recovery.


3.1      Alternative Measure of Financial Crises

The measure of financial crises used in the baseline specification is a dummy variable based
on the occurrence of banking crises or default/rescheduling events during the recession
window. In this section, we study the robustness of the findings to the use of a continuous
measure of financial crises and credit-market conditions: the contraction in credit during
the recession episode. In particular, the alternative measure of financial crises is defined
as the change in the cyclical component of real credit per capita from output peak to
recovery point (∆PR credit c).8
       We estimate the model defined in Equation (1) with the alternative measure of finan-
cial crises:
                               ∆PR zi = α + β∆PR credit c i + Xi0 + i .                                  (2)

Table 4 indicates that the results using the alternative measure of financial crises are
similar to those obtained in the baseline specification. In particular, Panel A shows that
in DMs, creditless recoveries are associated with jobless recoveries and seem unrelated
to the recovery of real wages. Panel B shows that the same pattern is observed in low-
inflation EMs. Finally, Panel C reports that in high-inflation EMs creditless recoveries
are associated with wageless recoveries and not jobless recoveries. In summary, focusing
on continuous indicators of credit conditions, rather than dummy variables identifying
financial crises, broadly confirms the results obtained in the financial-crisis analyses.


3.2      Additional Controls

In this section, we study the robustness of our results to the inclusion of additional controls
that could be associated with jobless recoveries and financial crises. A first source of
concern could be that the association between financial crises and labor-market recovery
is driven by characteristics of financial crises relative to other recession episodes that
are unrelated to financial factors. For instance, financial crises are typically associated
with a larger output contraction than other recession episodes (see Reinhart and Rogoff,
   8
     In the recession episodes in which a financial crisis occurs prior to or at the output peak, we consider
the maximum level in the cyclical component of real per capita credit between the beginning of the financial
crisis and the output peak instead of the cyclical component of real per capita credit at the output peak.
Indeed, when a financial crisis starts before the recession episode, the level of credit at the output peak is
already affected by the financial-crisis episode. The cyclical component of credit was computed using the
HP filter, but results do not change if we use a log quadratic trend.

2009a). Jobless recoveries could result from deeper recession episodes if, for example, larger
output contractions lead to greater increases in unemployment and there is hysteresis in
unemployment.9 A second source of concern is that country characteristics, such as labor-
market or financial-development indicators, are associated simultaneously with a higher
frequency of financial crises and with jobless recoveries. The two sets of controls we have
included in the baseline specification are aimed at addressing these concerns. In this
section we study additional controls related to both episode-specific to country-specific
characteristics. The following list describes each control:

   • Depth of the recession episode (∆PT y). Defined as the log change in GDP per capita
      from output peak to trough. Data source: WEO and WDI.

   • Country’s financial development (fin development). Defined as the country’s histor-
      ical median (1980–2007) of the ratio of bank-provided domestic credit and GDP.
      Data source: WDI.

   • Country size (small country, medium country and large country). Defined as three
      dummy variables measuring the size of the population of a given country: small country
      takes the value one when the country’s population is below 20 million and zero other-
      wise; medium country takes the value one when the country’s population is between
      20 and 80 million and zero otherwise; large country takes the value one when the
      country’s population is above 80 million and zero otherwise. Definition of thresholds
      and data source: Uribe and Schmitt-Grohé (2014).

   • Country fixed effects. This analysis is only carried out for DMs. For EMs, the use
      of fixed effects is problematic as the number of countries in the sample is too large
      in relation to the overall sample, given by the number of recession episodes.

   • Additional labor-market controls. For DMs, we can use an additional set of labor-
      market controls: those constructed by the OECD, which have been used in the
      empirical literature as determinants of unemployment rates across countries (see,
      for example, Scarpetta, 1996). In particular, we use unemployment benefits (ub),
      the coverage of collective bargaining (colcov ), and the degree of unionization of the
      labor force (union).

    Table 5 reports the estimated coefficient associated with financial crises in Equation
(1) including these additional controls. The results indicate that there is little change in

     Blanchard and Summer (1986) depicted the European experience as reflecting hysteresis in unemploy-
ment, a situation in which the natural rate of unemployment depends on the actual rate of unemployment.

of these variables.


3.3   Alternative Measures of Jobless Recoveries

The jobless-recovery measure used in the baseline specification is the change in the un-
employment rate from output peak to recovery. This section studies the robustness of the
results to two possible concerns related to this measure. A first concern might be that
the measure is influenced by a low cyclical rate of unemployment at the output peak.
To address this concern, we construct an alternative measure of jobless recovery, defined
as the difference between the unemployment rate at the recovery point and the natural
rate of unemployment at the output peak (uR − natural u P ). A second concern might be
that the unemployment rate could also influenced by changes in the participation rate.
To address this concern, we construct an alternative measure of jobless recovery defined
as the change in the employment rate between output peak and recovery (∆PR l).
   We estimate Equation (1) with these two alternative measures of jobless recovery for
DMs, in which we have more data coverage on the natural unemployment and employment
rates. The results are presented in Table 6 and confirm the findings that emerged from the
analysis with the change in unemployment rate as a jobless-recovery measure, suggesting
that jobless recoveries are not driven by a low unemployment rate at the output peak or
by changes in the participation rate.
   It is worth noting that the measure of jobless recovery used in this paper differs from
that used in other studies that define a jobless recovery as a deviation from the Okun’s
law, the difference between the unemployment rate and the natural unemployment rate
(see, for example, Ball, Leigh and Loungani, 2013). To compare our findings with these
studies, we decompose our jobless-recovery measure into two components: i) the deviation
from Okun’s law at the recovery point (uR −natural u R ), and ii) the change in the natural
unemployment rate between output peak and recovery point (∆PR natural u). We estimate
Equation (1) for each of these measures. Results are presented in Table 6 and indicate
that the major part of the effect found in this paper is driven by changes in the natural
rate of unemployment. These changes would not be captured in studies that focus only
on deviations from Okun’s law. Nevertheless, our evidence that high-inflation recession
episodes do not display jobless recoveries suggests that, more than an increase in the
“natural rate,” this pattern might be better characterized as persistent unemployment in
the presence of low inflation and nominal rigidities.

4     Financial Crises and Jobless Recoveries: A Simple Ana-
      lytical Framework

This section develops a simple analytical framework to help explain why financial crises
are associated with jobless or wageless recoveries. This framework is based on two ob-
servations. The first observation, widely documented in the literature, is that financial
crises typically impact collateral values (e.g., a fall in housing prices), tightening credit
for firms. For our sample of recession episodes, this is documented in Figure 4. During
financial-crisis episodes, real house prices contract 8.1 percent from output peak to trough
and do not recover once output recover its trend. In other recession episodes, real house
prices only contract 0.8 percent and recover their precrisis level together with output.
    The second observation that motivates our analytical framework is that not all firms’
projects require the same collateral per unit cost. Collateral requirements are lower for
projects and firms possessing easily recognizable collateral (e.g., tangible assets) or “in-
trinsic collateral” (Calvo, 2011). As a large component of such intrinsic collateral is given
by physical capital, tighter lending conditions might imply that credit is directed more
towards projects that involve physical capital at the expense of projects involving job

creation, thus reducing the labor intensity of aggregate output.
    In the rest of this section, we begin by formalizing this hypothesis and then provide
some empirical evidence on the suggested channel. The model is based on a collateral
channel, although it is conceivable that other specifications of the credit market could
lead to similar conclusions.


4.1    Analytical Framework

Consider a firm that produces homogeneous output by means of capital (K) and labor
(L). The production function is denoted by AF (K, L), where A stands for neutral techni-
cal progress, and function F displays positive marginal productivities and strictly convex
isoquants; F is linear homogenous and twice continuously differentiable. Factors of pro-
duction have to be hired a period in advance for which credit is required. Therefore,
assuming that capital is fully depreciated at the end of the period, and the relevant rate
of interest is zero (assumptions that can be relaxed without affecting the central results),
profits are given by
                                          AF (K, L) − (K + W L),                                   (3)

where W stands for the wage rate plus search and other costs associated with labor hiring
(measured in terms of output).
    We assume that firms face a credit constraint,


                                      K + W L ≤ Z + (1 − θ)K,                                      (4)

                                                   20
where Z > 0 and 0 ≤ θ < 1 . The left-hand side of Expression (4) corresponds to credit
needs, while the right-hand side stands for total collateral. Total collateral consists of
“extrinsic collateral,” Z, defined as collateral provided by assets other than those involved
in the project, and “intrinsic collateral,” (1−θ)K, defined as the collateral embodied in the
project. This helps to capture a situation in which, under credit constraints, capital may
be easier to finance than labor. If loans are not repaid, (1 − θ)K can still be recovered by
the creditors. In contrast, funds spent hiring labor cannot be recovered from the workers
(unless somebody more skillful than Shylock is involved in the deal!). If K is its own
collateral, for example, θ = 0, then this constraint boils down to wL ≤ Z: labor would
be the only input subject to a credit constraint, and capital could be accumulated in the
standard manner.
   This form of collateral constraint is related to the literature on the inalienability
of human capital (Hart and Moore, 1994). In this framework, entrepreneurs cannot be
costlessly replaced and can repudiate contracts by withdrawing their human capital. It
is also related to the literature on asset tangibility. For example, Almeida and Campello
(2007) show that pledgeable assets support more borrowing because such assets mitigate
contractibility problems: Tangibility increases the value that can be captured by creditors
in default states. Tangibility as a characteristic of assets used as collateral in debt contracts
plays a central role in the corporate finance literature (Tirole, 2005).
   The firm’s problem is to choose K and L to maximize (3) subject to (4). Denoting
with λ the Lagrange multiplier associated with the credit constraint (4), the optimality
conditions are given by (4), the first-order conditions,


                                    AFK (K, L) = 1 + λθ,                                     (5)

                                   AFL (K, L) = W (1 + λ),                                   (6)


and the complementary slackness conditions,


                               λ ≤ 0,   λ(Z − θK − W L) = 0.                                 (7)


Conceivably, Z is determined by the amount of collateral that the firm can credibly post,
in addition to capital. A financial crisis can be modeled in this context as a contraction in
Z that triggers binding credit constraints. Proposition 1 shows that in this environment,
under binding collateral constraints and for a given Z and W , the profit-maximizing
technology becomes more capital intensive as A increases.


                                               21

                                                  ∂K ∗        ∂L∗
straint (4) is strictly binding (λ > 0),           ∂A    >    ∂A .


Proof: See Appendix B.

       This means that output and capital will grow faster than employment. Employment
will lag behind output, which is the defining characteristic of a jobless recovery.
       Figure 5 illustrates Proposition 1. As in Proposition 1, we focus on the case in which
the credit constraint is strictly binding. The straight line in blue stands for the credit
constraint (4), whose slope is given by −θ/W . The convex curves are isoprofit lines.
Under these conditions, recalling linear homogeneity, one can show that the isoprofit lines
in the (L, K) plane are strictly convex, and have the same slope along constant-L/K rays
from the origin. Solid and dashed lines correspond to two different families of isoprofit
lines. An increase in the neutral technical progress parameter, A, implies that the isoprofit
line becomes steeper,10 and thus an increase in A is equivalent to a shift from the solid
to the dashed isoprofit lines. Equilibrium under the solid lines holds at the blue tangent
point, while that under the dashed lines holds at the red point. Therefore, under binding
credit constraints, an increase in A implies an increase in the capital-to-labor ratio.
       Although a quantitative study including the mechanism suggested in this section is
beyond the scope of this paper, Appendix C presents a numerical experiment using the
analytical framework presented in this section and shows that the model can predict a
jobless recovery in line with the one observed in the data for the US Great Recession.


4.2      Some Empirical Evidence on the Collateral Channel

To further study the transmission mechanism of the analytical framework presented in
the previous section, we relate jobless recoveries to the contraction in collateral values,
using data on real house prices as proxies for collateral values. These data on real house
prices were obtained from Cesa-Bianchi, Cespedes and Rebucci (2014). We estimate an
equation similar to (1):

where ∆PT house p i denotes the change in (log) real house prices from output peak to
trough for recession epsiode i. Due to data availability, we provide evidence only for the
DM sample. Table 7 presents results and suggests a negative relationship between the
house-price contraction from output peak to trough and jobless recoveries. This result
holds for all specifications, using baseline controls and additional controls (Section 3),
such as country fixed effects.

5    Conclusions

Financial crises are associated with bad labor-market outcomes. This is a central piece
of evidence, which this paper shows for both DMs and EMs. An equally important piece
of evidence is that the relationship between financial crises and labor-market outcomes
depends on the inflation during the crisis episode. In low-inflation cases (all DMs cases
and EMs cases that exhibit inflation below 30 percent annual rate during the recession
episode), real wages appear to be downward inflexible, and the brunt of the adjustment
comes in the form of high unemployment, measured at the point at which per-capita out-
put recovers its trend. In contrast, under high inflation (EMs cases that exhibit inflation
above 30 percent annual rate during the recession episode), unemployment goes back to
precrisis levels at the output-recovery point, but real wages are significantly lower.
    This suggests that labor-market outcomes during financial crises cannot easily be
alleviated by standard expansionary monetary policy. For instance, the evidence suggests
that a sharp rise in the price level can help to restore full employment, but at the expense
of sharply lower real wages (close to −13 percent according to the average in high-inflation
EMs; see Figure 2). This indicates that the use of monetary expansion to palliate high
unemployment may encounter severe political opposition. Moreover, the EM experience
is not helpful to assess the political feasibility in DMs because high inflation was an
inevitable consequence of capital flight and resultant maxi-devaluations, not a calculated
policy outcome. It is worth noting, incidentally, that there is no evidence in our sample
that persistent inflation helps to lower unemployment (see Calvo, Coricelli and Ottonello,
2014). In the majority of high-inflation episodes, they occurred mostly within the crisis
window and were followed by a return to previous inflation rates. Therefore, the evidence
in no way contradicts the vertical Phillips curve conjecture.
    Financial-crisis episodes are dramatic events that involve the central nervous system
of capitalist economies. Hence, there are strong a priori intuitive considerations that make
one expect those crises to be deeper and longer than most of the others. It is much less
obvious why the labor market should suffer a significantly more powerful blow. To address
this issue, the paper presents a simple model in which the financial shock takes the form
of a drop in loan collateral values, and firms are assumed to be subject to a binding
collateral constraint. This is a standard assumption in the macroeconomic literature (see,
for example, Brunnermeier, Eisenbach and Sannikov, 2012). The relatively new twist in
the model is that it assumes that labor costs are harder to collateralize than physical
capital because, as a general rule, a share of physical capital can be attached by the


                                            25
creditor in case of default, while hiring costs, for example, are more like “autumn leaves,”
hard to grab and harder to price. This slants credit in favor of capital-intensive projects
and exacerbates a jobless or wageless recovery. Preliminary tests of this conjecture are
encouraging.
    The additional evidence about the role of loan collateral further supports the view
that standard fiscal and monetary policies may be ineffective in speeding full recovery and
suggests that studying policies that address the weaknesses of the credit market should
take center stage. Examples include debt restructuring and labor subsidies. Searching for
policies of this kind that are both effective and politically viable should be at the top
of the policy research agenda to provide guidance to policy intervention during financial
crises.

B    Proof of Proposition 1

Around a solution of the firms’ problem (K ∗ , L∗ ) in which λ > 0, the complementary
slackness condition (7) implies that (4) holds with equality: (Z − θK − W L) = 0. First,
consider the case with θ > 0. This means that L = (Z/W − (θ/W )K) ≡ L(K), with
∂L(K)/∂K < 0. Combining conditions (5) and (6), we obtain
                                                            
                                     W                    1
          S(K, A) ≡ A FL (K, L(K)) −   FK (K, L(K)) + W     − 1 = 0.
                                     θ                    θ

By the implicit function theorem,

                                 ∂K   ∂S(K, A)/∂K
                                    =             .
                                 ∂A   ∂S(K, A)/∂A

If θ < 1, ∂K/∂A > 0 since
                                                             
          ∂S(K, A)                     W                W     1
                   =    FL (K, L(K)) −   FK (K, L(K)) =    1−     <0
            ∂A                         θ                A     θ

and, by linear homogeneity and diminishing return on each factor,

                             ∂L(K) W         W    ∂L(K)
                 FLK + FLL        −   FKK + − FKL       > 0.
                              ∂K    θ        θ     ∂K

Finally (4) holding with equality implies that ∂L/∂A < 0 and thus ∂L/∂A < ∂K/∂A.
Second, consider the case with θ = 0. Equation (4) holding with equality implies that
L = Z/W and thus ∂L/∂A = 0. Equation (5) implies that AFK (K, Z/W ) = 1, and the
implicit function theorem implies that ∂K/∂A > 0 and thus ∂L/∂A < ∂K/∂A.


C    A Quantitative Exercise of the Analytical Framework

In this section, we perform a simple quantitative exercise to show that the analytical
framework presented in Section 4 can rationalize actual jobless recovery episodes. In
particular, we calibrate the model and compare its predictions with actual data from the
US Great Recession. We begin by assuming the technology is Cobb–Douglas:


                                    F (K, L) = K α L1−α .                            (9)


We assume, for simplicity, that θ = 0, corresponding to the case in which K is its own
collateral. Furthermore, we assume that real wages are constant (∆wt = 0 for every t).


                                             31
This assumption is consistent with US data for the Great Recession (Shimer, 2012). We
now solve the model for the case in which the credit constraint is binding, and thus
Equation (4) holds with equality. Thus, wL = Z and profits can be expressed as


                                AZ 1−α = K α − (K + Z).                            (10)


The first-order condition with respect to capital implies

                                            1        1
                                    K = α 1−α ZA 1−α .                             (11)


Hence, assuming discrete time and denoting for any variable X, ∆xt = log Xt − log Xt−1 ,
we get


                                         ∆lt = ∆zt                                 (12)
                                          1
                                 ∆kt =       ∆at + ∆zt .                           (13)
                                         1−α

Our aim is to compare the model’s prediction for L and K with US data during the
Great Recession. The time unit is set equal to a quarter. We obtain data for L, K, A
and utilization from Fernald (2012). For L, we use hours worked; for A, we use total
factor productivity adjusted by utilization. We estimate Z, as the process consistent
with the model that reproduces the actual behavior of Y , that is, using (12) and (13),
∆zt = ∆yt − 1/(1 − α)∆at . Following the estimate of Fernald (2012) for 2007, we set
α = 0.35 the year prior to the crisis. Results are presented in Figure 6. Panels a) and
b) show the behavior of A and Z, the model’s inputs. It can be seen that A increases
throughout the episode, while the estimated Z displays a sharp contraction, consistent
with the behavior of output. Panels c) and d) depict the behavior of L and K. It can
be observed that employment behavior predicted by the model tracks closely the actual
path of employment. In particular, the model predicts a jobless recovery similar to the
one observed in the data.
