           International   Evidence on the Persistence of Economic fluctuations




                                           ABSTRACT



         This   paper presents new evidence on the persistence of fluctuations in

    real GNP.     Two measures of persistence are estimated non-parametricaFly using

    post-war quarterly data from Canada, France, Germany, Italy,       Japan,   the United

    Kingdom,    and the United States.   These estimates are compared with Monte Carlo

    results from various AR(2J processes.      For six Out of seven countries, the

    results indicate that a 1 percent shock to output should change the on9-run

    univariate forecast of output by well over     1   percent.   Low-order   ARM   models

    for output growth are also estimated, and yield similar conclusions.

    Finally,    the persistence in relative outputs of different countries is

   examined.

I.      Introduction

        Since the provocative work of Nelson and Plosser (1982), much research

has been devoted to the question of whether, and to what extent, fluctuations

n     real GNP are trend-reverting.     In contrast to what was the prevailing view

only a few years ago, it appears that shocks to real OMP do not dissipate

in five or ten years.       Indeed,   it is hard to reject the view that real GNP is

as persistent as a random walk with drift.

        Most of the recent work addressing the persistence question has used

data for the United States.       Yet in post-war United States data, there are

only eight non-overlapping five—year intervals.        One would thus expect that

such data can provide only an imprecise estimate of persistence. The Monte

Carlo experiments reported in Campbell       and Mankiw (1987b) and below in this

paper indeed confirm that it is difficult to estimate persistence with such a

small data set.

        One strategy for obtaining more information about persistence is to

expand the data set by using United States data from before the war.         Nelson

and Plosser use data beginning in 1909, and Cochrane (1986) uses data

beginning in 18S9.       The primary problem with such an approach is that the

older data may not be comparable to the newer data.        In Campbell and Mankiw

(1967a),    we report that the persistence properties of the data from 1869 to

1930 are very different from the persistence properties of the data since

1930.     Romer'S (1987) recent re-examination of GNP    data   from before World War

I    indicates   that there are serious deficiencies in the construction of the

older data.      her results call into question the reliability of using pre-war

data to estimate the persistence of economic fluctuations.
                                         —2-


     A second strategy for obtaining more information on persistence, which

is adopted   by Stulz and Wasserfallen   (1985), Kormendi and McGuire (1987), and

in this paper, is to expand the data Set by using data from other Countries.

Here we examine data from Canada, France, Germany,      Italy,   Japan, the United

Kingdom, and the United States.    The estimate of persistence we obtain for

every country other than the United Kingdom exceeds that for the United

States.   It is hard to reconcile the data from most of these countries with

the view that fluctuations in output dissipate in five or ten years.

     international data can also shed light on whether, as Lucas (1977)

suggests, "all business cycles are alike."      A stylized fact often noted about

United States post—war quarterly data is that the first autocorrelation of

the growth rate is positive (Blanchard 1981, Kydland and Prescott 1980).

Here we show that this autocorrelation is larger for the United States than

for any other country we study.    in fact,    for France, Germany, and the United

Kingdom, the first autocorrelation of output growth is negative.

     Section II of this paper defines more precisely what we mean by the

"persistence" of economic fluctuations, while Section III discusses how these

persistence measures can be estimated nonparametrically. Section IV presents

some Monte Carlo results to shed light on the small sample properties of

these estimators of persistence under different assumptions regarding the

true stochastic process.   Section V describes the data, and Section VI

presents the single-country results.     Section VII examines the relative

output of different countries.    Section VIII concludes.

It.     Two Concepts of Persistence

        What is persistence? For some purposes, a shock to an econo.y say be

considered persistent if it lasts for more than one period. Here, however, we

take persistence as meaning "continuing for a long time into the future," More

formally, suppose that the change in log of GNP is a stationary process with

moving average representation


(1)     t
where 4(L) i      I   +
                          41L
                                +
                                    42L2
                                           +
                                               43L3
                                                      P           is   an infinite polynomial in the lag

operator, and             is white noise. The impact of a shock in period t on the

growth rate in period t+k is 4k'                  The impact of the shock on the leve' of GNP

in period t+k is therefore I +                    +           +           The ultimate        impact   of the

shock on the level of GNP equals the infinite sum of these moving average

coefficients, which is A(1).                   The value of 4(1) is the measure of persistence

we proposed in our previous paper (1987a).                             For a random walk, 4(1) equals

one for any series stationary around a deterministic                                 trend,   4(1) equals

zero.

        Cochrane (1986) has recently proposed another measure of persistence,

which has also been studied in Campbell and Mankiw (1987a) and Huizinga

(1967).     His measure can be written either as a ratio of variances or as a

function of autocorrelations;



(2)          vk             Var(Y+k+l_Y)                  m   1 + 2 E            —
                                                                            (1
                      k+1                                              j1
                                Var(V1_Y)

where p     is the 3th autocorrelation of                                     foflows     a random walk.

then the variance of the (k+1)-lagged difference is (k+1) times the variance
                                                —4-


of the once-lagged difference. Hence, for a random walk, the above

expression         is one for all k.        For any stationary series, the variance of

the (k+1)-lagged difference approaches twice the variance of the series, which

is a finite constant.           Hence,   for any stationary series,     approaches zero

for large k.       The limit of the variance ratio is thus a natural measure of

persistence.

        The limiting variance ratio, which we call V. is simple and intuitively

appealing. Note that


(3)          Vs li       vk s   I   + 2 E p..
                   k-'                 •j1

if a stochastic process reverts to a deterministic time trend,             then one would

expect unusually low growth rates (recessions) to be followed by unusually

high growth rates (recoveries). Thus, at some lags, one would expect

negative autocorrelations. As equation (3) shows, trend reversion is

captured by this measure of persistence, since V incorporates all of these

Sutocorrelations.

        The two concepts of persistence are closely related.          For two simple and

important cases -- a stationary process and a random walk --             the   two measures

of persistence A(l) and V produce the same number. More generally, however,

the two measures are not exactly the same.            Define P2 •   I — Var(e)/Var(AY),
the fraction of the variance that is predictable from knowledge of the past

history of the process.             Then A(i) can be expressed as



(4)         A(1)



Equation (4) shows that the square root of Cochrane's measure of persistence

is    a lower bound on A(1).         The more highly predictable is the differenced
                                             —5—


process, the greater is the disparity between the two measures.



III. Estimating Persistence

      One can estimate the persistence measure V very simply by replacing the

population autocorrelations in equation (2) with the sample autocorrelations.1

The estimator is

                               k
(5)             Qk        1÷2                J


As long as k increases with the sample size, this estimator consistently

estimates V.2

          It is also possible to compute nonparametrically an approximate estimate

of A(1), called A (1), as




(6)




The estimate of A(1) is computed by replacing the R2 in equation (4) with

the square of the first autocorrelation. Since               is   an underestimate of
                                                        p
P2. except for         an AR(1} process, this estimate tends to understate A(1).

          In any given sample,     it is of course necessary to choose k, the number    of

autocorrelations to include.           Including too few autocorrelations may obscure

trend reversion manifested in higher autocorrelations. Including too many

autocorrelations may tend to find excessive trend reversion;              as k

approaches the sample size 1, the estimator approaches zero.              Since the

sample mean has been removed from the data, vk is           identically   zero at

k     I    -   1.    Hence, while large k appears preferable, k must be small relative

to the sample size.
                                                 —6-


        For the case In which     t        is a random walk with drift, the mean value      of

      is approximately {T-k)/T rather than one (Campbell            and Mankiw, 1987b).

Therefore, to correct for this downward bias, we multiply                  by 17(1-k).

Although it reduces somewhat the comparability of these results with those in

out previous papers, this bias correction makes the estimates easier to

interpret.



IV.     Monte Carlo Results

        This Section presents some Monte Carlo results for the estimators of A(1)

and V discussed above. The Monte Carlo experiment is designed to examine more

precisely the choice of window size (k) and to judge the ability of the

estimates to distinguish between different stochastic processes.

        The true process is assumed to be an AR)?) process


(7)         (1—r1L)(1_r2L)Y           Et

where       is H(O,   2)   and
                                 r1
                                      and r2 are the two roots of the process.       If both

      end r2 are less than one, then the process is stationary.             If r1   or

r2equals one, then the process for ''              is   integrated, that is, it is

stationary only after differencing.

       While the process in equation (7) does not include a trend in V. the

presence of such a trend would not affect the Monte Carlo results in any way.

All the statistics we examine are computed from the demeaned values of                   t.V.


Any deterministic trend In V would be eliminated when we Subtract the sample

mean.

        For the larQer root, we try values of 0.8. 0.9, 0.95, and 1.0.               For the

smaller root, we try values of 0.0,0.25,                and 0.5.   We thus simulate twelve
                                            —7—


different AR(2} processes.         To gauge the persistence of these various

parameter combinations, we present in Table         I   the time impulse responses to a

unit shock at horizons of 20, 40, and 80 quarters.           Table 2 shows the first

four population autocorrelations of changes in the processes, while Table 3

shows variance ratios            computed as in the right hand side of equation (2)

using population autocorrelations, for k           20, 40, and 60.

        The   autocorrelation   patterns in Table 2 are of three different types.      If

the smaller root is 0.0 (so that the process is an AR(1) in levels),           then all

autocorrelations of the differenced process are negative or zero.           If the

larger root is 1.0 (so that the process is an AR(1) in differences), then all

autocorrelations of the differenced process are positive or zero.           If the

smaller root is greater than 0.0 anq the larger root is less than 1.0, then

the lowest-order autocorrelations are positive and higher-order

autocorrelations are negative.         For these last processes the limiting variance

ratio V is zero but the variance ratio            may approach V quite slowly.   For

the process with roots (0.95,0.5), for example, vk in Table 3 is 1.78 at k

20.    clearly it would be hard to distinguish this process from a unit root

process even if one knew the true          at k    20, 40,   or   60.

        In practice, of course, a further problem arises because we must estimate

      using vk.   To see what effect this has, we run a small Monte Carlo

experiment. For each process, we simulate a sample and then compute the

estimates of persistence. There are 500 replications, and each has 100

observations, which is a typical number of post-war quarterly observations we

use below.      Tables 4 and 5 report the means of the two persistence estimates

for K     20, 40,   and 60, as well as the standard deviations of the estimates.
                                                    -8-



        The results show how           difficult   it is to distinguish between different

representations on the basis of these nonparametric persistence estimates.

For k =    40,   the mean estimate of V is 1.02 for both a random walk and the

stationary AR(2) with roots (0.95,O.2S). The associated standard deviations

are substantial, but they are smaller for less persistent processes.

        The finding that the standard deviation of                  is smaller for less

persistent processes has an important implication. It is easier to reject

the hypothesis that a less persistent process generated                  a   data set with high

values of          than it is to reject the hypothesis that a more persistent

process generated a data set with low values of vk.                  For example, if we

observe vk —       1.0   for k     40,   we can reject roots of (0.9,0.25) at

conventional significance levels.              On the other hand, if we observe               0.1

for k      40,   we cannot reject roots of 11.0,0.5).



V.      The Data

     We examine quarterly data from seven major countries: Canada,                     France,

Germany, Italy,      Japan,      the United Kingdom,      and the United States.      These

countries make up the "Group of Seven" (07) which meets periodically to

coordinate macroeconomic policy. All the data are taken from the data banks

maintained by Data Resources, Inc., which obtains the data originally from

the International Monetary Fund's Internptional Financial Statistics.3

        For each country, we use real Gross National Product (GNP) or real Gross

Domestic Product (GOP), whichever is supplied by the International Monetary

Fund.    In those cases In which both nominal             i3NP   and nominal GOP are

available, we compared           the   two real.series underthe assumption of a common..
                                             -9-


deflator.     The diference in results was extremely minor.         We concluded that

for our purposes,      the differences between GNP and GOP are not important.

         In each case, we used the longest series of quarterly data available in

this data bank.       The sample periods are:

                                                                 Number of
             Country                    Sample                  Observations

             Canada (GNP)             57:1   — 86:2                118
             France (GOP)             65:1   -   86:2               85
             Germany (GNPJ            60:1   — 86:2                106
                                             —
             Italy (GOP)              60:1       85:1              101
             Japan (GNP)              57:1   — 86:2                118
             U.K. (GOP)               57:1   — 86:2                118
             U.S.   (GNF)             57:1     86:3                119


        All the data, except that for the United Kingdom, are seasonally

adjusted.     To make the U.K. data comparable to the other data, we seasonally

adjusted them using the X-11 program used-to adjust U.S. data.           (The program

is that available in EPS by Data Resources, Inc.)          The persistence estimates

for Britain using data adjusted     by X-11 were largely the same as those
obtained with the unadjusted data and with data adjusted by seasonal dummies.



VI.     Single Country Results

        In this section we examine the persistence properties      of the data from
our seven countries, considered separately. In Table & we present the first

16 autocorrelations of the change in log real output for each of the

countries. The top half of Table 7 reports the persistence estimates                and

Ak(l)    for window sizes k    20, 40, and 60.

        The results for the United States,       in the right-hand column of each

table,    are similar to those reported in Campbell and Mankiw (1981a, 1987b).4

The first autocorrelation of U.S. output growth is 0.3. subsequent
                                           -10-


autocorrelations die off rapidly, and there is a string of small negative

correlations between lags 4 and 9.        The persistence measures      for the u.s.

fall from 1.11 with k      20, to 0.70 with k = 50.     Comparing the first few

autocorrelations with the numbers in Table 2, they appear consistent with

roots of (1.0,0.25), (0.95,0.25), (0.95,0.5) or even (0.9,0.5) for U.S.

output.    Comparing the persistence measures in Table 7 with the Monte Carlo

results in Tables 4 and 5, the same combinations of roots appear to be

consistent with the data.     These results indicate once again how hard it is to

distinguish a process with permanent shocks from one with shocks which die out

slowly.

     The results for other Countries are less ambiguous than those for the

United States.    With the exception of the United Kingdom, all the other

countries have persistence measures at k =        40and k   = 60 that are higher

than the U.S. measures, and higher than any of the stationary AR(2) processes

we simulate.     In fact, at k — 60 the      measures for these countries are all

higher than       of the processes we simulate, including the highly persistent

processes with a unit root.    These results are not due to very large positive

low—order autocorrelations, since Canada, Italy and Japan have small positive

first autocorrelations, and France and Germany actually have negative first

autocorrelations.    Rather, the persistence of fluctuations in these countries

is due to the absence of many small negative autocorrelations in output

growth.5

     The exception to the pattern of persistence is the United Kingdom.            The

first five autocorrelations of British output growth are all negative, and

the persistence measures are less than one.        These results are robust to the
                                           —11—


method used to deseasonalize the British data.        The British results Suggest a

process such as an AR(2) with roots of (0.9,0.25) or (O.95,0}.        Yet the

results are consistent with substantial persistence since our Monte Carlo

study showed very large standard deviations of            for persistent processes.

The U.K. estimates are less than one standard deviation below the mean

estimates for a random walk.6

        As a check on the robustness of our results, we also estimated ARMA

models for output growth in each country.         We repeated the procedures of

Campbell and P4ankiw (lYala), omitting the U.S.7       We used an exact maximum

likelihood procedure to estimate models with up to 2 autoregressive and 2

moving average parameters, and for each model we computed the impulse

response function at a horizon of 60 quarters.        This is an estimate of the

persistance measure A(1).        We also calculated the value of the Akaike

Criterion for each model; this is one possible way to choose a "best"         ARM
representation.

        The   ARM   results are fully consistent with the nonparametric results on

persistence. In Canada, the likelihood function is rather flat; the Akaike

Criterion picks an AR(1) model for output growth, with an A(1) value of 1.15,

but all the other estimated models give similar persistence estimates.          In

France,   the Akaike Criterion picks the ARMA(1,2} model.      This and the

ARMA(2,2} have considerably higher likelihoods than the lower-order models.

They give A(1) estimates of 1.65 and 1.71 respectively, while the lower—order

models estimate A(jJ to be less than unity.         In Germany, the ARMA(2,2) has a

much higher likelihood than any lower—order model, and it estimates A(1} at

1.00;    the lower-order models deliver similar persistence estimates.        In Italy,
                                      -12-


the likelihood function is again quite flat,    The Akaike Criterion picks an

AR(1) model, but the ARMA(2,2) is nearly as good.     All the estimated models

have A(1) values of between 1.14 and 1.32.     In Japan, the Akaike Criterion

picks the ARHA(1,2) model, with an A(1) estimate of 3.67.       The ARMA(1,1),

ARMA(2,1) and ARMA(2,2) models have similar likelihoods and similar

persistence estimates.   Finally, in the U.K. the Akaike Criterion picks an

MA(1) model with a persistence estimate of 0.82.    The higher-order models give

lower persistence estimates, and the ARMA(1,2) and ARMA(2,2) models estimate

the impulse response at 80 quarters to be as low as 0.06.

     In principle, as Cochrane (1986) has pointed out, it is possible for

low-order ARMA models and nonparametric methods to give very different

persistence estimates.   In practice, we have found that this is not the case.

For every country we study, except the United Kingdom, both nonparametric and

ARMA estimates of persistence exceed unity, while in the U.K. both estimates

of persistence are small.

     Table B presents non-parametric bias-corrected persistence estimates for

two subsa.ples.   We split the period in 1972:4, approximately the time of the

worldwide productivity slowdown.   These figures tell a far less consistent

story.   For example, prior to 1973, fluctuations in Canada seem highly

persistent while those in France seem transitory.    After 1973, fluctuations

in Canada appear to become transitory while those   -in   France become

persistent.   These results are difficult totnterpret in part because

persistence is not well estimated with such short time series.       Moreover, the

break point in 1972 is implicitly based on the data, which affects-the

statistical properties of the estimator in unknown ways.            -'

       The results in laDle 8 suggest the possibility that there was a change

in the wean growth rate and that failing to account for this change biases

the previous persistence estimates In each country,         the mean growth rate

fell   in the second subsample, typically by 0.6 percent per quarter.

Estimating persistence in the presence of non-linear deterministic trends is

a potential topic for future research.



VII.   Cross-Country   Results.

       In the previous section, we found considerable persistence in real output

fluctuations for six out of seven countries,      An interesting further question

is whether fluctuations in relative real output (defined as the difference in

log real output between one country and another) are also persistent. It is

entirely possible that they are not, that when one    country grows    particularly

fast relative to another this good fortune tends to    be reversed subsequently.

In the extreme, relative reel output for some countries might       be stationary

around a fixed mean or trend, such countries would have cointegrated real

output processes with a cointegratirig vector of (1 -1) (Engle and Granger

(1981)).

       In Table 9 we compute bias-corrected persistence measures for relative

real output for each pair of countries in our sample.-       To conserve space we

report results only for a window size k       40; results   fork    20 and 60 are

similar.    The bottom left part of the table gives bims_correctedVk, while the

top right of the table gives bias-corrected Ak(l).

       Some of the results in Table 9 could be predicted from the single-country

results.    British output fluctuations are highly transitory and Japanese
                                       —14—


 fluctuations are highly persistent.   It is not surprising that these

properties carry over when fluctuations are measured relative to other

countries' output.    A striking new result in Table 9, however, is that Canada,

France, Germany and Italy form a group whose relative output fluctuations are

transitory, even though their absolute output fluctuations are persistent.

The bias-corrected      statistics for relative output within this group never

exceed 0.46, while the equivalent statistics for absolute output are all

larger than 2.13.    Real output in the United States moves more independently;

U.S. fluctuations relative to other countries are
                                                  generally about as

persistent as fluctuations in U.S. output itself.

     Even though fluctuations in relative real output are quite transitory for

so.e countries, there is no strong evidence that relative real
                                                               output is

stationary for any pair of countries. Dickey—Fuller tests with an

autoregressive correction of order 1 through 4 fail to reject the null

hypothesis that relative real output levels for Canada, France, Germanyand

Italy have a unit root.    The tests proposed by Stock and Watson 11987), which

allow arbitrary linear combinations of different countries' outputs to be

stationary, also fail to find evidence that there are any stationary

co.tinations.8



VIII. Conclusion
- :
     In Campbell andMankiw {1987a), weconfirmed the resultinNelson and            -




Plosser   (1982) that fluctuations In U.S. output appear highly persistent.   A
one percent shock to output shouldchange the univariate forecast of output by

over one percent over any foreseeable horizon.   Here we have examined data
                                                —15—


from six other countries.             With the sole exception of the United Kingdom,

output appears more persistent in these other countries.

        We find persistence in six Out of seven countries despite the fact that

there are substantial differences across countries in the individual

autocorrelations of output growth.            The first autocorrelation, for example,

ranges from 0.30 in the U.S. to -0.38 in France, while the second ranges

from 0.19 in the U.S. to -0.07 in Germany.             Because of these differences, we

have not tried to pool data from different countries by assuming that they

are generated by a single underlying stochastic process.              We have studied the

behavior of relative output (the difference in log output across countries),

and have found some evidence that relative output levels for Canada, France,

Germany, and ttaly are less persistent than the levels of output of these

countries considered in isolation.

        Our results shed some light on different strategies which have been

suggested for estimating persistence.             In Campbell and Kankiw (1987a),    we
modeled the change in log output as a stationary ARMA process,             estimated the

parameters of this process using exact maximum likelihood, and then Inferred

persistence from the estimated parameters.9 iere we have adopted the

non-parametric approach suggested by Cochrane (1985).

        There are several advantages to the non—parametric approach.             First, the

results are obviously not dependent on a particular paraaeerization.

Second, it is clear which sample moments drive the estimates.              Third, the

estimator is computationally simple.            The advantages of this approach thus
                                                  -
appear substantial.

        One purpose    of   this   paper has been to examine this   approach   more closely

using    Monte Carlo    techniques.      We have shown that the simplest non-parametric
                                         —16-


estimator of persistence can suffer from severe downward bias; this can be

approximately eliminated for the case of a random walk process by a sample

degrees of freedom correction.      We have also shown   that   highly persistent

processes can generate data that do not appear persistent, but that

transitory processes are much less likely to generate apparently persistent

data.

        Future work might attempt to examine more systematically the pros and

cons of the different approaches.      It is reasonable to conjecture that the

parametric approach yields more efficient estimates of persistence if the

parameterization    is correct, but yields inconsistent estimates      if   the

parameterization    is incorrect.   For the data examined here, the     estimates   of

persistence obtained in practice with the non-parametric approach are similar            -




to   those obtained with the parametric ARMA approach.      This finding suggests

that simple ARMA models well    approximate GNP   data for these seven countries.

1.      We compute the         autocovariance as the sum of the T-j cross products

divided by T-j.     This computation does not guarantee that         is positive.

Dividing the T-j cross-products by T would guarantee a positive estimate.            In

practice, as long as k is small relative to T, the difference is not

important.


2.      The estimator         can be interpreted in terms of the frequency domain.   As

Priestley (1982, p. 463) shows, vk is the estimate of the normalized spectral

density at frequency zero that uses a "Bartlett window."         A result in spectral

analysis gives the asymptotic standard error of            as

                         if   4 (k+1}

where T is the sample size.          Monte Carlo results, however, lead us to be

skeptical about the usefulness of this standard error in samples of typical

size.    See also Lo and MacKinlay (1981).


3.      The International Financial Statistics contain quarterly national income

accounts data for relatively few countries, and these data are often available

for only a short period.         We include all the major countries for which data

are available.


4.      Small differences are due to the shorter sample period of this paper.


5.      The most extreme case is Japan.       Here the autocorrelations show no

tendency to die away to zero, suggesting that Japmnese output growth may have
                                            -18-


a    unit root.   This would be an extreme form of persistence. Dickey—Fuller

tests with autoregressive corrections of order 0 through 4 reject at the it

level the null hypothesis that Japanese output growth has a unit root (as it

also does for the other countries in our sample);       however, Schwert (1987) has

shown    n   a Monte Carlo study that Unit root    tests are   biased towards false

rejection when the data are generated by an integrated ARM process with a

large moving average root.         This problem may be affecting the Dickey—Fuller

test for Japanese output growth.


6.     Stockman (1987) also finds that U.K. output is less persistent than that

of other European countries. We note that even for the U.k. there is no clear

evidence that output is stationary around a determistic level.
                                                                        Dickey—Fuller
tests with autoregressive corrections of order 0 through 4 fail to
                                                                   reject at
even the lOt level the null hypothesis that the level of U.K. real GDP has a

Unit root.


7.     Detailed   ARM   results for the U.S. are reported in Campbell and Mankiw

{1987a).                               -




8.     This result holds whether we carry Out the tests
                                                        using data from all
seven countries, from a group of six excluding Japan, from a
                                                             group of five

excluding Japan and the U.K., or from a group of four excluding Japan, .the

        and the U.S.


9.     Another approach to estimating persistence-is the use-of unobserved

components models (e.g., Watson,--1g86;Clark, 1987). As discussed-in

Campbell     and Mankiw (1987b).   these models can be viewed as imposing
                                      —19—


restrictions on ARMA models.   In this sense, the unobserved components models

are the most parametric.   Without strong reasons to believe these restrictions

a priori, however, a less strict parameterization appears preferable.

Note;   This table presents variance ratios, measured as
        wei9hted sums of autocorrelations,
               k
              E (1—j/(k+i))p., for k = 20, 40, and 60,
             j=1
        for the AR(2) processes we simulate below.
        These sums are persistence measures that use
        population autocorrelatlons rather than sample
        autocorrelations.
