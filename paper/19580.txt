We present new data documenting European capital issues in major financial centers from 1919 to 1932.
Push factors (conditions in international capital markets) perform better than pull factors (conditions
in the borrowing countries) in explaining the surge and reversal in capital flows. In particular, the sharp
increase in stock market volatility in the major financial centers at the end of the 1920s figured importantly
in the decline in foreign lending. We draw parallels with Europe today.

        1.   Introduction

        From 2001 through 2008 one half of Europe received enormous capital inflows from the

other half of Europe and the rest of the world. Starting in 2009, the recipients then experienced a

sudden stop, a capital-account reversal, and an economic and financial crisis.                    From 1924

through 1928 one half of Europe received enormous capital inflows from the other half of

Europe and the rest of the world. Starting in 1929, the recipients then experienced a sudden stop,

a capital-account reversal, and an economic and financial crisis.

        The fact that there are parallels between the economic and financial crises in Europe in

the interwar years and today is invoked frequently, if mainly at an anecdotal level. And while

there exist a number of empirical studies of the determinants of capital flows in Europe

following the creation of the euro (see e.g. Ahearne, Schmitz and von Hagen 2008, Lane and

Pels 2012), there are few comparable analyses of capital movements in the 1920s and 1930s. In

this paper we fill this gap with a new analysis of the determinants of capital flows and capital-

account reversals between the wars. While we mainly seek to shed light on interwar experience,

we hope in addition that our analysis will provide new perspective on the financial crisis in

Europe today.

        Interwar capital flows have of course been studied before. Contemporary accounts like

Harris (1935) focused on the German case and argued that foreign lending in the 1920s was

perverse, unproductive and unsustainable.1 Nurkse (1944) generalized the point, arguing that

capital movements were erratic in the 1920s and destabilizing in the 1930s, although he was not

always explicit about what he meant by erratic and destabilizing.2 The parallels with ex-post

indictments of capital flows to peripheral Europe in the years leading up to the 2008-9 financial

crisis are evident.

        Despite this, a systematic analysis of European capital flows in the 1920s and early 1930s

does not appear to exist. Such analysis might address questions like the following. How large

were the capital surge and reversal compared with the recent eurozone episode? What was the

relative importance of private versus official flows? What were the main drivers of observed

capital movements? To what extent did changes in borrowing countries’ conditions and in global

capital markets’ conditions affect the direction and volume of flows?

        In this paper we seek to address these questions. Our data on gross long-term private

capital issues on account of European countries are drawn from an unpublished compendium of

capital movements in Europe in the Mudd Library at Princeton University and evidently

authored by Ragnar Nurkse (1943).3 In addition, we provide some analysis of net capital flows.

Our framework is in the spirit of recent analyses of the retrenchment of capital flows at the time

of the 2008-9 financial crisis such as Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2011).

        We show that capital flows to the European recipients were large: in 1927, the aggregate

current account deficit of Austria, Germany and Hungary was nearly 5% of their aggregate GDP.

At the same time, however, this was smaller than the collective current account deficit of Greece,

Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal in 2008 (6.7% of their collective GDP).4 On the other hand,

the subsequent reversal was even larger in the early 1930s: the shift in Central European

countries’ current account deficit between 1927 and 1931 represented 6.0% of their collective


3
  Some similar analysis appears in Nurkse’s 1944 classic, International Currency Experience, published by the
League of Nations. The Financial Section and Economic Intelligence Service of the League, for which Nurkse
worked, was transferred to Princeton following the outbreak of World War II. Private capital flows include League
of Nations-sponsored loans as well as loans extended in conjunction with the Dawes and Young Plans, since these
were underwritten by private investment banks and placed with private investors.

  Computed by aggregating current account deficits and GDP at market exchange rates. Unless otherwise stated this
is our convention throughout.


                                                                                                               3
GDP, whereas between 2008 and 2011, by comparison, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and

Spain experienced a current account contraction amounting to “only” 3.2 per cent of their

aggregate GDP. The much larger provision of official financing in the more recent episode

largely accounts for this difference. In other words, net private capital outflows from European

debtors were in fact larger in 2011 than in 1931 but they were also compensated by much larger

inflows of official capital.

          We find further that push factors (conditions in international capital markets) do better

than pull factors (conditions in the borrowing countries) in explaining the surge and reversal. In

particular, the sharp increase in stock market volatility in the major financial centers at the end of

the 1920s figured importantly in the decline in foreign lending. In parallel with the recent

episode of flows from Northern to Southern Europe, analyses attributing the surge of lending and

then its reversal to policy distortions in the borrowing countries capture only part of the story.

This pattern is strikingly like that detected by Milesi-Ferretti and Tille in the run-up to the recent

crisis.

          In Section 2 we describe the data. Section 3 then uses them to characterize the lending

surge and reversal periods. Sections 4 and 5 focus on pull and push factors in turn, while Section

6 provides a detailed analysis of the capital-flow-reversal episode. Section 7, concluding, returns

to implications for today.



          2.   Data

          Our analysis of the determinants of capital flows employs new estimates of private bond

issues in six major financial centers: New York, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Stockholm and




                                                                                                    4
Zurich.5 These estimates, spanning the period 1919 to 1932, were compiled from an anonymous,

typewritten, pencil-annotated memo in the Ragnar Nurkse papers at Princeton University’s Mudd

Library.6 This document, dated June 1943 and entitled “Europe’s Capital Movements, 1919-

1932: A Statistical Note,” was prepared for the League of Nations. Nurkse was almost certainly

its author or at least contributed substantially to its making.7 The memo contains detailed yearly

information on the total volume of bond issues on account of European countries. Data are

broken down by recipient country and type of borrower (central and provincial

governments/municipalities/corporations). The memo covers 28 European countries and

comprises, it would appear, the population of European bond issues in the six centers. Detailed

commentary indicates that much careful work was done to place new issues in different financial

centers on a comparable basis and thus address the inconsistency problems of other sources.8

        Whereas other contemporary and historical studies of international capital movements

rely on estimates of net capital flows computed from balance-of-payment statistics, we work here

mainly with gross primary issues.               Gross as opposed to net capital flows have several

advantages. First, reliable balance-of-payments statistics for the pre-World War II period only

exist for a few countries. Second, the capital account is constructed as the residual item of the

balance of payments and is therefore subject to reliability problems.9 Third, focusing on net

capital flows can cause one to miss important parts of the story. Fostel and Kaminsky (2007)

note that net capital flows say little about countries’ ability to “tap international capital markets,”

  Thus, we exclude official capital flows and short-term credits extended by central banks and governments.

as a zero net flow might very well reflect a large (gross) inflow counterbalanced by a large

(gross) outflow. They therefore recommend using international primary issuance as an indicator

of access to foreign finance. Broner et al. (2013), Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2011), Fratzscher

(2012), and Forbes and Warnock (2012) also stress the importance of considering gross capital

flows in sudden-stop episodes as a way of distinguishing the behavior of foreign and domestic

investors. While there is a handful of studies of gross long-term capital issues in the nineteenth

century (Clemens and Williamson, 2004, Catao, 2007, Esteves, 2007), we are not aware of

similar work for the interwar years. Moreover, work on the classical gold standard has focused

on capital issues in one or two financial centers.10 Our data, in contrast, track European bond

issues in all major financial centers in the 1919-1932 period.11

         Naturally our data also have limitations. Most importantly, they exclude short-term

capital movements.12 Short-term loans constituted a non-negligible part of capital flows and

were used extensively in financing trade.13 Then there was the steady amortization (retirement)

by previous borrowers of their outstanding obligations. There was also some repatriation of

foreign securities to investors in the issuing countries; Lary (1943) and Bloomfield (1950)

observe that with the normalization of economic conditions in Europe in the second half of the

1920s, securities issued abroad by governments and corporations became more attractive to

   Clemens and Williamson (2004) focus on primary issues on the London market in the 1865-1913 period, using the
data collected by Jenks (1927) and Simon (1968), and later updated by Stone (1999). Esteves compares the
determinants of capital issues in Britain and Germany, using original data for the German Stock Exchange
assembled from a range of primary sources. Catao (2007) and Bordo, Cavallo and Meissner (2010) have also
explored the determinants of sudden stops during the 1880-1913 period using alternatively London gross primary
capital issues and net capital inflows.
11
   Anon (1943), p. 25 notes that long-term bond and share issues outside the six centers in our data base were
minimal. For example, it is estimated that 97.7 per cent of Germany’s long-term loans were floated on these six
markets.

   Limited direct evidence is available on the magnitude and direction of short-term capital flows, the best discussion
of which we are aware being Conolly (1936).

   Such as, in the U.S. case, the short-term instrument known as trade acceptances, a considerable fraction of which
was purchased by foreign investors in the 1920s (see Lary 1943 and Eichengreen and Flandreau 2012).


                                                                                                                     6
domestic investors.14 Finally, there was opportunistic repatriation starting in 1931 of foreign

bonds in default that were bought back at deep discounts. These transactions were economically

and diplomatically contentious; by their nature little is known about their extent.15 Only for a

small handful of countries do we have reasonable reliable estimates of short-term capital flows,

amortization and secondary market transactions. For the United States, for example, studies

undertaken for the U.S. Department of Commerce show amortization payments as running at 20

to 30 per cent of new issues in the boom period 1924-28.16 Transactions in outstanding foreign

securities in U.S. markets ran at lower levels, typically half those of amortization, prior to 1930-

1. Data on short-term capital movements are derived mainly from reports on foreign deposits by

U.S. banks and brokers, coverage of which is incomplete, rendering the resulting series volatile

and of uncertain reliability. For other countries the picture is even more fragmentary.17

        For these reasons, we supplement our data for primary bond issues with net capital

inflows obtained from balance-of-payment statistics. Net capital inflows are calculated by adding

the accumulation of gold and foreign exchange reserves to the current account deficit. The

country sample is more limited and less representative, but analysis of net capital flows

nonetheless provides a useful check.

        We also construct variables designed to capture potential determinants of capital flows.

Pull factors are proxied by recipient country characteristics: GDP, GDP per capita, GDP growth,

public debt, central government’s budget balance, volume of international reserves, etc. We add

   There were also some purchases by Americans of outstanding U.S. bonds in the hands of European investors, but
these appear to have been concentrated in the first two or three post-World War I years (being a continuation of
wartime transactions) and thus fall outside our sample period. See Lary (1943).

   Although some estimates are available in the German case. See Klug (1993).

   In addition, our data do not include share issues. This is a minor problem, however, as shares accounted for at
most ten per cent of the total of gross capital issues for foreign residents in the six financial centers under study.
Anon (1943), table 3C, estimates that total share issues on account of European countries reached $642 M. (current)
over 1919-1932, whereas bond issues amounted to $5,889 M. over the same period.

dummy variables for whether countries were exporters of primary products and for whether they

were on the gold standard.18 Push factors include source country real GDP, the volatility of stock

market returns, and long-term interest rates. Finally, we add variables accounting for overall

macroeconomic conditions: GDP growth and trade openness at the aggregate European level.19

Table 1 provides summary statistics for the variables in the dataset, while full details on sources

are given in appendix A.



        3.   Capital Surges and Reversals

        We begin by describing interwar capital-flow surges and reversals and contrasting them

with recent experience. Figures 1 and 2 show the value of long-term bonds floated by European

countries in six major financial centers from 1919 to 1932 in millions of 1990 US dollars. Issues

are broken down by financial center in Figure 1 and by borrower type (public vs. private sector)

in Figure 2. The surge and stop are both evident. Gross capital exports to European countries

rose sharply starting in 1924 and peaked in 1927. Of all bond issues in the 1924-1928 period,

New York accounts for the largest share (66 per cent), but in addition other markets like London

(16 per cent), Amsterdam (8 per cent), and to a lesser extent Stockholm (5 per cent) played

significant roles. Starting in 1926, private borrowers were responsible for the greatest share of

capital issues.

        That new issues in New York on behalf of European borrowers and new European issues

in the major financial centers fell already in 1928 may surprise readers who associate the decline

in lending with the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange and the associated deterioration in


18
  Primary exporters are defined as countries whose exports were composed of 75% of primary products at least.
19
  These are constructed using the real GDPs (in constant 1990 dollars) of 15 European countries as well as their
nominal exports converted at market exchange rates and deflated using the US Consumer Price Index (see appendix
A).


                                                                                                              8
U.S. economic and financial conditions. In fact, that the falloff in lending to Europe began

earlier was noted by earlier specialists (viz. Mintz 1951).        We see in Figure 1 that the

phenomenon was not limited to New York and that it disproportionately affected public-sector

borrowers. We return to potential explanations below.

           New bond issues declined by 64 per cent in real terms in 1929. This was followed

however by a recovery in 1930, due mostly to loans to the German government and corporations

(in particular, the Young Plan loans). In 1931 gross long-term capital exports collapsed again; in

1932 no new European issues were recorded in New York or London. While almost all major

financial centers participated in this sudden stop, there were a few exceptions. The volume of

bond issues actually rose in Paris and Stockholm between 1927 and 1931, for example. Whereas

Paris had been only a marginal player in the capital-flow surge of the 1920s, it overtook New

York as the leading market for bond issues in the early years of the Great Depression.20 Twenty-

five per cent of all European bonds issued in 1929-1932 were floated in Paris. As the New York

and London capital markets dried up in 1929-1932, European governments and firms evidently

turned to Paris and Stockholm to issue new debt. This partial substitution between the main

financial centers attenuated the effects of the sudden stop insofar as all sources of external

funding did not dry up at the same time. This also suggests that the shift in capital flows was

partly driven by factors specific to different financial centers rather than simply to questions

about the solvency of the recipients. Section 5 of the paper will shed some light on the identity of

these financial-center-specific factors.

           Figures 3 to 5 compare the capital surge and sudden stop in the European periphery

during 1925-1932 and 2006-2011. Figure 3 first juxtaposes the aggregate ratio of current account

deficit to GDP for the largest (net) capital importers of the two periods: Austria, Germany, and
20
     Albeit by a relatively small margin.


                                                                                                  9
Hungary in 1925-1932 and Greece, Ireland Italy, Portugal and Spain (the GIIPS) in 2006-2011.21

We set year zero, the peak year for current account deficits, as 1927 and 2008 respectively. The

figure shows that the GIIPS ran larger current account deficits at the peak of the recent boom

than the Central European countries in 1927. However, the subsequent current account

adjustment was more severe in the Great Depression than in peripheral Europe after 2008.

Between 1927 and 1931, the decline in the aggregate current account deficit of Austria, Germany

and Hungary represented 6.0 per cent of their 1927 collective GDP and these countries even ran

current account surpluses as of 1931. By contrast, the current account adjustment experienced by

the GIIPS between 2008 and 2011 was “only” 3.2 per cent of their aggregate 2008 GDP and

these countries still ran current account deficits in 2011. However, the most recent estimate for

2012 suggests that the GIIPS’ current account deficit contracted further in that year so the

adjustment might eventually be of the same magnitude as in Central Europe during the Great

Depression.

        A large part of the explanation for the differences in current account adjustments between

the two periods is the extent to which official capital inflows compensated for private outflows.

In the early 1930s official flows took the form of loans for Germany, Austria and Hungary from

foreign governments as arranged by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and central

bank finance of the balance of payments (central bank purchases and sales of gold and foreign

exchange).22 After 2007 they took the form of rescue loans for Greece, Ireland and Portugal

from foreign governments and arranged through the European Financial Stability Facility and

transfers to the affected countries’ central banks through TARGET2, the European Union’s real-

time interbank payment system. The analogy, obviously, is direct.

21
   These two groups correspond to the largest (net) importers of capital of the 1925-1930 and 2004-2008 period
respectively.
22
   On the BIS loans, see Toniolo (2005).


                                                                                                           10
         Figures 4 and 5 show the aggregate ratios of net private and official capital inflows to

GDP for the main European debtors in 1925-1932 and 2002-2011.23 They confirm that the

reversal in the direction of net private flows was dramatic in both periods. In contrast to gross

capital inflows, net private capital inflows to Central European countries did not rebound in

1930. This indicates that the temporary increase in external loans to German borrowers, in

particular, was outweighed by an increase in capital outflows.24 By 1931 and 2010, net capital

inflows to the European debtors were strongly negative, reflecting capital flight. 25 Evidently, the

decline in private capital inflows to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain in 2008-2011 was

larger than that experienced by Central European countries in 1927-1931.26 However, the rise in

official inflows was also larger, making the resulting current account adjustment less severe for

the capital importers (at least until 2011). In 2011 indeed, net official inflows to the GIIPS

amounted to 12.4% of their collective GDP and more than compensated for net private outflows

(8.3% of GDP). This explains how these countries could continue to run current account deficits,

at least temporarily, despite the crisis. In 1927-31, in contrast, net official inflows to Austria,

23
   In Figure 5, official inflows include TARGET2 positions, loans granted by the IMF, EFSF, EFSM and other EU
governments and changes in the central bank’s reserve assets (see Boeckx, 2012). Note that, since errors and
omissions are excluded, the sum of private and official capital inflows to the GIIPS does not exactly match the
figure for their current account deficit.
24
    This is evidence that Germany experienced a growing problem of capital flight, associated with political
instability, the poorly received Austro-German customs union proposal and the Brüning government’s bellicose
stance on the reparations question, well before full-blown financial crisis erupted in 1931. Whether this was capital
flight mainly by foreigners excited by the reparations conflict, as argued by Ferguson and Temin (2003), or by
residents concerned with the condition of domestic banks, as concluded by Schnabel (2004), is not something on
which our data shed light.
25
   In their recent study of capital flow waves since the 1980s, Forbes and Warnock (2012) distinguish between four
types of episode: - surges (large increases in gross capital inflows); - stops (large decreases in gross capital inflows);
- flights (large increases in gross capital outflows); and - retrenchment (large decreases in gross capital outflows).
According to this typology, the European capital importers of the 1920s faced a combination of a stop and a flight in
the years 1931 and 1932.

   The decline in aggregate net private capital inflows to the Austria, Germany and Hungary between 1927 and 1931
represented 8.4% of their 1927 collective GDP. The decline in aggregate net private capital inflows to the GIIPS
between 2008 and 2011 represented 10.1% of their 2008 collective GDP. The sudden stop experienced by Central
European countries in the early 1930s is comparable to that endured by Latin America in the early 2000s. Calvo and
Talvi (2008), table 8.1, find that net capital inflows declined by 8 per cent on average for seven Latin American
countries between 1998 and 2002. The decline was particularly acute for Argentina (19.5 per cent) and Venezuela
(17.4 per cent). See also Calvo, Izquierdo and Talvi (2004).


                                                                                                                       11
Germany and Hungary amounted to 3.4% of their collective GDP and did not compensate for the

net private outflows (4.2% of GDP). These countries therefore had to shrink their current account

deficits much more severely and, by 1931, transform those deficits into surpluses.27

           The decline in private capital inflows to the debtor countries was associated in both

periods with a decline in capital outflows from the European creditors. France, the Netherlands

and Switzerland (the largest capital exporters of the 1925-1930 period) became net importers of

capital in 1931, registering a net private capital inflow of 5.7% of their collective GDP. But this

private capital inflow was offset by an outflow of official capital (change in international

reserves and BIS loans) of 4.4% of their collective GDP. In contrast, Germany (the largest

European capital exporter in the early 2000s) has remained a net exporter of private capital in

2008-2011, but the volume of its private capital exports has declined steadily. And, again, the

decrease in private outflows from Germany has been partly offset by the increase in official

outflows.

           To some extent, then, the Eurosystem has provided collective insurance against sudden

stops. In 1929-31, in contrast, Central European countries were forced to rely on their individual

insurance against sudden stops (in the form of international reserves), together with much more

limited international emergency support. These official inflows, although non-negligible, were

not enough to compensate for the private capital outflows.



           4.   Pull Factors

           Studies of the determinants of capital flows typically distinguish factors specific to the

lending countries and the global financial system (“push” factors) on the one hand and factors

     Austria, Germany and Hungary all reacted by introducing capital controls in the summer and fall of 1931.


                                                                                                                12
specific to the recipient countries (“pull” factors) on the other.28 While much of the literature has

concentrated on pull factors, recent experience has refocused attention on push factors as

determinants of both capital-flow surges and sudden stops (see e.g. Milesi-Ferretti and Tille,

2011, Fratzscher, 2011, Forbes and Warnock, 2012).

           We start with pull factors. Our dependent variable for this portion of the analysis is the

(log of the) total amount of borrowing by a given country in all markets in a given year (in

millions of 1990 US dollars). We control for the recipient countries’ economic size (real GDP),

macroeconomic performance (real GDP growth suitably lagged), economic development (lagged

GDP per capita), fiscal and monetary policies (lagged inflation, lagged ratios of public debt to

fiscal revenues, of government budget balance to fiscal revenues, and of international reserves to

imports, along with a gold standard dummy), and position in world trade (primary product

exporter).

           Ritschl (2002, 2012) has argued that a special set of pull factors were present in the

German case, encouraging private capital inflows before 1929 and discouraging them thereafter.

Under the Dawes Plan, private foreign lending enjoyed what was known as “transfer protection.”

The mechanism through which reparations were transferred effectively gave commercial credits

first claim on the available foreign exchange and seniority over reparations. That made private

lending to Germany more attractive. Under the Young Plan, which succeeded the Dawes Plan in

1929, this hierarchy of seniority was inverted, making private lending less attractive and

contributing to the sudden stop. To take this argument into consideration, we add a pair of

dummy variables for Germany for the Dawes Plan years (1924-1928) and Young Plan years

(1929-1932). Reflecting the emphasis in Decorzant and Flores (2012) on the role of the League

                                                                                                  13
of Nations in European countries’ access to external capital in the 1920s, we also add a dummy

variable for whether a country previously borrowed under the auspices of the League of Nations.

        Our econometric results focus on the period 1924-1932.29 We include year dummies in all

regressions in order to control for time-varying, supply-side factors common to all receiving

countries (push factors).30 Our dependent variable has a large proportion of zeros (33 per cent of

the country-year observations), and a log-linear specification would lead one to omit these

observations.31 A first option for dealing with this problem is to add a small constant ( =1) to the

dependent variable and then to estimate the model with OLS. We report results obtained with

this procedure below. Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) suggest however that OLS estimates of

log-linearized models are unreliable and recommend using the Poisson pseudo-maximum

likelihood estimator instead. This estimator provides a simple way to deal with the zeros in the

dependent variable and is well behaved even when the proportion of zeros in the dependent

variable is large (Santos Silva and Tenreyro, 2011).32

        Table 2 reports results for an unbalanced panel of 20 countries and nine years estimated

using both procedures, OLS and Poisson, although the latter is preferred. We report results

obtained for the full 1924-1932 period as well as sub-periods corresponding to the surge (1924-

30
   We exclude the UK from the sample of recipient countries since the British government and firms did not seem to
rely significantly on international capital markets as a source of funding in this period. Over the 1919-1932 period,
only very small amounts of bonds ($2 million or less) were floated (in 1924, 1927, 1928 and 1929) by British
corporations on the Amsterdam market. No government debt issues were recorded and the data tables for other
financial centers do not include a “United Kingdom” line. We cannot rule out purchases by foreigners of securities
on the London market itself, but we lack data on this.
31
   The choice of a log-linear model is justified by the fact that, when expressed in level, the (non-censored part of
the) dependent variable is not normally distributed. By contrast, when expressed in log, the (non censored part of
the) dependent variable is normally distributed.
32
   We also estimated the regressions using Tobit and Box-Cox Tobit model (following Han and Kronmal, 2004).
The results were similar to those obtained with OLS. However, the Tobit model is not appropriate when the zeros in
the dependent variable are not due to actual censoring. Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) show that Tobit estimates
of log-linear model suffer from the same biases as OLS.


                                                                                                                  14
1928) and the stop (1929-1932). Finally, column VII reports results obtained for the 1929-1932

period when the Young Loans to Germany are excluded from the sample.33

        Estimates for 1924-1932 suggest that only a few of the standard pull factors were

significant drivers of gross capital flows. We find no evidence that stronger economic growth,

lower inflation, lower budget deficits, or higher international reserves were positively associated

with capital inflows. We only find weak evidence of an association between capital flows and

maintenance of the gold standard (column IV). This result is consistent with the findings of

Obstfeld and Taylor (2003), although it is inconsistent with earlier accounts such as Lary (1943)

which emphasize the facilitating role of gold convertibility in the 1924-28 period.34 There is a

small negative relationship between capital flows and lagged economic growth in column IV, as

if countries having experienced more severe economic disruptions in the past received more

capital thereafter.35 Exporters of primary products also appear to have enjoyed favorable access

to international capital markets.36 By contrast, we find no evidence that countries that previously

issued bonds under the auspices of the League of Nations received more capital in the following

years, other things equal. While the coefficient on the Germany/1929-1932 dummy varies

depending on whether the Young Loans are included in the sample, the results do not seem to

indicate that Germany was a positive outlier before 1929 or a negative outlier thereafter.

        Comparing the results for the two sub-periods, it would appear that the negative

association between capital flows and economic growth is only present during the capital surge

   Information on the amount of the Young Loans is taken from The Economist, 14 June 1930, “Reparations Loans”.
34
   Note that some of our regressions focus specifically on this 1924-28 period and still find no impact of gold-
standard membership.
35
   The coefficient implies that a 1% increase in a country’s (lagged) economic growth is associated with a 5%
decrease in its bond issues. We return to the question of whether this is true for the period as a whole.
36
   Previous authors from Nurkse (1944) to Feinstein and Watson (1995) emphasize the role of improving terms of
trade in attracting capital inflows in 1924-28 and of deteriorating terms of trade in discouraging them thereafter.
While Nurkse’s focus is global, Feinstein and Watson consider specifically the agricultural exporters of Central and
Eastern Europe. We also ran the regressions including the (lagged) change in borrowing countries’ terms of trade as
an explanatory variable but find no association between terms of trade and capital movements.


                                                                                                                 15
(1924-1928). A large, negative and significant coefficient on public debt in column VII suggests

that investors discriminated against heavily indebted countries during the sudden stop (1929-

1932) but not during the surge (1924-1928).37 Evidently investors only grew seriously concerned

with debt levels when liquidity dried up and growth rates declined (and turned negative).

Additional evidence of this effect can be found in the breakdown of European bond issues by

Moody’s rating categories (Table 3). The share of borrowing countries, whose governments were

rated in the top two categories (Aaa and Aa) increased in all financial centers in 1929-1932

relative to 1924-1928. This is suggestive evidence that riskier, lower-rated borrowers were being

rationed out of the market during the sudden stop.38 There is a parallel here with recent trends in

the eurozone: spreads on the bonds of high-and low-debt European countries were compressed in

2001-8, the period of the recent capital-flow surge, but investors discriminated very sharply

between high- and low-debt countries after 2008 when liquidity evaporated and growth

collapsed.

         We also find that international reserves were negatively associated with capital inflows in

1924-1928. In that period governments borrowed on international capital markets in order to

purchase gold and foreign exchange reserves for the purpose of stabilizing their currencies.

However, international reserves were of little help when the global crisis erupted; there is no

evidence that they attenuated the sudden stop of 1929-1932.

         In Table 4 we distinguish between public and private sector borrowers. Pull factors

mattered even less for private than public borrowers. In particular, we find no association



37
   The coefficient implies that a one standard deviation decrease in a country’s ratio of public debt to fiscal revenues
is associated with a doubling of bond issues on account of this country.
38
   Ratings data are from Flandreau, Gaillard and Packer (2011). These authors find that the level of governments’
external debt is a strong predictor of ratings. We also ran regressions including ratings as an explanatory variable but
the results were inconclusive.


                                                                                                                     16
between economic growth, international reserves or being an exporter of primary products on the

one hand and private-sector borrowing on the other hand.

        Although several interesting findings emerge from this analysis, pull factors do not

perform very well overall. Many coefficients in Tables 2 and 4 are insignificant at conventional

confidence levels. Only a handful of country-specific variables successfully predict capital

inflows.39 By contrast, after controlling for the pull factors in the regressions run over the 1924-

1932 period, we still find evidence of an effect of the year dummies. Figure 6 plots the

coefficients on the year dummies estimated using the Poisson model (Table 3, column IV). The

figure distinguishes between the statistically significant coefficients (at the 5% level, dark-gray

bars) and the statistically insignificant coefficients (light-gray bars). All coefficients are to be

interpreted relative to 1932, which is the omitted category in the regressions. These year

dummies control for supply-side factors common to all countries in the regressions (push

factors). Thus, the size and significance of the coefficients on the year dummies on Figure 6

suggest an important role for push factors in accounting for the capital-flow surge and

subsequent sudden stop.

        We now turn to a more detailed investigation of the push factors in question.



        5.   Push Factors

        Whereas Section 4 focused on the destination of long-term capital flows, we now ask

what drove the volume of capital exports from the financial centers. Our dependent variable for

this part of the analysis is the log of the value of bonds floated in a given financial center in a

given year, again in millions of 1990 US dollars.


39
   The R-square of the OLS regressions in columns I-III is low as well. However, this might be because ordinary
least squares are not appropriate to analyze censored data.


                                                                                                            17
        Studies of post-1980 sudden stops have emphasized changes in risk perception and

interest rates as determinants of global capital flows.40 To assess whether a similar dynamic was

at play in the 1920s and 1930s, we include long-term interest rates and a proxy for risk in the six

financial centers.41 Long-term interest rates are measured as the yield on long-term domestic

government bonds in each center.42 In the spirit of the recent literature, we use the volatility of

stock market returns (i.e. the annualized standard deviation in monthly returns) as a proxy for

risk. We control for the source country’s size (real GDP), for Europe’s overall economic growth,

and for its openness to trade.43

        Table 5 presents regressions run on a balanced panel of six financial centers and twelve

years (1921-1932). Columns I and II report simple pooled estimates, while Columns III and IV

add financial-center fixed effects. Columns II and IV include year dummies to control for time-

varying factors common to all financial centers.

        Push factors perform better than pull factors in explaining capital flows in this period.

Many of the coefficients in Table 5 are significant at high levels of confidence. After controlling

for time and financial center fixed effects, the model in column IV accounts for 69 per cent of

the variance in the dependent variable. There is no evidence that European growth or openness to

trade boosted bond issues. In contrast, conditions in the major financial centers were strong


40
   See, for example, Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2011), Fratzscher (2012) and Forbes and Warnock (2012).
41
   We estimated the same equations using short-term interest rates and obtained essentially the same results.
42
   Ideally we would include a measure of ex ante (expected) real interest rates. However, constructing one requires a
measure of inflation expectations over the same period (often ten or more years until the bond matures). No such
measure is readily available. The plausible proxies, such as forward foreign exchange rates and commodity futures
prices, are for much shorter horizons. It is also plausible that under the gold standard that characterized this period
price levels were expected to follow a random walk (Barsky and Summers 1985), in which case nominal rates are a
perfectly fine stand-in for real interest rates.
43
   European growth and trade openness are constructed based on a sample of fifteen continental European countries
(see appendix A). European GDP growth is measured as the annual growth rate of these countries’ aggregate real
GDP (in per cent). European trade openness is measured as the ratio of their aggregate exports to their aggregate
GDP (in %). Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2011), p. 314 also control for global growth and trade openness in their time-
series analysis of global capital flows. Forbes and Warnock (2012) include global growth in their list of the global
factors explaining extreme capital flow events.


                                                                                                                    18
drivers of capital flows. In particular, we find a strongly negative and statistically significant

relationship between capital issues on the one hand and stock market volatility and interest rates

on the other. Evidently, risk perceptions and the cost of capital in international capital markets

mattered importantly for the volume of new bonds issued. These effects are also large. Earlier

studies (e.g. Royal Institute of International Affairs 1937, Lary 1943, Bloomfield, 1950) placed

considerable emphasis on the influence of these interest rates; by comparison, we have been able

to find less commentary on the role of volatility.

        Including a dummy variable for New York in 1929 does not alter the estimates; these

results are not driven entirely by the peak in stock market volatility experienced in the US in that

year. Excluding 1921 through 1923, when exceptional postwar conditions prevailed, similarly

does not alter the results. The relationships we document are not, therefore, an artifact of the

early 1920s, when international capital markets and European economies were still recovering

from the war.44

        These results point to three explanations for the sudden stop of the late 1920s: higher

interest rates in the main financial centers (New York and London), increased stock market

volatility, or a combination of the two. Figures 7 and 8 show the evolution of long-term interest

rates and stock market volatility from 1921 to 1932 in the three largest markets: New York,

London and Paris. Although interest rates rose slightly in both London and New York in 1929 as

a consequence of increases in the Bank of England’s and Federal Reserve’s discount rates,

Figure 7 suggests that US and UK interest rates were not the principal explanation for the sudden

stop in gross inflows. Long-term interest rates in New York and London declined again in 1930

and remained at low levels in 1931-1932, relative to the experience of the preceding decade,

44
  The exceptional nature of capital flows in the immediate postwar period is emphasized by Holtfrerich (1986) and
Feinstein and Watson (1995). Lary (1943) provides a detailed narrative of foreign lending by the United States, the
principal creditor in this period.


                                                                                                                19
when capital flows from these two markets remained at a stop. That said, high interest rates may

help to explain the limited participation of Paris in the lending boom of 1924-1928. Because

France was struggling to stabilize its currency for much of this period, Paris experienced high

interest rates relative to New York and London, handicapping its efforts to become a major

financial center. Only after the franc was stabilized in 1926-8 did interest rates decline and Paris

begin competing seriously with other international financial centers.

       If interest rates have limited ability to explain the stop in new issues in New York and

London in 1929-1932, heightened perceptions of risk, as captured by stock market volatility, are

a better candidate. The volatility of returns rose sharply in both New York and London in 1929,

coincident with the collapse in lending to European countries. At the same time, stock-return

volatility in Paris declined, causing bond issues to be redirected there. After a temporary decline

in 1930, stock market volatility increased everywhere in 1931. This increase coincided with the

final collapse of lending.

       The relationship between stock market volatility and capital flows was particularly

pronounced for the United States. The simple correlation between the volatility of the S&P index

and new foreign issues in New York, in annual data for 1919-1932 is -0.67. Volatility thus

appears to have been the key driver of movements in the value of new capital issues for

European borrowers in the United States. This result resembles findings for the recent period:

Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2011) and Forbes and Warnock (2012) both conclude that global risk

perceptions have been important determinants of capital flow surges and reversals in the past 30

years. As in 2008, increased risk aversion brought capital flows to a sudden stop after 1928 and

helped to precipitate a global financial crisis.




                                                                                                 20
       This result also sheds light on contemporary perceptions of foreign lending. Both Harris

(1935) and Nurkse (1944) expressed strong skepticism about international capital flows, arguing

that they were economically and financially destabilizing on balance. Their conclusions were

informed by this interwar experience when, our results suggest, debtor countries were first

inundated by and then starved of foreign capital, due as much to changing conditions in

international capital markets as any changes in local economic circumstances and policies.



       6.   The Capital Flow Reversal

       The preceding evidence suggests that the sudden stop in gross capital inflows to

European countries was accompanied by capital flight from the borrowers. This phenomenon

peaked in 1931, when the earlier capital importers became large net capital exporters. In this

section we ask whether the magnitude of the reversal in European private capital flows was

related to country-specific characteristics and whether countries could successfully insulate

themselves from the reversal. Given that data on net capital flows are limited to a subset of

countries, we attempt only a simple bivariate analysis. The capital flow reversal is measured as

the change in net private capital inflows between 1930 and 1931 as a percentage of 1930 GDP.

We relate this dependent variable to the average ratio of net capital inflows to GDP between

1925 and 1930, 1930 real GDP growth, the government budget balance as a share of fiscal

revenues, and the ratio of public debt to fiscal revenues.

       Few of these variables are good predictors of the severity of the 1931 reversal. Faster

GDP growth and smaller budget deficits appear to have done nothing to ameliorate the severity

of the reversal. We find a weak positive correlation between the magnitude of the 1931 reversal

and the level of public debt. This reflects the large public debts of the capital exporters of the




                                                                                               21
1920s – the UK, Netherlands, Switzerland, and France – which were on the receiving end of the

capital-flow reversal in 1931. Aside from France, these countries had little or no inflation in the

first half of the 1920s, in contrast with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which had

essentially eliminated their debts through high inflation at the beginning of the decade. 45 In

contrast, the amount of foreign capital received during the surge years (1925-1930) is a good

predictor of the magnitude of the 1931 reversal (Figure 9). Countries relying most heavily on

foreign borrowing were most severely affected by the sudden stop in 1931, in other words.

        Finally, we can juxtapose the magnitude of the reversal against the ratio of international

reserves to imports in 1930 and the percentage change in international reserves in 1931. Figure

10 indicates that reserves did not provide much insurance against sudden stops, confirming what

we found for gross capital flows. However, the strong positive relationship between the change

in reserves and the capital-flow reversal in Figure 11 indicates that countries confronted to the

sudden stop reacted by massively selling international reserves in 1931.46 This confirms the

finding by Accominotti (2011) that the capital importing countries of the 1920s experienced

significant exchange market pressure during the global financial crisis of 1931, while capital

exporters faced upward pressure on their currencies.

        The overall picture is that there was little a country could do to insulate itself from the

capital flow reversal. Once the reversal was underway, governments and central banks could

attempt to finance it by selling reserves, and the more reserves they had the more they could

finance before being forced to pull the plug and devalue, default and/or impose exchange

controls. Finally, the extent of previous foreign borrowing was strongly correlated with the

45
   The present result is to be contrasted with our previous finding for gross capital flows. Those results showed that
public debts were negatively associated with gross capital inflows in the 1929-1932 period. The contrast suggests
that while low levels of public debt may have been perceived positively by foreign investors, this did not prevent
domestic investors from engaging in capital flight in 1931.

   Whereas countries to which capital flows were redirected accumulated reserves.


                                                                                                                   22
severity of the 1931 reversal. One policy lesson from this interwar episode is therefore that

countries more dependent on capital inflows are also more vulnerable to their sudden stops and

reversals.



       7.    Conclusion

       The parallels between capital flow surges and reversals in Europe in the periods leading

up to the two great financial crises of the modern era, the Great Depression and the Global Credit

Crisis, are more than skin deep. In both periods there was a flood of capital from one half of

Europe to the other, as well as to the continent’s recipient half from the rest of the world. There

was neglect by lenders of public debt burdens and their implications for credit worthiness during

the boom and then the sudden rediscovery of sovereign risk once capital dried up. In both

periods, countries that imported foreign finance most liberally during the boom suffered the

largest reversal and most serious dislocations when the surge of capital inflows came to an end.

       But recipient-country characteristics explain only a part of trends and fluctuations in

private long-term capital flows in the 1920s and early 1930s. At least as important were

conditions in international capital markets. Among the important factors there was the level of

interest rates, as emphasized in a host of earlier studies, but also perceptions of the riskiness of

the investment environment, as captured by the volatility of equity prices, the same proxy

utilized in studies of the recent period.

       Interwar experience thus underscores the extent to which global factors largely

the period leading up to subprime/global credit crisis of 2007-8 could have usefully taken heed.

    Gross Long-Term Capital Flows
    Gross long-term European bond issues in New York, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Stockholm and
    Zurich over 1919-1932 were computed from an anonymous memo in the Ragnar Nurkse papers
    at Princeton University’s Mudd Library. The memo gives the total value of long-term bond
    issues on account of European countries in each financial center from 1919 to 1932. The
    frequency is annual. The data are reported in millions of current US Dollars and were converted
    into 1990 constant US Dollars using the US Consumer Price Index in Carter and Sutch (2006),
    series Cc2.

    Twenty-eight countries stand among the list of European capital recipients in the source (Austria,
    Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Danzig, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,
    Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Norway,
    Poland, Portugal, Rumania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Yugoslavia).
    However, regression results in tables 2 and 3 exclude Danzig, Estonia, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia,
    Lithuania and Luxemburg, covariates being unavailable for these countries. The UK is also
    excluded from the sample of capital recipients (see section 4). More details on the source for
    long-term capital flows are given in section 2.

    Net Capital Flows (Official and Private)
         1925-1931
    Annual net capital inflows (official and private) were computed from the different countries’
    balance-of-payments statistics and additional sources. For estimates of official flows in the 1920s
    and 1930s we combined the change in international reserves as described below with data on
    loans through the Bank for International Settlements from BIS Annual Reports and Toniolo
    (2005, pp. 108-109). Net private capital inflows were then defined as the sum of the current
    account deficit and official capital outflows. Sources for current account deficits are the
    following:
-   Austria: The current account balance is from an internal database of the Austrian National Bank
    (data kindly communicated by Clemens Jobst);
-   Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Sweden: Mitchell (2007);
-   France: Sicsic (1993);
-   Germany: Ritschl (2002), completed by United Nations (1949) for 1924 (this source reports the
    balance of current account and gold);
-   Hungary: Mitchell (2007), completed by United Nations (1949) for 1925;
-   Netherlands: den Bakker et al. (1990), table 6, pp. 203-204;
-   Switzerland: United Nations (1949);
-   United Kingdom: Sayers (1976), vol. 3, appendix 32.

    Net capital inflows (in Mio USD) were matched with the different countries’ nominal GDPs,
    taken from the following sources:
-   Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Yugoslavia: Mitchell (2007);
-   Czechoslovakia, Poland: Kaser and Radice (1985);

         2002-2011
    Net private and official capital inflows to Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain
    during the recent period were computed using balance of payment statistics. The data were
    kindly communicated by Jef Boeckx and are originally from Thomson Datastream. We followed
    Boeckx (2012)’s methodology and defined net private capital inflows as the difference between
    the financial account and the net liabilities of the central bank and government (recorded under
    “Other investment”). We defined official inflows as the sum of the net liabilities of the central
    bank and government, IMF financing and reserve assets of the central bank.

    In order to check our estimate, we also reconstructed the amounts of EU disbursements and
    bilateral loans to Greece, Ireland and Portugal (from the websites of the European Commission
    and European Financial Stability Facility, and national governments’ sources). These amounts
    can be compared with the net liabilities of the government recorded under “other investment” in
    the IMF’s balance-of-payment statistics and which includes official loans from the EFSF and
    EFSM bilateral government loans. The tables below compare the series for the three countries
    which received bailout money in 2010-2012. The two series are very similar, revealing that the
    net liabilities of the government of the IMF’s balance of payment statistics are indeed dominated
    by EU and bilateral loans. The data reported in the tables are in billions of US dollars.

Real GDP and GDP Per Capita



                                                                                                   48
    Real GDPs (in Mio 1990 USD) and population sizes are from Maddison (2006).

    Inflation
    European countries’ annual inflation rates (in %) are from the following sources:
-   Austria, Czechoslovakia: Mitchell (2007), percentage change in the consumer price index,
    completed by League of Nations, Statistical Year-Book for 1923.

    index; 1929-1932: Mitchell (2007), percentage change in the consumer price index.

    Public Debts
    European countries’ annual amounts of government debt were obtained from a post-war UN
    study on public debts during the 1920s and 1930s (United Nations, 1948).

    Fiscal Revenues and Expenditures
    Statistics for the different countries’ central government revenues and expenditures were
    published in the League of Nations’ Statistical Year-Book at an annual frequency as of 1924. We
    relied on this source for most countries in the sample (the data from the Statistical Year-Books
    were completed with Mitchell, 2007, for Denmark and Finland in 1923, Austria in 1924 and
    Switzerland in 1923-1924). Data for France and Portugal are from Mitchell (2007). Germany’s
    fiscal revenues and expenditures are taken from Ritschl (2002) and were completed with
    Mitchell (2007) for 1924. Data for Italy are from Fua (1969), vol. 3.

    International Reserves
    Under the gold exchange standard system, central banks were allowed to hold short-term foreign
    assets as a complement to gold in their legal reserves (used to back monetary circulation).
    International reserves were therefore composed of gold holdings and foreign exchange. Gold
    reserves were obtained from a 1943 Federal Reserve volume (Board of Governors of the Federal
    Reserve System, 1943, pp. 521-555). This source reports all European central banks’ gold
    holdings during the interwar period. Data for the different countries’ foreign exchange reserves
    are from the following sources:
-   Austria: 1923-1925: League of Nations, Statistical Year-Book, 1926; 1926-1932:
    Oesterreichische Nationalbank (1926-1932), Mitteilungen des Direktoriums der
    Oesterreichischen Bank, various issues;

                                                                                                       49

    Imports and Exports
    Data for the different countries’ nominal imports and exports are from Mitchell (2007).

    Gold Standard
    A gold standard dummy (taking value 1 if a country was on the gold standard in a given year)
    was constructed using the information provided in Eichengreen (1992, table 7.1, pp. 188-190).

    Primary Exporter Dummy
    A primary exporter dummy (taking value 1 if a country’s exports were composed of more than
    75% of primary products over 1925-1932) was constructed using the information published in
    the League of Nations’ Statistical-Year-Book. The League of Nations distinguished between five
    classes of commodities: 1. live animals; 2. articles of food and drink; 3. materials, raw or partly
    manufactured; 4. manufactured articles; and 5. gold and silver. We define primary products as
    commodities belonging to categories 1 to 3. The League of Nations’ Statistical Year-Books do
    not display the commodity composition of Finland’s trade but the share of manufactured
    products in Finland’s exports is reported in a working paper of the United Nations Statistics
    Division (United Nations Statistics Division, 1962).

    League of Nations
    The League of Nations dummy takes value 1 for countries, which received a League of Nations’
    Loan in the 1920s. Information on League of Nations’ Loans is from Decorzant and Flores
    (2012). League of Nations countries include Austria (1923-1932), Bulgaria (1926-1932), Danzig
    (1925-1932), Estonia (1927-1932), Greece and Hungary (1924-1932).

    Ratings
    Data on Moody’s annual ratings were kindly communicated by Marc Flandreau and Norbert
    Gaillard and are from Flandreau, Gaillard and Packer (2011). The ratings only cover countries
    whose governments issued bonds in New York over the period.

    Stock Market Volatility
    Stock market volatility in New York, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Zurich is
    measured as the annualized standard deviation (in %) of monthly returns (in local currency) on
    each domestic stock price index. The stock market indices used are the S&P index of all
    common stock prices for New York (source: NBER Macro-History Database, series m11025),




                                                                                                          50

France’s CAC all tradables index for Paris (source: Global Financial Data, series _CACTD),
Netherlands’ all shares price index for Amsterdam (source: Global Financial Data, series
_AAXD), Sweden’s OMX Affärsvärldens general index for Stockholm (source: Global Financial
Data, series _OMXAFGD) and Switzerland’s general stock price index for Zurich (source:
Global Financial Data, series_SPIXD).

Long-Term Interest Rate
Long-term interest rates correspond to the yields on long-term domestic government bonds in the
different financial centers. For New York, we use the annual series of US government bond yield
in Carter et al. (2006, series Cj1192). For London, we use the yield on 2.5% consols (source:
NBER Macro-History Database, series m13041c). For Paris, we use the yield on the French 3%
Rente perpétuelle (source: League of Nations, Statistical Year-Book, completed with Global
Financial Data, series IGFRA10D for 1921-1923). The Dutch long-term interest rate is taken
from International Conference of Economic Services (1934) for 1921-1928 and International
Institute of Statistics (1938) for 1929-1932 and corresponds to the average yield on eight
domestic bonds (initially computed by the Netherlands Bank). We rely on the “long-run yield”
series of the Riksbank’s Database (Historical Monetary Statistics of Sweden, 1668-2008, section:
interest and stock returns, available at http://www.historicalstatistics.org) for Sweden’s long-
term interest rate (note that this series perfectly matches the “yield on 7 government bonds”
series reported in the League of Nations’ Statistical Year-Book). Finally, for Zurich, we use the
yield on 3.5% SBB/CFF (Swiss Federal Railways) bonds reported in Swiss National Bank
(2007). The source indicates that this yield “was considered the benchmark for the Swiss capital
market” (p. 11).

European GDP Growth and Trade Openness
European real GDP growth and trade openness were calculated on the basis of the sources
described above for a sample of 15 continental European countries for which data are available
over 1921-1932. The countries in this sample are Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland
and Yugoslavia. European real GDP growth is measured as the percentage change in these
countries’ aggregate real GDPs. European trade openness is measured as the ratio of their
aggregate exports to aggregate GDPs (in %). Nominal exports were converted into 1990 constant
US dollars using the US Consumer Price Index in Carter and Sutch (2006), series Cc2.
