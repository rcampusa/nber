                                          ABSTRACT

The recent digitization of complete count census data is an extraordinary opportunity for social
scientists to create large longitudinal datasets by linking individuals from one census to another
or from other sources to the census. We evaluate different automated methods for record linkage,
performing a series of comparisons across methods and against hand linking. We have three main
findings that lead us to conclude that automated methods perform well. First, a number of
automated methods generate very low (less than 5%) false positive rates. The automated methods
trace out a frontier illustrating the tradeoff between the false positive rate and the (true) match
rate. Relative to more conservative automated algorithms, humans tend to link more observations
but at a cost of higher rates of false positives. Second, when human linkers and algorithms use the
same linking variables, there is relatively little disagreement between them. Third, across a
number of plausible analyses, coefficient estimates and parameters of interest are very similar
when using linked samples based on each of the different automated methods. We provide code
and Stata commands to implement the various automated methods.

1. Introduction

The recent digitization of historical complete count population censuses and advances in
computing power allow social scientists to create large historical panel datasets for the first time.
These longitudinal datasets offer new evidence on questions such as the selection of immigrants
(Abramitzky et al. 2012, 2013, Kosack and Ward 2014), how immigrants integrate into the
economy and society (Abramitzky et al. 2014, 2019, Fouka 2019, Pérez 2017), how
intergenerational mobility varied across groups and over time (Parman 2011, Ferrie and Long
2013, Feigenbaum 2015, 2018, Modalsli 2017, Collins and Wanamaker 2017, Abramitzky et al.
2019), the long-run effects of governmental programs and historical events (Aizer et al. 2016,
Bleakley and Ferrie 2016, Salisbury 2014, Parman 2015, Eli and Salisbury 2016, Eriksson 2019),
the geographic and economic mobility of African Americans (Collins and Wanamaker 2014, 2015,
Hornbeck and Naidu 2014), and the return to human capital (Feigenbaum and Tan 2019).1

Linking historical data, however, introduces particular challenges. Because historical data lack
unique identifiers such as Social Security Number, finding the same individual in two datasets
requires using characteristics such as reported names and ages. Consider the following (real-world)
linking problem: you want to match a man who is listed in the 1915 Iowa census as Paul Coulter,
3 years old, born in Kansas, to the 1940 Federal census. After much searching, you find two
possible candidates in the 1940 census: Paul Coater, 28 years, born in Kansas, and Paul Courter,
29 years old, born in Kansas. Who, if anyone, would you choose as the correct match?

This example illustrates a recurrent challenge in historical record linkage: Common names, along
with transcription and enumeration errors, age misreporting, mortality, under-enumeration and
international migration between census years, often make it impossible to find the correct match
with certainty (regardless of whether hand- or automated-methods are used).2 In the face of this


1
 Historical Census data are released to the public 72 years after the survey was taken, including the
personally identifying information like first and last name that is suppressed in modern public-use files.
These historical censuses were fully digitized in a partnership between Ancestry.com and the Minnesota
Population Center and have been made available for scholarly use.
2
  For instance, King and Magnuson (1995) report US census undercounts ranging from 6.5% in 1880 to 5%
in 1940. Gould (1980) and Bandiera, Rasul, and Viarengo (2013) estimate rates of outmigration ranging
from 20% to more than 50% among immigrants entering the US in the 1900-1920 period. Age misreporting
is also pervasive in US historical censuses: Close to 30% of the individuals report an age ending with 0 or
5 in the 1860 census, although the true number should be closer to 20% (own calculation from IPUMS).

                                                    2
inherent challenge, a record matching method should therefore aim to satisfy four goals. First, a
method should be accurate, making as few false matches as possible (minimize type I errors).
Second, it should be efficient, creating as many of the true matches as possible (minimize type II
errors). Third, it should be representative, generating linked samples that resemble the population
of interest as closely as possible. Fourth, it should be feasible for most scholars to implement given
current limitations of computing power and resources.

The main goals of this paper are to evaluate how various widely used automated methods of older
and newer vintage perform on these metrics, suggest best practices for linking historical records,
and provide user-friendly implementation codes. We evaluate three classes of the most widely
used automated algorithms in economic history. First, we consider the algorithms developed by
Abramitzky, Boustan, and Eriksson (2012, 2014, 2019; henceforth ABE), which are similar in
spirit to Ferrie (1996) and suggest a simple fully automated linking approach that encompass a
variety of different approaches to name comparisons (including using exact names, phonetic
versions of names or “edit distance” measures between strings). Second, we test the machine-
learning algorithm developed by Feigenbaum (2016), which uses a sample of manually classified
records to train an algorithm to make matches like a human research assistant would at scale.
Finally, we evaluate the fully automated probabilistic algorithm described in Abramitzky, Mill,
and Pérez (2019), which uses the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to combine age and
name distances into a single score reflecting the probability that each potential pair of records is a
true match.

A common feature of these approaches is that they link based on variables that are not expected to
change over time, typically birthplace (in the US census: birth country for the foreign-born or birth
state for the American-born), birth year, name and gender.3 While adding other characteristics to
the list of linking variables may increase the match rates and decrease false positive rates, it may
also bias the economic analysis. For instance, using current county of residence or current


Mason and Cope (1987) show that, in the 1900 census (which was the first to ask individuals both their age
and their year of birth), about 3% of the individuals reported inconsistent age and year of birth information.
3
  Current linking studies are often only able to systematically link men, because women tend to change their
last name upon marriage (more recent studies that use marriage certificates that include information on
maiden name also link women, see Craig, Eriksson, and Niemesh 2019). Olivetti and Paserman (2015) also
proposed a group-based linking procedure to link daughters from childhood to adulthood.

                                                      3
occupations as identifying variables for linking can both significantly increase match rates and
help us identify the true individual. However, using such a variable would result in excluding those
who switched their county of residence and occupation from the analysis. This exclusion is an
obvious issue in a study on geographical or occupational mobility, but could bias the results of
many studies (see more discussion in section III of Abramitzky, Mill and Perez 2019).4

Another goal of this paper is to compare the performance of automated algorithms and manual
linking. Linking by hand has the advantage that we instinctively trust other humans more than we
trust computer algorithms, but hand linking is expensive, non-replicable (in the sense that any two
scholars may link differently and even the same scholar might link differently at two different
points in time), and impractical (consider linking the entire US population across two censuses by
hand).5 For example, the project of digitizing and linking the Union Army records that we use
below took twenty years and several major grants to complete. In contrast, automated linking is
rule based, cheap, and replicable. Moreover, a substantial body of evidence (going back to Meehl
(1954)) argues that automated algorithms make more accurate and consistent decisions than
humans along a wide variety of tasks.6 Ultimately, when computers and humans use the same
information, it is an empirical question whether they make similar links and which method
performs better, relative to some benchmark.

One test of the accuracy of automated methods is to compare the links created by various
algorithms with genealogical hand linkages. While we use high quality hand links, we hesitate to
call these links “ground truth” because there is no way to know for sure what the true links are in
this case. In the first exercise, we asked the Record Linking Lab at Brigham Young University
(BYU) to check the quality of the links made by automated methods. The BYU lab linked the 1910
and 1920 US censuses using provided code and compared the links made by the automated

4
 Even linking based on race may be problematic when individuals selectively report their race (a pattern
documented in Mill and Stein 2016 and Dahis, Nix and Qian 2019).
5
 In practice, there is no way to conduct hand linking without some use of a computer algorithm. Asking a
human clerk to compare one record to all other records in the Census would be physically impossible.
Instead, hand linking procedures first screen out “impossible” matches based on name and age similarity
and then offer the human linkers a set of possible matches (usually fewer than 10).
6
  This literature is summarized in Kahneman (2011). Kahneman and Tversky (1973) coined the term
"illusion of validity" to the refer to the cognitive bias through which people overestimate their ability to
interpret and predict outcomes when analyzing a set of data.

                                                     4
methods to those made by users of the website FamilySearch.org. Specifically, the BYU team uses
the Family Tree data, in which users of the platform connect individuals together on a wiki-style
family tree (typically, their own family members and ancestors). To create these links, users attach
historical documents (such as a US Census record) to that person as evidence of that person's
existence or relationship. This genealogical linking has been considered the gold standard of hand
linking (Bailey et al. 2017), although users of FamilySearch tree might not be representative of the
entire US population. The Record Linkage Lab found that ABE links (EM links) agree with users
of the Family Tree data in over 95% (97%) of cases. This implies a rate of “false positives” of less
than 5% between the genealogical links made by humans and those made by the automated
methods.

In the second exercise, we use a similar method to compare the links created by a wider set of
algorithms to data linked from the Union Army Records to the 1900 US Census, which were
carefully (and expensively) hand collected using trained research assistants who had access to extra
information not typically available for linking (Costa et al. 2017). Treating these data as a
benchmark, we compare the relative performance of automated and hand linking methods that use
only typically-available variables (that is, names, year of birth, and state or country of birth).
Unlike comparisons with the Record Linkage Lab (which links a full count census to a full count
census), here the linking is from a sample (the Union Army records) to a full count census, which
will tend to increase false positive rates.7 We find that these widely-used automated methods lie
along a frontier that illustrate the tradeoff between type I and type II errors. Researchers can choose
to use algorithms that generate very low “discrepancy rates” from these high-quality benchmark
links, which we refer to here as the “false positive rate” (as low as 5-10% in the context of the
Union Army records). However, achieving a low false positive rate comes at a cost of accepting a




7
  The following example illustrates why this might be the case: Assume there are two John Smiths in 1880
US, but only one of them is in the Union Army records. In 1890, one of the John Smiths (the one who was
originally in the Union Army records) moves out of the US. By 1900, there will be just one John Smith in
the census, so a linking method that starts from a sample will likely link the unique (in the Union Army
records) 1880 John Smith to the unique 1900 full count John Smith, even though the two are different
people.

                                                   5
relatively low (true) match rates (10-30%). Alternatively, researchers can choose algorithms with
higher (true) match rates (50-60%) at a cost of higher discrepancy rates (15-30%).8

Hand linking that relies on the typically-used linking variables (name, age and place of birth) is
also on this frontier, producing “false positive” rates of around 25% and (true) match rates of
around 63%. Not surprisingly, “false positive” and true match rates for hand links look very similar
to links created by machine learning algorithms that are trained on hand-linked data. Relative to
more conservative automated methods, humans using typical linking variables tend to match more
observations than automated methods but at a cost of higher rates of false positives. When humans
and machine use the same information for linking, automated methods have very low discrepancy
rates relative to hand links.

We next use data from two different transcriptions of the 1940 Federal Census, one transcribed by
FamilySearch and one by Ancestry.com. In this case, we can establish a real “ground truth”
because records listed on the same census manuscript page and line number are known to refer to
the same individual but the set of possible errors is more limited (transcription errors are still
possible, but mortality and return migration are not). We find that differences in transcription for
names (but not ages) are generally high, particularly for the foreign born from non-English
speaking countries. Between 7-14% of first names (and 17-32% of last names) have at least one-
character difference in the two transcribed versions.9 Despite transcription differences, we find
that automated methods produce links between these two versions of the 1940 Census that are
almost 100% correct. We note that even when linking a census to itself, we can only link 43-67%
of the observations: Non-unique records due to common names like John Smith can explain around
55 percent of non-matches, whereas transcription errors explain the remaining 45 percent. This
suggests that there is an upper bound for match rates of any method, either with automated or hand
linking.

  Depending on specific choices of name strings and age differences, the more conservative ABE
algorithms generate samples with “false positive” rates of about 10% and (true) match rates of about 25-
30%, and their less conservative algorithms generate samples with about 20-25% “false positive” rates and
about 35% (true) match rates. The ML algorithms generate samples with “false positive” ranging from
about 17-30%, and 50-60% (true) match rates, and the EM algorithms generate samples with about 5-15%
“false positive” rates with a 5-30% (true) match rates range.

    We compare one version of the 1940 Census to the other by line and page number.

                                                    6
Ultimately, the goal of constructing linked samples is to conduct economic analyses. We study
how automated linking methods affect inference using two samples. First, we examine the
sensitivity of regression estimates to the choice of linking algorithm using linked data from the
1915 Iowa Census to the 1940 Federal census. These data allow us to study a set of typical
regressions documenting intergenerational mobility between fathers and their sons. Here we do
not have a proxy for ground truth, but we can compare the results we obtain in samples linked by
hand to those we obtain in samples linked using automated methods. For multiple outcome and
explanatory variables, we find that parameter estimates are stable across linking methods, with
parameter estimates using automated and hand links similar in magnitude and well within each
other’s 95% confidence intervals. For example, in the case of intergenerational income elasticity,
our weighted estimates mostly range between 0.15 to 0.20. This stability is not surprising, because
we also find that human linkers and automated methods agree in over 90% of cases. In the few
cases of discord, it is not clear from inspection whether computer algorithms or hand linkers is
correct.

Second, to evaluate automated methods in another setting and across countries, we use data linked
from the 1850 to the 1880 US censuses of population, and from the 1865 to the 1900 Norwegian
population censuses, comparing our links to the widely-used linked samples constructed by
IPUMS (Goeken et al. 2011). We measure intergenerational occupational mobility (another typical
use of linked data) and find that in both the US and Norway the automated methods generate very
similar measures of intergenerational mobility to the ones computed using the IPUMS linked
samples.

Overall, we conclude that automated methods perform well. Automated methods involve a tradeoff
between the number of matches made and the accuracy of the matches. It is possible to select an
algorithm that will generate samples with very low rates of false positives, and estimates using
different automated methods are in most cases stable. Throughout the paper we also provide
general guidance for researchers and offer practical tips. Our overarching advice to researchers
using linked historical data is to create alternative samples using various automated methods and
test the robustness of results across samples. Whenever high quality hand linked data can be
created, the researcher should consider using them as well (Bailey et al. 2019), although we note




                                                7
that such data are often impractical and expensive to create, and that even well trained hand linkers
can make errors.10

2. Linking algorithms
     In this section, we briefly describe the automated record linkage algorithms evaluated in this
paper, with an eye towards making them useful to practitioners. The goal of these algorithms is
to link individuals from one set of records (dataset A) to another set of records (dataset B).
Although the discussion below is focused on the case in which the linking is solely based on
predetermined characteristics (names, place of birth and year of birth), we emphasize that all of
these algorithms can be easily modified to use additional characteristics for linking (for instance,
place of residence or information on other family members).

Implementation code and Stata commands for all of these algorithms can be found on our webpage
at: https://people.stanford.edu/ranabr/matching-codes. We also provide a general coding structure
to facilitate the adaptation of the codes to specific linking projects.




10
   Our paper was written in parallel to Bailey et al. (2017, 2019), which evaluates some of the same
historical linking methods. Yet, our takeaway about the usefulness of automated methods is more positive
that Bailey et al (2019) for a number of reasons. First, we show that links done by automated methods are
very similar to the best available hand links created by users of FamilySearch.org website. Second, in real
ground truth data based on comparing two independent transcriptions of the 1940 census, we find that while
automated methods miss many links because of transcription differences, the links they create are almost
100% correct. Third, Bailey et al (2019) continues to report results that mix the Abramitzky, Boustan, and
Eriksson approach with an outdated name standardizing algorithm (Soundex) that is not used in
contemporary linking papers (see Koneru et al. (2016), which suggests that NYSIIS result in fewer false
positives than Soundex). Not surprisingly, this method is reported to have the highest false positive rates
(43%). Fourth, Bailey et al. (both 2017 and 2019) reports the highest error rates in an exercise that assumes
that hand links performed by well-trained research assistants are ground truth (LIFE-M). In the LIFE-M
data, hand linkers matched 45% of the records. Bailey et al. (2017, 2019) assume that any match made by
an automated method in the remaining 55% of the data is necessarily wrong, but this assumption cannot be
evaluated in the absence of real ground truth data. Finally, Bailey et al. (2017, 2019) also classifies any
discordant match for which the automated method selects a different match than the hand linkers to be a
“false positive” but it is also possible that the hand linkers selected the incorrect pair. We also note that our
findings are more in line with the lower false positive rates reported in Bailey et al. (2019) than with the
higher false positive rates reported Bailey et al. (2017). See our NBER Working Paper version (2019) for
additional reasons why the false positive rates of automated methods reported in Bailey et al. (2017) are
high.

                                                       8
One promising method that we do not evaluate is a probabilistic matching approach, whereby
instead of making unique matches, the researcher decides to use several possible matches and adjust
the analysis accordingly (see, for instance, Lahiri and Larsen 2005 and Poirier and Ziebarth 2019). One
advantage of such a method is that no observations are dropped, so uniquely matched observations can
be used together with observations that have multiple matches. This could, potentially, lead to
efficiency gains. This method has not been used widely, perhaps because it is challenging to apply to
historical linkage. For instance, Lahiri and Larsen (2005) assume that all observations in one dataset
have a potential link in the other, which is usually not the case when linking historical censuses because
of mortality and under enumeration (Abramitzky et al. 2019). More research is needed on the
conditions required for such methods to work well in the historical context, although tools discussed
in our paper could be used to identify the set of possible matches and their relative likelihood.

2.1. Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson (ABE) algorithms

The approach is described in more detail in Abramitzky, Boustan, and Eriksson (2012, 2014,
2019), and is similar in spirit to Ferrie (1996). Here are the basic steps:

     1. Clean names in datasets A and B to remove any non-alphabetic characters and account for
        common misspellings and nicknames (e.g. so that Ben and Benjamin would be considered
        the same name).

     2. Restrict the sample to people who are unique by first and last name, implied birth year
        calculated from calendar year and age, and place of birth (either state or country) in dataset
        A.11

     3. For each record in dataset A, look for records in dataset B that match on first name, last
        name, place of birth, and exact birth year. At this point there are three possibilities:

            a. If there is a unique match, this pair of observations is considered a match.

            b. If there are multiple potential matches in dataset B with the same year of birth, the
                observation is discarded (it is impossible to tell which potential match is correct).


11
  We note that historical US censuses did not include a question on year of birth, but rather only asked
people about their current age. To the extent that people misreport their age, we only observe an imperfect
proxy of the actual year of birth.

                                                    9
            c. If there are no matches by exact year of birth, the algorithm searches for matches
                within ± 1 year of reported birth year, and if this is unsuccessful, it looks for
                matches within ± 2 years. In each of these steps, only unique matches are accepted.
                If none of these attempts produces a unique match, the observation is discarded.

            d. In an updated version of this method, this procedure is then done for each record in
                dataset B, after which the intersection of the two matched samples is taken.12

The steps described above represent the basic structure of the algorithm.13 However, the papers
that implement this approach typically also implement the following variations of the basic
algorithm to check the robustness of the results.

     1. Requiring matches on exact year of birth. In the standard process matched pairs are allowed
        to differ by up to 2 years in reported year of birth. Alternatively, matched pairs can be
        required to have the exact same reported year of birth to minimize the chance of false
        positives. However, this will result in a smaller matched sample, and will increase the
        number of Type II errors.

     2. Requiring names to be unique within a 5-year band (within ± 2 years of the implied birth
        year). In historical records, reported age is an imperfect measure of true year of birth (due
        to misreporting, rounding, and timing of census enumeration). In the standard matching
        process, we attempt to link a record as long as there is no one else with the same name and
        same birth year. In this robustness check we only attempt to match a record if there is no
        one else with the same name who was born within +- 2 years of the implied birth year.
        Given this more restrictive uniqueness requirement, there will be fewer false positives but



12
  An example is given in the Appendix of a match that could have been made in the original ABE code but
which has since been fixed. Because of this possibility, it is necessary to do the matching in both directions
and take the intersection of the resulting matches. The updated code is not used in the papers cited, but is
used for the abematch Stata command. We posted replication files of all of the relevant papers on
https://ranabr.people.stanford.edu/matching-codes.
13
  In practice, this approach runs faster for large datasets when looping over blocks. For example, in the
United States, it is more efficient to block first by birth state or country and then append the resulting
datasets together. In addition, the Stata command can make multiple robustness samples, as described
below, at once so the matching only needs to be done once if matching based on the same variables.

                                                     10
        the number of (true) matches created will also be lower.14 Two versions of this restriction
        are possible. The first version introduces a step 0 that flags observations in each dataset
        that are unique within ± 2 years of birth and then keeps only those observations after the
        match has occurred. The second version also flags matched cases in each dataset that do
        not have another potential match within the ± 2 years age band in the other dataset.15

     3. Using NYSIIS (New York State Identification and Intelligence System) standardized
        names. Another concern with historical records is misspelling and mis-transcription of
        names. This risk can be exacerbated when focusing on immigrants with foreign names that
        census enumerators may not be familiar with. One way of accounting for this is to use the
        NYSIIS standardized names, rather than exact names, in the matching procedure. The
        NYSIIS phonetic algorithm standardizes names based on their pronunciation so that names
        can be matched even if there are minor spelling differences.

     4. Jaro-Winkler adjustment. Jaro-Winkler string distance gives a measure of the similarity of
        two strings, placing more weight on characters at the beginning of the strings. The measure
        is based on the “edit distance” between two strings (that is, the number of changes that
        need to be made to one string to convert it into the other). An alternative to using NYSIIS
        standardized names is to compute the Jaro-Winkler string distance between the first and
        last names of all potential matches within each dataset. The matching process can then
        consider any two records with a string distance below a given cutoff to be a match. We
        describe this approach in more detail below.


14
  For instance, imagine that two men named James Alexander were born in 1892, but dataset A incorrectly
reports that one of these men was born in 1890. Both men appear to be unique by name and exact year of
birth in dataset A, and would be used in the standard matching process. Because in reality these men were
born in the same year, they are non-unique and should not be considered in the matching process (it would
be impossible to tell when James Alexander is the correct match).
15
  Generally, the first and second versions of this algorithm match the same set of people. However, here is
an example of how the two versions could produce different matches. Imagine that there are three men
named Alex Smith in dataset A with reported birth years of 1890, 1891, and 1894, and only one Alex Smith
in dataset B with a birth year of 1892. In the first version, the men in dataset A with a birth year of 1890
and 1891 will be dropped, but Alex Smith born in 1894 will remain since he is unique within ± 2 years of
his birth year. In this case we would match Alex Smith, born in 1894 to the Alex Smith in dataset B, born
in 1892. However, in the second version, we would require that Alex Smith in dataset B have only one
potential match within a ±2 year band in the other dataset. Given that there are three potential matches
within ± 2 years, no successful match will be made.

                                                    11
      5. Adding middle names/initials as a linking characteristic for those who have them. 16 In
           cases where no middle name is reported, we link on the full name. An alternative is to
           truncate all middle names to a single initial and then to match on middle initials only
           because the use of full middle names is very unstable across Census waves. Indeed, Census
           enumerators were instructed to only record middle initials, rather than full name.17

2.2. Abramitzky, Boustan, and Eriksson algorithm using string comparators (ABE-JW)

A limitation of the ABE algorithm described above is that it relies on matching observations based
on either exact or standardized names. This reliance has two potential limitations. First, match
rates could be lower, because cases in which names do not coincide exactly either in their raw or
their standardized version might be very similar and could correspond to the same individual, yet
would be dropped by the algorithm. For instance, “Santiago Perez” and “Santiago Perz,” which
are close to one another in string distance and may reflect a simple enumeration or transcription
error, would count as a different name both when using raw and NYSIIS standardized names.
Second, relying on standardized names might lead to higher rates of false positives because the
name standardization may treat two very different names as the same string. For instance, the
names “Thomas Calemon” and “Thomas Colenan” seem sufficiently different that they are
unlikely to be the same person but would be assigned the same NYSIIS standardized name, “Tan
Calanan.”       To address this limitation, we follow recent literature in economic history and
incorporate a string comparator to the linking procedure—the Jaro-Winkler (JW) score.18 More
specifically, we implement the following procedure (Abramitzky, Boustan, and Eriksson 2019):

      1. For each observation in dataset A, we identify a set of potential matches in dataset B. An
           observation in dataset B is a potential match for an observation in dataset A if:
               (a) It has the same place of birth.
               (b) The predicted year of birth is within minus/plus five years of the reported year of



16
  There is a wide variation in the use of middle names across populations. As many as 9.75% of enlistees
in the Union Army had a middle name. In contrast, the foreign born in the US in 1900 were very unlikely
to use middle names (0.47%). We recommend that researchers choose to use or not use middle names in
their matching algorithms according to context.
17
     See instruction # 124 in 1900 here (https://usa.ipums.org/usa/voliii/inst1900.shtml).
18
     See, for instance, Mill and Stein (2016), Feigenbaum (2018), Nix and Qian (2015), Perez (2017, 2019).

                                                       12
                  birth in dataset A.19
             (c) The first letter in the first and last names are the same first letters as the observation
                  to be matched.20
     2. For each pair of potential matches, we compute the Jaro-Winkler score for the first and last
        names (and middle name, if available). The JW score ranges from 0 to 1. We normalize
        the JW score such that 0 corresponds to two identical strings and 1 corresponds to two
        strings with no common characters.21
     3. For each pair of potential matches, we define a “name match” as a pair of observations
        with a JW score in the first, (middle) and last names less than or equal to 0.1.22 At this
        point, there are three possibilities:
             (a) We do not find any “name match” for a given observation in dataset A. In this
                  case, we consider it “unmatched” and drop it from the analysis.
             (b) The observation in the source data (dataset A) has a unique “name match” in the
                  destination data, and the observation in the destination data (dataset B) has a
                  unique “name match” in the source data. In this case, we incorporate the
                  observation to the analysis.
             (c) We find more than one “name match” for an observation in the source data. In this
                  case, we use the following decision rule:


19
  We choose this rule of +/- five years for potential matches even though we only consider +/-2 years for
actual matches to avoid cases like the following: Ran Abramitzky is 20 years old in dataset A and 22 years
old in dataset B, and there is another Ran Abramitzky who is 23 years old in dataset B. In dataset B, the
two Ran Abramitzky are only 1 year apart, so a more conservative choice is not to match either one.
20
  The goal of imposing this condition is to dramatically reduce computational time. It can be relaxed when
the datasets are relatively small. Moreover, an alternative to blocking on the first letter of the exact first and
last names is to block on the first letter of the standardized first and last names (so as to allow for matches
between a name like “Katherine” and a name like “Catherine”).
21
  Stata’s “jarowinkler” command produces string similarity scores rather than distances so exact matches
are actually scored at 1 and strings without common characters are scored at 0, but we follow the method
used in the R package stringdist.
22
  The method does not require this cutoff to be exactly 0.1. However, in practice, 0.1 is a reasonably
conservative cutoff. For instance, Feigenbaum (2016) shows that 95% of the links made by IPUMS have a
Jaro-Winkler distance in first and last names below 0.2. To give a sense of the scale of Jaro Winkler scores,
the strings “Smith” and “Smyth” have a Jaro-Winkler distance of 0.106, and the strings “Frederick” and
“Francis” have a Jaro-Winkler distance of 0.329.

                                                       13
                    i. We compute the absolute value of the age difference with respect to the
                       observation with the closest age (let’s call this difference d1).
                   ii. We compute the absolute value of the age difference with respect to the
                       observation with the second closest age (let’s call this difference d2).
                   iii. We keep only individuals such that d2-d1>x, such that larger values of x
                       represent more conservative linking choices. In other words, we choose the
                       closest observation with respect to age, but only if the second closest
                       observation is “far enough” away, where the value of x determines how far
                       the second closest observation must be to create an acceptable match.
     4. Repeat steps 1-3, only matching observations from dataset B to dataset A (instead of from
        A to B).
     5. Our sample is comprised of the intersection between the observations that uniquely link
        from dataset A to dataset B and the observations that uniquely link from dataset B to dataset
        A.
     6. Because the JW distance measure is not transitive, in some cases we will find a unique
        match for a record in dataset A, even though there is another record in dataset A with the
        same reported age and within 0.1 JW distance in name. 23 To account for this, we
        additionally require that for each successful match there is no other individual with ≤ 0.1
        distance in name within ± x years of reported age.

We typically show results using x = 0 and x = 2, and allow matched observations to differ by up
to 2 years in reported year of birth. The case when x = 0 is parallel to the standard ABE method,
and in both cases we consider the potential match closest in age to be a successful match, so long
as this match is unique. Using x = 2 is parallel to the ABE method with a 5-year uniqueness
band. In this case we require that each record have only one potential match within ±2 year of
reported age, and additionally that each individual is unique by name or JW string distance within
±2 years in his own dataset.


23
  As an example, imagine that dataset A contains the men “John Anders” and “John Aders” born in 1890
and there is a man named “John Andersson” in dataset B, also born in 1890. The last names “Anders” and
“Aders” are within 0.1 JW distance, and the last names “Anders” and “Andersson” are also within 0.1 JW
distance. However, the names “Aders” and “Andersson” are not within 0.1 JW distance. As a result, “John
Anders” is the only potential match for “John Andersson.”

                                                  14
One limitation of the class of Abramitzky, Boustan, and Eriksson algorithms is that it is not clear
how to appropriately weight differences in name spelling versus differences in age when
comparing two records. For instance, the basic approach requires names (or their standardized
version) to match exactly, but enables age to differ by up to two years, whereas the JW considers
string similarity first (that is, only considers as potential matches those within a 0.1 JW distance)
before screening on age differences. This limitation prompted the development of two additional
linking methods that estimate the optimal weight for each of these differences and other record
match discrepancies. The goal of these methods is to “let the data speak” with respect to which
features (differences in names, and differences in year of birth) should be weighted more heavily,
and then combining these differences into a single linking score. We describe these two methods
below.

2.3. Fully automated probabilistic approach (EM)

The EM method is the first method designed to systematically weigh name versus age differences
in a fully automated probabilistic approach for record linkage. This approach is described in detail
in Abramitzky, Mill, and Perez (2019) and has the following steps:

      1. For each observation in dataset A, we identify a set of potential matches in dataset B. An
          observation in dataset B is a potential match for an observation in dataset A if:
              (a) It has the same place of birth.
              (b) The predicted year of birth is within minus/plus five years of the reported year of
                   birth in dataset A.
              (c) The first letter in the first and last names are the same first letters as the observation
                   to be matched.
      2. For each pair of potential matches, we compute measures of similarity in their reported
          year of birth and name. To measure similarity in names, we compute the Jaro-Winkler
          score for the first and last names.24 To measure similarity in reported ages, we compute the
          absolute value of the difference in reported years of birth.25

24
  In principle we could compute the JW score for middle names as well, which possibly could reduce false
positives further.
25
     Note that steps 1 and 2 are shared with the ABE-JW approach.

                                                     15
     3. We combine distances in reported names and ages between each record in dataset A and
        its potential match in dataset B into a single score, roughly corresponding to the probability
        that both records belong to the same individual. We estimate these probabilities using the
        Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, a standard technique in the statistical literature
        (Dempster et al. 1977, Winkler 1988). Abramitzky, Mill and Perez (2019) provides the
        logic and intuition for this estimation.26
     4. We use these scores to inform our decision rule on which records to use in the analysis.
        Specifically, to be considered a unique match for a record in dataset A, a record in dataset
        B must satisfy three conditions:
        (a) choose the match in dataset B with the highest probability (score) of being a true match
            out of all potential matches for the record in dataset A.
        (b) choose a match that is true with a sufficiently high probability (score), i.e. a match with
            a probability p1 that satisfies p1>p for a given p in (0,1), with p chosen by the researcher.
            Intuitively, the higher the value of p that the researcher chooses, the lower the
            likelihood of false positives.
        (c) choose a match for which the second best match is unlikely, i.e. the match score of the
            next best match, denoted as p2, satisfies p2<l for a given l in (0, p). with l also chosen
            by the researcher.




26
   The goal of the method is to split the full set of pairs of records into two groups (“clusters”): matches and
non-matches. The simplest way of thinking about this grouping problem would be to use k-means
clustering. In this approach, the data are split into k clusters so as to (1) minimize the within-cluster
differences across observations and (2) maximize the between-clusters differences. Intuitively, pairs of
records that are closer to each other with respect to their name and age distances should be grouped together
in the cluster of “matches,” and observations that are further away should be grouped together in the cluster
of “non-matches.” The EM algorithm instead computes probabilities of observations belonging to each of
the clusters. To compute these probabilities, the EM algorithm starts from assuming that distances between
records follow a particular type of distribution, and allowing two different distributions for matches and
non-matches.

                                                      16
     Similarly, to be considered a unique match for a record in dataset B, a record in dataset A has
to satisfy these three conditions.27 Our linked sample is the set of pairs of records (a, b) in A´B for
which: (1) a matches uniquely to b, and (2) b matches uniquely to a.

     Depending on the choice of values for the first- and second-best matches (p and l), it is possible
to generate samples with more or less confidence in the links. Intuitively, higher values of p and
lower values of l will yield samples with fewer observations but higher average quality of the links.
When the main concern is to avoid false positives, we suggest two rules of thumb. First, we suggest
to choose a low value of l. For instance, in the applications below we construct “conservative”
samples with l=0.3, which in our data corresponds to pairs of observation with a Jaro-Winkler
distance of at least 0.12 in both the first and last names and an age distance of 3. Second, because
names are the most important source of identifying information, we suggest choosing p such that
only records in which there is at least “partial agreement” (in our current implementation, a Jaro-
Winkler distance below 0.12) in both first and last name will be linked.

2.4. Machine learning algorithm (ML)

     The second method designed to systematically weight name versus age differences is a
machine learning approach to record linkage, using hand linked data to train the algorithm on how
much (or little) to penalize a potential match based on certain discrepancies in record features. This
approach is explained in detail in Feigenbaum (2016).28 The method has the following steps:



27
   We impose this symmetry condition because linking historical censuses is an example of one-to-one
linking. Imposing this condition prevents situations in which a record b in dataset B is the best candidate
for a record a in dataset A, but the best candidate for b in dataset B is a different record a’ in dataset A.
28
   Price et al. (2019) outline a new and promising tactic to create census linked samples. The method applies
a supervised machine learning approach as in Feigenbaum (2016). But rather than rely on RA-linked
data, Price et al. (2019) train their algorithm on data linked by the public on the wiki-style family tree hosted
by FamilySearch.org. Using potentially high quality linked data – matched by descendants and possibly
relying on information that goes well beyond the fields in any given census – the method performs quite
well on our standard measures of recovering true matches (PPV) and minimizing false positives (TPR), as
described in the next section. Price et al. (2019) link between the 1900, 1910, and 1920 Censuses. Although
more study on the representativeness of the FamilySearch tree – or how much any non-representativeness
in training data could matter – broader access to the FamilySearch tree could make this sort of strategy an
attractive matching technique in the future. Of particular interest: the FamilySearch tree training data
contains links of women over time (and across marital statuses), though such links could only be automated
in the presence of extra data (marriage certificates, for example).

                                                       17
     1. For each observation in dataset A, we identify a set of potential matches in dataset B using
        the rules articulated below. In principle, any record in B could be a match for a record in
        A, but to reduce computational complexity, the following screen is applied. An observation
        in dataset B is a potential match for an observation in dataset A if:
            a. It has the same place of birth.
            b. The year of birth distance between the two records is less than three years
            c. The Jaro-Winkler distance between the first names of the two records is less than
                 0.2.
            d. The Jaro-Winkler distance between the last names of the two records is less than
                 0.2.29
     2. Build a training dataset on a small share of these possible links and use the training data to
        tune a matching algorithm. To do this, a trained human researcher views a record in dataset
        A and the set of possible matches in dataset B and selects a match, if the researcher is
        confident such a match is correct. If no hand match can be made, either because all possible
        candidate matches are too different or because there are multiple matches deemed to be
        equally likely, then no match is recorded.30
     3. We fit a probit model to a reshaped version of the training dataset. Each observation in the
        reshaped data is a pair of records from dataset A and dataset B that could be a match,
        filtered as in step 1. The outcome is a simple indicator variable: 1 if the human researcher
        matched these records to one another, 0 if not. The right-hand-side variables are record
        linking features. These features include the main variables used by other methods such as
        Jaro-Winkler string distance in first name, the Jaro-Winkler string distance in last name,

29
   Specifically, the optimal filter values on Jaro-Winkler distance or year of birth distance may be larger for
data with high rates of transcription error. For example, when working with historical datasets with many
first names reported as initials (J.J. rather than James J., for example), including any pairs with either Jaro-
Winkler distance less than .2 OR agreement in the first letter of first name string could prevent true matches
from escaping the initial filter. Similarly, working with samples with more or less age heaping or age
misreporting could push the researcher to change the filtering.
30
   We provide an example of the full instructions given to RAs creating the training sample at
https://jamesfeigenbaum.github.io/linking/. The algorithm will “learn” from this researcher-produced
training dataset. If the trainer is more conservative or more aggressive with linking, these traits will be
reflected in the learned algorithm. Though most trainers tend to link similarly, such preferences could be
shaped by how the trainers are trained or instructed in the linking process and can be set differently in
different projects.

                                                      18
      and the absolute difference in year of birth. Other variables are also included: indicators
      for phonetic matches in first or last name, agreement of first or last letter of first or last
      names, the number of possible matches for the record from A in B, and agreement on
      middle initial. The method is flexible to the extent that this list of variables could change
      depending on the underlying data and historical context. The coefficients on each feature
      in the model represent the weight or penalty the human implicitly put on the various record
      features when making or not making links.
   4. Applying the fitted model to the full data, we generate a predicted probability of being a
      match for each pair of records in A and B.
   5. For each record in A, we compare the scores (fitted values) of all possible matches in B. A
      record is considered a match if it meets three conditions, similar in spirit to the three
      conditions in the EM method described previously:
          a. It is the match with highest score (probability of being linked by the human RA)
              out of all potential matches for the record in A.
          b. The score is sufficiently large – that is, greater than some threshold b1.
          c. The score is sufficiently better than the second-best match – that is, the ratio of the
              top score to the second-best score is larger than b2. When there is no second-best
              match because only one candidate match in dataset B was found for a given record
              in dataset A, this condition is trivially satisfied.
   6. To define the parameters b1 and b2 above, we use cross-validation within the training
      dataset, searching over the b1 and b2 space to find values that minimize a weighted average
      of both “false positives” and “false negatives” where the truth is taken as the matches made
      by the human in the training data. This step finds the parameters b1 and b2 that tune the
      machine matching to be most like the human training data when deciding whether a given
      candidate pair is likely or not likely to be a match. The researcher may choose these weights
      —essentially how much to care about type I versus type II errors – based on the context
      and the data. In this paper, we present ML linked samples based on even weights on type I
      and type II errors, as well as samples weighting 3 to 1 against type I errors and 3 to 1

3. Comparing automated and hand linking methods


                                                 19
Having described the various automated methods, we turn to a comparison of their performance
in a number of settings. In theory, comparing the performance of automated and hand linking
methods requires a third set of “ground truth” data in which true links are known with certainty.
Unfortunately, completely certain linked historical data do not exist. In the absence of such data,
we consider two genealogical samples to proxy for ground truth, following by a matching exercise
across two transcriptions of the same census where we do know whether two records are a true
match due to their placement in the census manuscript.

3.1. 1910 to 1920 Censuses using FamilySearch data

We asked the Record Linking Lab at Brigham Young University (BYU) to construct automated
links of the entire 1910 and 1920 US censuses using provided code, and to compare these matches
to the links from the FamilySearch’s Family Tree data. These data are a large wiki-style network
of individuals connected together in a “Family Tree” by users of the FamilySearch platform.31 In
order to verify that a person on the Family Tree is the correct person, users of the platform attach
records (such as a US Census record or a birth or death certificate) to that person as evidence of
that person's existence or relationship. For the purposes of this exercise, we take advantage of those
instances in which records from two different census years were attached to the same individual
in the Family Tree (hence creating a census-to-census link).

These hand links are expected to be high quality, because users have personal motivation to find
their ancestors, as well as private information not typically available to researchers conducting
automatic linking. For instance, these users might have information on maiden names or on other
family members, and from sources that go far beyond the census. Moreover, the website is
structured so as to enable different individuals to collaborate (and potentially correct each other)
when they have a family member in common (Price et al. 2019).



31
   Users of FamilySearch can add records to their ancestors' pages in two main ways. The first is through
automatically generated hints. To generate these hints, FamilySearch, like other genealogical platforms
(Ancestry.com, Geni.com, MyHeritage.com, etc), employs teams of data scientists and machine learning
record linking experts to generate automated links. In contrast to the automated linking methods we discuss
in this paper, FamilySearch uses information from sources other than the census, as well as information on
other household members. The second approach is by directly searching their ancestor’s names (and other
identifying information including place of birth and death) in the platform.

                                                    20
Table 1 shows the results of this exercise. The standard ABE method linked approximately 11
million people (8 million with the more conservative ABE method), out of about 47 million males
in the 1910 census, a link rate of about 23% (17% in the more conservative ABE method). Among
these matches, there were 3.39 million (2.78 million in the more conservative ABE method) that
overlapped with people for whom we also observed a match in the Family Tree data.32 Of these
matches, 95.23% (97.13% in the more conservative ABE method) of the time the match identified
by the ABE method is the same as the match identified on the Family Tree. If we treat the Family
Tree data from FamilySearch as the “ground truth” (again in quotation marks because we are
hesitant to call any hand linked data truth), then the rate of false positive of the ABE method is
4.77% (and only 2.87% with the more conservative ABE method). The EM method linked
approximately 3.6 million people. Among these matches, 1.358 million overlapped with people
for whom we also observed a match in the Family Tree data. Of these matches, 97.64% of the time
the match identified by the EM method is the same as the match identified on the Family Tree, a
“false positive” rate of 2.36%.

3.2 Union Army: Oldest Old data linked to the 1900 census

The Family Tree has a number of advantages: it contains millions of records, is created by linking
two complete-count censuses, and is considered the gold standard of hand linking. However,
because the data is proprietary, we are not able to use it for comparison with a wide set of
algorithms or for inference. We turn then to the Union Army data linked to the 1900 Census (Union
Army-Oldest Old data). These data include individuals known to have survived past the age of 95,
and are part of a larger data collection effort that started in 1991 with the Early Indicators project.
The benefit of this sample is that the data were carefully and expensively hand-collected by
genealogists who had access to data sources that go beyond the Union Army records (and that are
typically unavailable in other record linking projects). For example, the military pension system
collected detailed information on each individual’s exact birth and death dates and location. Given
the unusual wealth of data that was used to construct the links, they are more likely to be correct.33

32
   The BYU researchers emphasized that it is important to note that not every individual who appears in a
US Census record is attached to a person in the Family Tree data due to the vagaries of genealogical interest.
As a result, many automated links do not correspond to a record attached to a person in the Family Tree
data.
33
     We are grateful to Dora Costa for sharing these data with us.

                                                      21
The downside of this data is that it includes substantially fewer observations than a link across two
census years and that the Union Army records themselves contain fewer outcomes of economic
interest.

The construction of the Union Army data illustrates just how expensive and impractical hand-
linking might be. In particular, the project to link these records, called the Early Indicators project,
was led by Robert Fogel beginning in 1992 and was funded through several grants from the NIH
spanning from 1991 to 2019, with Dora Costa leading the project starting 2013. The project of
digitizing and linking the records was only complete twenty years after beginning the work. In
addition, the researchers who made the links were usually trained genealogists with many years of
experience. Finally, these genealogists often spent days considering the links of just one individual.
While the linkage rates are high, and some have considered the Union Army data to be a sort of
“ground truth” (though that can be debated), the project is completely infeasible for most
researchers because the funds and time spent on the project were enormous (see http://uadata.org/
for a description of the project, and Wimmer 2003 for an early discussion of the data collection).
Automated linking methods, in contrast, have a dramatically lower entry cost for researchers.

We have also created our own new hand-linked samples matching the Union Army records to the
1900 census. These samples were linked by two independent hand coders (an undergraduate
student at Boston University and an assistant professor, James Feigenbaum) who observed only
the variables that are used in standard automated algorithms: first and last names, year of birth,
and state of birth. 34 We call their links “limited-information hand linking” and test them against
the automated methods that use the same information (for the ML method, we use these hand links
to train the algorithm). Unlike in the case of the Union Army Data, we acknowledge that in this
case our hand coders are not professional genealogists. However, they did link independently,


34
  Specifically, we use a Stata dataset sent to us by Dora Costa and her team called milinfo_final.dta. We
pull names from the recname1 field (corresponding to the name taken from the Regimental Books at the
beginning of the data collection process) which includes comma delimited first and last names. We extract
years of birth from the rb_date1 field. As indicated by the variable names, neither are the only fields with
names or birthdates for the veterans in the UA data. The UA data was compiled from a variety of sources
and each record potentially has multiple name and birth date variants. If soldiers were lying about age to
enlist (claiming to be older to enlist earlier) some years of birth, particularly those on enlistment papers,
could contain substantial noise. But to make the comparison with automated methods as straight forward
as possible, we select the “first” variables (those marked with 1s) and treat them as noisy truth.

                                                     22
ended up finding very similar links, and the results are unchanged when we use only links that
were agreed by both. Comparing these hand-linked samples to those generated by automated
methods enables us to distinguish between the role of having additional information for linking
and whether human linking per se is more accurate than automated algorithms.

To compare how the various automated algorithms (ABE, ABE-JW, EM, and ML) perform
relative to each other and relative to the manually linked data, we use two standard measures of
performance capturing the tradeoff between Type I and Type II errors. These are:

        1. Positive Prediction Value (PPV) = #correct matches/#matches (= 1 – false positive
rate)

This measure captures the degree of accuracy of a linking algorithm. That is, out of all the records
that are matched, how many of these are correct?

        2. True Positive Rate (TPR) = #correct matches/#observations (= 1 – false negative rate)

This measure captures the degree of efficiency of a linking algorithm. That is, out of all the matches
that were made by the original hand-linking team, how many correct matches are made? Note that
this measure is different from the usually reported “match rate”, because the number in the
numerator is the “correct” number of matches rather than the total number of matches.

We deem a match to be correct if it links two records that were also matched by the genealogy-
quality hand linkers who constructed the Union Army-Oldest Old sample. Because the purpose of
this exercise is to compare the performance of different methods relative to the Union Army-Oldest
Old links, we only attempt to match those records that were initially matched in this sample (this
makes the maximum potential TPR value equal 1).35 Even in this context, genealogists were not

35
   For the matches underlying Figures 1-6, we attempted to link all observations that were successfully
matched by the relevant hand linkers. In Appendix Figures A.1-A.3, we instead attempt to link all records
in each dataset. In this case, we consider a link created by an automated algorithm to be false if that
observation was deemed “unlinked” by the hand linkers (although we emphasize that we cannot really know
if the hand linkers failure to produce a link is due to a link not existing, or to the hand linkers being reluctant
to make a choice between similar potential matches). This procedure will weakly increase the false positive
rate for automated methods. In the Union Army dataset, only 386 people, out of 2,033, were unable to be
assigned high quality links by hand coders, and as such including these observations does not make a
significant difference. However, only 62 percent of the observations in the 1915 Iowa Census could be
linked to the 1940 Census by the hand linkers (= 4,276 out of 6,881 men). Attempting to find matches for
all observations in the Iowa data lowers the reported “accuracy” of the automated algorithms, but the mean
PPV is still 85% and the lowest PPV is 70% (Appendix Figure A.3).

                                                       23
equally certain about all the links they made. We thus focus on those links that the research team
was most certain about (quality code equal to 1 in the Union Army-Oldest Old data). Specifically,
we only attempt to match the 1,619 records (out of 2,033) in the Union Army data that were
matched in the Union Army-Oldest Old data and had a quality code equal to one.36

We summarize the performance of the different algorithms through a series of figures. In each of
these figures, the vertical axis represents the PPV, while the horizontal axis represents the TPR.
These figures enable a visual interpretation of the tradeoff between accuracy (minimizing incorrect
links) and efficiency (maximizing correct links).

Figure 1 summarizes the performance of different algorithms when linking Union Army records
to the 1900 census. Methods are represented multiple times in the graph because we use different
versions of each, changing various parameters. Black circles represent different versions of the
ABE algorithm using NYSIIS standardized names. Grey circles represent different versions of the
ABE algorithm using exact names. Blue diamonds represent different versions of the ABE-JW.
Green squares represent links constructed using the EM method. Pink triangles represent the links
done using the ML method. Finally, the purple plus signs represent the hand matches that were
done by independent hand linkers.37

We find that automated methods roughly trace a frontier, with different automated methods on
different parts of it. The EM-linked samples tend to have fewer false positives (high PPV), whereas
the ML samples make a large number of true matches (high TPR). EM samples can achieve false
positive rates as low as 5-10%, but at the expense of rejecting a larger number of true matches.
ML samples link up to 60% of true matches, but end up with a 30-35% false positive rate. ABE
methods are in between the two sets of algorithms.

Hand linking is also on the frontier, in a region close to ML samples with relatively high (true)
match rates (high TPR) but also relatively high false positive rates (low PPV). This outcome

36
   Some of these records are non-unique based on place of birth, name and age. Hence, regardless of the
linking method we use, it is not possible to uniquely link these observations without access to additional
data. Including these observations in the denominator when computing the TPR only affects the level of
the TPR, but does not affect the ranking of methods.
37
  Appendix Table A.1 explores the performance of different variants of the ABE algorithms, experimenting
with including or excluding matches where there is an age difference, using middle names, etc. The main
takeaway from this table is that we recommend not using observations with age difference of more than
one year, as a high fraction of matches tend to be false positives.

                                                   24
suggests that human linkers tend to be more willing to declare matches, and are thus less
conservative than automated algorithms.38 Consider also that our measure of “ground truth” is
based on hand links (albeit hand links made with additional information), and so some of the
reported success of our low-information hand links might simply reflect shared biases between
hand linkers in the same social context (American universities).39

In Figure 2, we provide more details on the performance of the different versions of each of the
algorithms. Panel (a) focuses on the ABE algorithms using NYSIIS standardized names and panel
(b) instead uses exact names in the matching process. The variants are determined by whether the
algorithm uses middle initials or not, imposes a 5-year uniqueness band or not, and whether we
allow matches to differ in reported age by up to 2 years or require an age difference of ≤ 1 year.40
Panel (c) focuses on the ABE-JW method. We report versions imposing the age difference between
the first- and the second-best match to be of zero (our least conservative choice) or two (our most
conservative choice); versions using middle initials or not; and versions allowing matches to have
an age difference of ≤ 2 years or ≤ 1 year. Panel (d) focuses on the EM method. We report results
corresponding to a “conservative” and to a “lenient” sample. Our “conservative” sample uses
p=0.9 and l=0.3, whereas our “lenient” sample uses p=0.75 and l=0.6. To illustrate the trade-off
between type 1 and type 2 errors, we also show how the PPV and TPR change as we progressively
decrease the value of p (from 0.9 to 0.75) and increase the value of l (from 0.3 to 0.6). Finally,
Panel (e) focuses on the ML method, where the variants are determined by: (1) which person linked


38
  In a different context, Chan, Gentzkow, and Yu (2018) also find that humans faced with a classification
task put more weight on avoiding false negatives than on avoiding false positives. In their case, they
consider doctors diagnosing patients as having pneumonia or not.
39
   The proximity of the ML approach and the hand-links on which it was trained is not surprising but a good
check that that the computer does replicate choices made by the human trainer. It may also suggest that
using higher quality linked data to train with---either based on the double- and triple-entry practices at
LIFE-M described in Bailey et al. (2017) or the public genealogy trees used by Price et al (2019) or other
sources---could be a straightforward way to increase both PPV and TPR for machine learning approaches
to census linking.
40
   As a robustness check when linking individuals across different censuses, we typically recommend
keeping only matches with the same implied year of birth. However, in the UA-1900 linked data, an
abnormally high number of matches are off by one year in reported year of birth. This is likely because,
unlike census data where all records are collected at the same point in time, the UA data include information
collected at different points in the calendar year. Hence, we instead use all matches with ≤ 1-year difference
in reported age as a robustness check. In addition, this problem might be particularly acute in the 1900
census which asked year and month of birth as well as current age but seemed not to check for consistency.

                                                     25
the training sample, (2) whether the algorithm is allowed to use middle initials in determining
matches, and (3) the function of PPV and TPR that the algorithm tries to maximize. We consider
three functions: “Even” refers to matches that arise when the algorithm maximizes PPV+TPR;
“PPV” refers to maximizing 3*PPV + TPR; and “TPR” refers to maximizing PPV+3*TPR. 41
Appendix Figure A.4 shows the PPV and TPR of the ABE-JW method with alternative
requirements for the age difference between the first- and the second-best match.

These within-method comparisons also clearly show the tradeoff between minimizing false
positives (high PPV) and maximizing the (true) match rate (high TPR). More conservative versions
of each method (for instance, imposing 5 years uniqueness in the ABE, choosing a higher value of
p in the EM or giving higher weight to PPV in the ML) yield fewer false positives, but at the
expense of overlooking true matches. Indeed, the most conservative version of each of the methods
achieves a positive prediction value (PPV) of at least 0.8 (with some of the methods achieving
PPVs close to 1), suggesting a low false positive rate, but at the expense of matching fewer true
observations.42

One intuitive approach to further reduce false positives is to construct a sample using the
intersection of the methods.43 In Figure 3 we show the false positive and truth match rates (PPV
and TPR) of all possible 2-way, 3-way, 4-way, and 5-way intersections of five automated methods.
Taking the intersection of two or more methods indeed reduces false positives; the most accurate
single method has a PPV of slightly above 90% but taking the intersection of all five of these
methods increases the PPV to approximately 96%. However, this increase in PPV comes at the
expense of a lower TPR, implying that the “intersection” method also lies along the type 1/type 2


41
  We note that PPV and TPR in this maximization correspond to the training sample of hand links we
generate. The Union Army-Oldest Old sample links are not used in the training at any stage.
42
  Bailey et al. (2017) also evaluates the performance of different automated algorithms using the Oldest
Old data (in addition to the Life-M data and a “synthetic ground truth” data). Our results using the Oldest
Old data are similar to theirs when using the same linking algorithms. However, their analysis includes
some methods with high rates of false positives that are rarely or never used in economic history (such as
ABE with Soundex). In addition, we show that there a number of automated methods that generate low
false positive rates. As a result, our takeaway on automated methods is more positive than theirs.
43
  Intuitively, if different methods were wrong for different reasons, then looking at their intersection will
reduce false positives: it would be unlikely for several methods to make the same mistakes. Bailey et al
(2019) also uses this approach.

                                                     26
frontier (in a region of high PPV but relatively low TPR). The PPV and TPR values, along with
sample size, of each intersection are listed in Appendix Table A.2. Appendix Figure A.5 shows a
Venn diagram of the overlap in matches found by each of these methods. One notable feature of
this diagram is that the ML method yields the greatest number of matches that do not overlap with
any other single method.

Another important aspect of the quality of a matching algorithm is its ability to generate a
representative sample of the population. In particular, individuals who report their identifying
information with high accuracy will be disproportionately represented under a more stringent
matching rule, and these individuals could be more literate and numerate than the average
population. To evaluate the performance of the different methods with respect to
representativeness, in panel (a) of Table 2 we compare the observable characteristics of matched
and unmatched individuals. Overall, as scholars using linked historical data often acknowledge,
none of the methods generates fully representative samples. Specifically, in our application, all the
methods are more likely to link literate and taller individuals. Note, however, that the differences
are in all cases quite small. For instance, the largest coefficient on height is 0.373 inches (relative
to a mean height of 67.5 inches) and the largest coefficient on literacy is 0.017 (relative to an
average literacy of 0.938). In contrast, differences in occupational scores between matched and
unmatched individuals are not statistically significant (and are sometimes positive and sometimes
negative).

Given that differences in observable characteristics between matched and unmatched individuals
are typical in studies using linked data, we suggest that papers that rely on linking should carefully
discuss (lack of) representativeness and run versions of the analysis that reweight the sample to
match the population on observable characteristics. 44 It is also important to acknowledge that
external validity is limited to people with characteristics similar to the ones in the matched sample.

Automated methods versus limited-information hand links

Thus far, we have compared automated methods to a hand linked sample created from a wealth of
personal information. Overall, the false positive rates implied by this comparison are relatively


44
  For reweighting using inverse propensity score, see also Pérez (2017), Zimran (2019), and Bailey et al
(2019).

                                                  27
low, but they are not zero. Is this because hand linking is per se more accurate than automated
methods or because the hand-linkers in question had access to additional information? In Figure
4, we directly compare our automatic links based on four linking variables (first name, last name,
birth place and implied year of birth) to those made by hand linkers who had access to precisely
the same set of limited variables.45 To simplify presentation, we treat these limited-information
hand links as the “truth” in Figure 4, and compute “PPV” and “TPR” for each automated method
relative to these hand links (although, from Figure 1, we know that limited-information hand links
do not always coincide with genealogy-quality matches). All of the automated algorithms much
more closely replicate the limited-information hand links in Figure 4 compared to the full-
information hand links in Figure 1. Indeed, the lowest PPV across all methods is quite high in this
context (around 0.77), most of the PPVs are above 0.9 and many of them are above 0.95, implying
a discrepancy or “false positive” rate between 5 and 15%.

Computational time. Comparing the effectiveness (“the benefits”) of various methods does not
take into account the fact that the cost and computational time requirements to implement each of
them are rather different. For the UA-1900 exercise we measured the amount of time it took to
match when using each of the fully automated methods (ABE, ABE-JW, and EM). The ABE is
the least demanding method; it completed a full match using NYSIIS names in 10 minutes. The
ABE-JW and EM methods take more time than the ABE, mostly due to the computation of Jaro-
Winkler distances: Both the ABE-JW and EM methods took approximately 30 minutes to link the
UA-1900 census data. All algorithms will be more time intensive when using larger data sets. 46
Finally, note that hand linking is similarly computationally intensive, since it requires computer
time to filter which records to show to the human linker. For instance, manually linking a full


45
  Automated methods need not use only these four linking variables. Other approaches have included a
wider set of fixed characteristics, such as race or parents’ birthplace. Still other approaches, including those
underway by the Minnesota Population Center, include many linking variables, even if they can change
within person (e.g., name of spouse, occupation, location of residence). One advantage of linking based
only on characteristics that should not change within person over time is to allow all records to have an
equal chance of linking (for example, linking based on spouses’ name will increase the match rates of
individuals who are married, or who remain married to the same person over a decade).
46
  We also measured the time it took to link the 1915 Iowa data to the 1940 census. Linking in this case
took approximately 30 minutes when using the ABE method with NYSIIS or exact names, and about two
hours with the ABE-JW and EM methods. These are all rough estimates of the differences in computing
time, given that the work was done on the NBER server whose speed varies dramatically day to day
depending on other users’ load.

                                                      28
census to a full census is practically impossible without first using a computer to filter which
records to consider as potential candidates. Of course, in addition to the computational time,
manual linking also requires the time of human clerks. In our case, the research assistants that we
hired for performing the manual links made an average of four or five links per minute. Hence,
creating a double-entry, hand-linked sample of approximately 2000 observations would take 14 to
16 hours of research assistant time. But while all automated methods scale reasonably, hand-
linking does not: double-entry hand-linking all 40 million men in 1900 ahead to another census
would take more than 30 years.

It is worth keeping in mind that most of the extra computational-time costs attached to the EM or
ABE-JW methods are due to the calculation of JW distances across potential matches. When
linking observations across censuses or other commonly used sources, this additional extra time is
a kind of “fixed cost.” Once we compute these distances, they can be stored and used for different
research projects using the same datasets, or used within the same research project for different
linking methods (for the EM and the ABE-JW). One natural option is to use the standard ABE
match first before assessing robustness of the results to the methods that require additional
computational time.

3.3. Matching two independent transcriptions of the 1940 census to each other

Thus far, we have conducted linking exercises without a “ground truth” because, even in the case
of hand links made by highly trained genealogists, it is not possible to know with certainty whether
selected matches are correct. In this section, we perform a matching exercise where we do know
whether two records are a true match. Specifically, we link two different transcriptions of the 1940
Census: one version was transcribed by Ancestry.com and one version was transcribed by Family
Search (Ancestry-FS). Both transcriptions were performed using the same underlying data — the
1940 Federal Census – but were transcribed by two different genealogy companies with their own
methods. In each dataset, we observe the census page and line of each record. This information
provides the “true nexus” between the two different transcriptions. In addition to comparing the
performance of different automatic algorithms relative to actual ground truth, this exercise allows
us to quantify the degree of human error in transcribing records. As there is no mortality or
migration or name-changing or enumeration error between these two versions – they are based on
the same exact underlying enumeration – only transcription will vary.


                                                29
Table 3 shows that there are substantial differences between the names in the two transcriptions.
In this table, we show the fraction of observations that differ in the first name (after different string
cleaning), last name or middle name and initial. We also perform this exercise separately for
persons born in Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio, England, and Italy to assess variation in transcription
across population subgroups.47 The table shows that transcription error is present and meaningful
(e.g. between 7% and 14% of records disagree in the first name, and between 17% and 32%
disagree in the last name). In addition, those who are born in Italy have higher rates of
disagreement (likely reflecting that many transcribers are English-speaking). Similarly, in
Appendix Figure A.8, we compute the Jaro-Winkler distance in first (x-axis) and last (y-axis)
names between the two independent transcriptions. If both transcriptions were identical, all the
observations would be on the origin, but this is far from being the case. In contrast to the
differences in transcribed names, we find small (although non-zero) differences in transcribed
ages. In this case, the two transcriptions disagree in at most 2% of the cases.48

In Table 4, we display the results from linking the two transcriptions of the 1940 Census. For
simplicity, we just focus on the different versions of the ABE algorithm. Depending on whether
we use a more or less conservative version of the ABE, we match between 43%-67% of all
observations. However, among the ones that the ABE algorithm matches, practically all of them
are correct (PPVs are between 0.98 and 1). This implies that, despite substantial transcription
errors, the automated methods perform well in finding correct matches, but that they are
conservative in the sense that they avoid matching observations that are not “unique” enough or
where differences in transcription are very severe. Moreover, this exercise implies that it is likely
not possible to obtain matching rates that are higher than the ones here, unless further information
is used for disambiguation.



47
  Ohio and North Carolina are two populous states, one in the North and on in the South. We also included
Iowa as it has similar characteristics to the average US states in this time period and because our previous
analysis also uses data from Iowa. Finally, we chose two immigrant countries (one English speaking, one
non-English speaking) to assess transcription discrepancies for foreign names.
48
  Note that, if the two transcriptions were identical to each other, all our algorithms would by construction
have zero false positives: All the methods privilege “exact links” over links in which there is some

3.4. 1915 Iowa records linked to the 1940 census

We next turn to a sample that will allow us to conduct a set of typical intergenerational mobility
regressions using samples based on hand and automated links. Specifically, we use a sample
constructed in Feigenbaum (2018) that links the 1915 Iowa Census to the 1940 Federal Census.
Unlike in the previous exercises, we do not have a genealogically-based sample to constitute
“ground truth,” and so we will focus on comparing automated links to hand links based on standard
matching variables (names, place of birth, and year of birth). Feigenbaum began with the 6,071
boys in the Iowa State Census sample digitized in Goldin and Katz (2000, 2007). To locate these
sons in 1940, he utilized the 100% 1940 census sample deposited by Ancestry.com with the NBER.
In this context, it is not possible to establish whether the algorithm or the human is correct due to
the absence of ground truth data.

As in the UA-1900 case, we find that there is little disagreement between automated and hand
links when humans and algorithms use the same information for linking. Here, for presentational
purposes, we treat limited-information hand links as the “truth” in our figures, and compute “PPV”
and “TPR” assuming that the hand links are correct. Figure 5 shows the results of this exercise.
The EM and ML methods consistently produce PPV values which are close to 1, and the ABE
method produced PPV values that range from 0.88-0.99, implying a “false positive” rate between
2 and 12%. The intersection of the automated methods, shown in Figure 6, further increases PPV
(which becomes nearly equal to one), but at the expense of substantially reducing TPR. In
Appendix Table A.3, we list the PPV and TPR values, along with sample size, of each intersection.
Appendix Figure A.6 shows a Venn diagram of the overlap in matches found by each of these
methods.

In addition, as in the case of the Union Army linked data, the matched sample is quite similar to
the population, but not fully representative (panel (b) of Table 1). Specifically, most methods are
more likely to find younger individuals, with the largest age difference between matched and
unmatched individuals being of -0.312 years (relative to an average age in 1915 of 9.636 years
old). There is also a correlation between having a foreign-born parent and the likelihood of
matching, although this correlation is sometimes positive and sometimes negative depending on
the linking method. Individuals who were literate or had more years of schooling in 1915 are also

                                                 31
less likely to be linked in this case. However, given that the sample includes many children in
1915, these measures do not capture final educational attainment and this pattern instead likely
reflects the fact that younger individuals are more likely to be linked.

3.5. Assessing discrepancies between hand links and automated methods

One of the general takeaways from this and the previous exercises is that, whenever humans and
algorithms have the same amount of information, the level of disagreement in matches is actually
quite low. However, there are still cases when humans and algorithms disagree. Once we look at
disagreements, is it obvious that humans are “right”? To better understand this issue, we took the
complete list of disagreements from a case where one of the algorithms had a very low number of
disagreements with hand linkers. Specifically, we focus on the EM with hyperparameter choices
0.75-0.6 (see section 2). The EM 0.75-0.6 had TPR=0.25 and PPV=0.98, implying that out of all
the links made by the algorithm, 98% were also made by the hand linkers. In Appendix Figure
A.7, we provide the full list of the 16 instances in which the algorithm and the human chose a
different link. The left column shows the records that we want to match, the middle column shows
the records that human linkers chose, and the right column shows the choices that the automated
method made.

In most cases, it is not straightforward to establish without further information whether the hand-
link is “correct” or whether the algorithmic link is “correct.” Going back to our example from the
introduction, in line 14 (Paul Coulter, born in Kansas, predicted year of birth 1912), the algorithm
chooses Paul Courter, born one year apart, whereas the hand linker chooses Paul Coater, born in
the same year. In line 7 (John Obman), the algorithm chooses John M Orman, born one year apart,
whereas the hand linker chooses John Ohmann, born in the same year. In line 16 (William Noel
born in 1910), the algorithm chooses William F Noxsel born in 1911, but the hand linker chooses
William G Noll born in 1909.

Overall, this exercise suggests that when humans and algorithms have the same amount of
information, the extent of disagreement is usually low, and when they do disagree, it is unclear
whether the human or the algorithm is more likely to be correct. Beyond this lack of a clear
advantage in performance, there are some practical and conceptual difficulties in implementing
hand linking. First, as discussed above, when matching by hand, even with unlimited budget it is
infeasible to compare each record to each potential match (each potential match being for example

                                                 32
every one of 100s of millions of Census observations). Hence, it becomes necessary to choose who
to show to the human linker as a potential match for each record. By contrast, a computer in
principle can make these very large comparisons.

The fact that human linkers cannot compare all potential matches simultaneously creates additional
conceptual difficulties. If the potential matches are shown “without replacement” (that is, each
observation is shown as a potential match for just one observation), the order in which the human
linker sees the potential matches might influence the final set of links. If, on the other hand, the
potential matches are shown with replacement, the researcher might end up with duplicate links,
which cannot obviously all be “true.”

Finally, an additional important disadvantage of hand linking is the issue of replicability. While
automated methods are transparent and easy replicate, hand links are by definition impossible to
replicate without the intervention of the same hand linker (and even the same hand linker can make
different choices at different points in time). While we do find that two independent hand linkers
trained in similar ways made similar choices that need not always be the case.



4. Results: Automated methods and inference

Ultimately, the goal of producing linked samples is to conduct economic analyses. Thus, the key
question for any automated linking method is to what extent it affects inference downstream. There
are two main channels through which errors in linking might affect inference. First, incorrectly
linked individuals could introduce measurement error and result in attenuation bias. Second, the
inability to link every observation could affect inference if the people who can be linked are not
representative of the population.

Before considering the extent to which automated linking affects regression coefficients, it is
important to note that, even if automated linked samples produced different point estimates, doing
so might not substantially affect a paper’s conclusions. In particular, researchers must consider
whether false positives will understate or overstate their findings. For instance, when the goal of a
study is to test whether a certain variable has a positive or a negative effect on another, attenuation
bias will bias the estimated effect toward zero but will not change the sign of the relationship. In
contrast, studies of intergenerational mobility rely on estimating a persistence parameter (the

                                                  33
degree to which father outcomes predict son outcomes), which is inversely related to mobility.
Thus, attenuation of the persistence parameter would overstate the degree of mobility.               More
generally, we encourage researchers to think carefully about the bias caused by false positives and
unrepresentative sample. For example, in many regression settings, false links will create
measurement error that will bias OLS estimates toward zero. However, family fixed effects
estimates (FE) are actually biased towards OLS because picking two random people and calling
them brothers (due to incorrect matches) will tend to recover the population-wide estimates.

We perform two exercises to assess how choice of linking method will affect substantive research
conclusions. In the first exercise, we use the Iowa-1940 census to compute intergenerational
correlations in earnings and education. In the second exercise, we use the US 1850-1880 and the
Norway 1865-1900 linked samples to compute measures of intergenerational occupational
mobility.

4.1. Inference using the Iowa 1915 Data linked to the 1940 census

One common application of linked data in economic history is to quantify the extent to which a
son’s economic outcomes can be predicted by his father’s characteristics. We compare
intergenerational correlations in earnings and education in the Iowa-1940 data using various
automated and hand linking methods. First, we regress the log of son’s earnings in the 1940 census
on the log of his father’s earnings in 1915 Iowa.49 Second, we regress a son’s completed years of
schooling in 1940 on his father’s completed years of schooling as measured in the 1915 data.

Panels (a) and (b) of Figure 7 present the results of these regressions. We find that hand and
automated linked samples recover similar estimates of the inter-generational elasticity of income
and education. In all cases, the coefficients are precisely estimated and the 95% confidence interval
using hand links methods includes the point estimate using any of the automated methods.
Estimates of the inter-generational elasticity of income range from 0.15 to 0.20, with the smallest
coefficient 25% lower than the largest, producing a set of results that would not change the
qualitative conclusion of any study in question.

  Bailey et al (2019) computes intergenerational elasticities between fathers’ and sons’ earnings using the
LIFE-M data.

                                                    34
Figure 7 also reports the coefficients from these regressions after reweighting the data by the
following observable characteristics in the Iowa census records: year of birth, literacy, years of
schooling and foreign-born status of parents. By reweighting, we ensure that each linked sample
matches the proportions in the 1915 Iowa census. The balance table in Appendix Table A.4. shows
that the sample rebalances on observables after weighting. Weighted results look similar to their
unweighted counterparts, with automated methods producing similar coefficients to the hand-
linked data.

4.2. Inference using linked fathers and sons across US and Norwegian censuses of population

Abramitzky, Mill, and Perez (2019) use the EM method to create two sets of linked samples: one
linking the 1850 and 1880 US censuses of population, and one linking the 1865 and 1900
Norwegian censuses of population. Here, we recreate these linked samples using the full set of
other automated methods. We chose to create these linked samples for three primary reasons. First,
economic history papers often attempt to link historical censuses of population (rather than some
outside source like Union Army data to a census), making linked census samples especially
attractive to test our methods. Second, IPUMS has constructed widely used linked samples for
both the US and Norway for these census years (Ruggles et al. 2011). Third, testing the method in
two different countries enables us to assess how well automated methods perform in two settings
with different naming conventions, enumeration quality, outmigration rates, etc.

   We compute transition matrices documenting rates of intergenerational occupational mobility
using our various linked datasets as well as the published files from IPUMS. We show that
researchers using our various linked samples would have arrived at substantively similar
conclusions about the patterns of intergenerational mobility, as compared to the widely used
IPUMS samples.

   Appendix Tables A.5 and A.6 show the father-son occupational transition matrices constructed
using our linked samples and the IPUMS linked samples. Appendix Table A.5 shows the data for
the US 1850-1880 links, whereas Appendix Table A.6 shows the corresponding Norway 1865-
1900 links. As can be seen from the tables, the automated methods produce quite similar
occupational transition matrices, both when linking US records and when linking Norwegian
records. In most cases, the estimated percentage of sons who are in each occupational category is


                                               35
very similar across methods. As a result, the methods also generate a very similar occupational
structure among sons in the later census year (last row of each matrix in each of the tables).

   Table 5 reports summary measures of intergenerational occupational mobility using the
linked samples. In panel (a), we report the simplest measure of occupational mobility: the fraction
of sons working in a different occupational category than their fathers. We also report a test of
whether this fraction is the same as the one that would arise if son’s occupations were
independent of father’s occupations. In panel (b), we use instead the Altham statistic (Altham
1970), which measures the distance of each occupational transition matrix with respect to a
matrix representing independence (so that larger values imply higher departures from
independence, that is, less mobility). This approach for measuring mobility is the one used in
some recent economic history papers and is more appropriate when comparing countries with
different occupational structures (see Long and Ferrie (2013) and Modalsli (2017) for further
details).

   In both the US and Norway, the fraction of sons working in a different occupational category
than their father is similar when using the IPUMS linked samples than when using the
automatically linked samples. In the US, we estimate that about 45% of sons worked in a
differential occupational category when using the IPUMS sample, and between 44 and 50 when
using our own linked samples. In Norway, we estimate that 47% of sons worked on a different
occupational category than their father when using the IPUMS sample, and between 44 and 48%
when using our data.

   The distance with respect to a matrix representing full independence is relatively similar
regardless of the linked samples that we use, both for the US and Norway. For the US, the departure
from independence displayed in the Altham statistic is 17.37 when using the IPUMS sample and
ranges between 12.17 and 15.18 when using our own samples. For Norway, the departure from
independence is 25.01 when using the IPUMS sample and between 24.19 and 26.09 when using
our linked samples. In all cases, no matter which linking method we use, we reach the same
conclusion: mobility was higher in the US than in Norway in the 19th century.

5. Conclusions




                                                36
We evaluate the performance of widely used automated algorithms for historical record linkage,
as well as hand linked samples that were created using the same set of standard linkage variables
(that is, names, year of birth and state or country of birth). One benchmark for accuracy is the links
made by genealogists and users of the website FamilySearch of the 1910 and 1920 US censuses
(population to population). Another is the links of the Union Army Records to the 1900 US Census
done by trained research assistants who had access to extra information not typically available for
linking (sample to population).

In the population-to-population case, we find that automated methods agree with the links made
by genealogists and users of FamilySearch.org over 95% of the time. In the sample-to-population
case, we find that many automated methods lie along a frontier that traces out the tradeoff between
type I and type II errors. Researchers can choose to use algorithms that generate very low
discrepancy rates from these benchmark links (as low as 5-10% in the context of the Union Army
records) at a cost of relatively low (true) match rates (10-30%). Alternatively, they can choose
algorithms with higher (true) match rates (50-60%) at a cost of higher discrepancy rates (15-30%).
Hand linking is not a perfect solution either: hand links that rely on the standard matching variables
are also on this frontier, producing relatively high false positive rates (around 25%) and relatively
high (true) match rates (around 63%). Compared to more conservative automated methods,
humans tend to link more observations but at a cost of higher rates of false positives. The frontier
provided here can help guide researchers in creating alternative samples using the various
automated methods and testing the robustness of their results across samples.

Next, we compare automated methods to another hand linked sample, namely the 1915 Iowa
Census linked to the 1940 Census. When humans and machine use the same set of linking
variables, human linkers and automated algorithms agree in the vast majority of cases. When hand
and automated links do not agree, it is not clear from inspection which links are correct.

We then use data from two different transcriptions of the 1940 Federal Census, one transcribed by
FamilySearch and one by Ancestry.com. In this case, we can establish a real “ground truth”
because records listed on the same census manuscript page and line number are known to refer to
the same individual. We find that differences in transcription are generally high, especially for the
foreign born from non-English speaking countries. Even in this case of linking a census to itself,
we can only link 43-67% of the observations, suggesting an upper bound for match rates of any


                                                 37
method due to transcription quality and common names for whom we cannot find a unique match
in the two datasets. Nevertheless, when linking these two versions of the 1940 Census, we find
that automated methods produce links that are almost 100% correct.

Finally, we study how automated linking methods affect inference. Across a number of regression
analyses, we find that coefficient estimates and parameters of interest are very similar when using
linked samples based on each of the different automated methods. Point estimates generated from
alternative linking algorithms are well within the confidence intervals of the benchmark estimate
and exhibit a degree of measurement error no larger than other commonly-used variables (see, for
example, the “years of schooling” variable studied in Ashenfelter and Krueger 1994).

We intentionally do not pick a favorite method – the choice of the method ultimately depends on
the research question and historical setting. Instead, we have provided implementation codes to
the methods discussed in this paper, so researchers are encouraged to test the robustness of their
results to the linking method. It is natural to start with the more and less conservative versions of
the ABE method, given they are the easiest and fastest to implement and given they span much of
the tradeoff between type I and type II errors. When the potential sample size is very large, we
encourage researchers to also use the EM method and pick conservative parameters that ensure
very low rates of false positives. When sample size is low, we encourage researchers to also use
the ML method that tends to generate larger samples.

Overall, we conclude that automated methods perform well; it is possible to use automated
methods to create linked samples with few erroneous links. The ability to create large historical
panel datasets by linking between census waves or other sources of data (such as the Union Army
records or state censuses or other novel sources) has the potential to represent a major advance in
our understanding of economic history, and of important questions of economic, social, and
geographic mobility more broadly. Although linking across historical sources is challenging and
inevitably imperfect, the rates of false links are low and can be minimized further by judicious
choice of algorithm. Ultimately, we find that the effect of algorithm choice on conclusions from
inference   is   small.   Finally,   we   want   to   highlight   our   Census    Linking    Project
(https://censuslinkingproject.org/), an ongoing effort to link and make publicly available every pair
of historical complete-count Censuses from 1850 to 1940 (36 pairs in all) using the different



                                                 38
linking methods suggested in our paper.50 Our goal is to reduce barriers and open up new research
possibilities by providing customizable linked historical datasets to the broad research community.
We will continue to post links created using a variety of matching algorithms, along with linking
code and technical documentation for public dissemination.




50
  Beyond federal Census to federal Census linking, we want to emphasize the power and potential of using
automated linking methods to connect other sources, either to one another or to the census. There are always
new (old) sources of microdata for clever researchers to find and questions that can be answered once the
data are linked. Automated methods for record linking makes that possible for scholars at all levels.

di↵erent variations of each linking algorithms (ABE-NYSIIS, ABE-exact, ABE-JW, EM and ML). “Hand” compares the hand-linking
carried out by two di↵erent people that only used the same information that the automated algorithms use (name, place of birth, and
year of birth). A match is defined as “true” if it coincides with the links made in the Union Army-Oldest Old sample.

Notes: Panels (a-c) show PPV and TPR for the data linked from the Union Army Records to the 1900 Census using di↵erent variations
of the ABE algorithm. Panel (a) uses NYSIIS-standardized names, Panel (b) uses exact names, and Panel (c) uses JW distance. In
each panel we report versions using middle initials or not, di↵erent uniqueness requirements, and allowing matches to di↵er in reported
age by  2 years or  1 year. Panel (d) shows versions of the EM algorithm that use di↵erent combinations of the hyperparameters p
(the minimum score for the first-best match) and l (the maximum score for the second-best match). Panel (e) shows di↵erent variations
of the ML algorithm. These variants change the person who carried out the training hand-linking (JF or HL), whether the algorithm
is allowed to use middle initials or not, and the function of PPV and TPR that the algorithm aims to maximize. “Even” refers to the
function PPV+TPR. “PPV” refers to the function 3PPV+TPR. “TPR” refers to the function PPV+3TPR.

Notes: Panel (a) plots the coefficient and 95% confidence interval from a regression of the ln(sons’ earnings) on ln(fathers’ earnings).
Sons’ earnings are reported in the 1940 Census, fathers’ earnings are from the 1915 Iowa Census. Panel (b) plots the coefficient and 95%
confidence interval from a regression of sons’ years of schooling, reported in the 1940 Census, on their fathers’ years of schooling reported
in the 1915 Iowa census. We also show results weighted to account for di↵erences between the linked sample and the population with
respect to the following variables in the Iowa 1915 records: year of birth, literacy, years of school, and foreign-born status of parents.
The samples are the same as in Figure 5; we only attempt to match those individuals that were successfully linked by the hand linkers.
The ABE samples are linked without the 5-year uniqueness band requirement and allow matched pairs to di↵er by up to 2 years in
reported age. The ML results use the “even” method, which aims7 to maximize PPV+TPR. The intersection sample is described in

 Notes: Panel (a): The first column corresponds to the population mean and standard deviation of all observations in the hand-linked
Union Army records. The table presents the balance test across the 8 di↵erent variations on the ABE algorithm corresponding columns
2 - 9 (e.g.: the second column is the balance test for the matched population under the ABE algorithm with 5 years band, including
middle initials and using the NYSIIS standardized names). Estimates correspond to the di↵erence in averages between the matched and
unmatched observations for a given algorithm and are reported as the first line of each variable. The standard deviations are reported in
the corresponding second line in parenthesis. Panel (b) repeats the same exercise for the Iowa 1915 to 1940 census linking exercise.

 Notes: This table summarizes the transcription di↵erences in names and ages between two versions of the 1940 US census,
one transcribed by FamilySearch and one transcribed by Ancestry. We focus on comparing first, last and middle names
under the di↵erent stages of our cleaning algorithm. For example, for those born in Iowa 11.6% of the transcriptions
had some di↵erence in first name transcription after cleaning odd characters, removing suffix and uppercasing. But after
removing middle names this figure was reduced to 9.5%. Note that a small number of the transcription di↵erences are due
to errors in indexing which makes it impossible to exactly crosswalk between the Ancestry and Family, so these reported
di↵erences are an upper bound on transcription errors.

 Notes: This table reports the results from the matching exercise between the transcription done by Ancestry and the transcription done by
FamilySearch. Instead of matching the entire 1940 census to itself we match people born in four di↵erent places of birth: England, Italy,
Iowa, Ohio and North Carolina. We report the overall matching rate, PPV, and TPR for each of the methods. A correct link is defined as
a link that shares the same Census page and line. Sum of matches in a given method is equal to the sum of =0 + =1 + =2 age di↵erence
in that method. For instance, first 4 rows: we were able to match 7,507,944 records, so Matched= 7,507,944, and out of these 7,507,944,
age di↵erence = 0 for 7,458,587 observations, age di↵erence = 1 for 27,524 observations and age di↵erence = 2 for 21,815 observations. Age
di↵erence=2, PPV=0.68 means that among all the matches that are two years apart in terms of year of birth (i.e. we match John Smith 1838
to John Smith 1840), 68% of them are right.

Notes: This table reports summary measures using our linked samples and the linked samples created by IPUMS. Panel (a) reports
the fraction of sons who worked in a di↵erent occupational category than their father (that is, the fraction of sons outside of the
main diagonal in the occupational transition matrix), along with the expected fraction under independence and the di↵erence between
these measures. Panel (b) reports the mobility measures based on the Altham statistic. Higher distance with respect to independence
indicates lower mobility. Significance levels are indicated by *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Appendix 1: ABE Matching Procedure Example

This appendix outlines an update to the standard ABE matching code after the publication of
Abramitzky, Boustan, and Eriksson (2012, 2014, 2019). The original code matched from one
direction to another. It also had a small logical mistake where it could potentially match the wrong
two people. Correcting this logical mistake requires a small change to the code; in addition, so that
the example outlined below could not happen, we now require matching in both directions, after
which the code takes the intersection.

Example:

Dataset A:

 ID               Name              Birthyear

 1A               John Smith        1900

 2A               John Smith        1899


Dataset B:

 ID               Name              Birthyear

 1B               John Smith        1900

 2B               John Smith        1900

 3B               John Smith        1901


If we match from Dataset A to Dataset B using the original iterative ABE method, we will match
1A to 1B and 2B, and drop these individuals from the dataset because 1A has multiple matches.
Then we will match 2A to 3B after iterating to plus or minus two years of age. The new abematch
command does not make this second match because it flags 1B and 2B as possible matches for
2A. Because this pattern could happen in either direction, we now require that the code matches
both directions and takes the resulting intersection of the two matched samples. This change affects
approximately 1% of matches in most samples.

of the four linking algorithms (ABE, ABE-JW, EM and ML). In this version we attempt to find links for all available records in the
full UA data set. “Hand” compares the hand-linking carried out by two di↵erent people that only used the same information that the
automated algorithms use (name, place of birth, and year of birth). A match is defined as “true” if it coincides with the links in the
Oldest Old sample. In this case, we also consider a match to be “false” if the automated algorithm identified a match but the hand
linker did not.

when matching the Union Army records to the 1900 census. In this version we attempt to find links for all available records in the
full UA data set. For presentational purposes, a match is defined as “true” if it coincides with the hand-link that a person did using
only the same information that the automated algorithms use (name, place of birth, and year of birth). In this case, we also consider
a match to be “false” if the automated algorithm identified a match but the hand linker did not.

Notes: The figure shows the PPV and TPR for the data linked from the Union Army Records to the 1900 US Census using di↵erent
versions of the ABE-JW algorithm. The parameter x determines how far in age the second closest match can be to the first closest match.
For each value of x we also present versions requiring all observations to be unique by JW string distance within their own data set either
by exact age or within ± 2 years.

Notes: This Venn-diagram shows the overlap in matched pairs found using five alternative matching algorithms to link the
Union Army records to the 1900 census. The purple intersection area contains all the 339 matched pairs that were found by
all 5 methods. All ABE methods require uniqueness within ± 2 years of age (5-year uniqueness band). None of methods
use middle names or middle initials in matching. The ML method uses equal weighting on PPV and TPR.

  Notes: This table shows all the matches that were found using the EM algorithm with parameters p = 0.70, l = 0.65 and that disagree
  with the matches identified by hand linkers, for the Iowa-1940 matching exercise. EM 70-65 had TPR = 0.25 (correct / observations) and
  PPV = 0.98 (correct / matches). The very high PPV means that, out of those observations that EM 75-60 matched, very few of them
  disagree with the hand matches. This is the complete list of those disagreements, a total of 16 cases.

 Notes: This table reports the results from the matching exercise between the Union Army and the 1900 census.
 We report the overall matching rate, PPV, and TPR for each of the ABE variants. A correct link is defined as a
 link that agreed with the links that were done by a team of genealogists as part of the Union Army Oldest-Old
 project. Sum of matches in a given method is equal to the sum of =0 + =1 + =2 age di↵erence in that method.
 For instance, first 4 rows: we were able to match 588 records, so Matched=588 , and out of these 588, age di↵erence
 = 0 for 233 observations, age di↵erence = 1 for 302 observations and age di↵erence = 2 for 53 observations. Age
 di↵erence=2, PPV=0.68 means that among all the matches that are two years apart in terms of year of birth (i.e.
 we match John Smith 1838 to John Smith 1840), 68% of them are correct.

  Notes: This table shows the number of matches found between the Union Army records and the 1900 census
  using five alternative matching algorithms and their intersections. Each intersection sample keeps only pairs
  that were found using all methods listed, for instance the intersection between ABE-NYSIIS and ABE-exact
  is the sample of all pairs found both when using the ABE algorithm with NYSIIS names and with exact
  names. A match is considered “correct” if it coincides with the match that human hand-linkers found. PPV
  = # “correct” / # matches. TPR = #“correct”/#observations. These PPV and TPR values are plotted in
  Figure 3. All ABE methods require uniqueness within ± 2 years of age (5-year uniqueness band). None of the
  methods use middle names or middle initials in matching. The ML method uses equal weighting on PPV and
  TPR.

 Notes: Panel (a): The first column is the population mean and standard deviations of the linked observations in the Union Army records.
The table presents the balance test across the 8 di↵erent variations on the ABE algorithm. Matched observations are weighted to account
for the distribution of the following variables in the Union Army records: year of birth, enlistment age, height, literacy, and occupational
category. Panel (b) repeats the same exercise for the Iowa 1915 to 1940 census linking exercise. Matched observations are weighted to
account for the distribution of the following variables in the Iowa 1915 records: year of birth, literacy, years of school, and foreign-born
status of parents.
