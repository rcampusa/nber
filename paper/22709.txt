                                         ABSTRACT

One of the key terms in contracts between hospitals and insurers is how the parties apportion the
financial risk of treating unexpectedly costly patients. “Prospective” payment contracts give
hospitals a lump-sum amount, depending on the medical condition of the patient, with limited
adjustment for the level of services provided. We use data from the Medicare Prospective
Payment System and commercial insurance plans covering the nonelderly through the Health
Care Cost Institute to measure the extent of prospective payment in 303 metropolitan statistical
areas during 2008-12. We report three key findings. First, commercial insurance payments are
less prospective than Medicare payments. Second, the extent of prospective payment in
commercial insurance varies more than in Medicare, both across hospitals and geographic areas.
Third, differences in prospective payment across hospitals are positively associated with the
extent of hospital competition, the share of the hospital’s commercially insured patients covered
by managed-care insurance, and the share of the hospital’s patients covered by Medicare’s
Prospective Payment System.

Introduction

       One of the key terms in contracts between hospitals and insurers is how the

parties apportion the financial risk of treating unexpectedly costly patients. At one

extreme are contracts that pay on a unit-price basis, depending on the treatments that the

hospital and its affiliated physicians determine are medically necessary at the point of

service. These payment systems are sometimes described as “fee-for-service” or “low-

powered.” At the other extreme are contracts that pay on a lump-sum basis, independent

of the level of services provided, depending only on the medical condition of the patient.

These payment systems are sometimes described as “prospective” or “high-powered.”

       In practice, payment systems are neither purely fee-for-service nor purely

prospective, but some mix of the two. The optimal mix of fee-for-service and

prospective payment in any particular case involves a tradeoff. On one hand, more

prospective payment gives hospitals incentives to contain costs; on the other hand, it

creates incentives to skimp on the care of and avoid patients who are difficult to treat

(Newhouse 1996; Ellis 1998).

       Prospective payment has been extensively studied in the context of the Medicare

program, which has paid hospitals according to its own Prospective Payment System

(PPS) since 1984. However, much less attention has been given to the use of prospective

payment by commercial insurance plans. This is not surprising. The terms of

commercial insurance contracts are the result of confidential bargaining, and until

recently, even the most basic information about these contracts was unknown to most

researchers.

       This paper seeks to fill this gap. We use data from the Health Care Cost Institute

(HCCI) on more than 5 million claims from 1,288 hospitals to construct a measure of the



                                                                                             2
extent of prospective payment for inpatient hospital services supplied to nonelderly

commercially-insured patients in 303 metropolitan statistical areas for 2008-12. For each

hospital in each year, we estimate a regression of the log of the hospital’s allowed

amounts (including patient copayments) on a set of Diagnosis-related Group (DRG) fixed

effects; the R2 from these regressions are the hospitals’ commercial insurance

“prospectivity.” We also construct an analogous measure of the extent to which PPS

pays hospitals prospectively; because PPS is the largest single hospital payment system in

the U.S., it is a natural benchmark against which commercial prospectivity can be

compared.

       Then, we examine the empirical relationship between our measure of

prospectivity and factors that economic theory suggests might affect the terms of

incentive contracts. One class of models predicts that competition among hospitals can

affect the use of prospective payment, because it may be in the interest of a party with

bargaining power to demand changes to contract terms in addition to high prices (Choi

and Triantis 2012). Economic theory also predicts that preferred-provider (PPO)

insurance products with broad networks, which give insurers less bargaining power with

hospitals, can have the same effect. Finally, research on “spillovers” shows how payment

systems can influence the care of patients other than those to which they apply (e.g.,

Chernew, Baicker, and Martin 2010). For this reason, the share of patients at a hospital

paid by PPS could affect the extent of prospective payment by commercial insurance.

       We test the validity of these theories by matching to our prospectivity indices

information on hospital competition, patient insurance mix, and patient demographic and

hospital characteristics. We estimate the effect of these factors on our commercial and




                                                                                           3
Medicare prospectivity indices, holding constant hospital- and time-fixed effects. We

evaluate the economic importance, as well as the statistical significance, of these factors.

   Our paper proceeds in four parts. Part I discusses the fundamental rationale behind

prospective payment and the literature on the extent of variation in and the determinants

of contract structure in markets for health care. Part II explains how we use data from

HCCI on commercial insurance claims from Aetna, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare to

characterize the extent of prospective payment, and how we supplement the HCCI data

with other information on hospitals and the concentration of their markets. Part III

presents models of the determinants of hospital payment systems and our results, and Part

IV concludes.



   I.      Previous research on prospective payment systems and determinants of
           contract structure

        A large body of theoretical work, summarized by Newhouse (1996), explains the

fundamental tradeoff associated with prospective payment for hospital services. Models

of hospital payment systems generally assume that the unit prices of treatments are

greater than marginal cost, hospital and physician efforts toward cost control are

unobservable, and contracts that specify what treatments are appropriate are incomplete.

Under these assumptions, purely fee-for-service payment encourages treatments that

provide minimal clinical benefit and too little cost control. However, purely prospective

payment encourages hospitals to avoid and skimp on the care of those who are costly to

treat. The conclusion from these models is that the optimal payment system will be

mixed, making hospitals responsible for some, but not all, of the risk of treating

unexpectedly costly patients.




                                                                                            4
       The empirical effects of prospective payment have been extensively studied in the

context of the Medicare program, which has paid hospitals according to the Medicare

PPS since 1984. As McClellan (1997) points out, although PPS is prospective in name,

in practice PPS reflects the mixed approach suggested by economic theory.      A hospital’s

PPS payments are primarily based on its patients’ DRGs, but many DRGs are related not

to diagnoses but to the performance of specific intensive procedures. In addition, PPS

provides for additional “outlier” payments that compensate hospitals directly, at least in

part, when a patient has unexpected need for costly additional services. Both of these

factors lead PPS to have some fee-for-service aspects.

       Economists and health policy researchers have generally concluded that PPS has

been a success, relative to the almost purely fee-for-service payment system it replaced.

According to a review of the literature by Pauly (2000, p. 557), PPS is widely

acknowledged to have reduced hospitals’ lengths of stay, profit margins, and cost growth

without significant adverse consequences for patient health outcomes. In Europe, public

insurers have been gradually replacing both global budgets and fee-for-service payment

for hospital services with DRG-based systems like PPS (Charlesworth, Davies, and

Dixon 2012).

       Fewer papers have studied commercial health insurance payment systems.

Clemens, Gottlieb, and Molnar (2015) find that the schedule of payments for physician

services used by Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Texas is benchmarked to Medicare’s

Resource Based Relative Value Scale for 65 percent of spending. In an analysis of the

hospital payment systems used by four large national insurers in selected metropolitan

areas, Ginsburg (2010) finds that commercial insurance payments to hospitals are less

prospective than PPS. According to him, commercial insurers pay hospitals by DRGs



                                                                                             5
(either with or without outlier payments) in approximately one-third of cases, ranging

from 6 percent in Los Angeles to 44 percent in Milwaukee; the remainder of payments

are made on a per diem or pure fee-for-service basis.

       As Ginsburg (2010) observes, this presents a puzzle. In interviews, insurers

expressed a preference for DRG-based payment, and because Medicare and almost all

Medicaid programs pay in this way, its adoption for commercially-insured patients would

reduce hospitals’ transaction costs. Previous research on PPS is consistent with this

anecdotal evidence: there appears to be unclaimed gains from commercial insurance

payment system reform that could be divided among the parties.

       One possible explanation is that hospitals with market power can earn higher

profits by demanding not only higher prices but also fee-for-service contracts. Although

this proposition is inconsistent with standard models in which sellers extract rents purely

through higher prices (also known as the “one monopoly profit” hypothesis), these

models may not capture the complexities of markets for health services. For example, if

people who value health services more would prefer their insurer used lower-powered

contracts with providers, then a provider with market power could increase profits by

offering a menu of contracts to price discriminate among insurers. And even if people’s

valuations of health services are homogeneous, it may be in a monopoly seller’s interest

to offer contract terms that would differ from the competitive ones if doing so affected

the price elasticity of demand. Both of these examples can be viewed as special cases of

a market for a good with two attributes where the demand for the attributes is interrelated

(Spence 1975). If this explanation is correct, then failures of competition in hospital

markets might lead not only to high prices – as previous research (e.g., Cooper et al.




                                                                                              6
2015) has shown – but also to fee-for-service payment that may discourage efficient

production and contribute to health care cost growth.

          Economic theory also suggests that PPO insurance with broad networks will be

more likely to use lower-powered payment approaches. An insurer designing a broad-

network product has less bargaining leverage with hospitals, thereby enabling them to

exercise what market power they have more fully. In addition, by reducing any single

hospital’s patient volume, broad-network products increase both the risk and the

transaction costs to the hospital of payment reform. For these reasons, understanding the

extent to which commercial insurance hospital payment systems are prospective, and the

determinants of commercial payment systems’ prospectivity, are important health policy

issues.

          Two empirical papers present evidence consistent with this explanation. Gift,

Arnould, and DeBrock (2002) analyze 1995 data on contract form from a large insurer in

Washington state, matched with data on hospital characteristics from the Washington

Department of Health, for 83 acute-care facilities. They found 34 of the 83 hospitals

used some form of prospective payment, and that the number of hospitals within 10 miles

was positively associated with the probability of prospective payment. Town, Feldman,

and Kralewski (2011) analyze data from 83 medical groups that contracted with

Minnesota Blue Cross’s “Blue Plus” plan in 2001, matched with data on medical group

characteristics from the Community Tracking Survey. They found that share of revenue

from capitation was positive associated with the number of physicians in the practice

relative to the total number of physicians within 15 km, and with physicians’ self-

reported assessment of their practice’s market power.




                                                                                          7
       Although these papers are suggestive, both have significant limitations. Both are

based on selected small samples of facilities or practices from a single geographic area,

and data from an earlier time period in which markets for health services were different

from today. The research design of both is cross-sectional, leaving open the possibility

that the observed association between payment system and competition may be due to

other, unmeasured characteristics of hospitals or areas. Finally, neither study provides a

general way to quantify the extent of prospective payment in commercial insurance and

compare it to a practical benchmark like PPS.

       Our paper seeks to address these limitations. We use nationwide data on

payments to hospitals from HCCI to characterize the payment systems used by Aetna,

Humana, and UnitedHealthcare. The HCCI data includes information on the inpatient

hospital claims for approximately 40 million individuals from all 50 states from 2008-

2012, accounting for 27% of the nonelderly population covered by commercial insurance,

making it one of the largest data bases on the privately insured ever assembled. We also

use data from the Medicare program in order to compare the extent of prospective

payment in HCCI to the extent of prospective payment in PPS, and investigate whether

prospective payment is correlated with hospital market competition and patient insurance.

We hold constant hospital fixed effects, in order to control for all time-invariant

characteristics of hospitals and geographic areas, as well as patient insurance type and a

set of time-varying hospital characteristics.




                                                                                             8
   II.      Data

         We use data from three sources: HCCI, the American Hospital Association

(AHA) Survey, and the Medicare program. Each HCCI hospital claim includes the

Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) and the “allowed amount,” representing the actual

amount paid to the facility by the plan plus any deductibles or copayments. The HCCI

data also contain information on each patient’s age, gender, and type of insurance (health

maintenance organization (HMO), preferred provider organization (PPO), or point-of-

service (POS)).

         We follow McClellan (1997) and characterize the extent of each hospital’s

prospective payment by the share of its payments’ variance that is explained by its

patients’ DRGs. This approach has several strengths. First, contracts between hospitals

and insurers share costs of treating difficult patients in many ways. Although some cost

sharing occurs through outlier payments, cost sharing also occurs other terms such as all-

inclusive per diem rates. This approach aggregates these different forms of cost sharing

into a single index proportional to revenues governed by each. Second, our commercial

insurance claims contain information on the DRG of each patient’s admission, even for

claims not paid on a DRG basis. Because DRGs are the basis for PPS (as well as most

states’ Medicaid hospital payment systems), they have become a standard claims

characteristic. Third, for the same reason, DRG-based payment is a practical option

against which commercial insurance contracts can be evaluated.

         For each hospital in each year 2008-2012, we calculate two prospective payment

indices: one for commercial insurance and one for PPS. For each hospital in each year

2008-2012, we estimate two regressions of payments (including deductibles and

copayments made by beneficiaries) on a set of DRG fixed effects. The R2 from the



                                                                                           9
regression of the log of commercial payments is the hospital’s commercial prospectivity;

the R2 from the regression of the log of PPS payments is the hospital’s PPS prospectivity.

        To each index, we match data on the distribution of the hospital’s patients’ age,

gender, and insurance type; on hospital characteristics from AHA; and on hospital

markets derived from Medicare claims. AHA hospital characteristics include teaching

status, ownership (private nonprofit, private for-profit, or public), number of beds (<100,

100-300, >300), system status, and vertical integration with physicians. Following

previous work (Baker, Bundorf, and Kessler 2014), we divide vertically integrated

hospitals into four groups: fully integrated organizations, closed physician/hospital

organizations, open physician/hospital organizations, and independent practice

associations. We use Medicare inpatient hospital claims from 2008-2012 to construct a

measure of hospital market competitiveness, equal to the patient-flow-weighted average

of the Hirschman-Herfindahl indices of admissions in each patient residential zip code

served by the hospital, according to the method in Kessler and McClellan (2000). We

limit our analysis to general medical/surgical, non-federal hospitals in metropolitan

statistical areas outside of Maryland1 with at least 100 HCCI admissions in all of the

years 2008-2012.

        Tables 1 and 2 report the mean, standard deviation, and percentiles (for selected

variables) of the variables used in analysis. All of these variables are measured at the

hospital level; all descriptive statistics are weighted by the number of admissions. Table

1 shows that the extent of prospectivity in commercial insurance payments to hospitals is

lower and more variable than the extent in PPS. In 2008, for example, the average R2


1
  Hospitals in Maryland are exempt from Medicare PPS. Medicare and commercial insurance hospital
reimbursement schedules in Maryland are determined by an all-payer system governed by the Maryland
Health Services Cost Review Commission.


                                                                                                     10
from a regression of commercial claims’ allowed amounts on a set of DRG indicator

variables is 0.747; by comparison, the average R2 from a regression of total payments

under Medicare PPS on DRG indicators is 0.952. Even those hospitals with the most

prospective commercial payments were not paid by commercial insurers as prospectively

as they were paid by PPS: the 90th percentile of commercial prospectivity across

hospitals is 0.841, whereas the 10th percentile of PPS prospectivity is 0.939. This is not

surprising: Medicare uses a single nationwide reimbursement system that is based on

DRGs, whereas commercial insurers use multiple reimbursement systems which may or

may not be DRG-based. By 2012, the level of commercial prospectivity had increased by

almost one-half of a standard deviation, to 0.776; this occurred primarily because of

increases in prospectivity at the bottom of the distribution.

       Table 1 also reports the 2008 and 2012 distributions of the hospital Hirschman-

Herfindahl index; the share of commercial admissions attributable to HMO, POS, and

PPO enrollees; the share of Medicare admissions (the number of Medicare admissions

divided by the total as reported to AHA); and the number of commercial and Medicare

PPS admissions per DRG. The most striking trend in these variables is the shift among

the commercially insured from HMO and PPO to POS insurance. The prevalence of POS

insurance increased by 11.5 percentage points, whereas the prevalence of HMO and PPO

insurance each decreased by around 6 percentage points. Table 2 reports 2012 means and

standard deviations of the other independent variables, including the characteristics of

commercial and Medicare PPS patients and of hospitals.

       Table 3 shows that the extent of prospectivity in hospital reimbursement varies

not only across hospitals but also across geographic areas. The table reports selected

characteristics of the five largest CBSAs, in terms of commercial admissions, in each



                                                                                           11
quartile of the prospectivity distribution. The table shows that the weighted-average

share of hospital payment variance explained by DRG dummies ranges from 70-73% in

low-prospectivity areas (such as Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, FL) to 80-

84% in high-prospectivity areas (such as Minneaspolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, MN). The

table also shows that Medicare PPS prospectivity is roughly constant across areas,

ranging from 94-96% nationwide. Finally, the table shows that the extent of

prospectivity is not obviously related to the average commercial price of a hospital

admission. According to the fourth column, some CBSAs in both the lowest and the

highest prospectivity quartiles have high commercial prices, and some have low

commercial prices. However, this simple, cross-sectional bivariate analysis does not

account for variation across areas or over time in insurance types or the characteristics of

patients, hospitals, or hospital markets, and so does not indicate whether there is an

association between hospital competitiveness and the extent of prospective payment.



     III.      Models and Results

            For this reason, we model the commercial payment prospectivity of hospital i in

year t, Yit, as linear functions of the following variables, weighting each observation in

the regression by the number of commercial admissions:

Yit = αi + θt + HHIitβ + Xitγ + Vitδ1 + Witδ2 + Zitδ3 + εit,

with

αi          hospital fixed effects;

θt          time fixed effects;

HHIit Hirschman-Herfindahl index;




                                                                                             12
Xit     insurance mix -- the proportion of commercial patients with HMO, POS, or PPO

        insurance (reference category is proportion PPO) and the proportion of all patients

        who are Medicare PPS2;

Vit     age and gender mix -- the proportion of patients aged 0-17, 18-24, 25-34, 35-44,

        45-54, and 55-64 years (reference category is proportion aged 55-64) and female;

Wit     hospital characteristics (described above);

Zit     number of admissions per DRG3; and

εit     an error term which we allow to be arbitrarily correlated within each hospital over

        time.

        We also estimate the parameters in the equation above substituting hospitals’ PPS

prospectivity for their commercial prospectivity as a placebo test. If the estimates of the

effects of HHIit and Xit from the commercial models are causal, then those variables

should have no impact on PPS prospectivity: PPS is a single, national program that is

defined by statute, so market factors should not affect it. In the models that use PPS

prospectivity as the dependent variable, we omit the proportion of commercial patients

with HMO, POS, or PPO insurance; substitute the proportion of patients aged 65-69, 70-

74, 80-89, and 90-99 years in Medicare (reference category is proportion aged 75-79) for

the commercial patient age mix; and weight each observation by the number of PPS

admissions.

        Table 4 presents estimates of the hospital HHI, insurance type, and time on the

extent of commercial and PPS prospectivity. According to the leftmost two columns,


2
  We include the proportion of patients who are Medicare PPS to test for the presence of spillovers from
Medicare to commercial insurance.
3
  We include the number of admissions per DRG to account for the possibility of a mechanical relationship
between our measure of prospectivity and the concentration of admissions across DRGs within a hospital,
which could bias our results if the concentration of admissions across DRGs within a hospital were
correlated with the concentration of admissions across hospitals.


                                                                                                      13
hospital market competition is significantly associated with increases in commercial

prospectivity, holding constant hospital- and time-fixed effects, insurance type, and the

characteristics of patients and hospitals. In particular, moving a hospital from the 75th to

the 25th percentile of the 2012 HHI would lead to an increase in commercial prospectivity

of 1.2 percentage points.4 Insurance type also has a statistically significant effect on

commercial prospectivity. For plausible shifts in the mix of a hospital’s commercial

payors, the effect of insurance type is small: moving half of the average hospital’s 2012

PPO patients to HMO or POS insurance (i.e., 6 percentage points) would lead to an

increase in commercial prospectivity of 0.4 percentage points.5 The effect of the

proportion of patients paid under PPS is somewhat larger. For example, increasing the

proportion of PPS patients from the 25th to the 75th percentile (i.e., by 10 percentage

points) would lead to an increase in commercial prospectivity of 1 percentage point.6

Taken together, these three factors explain an economically important (although not a

majority) of the differences in prospectivity across hospitals. In 2012, for example,

plausible shifts in hospital market competitiveness and insurance type could account for

approximately 2.6 percentage points of the 8.9-percentage-point difference between the

25th and 75th percentile of the prospectivity distribution, or approximately 30 percent.

         By contrast, according to the rightmost two columns of Table 4, hospital HHI and

the proportion of patients paid under PPS do not have a statistically significant or

economically important effect on PPS prospectivity. This is consistent with a causal

interpretation of the estimated effects of HHI and insurance type on commercial

prospectivity; the observed correlation between these variables in the commercial context

or hospital payments across hospitals over time, at least insofar as these trends would be

reflected in Medicare PPS payments.



   IV.      Conclusion

         Health economists have analyzed extensively the implications of “prospective” or

“high-powered” payment for hospital services. A vast literature has modeled

theoretically the tradeoffs associated with prospective payment, and many studies have

investigated the empirical consequences of Medicare’s adoption of its own particular

Prospective Payment System (PPS). Wide agreement in the health policy community

that PPS successfully lowered relatively unproductive health spending has led researchers

to propose extending the principles underlying it, in the form of “bundled payment”

systems (Miller et al. 2011).

         Despite this, much less attention has been given to the determinants, or even the

extent, of prospective or high-powered payment by commercial insurance plans. This

gap is important. There is some evidence that commercial plans make less use of high-

powered payment incentives than Medicare, and theoretical reasons to believe that this is

due at least in part to failures in markets for hospital services or health insurance. Yet,

little work has sought to test whether these hypotheses are correct, or even to assess the

extent of prospective payment in commercial insurance at all.

         In this paper, we use data from HCCI, the Medicare program, and the American

Hospital Association survey to investigate the association between the extent of

prospective payment in commercial insurance, patient insurance mix, and hospital market

competitiveness. We report three key findings. First, the extent of prospectivity in



                                                                                              15
commercial insurance payments to hospitals is lower and more variable than the extent in

PPS, although the extent of commercial insurance prospectivity has been slowly

increasing over time. Second, the extent of prospectivity in payment systems varies not

only across hospitals but also across geographic areas. Third, differences in hospital-

level payment prospectivity is positively associated with three factors: the extent of

hospital competition, the share of the hospital’s commercially insured patients covered by

managed-care insurance, and the share of the hospital’s patients covered by PPS. We

show that plausible differences in these three factors can explain around 30 percent of the

variation in hospital-level prospectivity that we observe.

       Our results have important implications for economic theory and public policy.

The fact that hospitals facing less competition are more likely to be paid on a fee-for-

service basis means that the “one monopoly profit” hypothesis does not accurately

characterize markets for hospital services. This result also indicates a channel other than

price through which hospital market power may affect social welfare: the terms of

contracts with insurers. Although (as we discuss below) we are not able to say

definitively whether the reduction in commercial payment prospectivity in uncompetitive

hospital markets is harmful to consumers, the fact that even in competitive markets

commercial payment prospectivity is significantly below that of PPS – which is widely

viewed as a success – is cause for concern.

       We also find that insurance mix significantly affects the extent of commercial

payment prospectivity. Hospitals serving patients with HMO or POS insurance have

higher-powered incentives than do those serving patients with PPO insurance. This

finding is consistent with both economic theory and anecdotal evidence. PPOs generally

have broader hospital networks than do HMO or POS products, which gives each



                                                                                           16
participating hospital less patient volume, thereby reducing insurers’ bargaining power

and increasing transaction and risk-bearing costs to hospitals. Recent analysis of a

demonstration project to implement higher-powered payment incentives in commercial

insurance contracts in California cited inadequate patient volume as the single largest

reason the project did not succeed (Ridgely et al. 2014). In addition, we find that

hospitals with a higher proportion of patients paid by PPS have higher-powered

commercial payment incentives. This is consistent with evidence that changes to

incentives for treatment of one patient population “spillover” to outcomes of other

populations (e.g., Chernew, Baicker, and Martin 2010), and that changes in Medicare

payment systems can facilitate private payment reform (Clemens and Gottlieb,

forthcoming).

       Our analysis has at least three limitations. First, we do not observe any actual

contracts between insurers and hospitals; our analysis is based on a measure of contracts’

payment incentives that we construct from claims data. Although there are strong

reasons to believe that our measure is correlated with the terms of the underlying

agreements, this is an assumption that we cannot test. Second, because our analysis is

observational in nature, the association we observe between prospectivity, hospital

market competition, and insurance mix may be due to an unobserved factor rather than a

causal connection. To address this concern, we control for hospital- and time-fixed

effects and the time-varying characteristics of hospitals and patient populations;

nonetheless, we cannot rule out the possibility of an unobserved time-varying

characteristic of hospitals or geographic areas that is correlated with both prospectivity

and market structure. Third, because we do not examine patient health outcomes or

health spending, we cannot make a definitive welfare assessment of the reduced



                                                                                             17
prospectivity we observe in uncompetitive hospital markets. Although previous

empirical work on PPS suggests that the use of low-powered payment in commercial

insurance is inefficient, future research should consider this hypothesis directly.
