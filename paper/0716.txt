           A COMMENT ON FELDSTEIN'S FISHER-SCHULTZ LECTURE


                                 Abstract


        Feldstein argues in his Fisher—Schultz Lecture that he has found,

by accounting for inflation and taxes, large and significant rate of

return effects on investment. His results are interesting because

they seem to be robust to alternative specifications of the investment

equation, Feldstein has clearly not exhausted all possible specifica-

tions   of the investment equation, and this comment reports on results,
using Feldstein's data,   for   one alternative specification. The results
do not support Feldstein's conclusion. The data do not appear to con-

tain enough information to decide the issue of the quantitative effect

of   the cost of capital on investment.

                                   by

                             Ray C. Fair

                              July 1981



     The debate regarding the quantitative effect of the cost of capital

on investment has been going on for a long time. Applied macro work is

fraught with problems, some of which are reviewed in the Lecture, and

the investment results have so far been mixed. It may be that the data

do not contain enough information yet to allow one to decide this issue.

Feldstein argues, however, that he has found, by accounting for infla-

tion and taxes, large and significant rate of return effects on invest-

ment. His results are interesting because they seem to be robust to

alternative specifications of the investment equation.

     Feldstein has clearly not exhausted all possible specifications of

the investment equation, and it is in the spirit of his Lecture to see

if the rate of return variables are significant in alternative specifi-

cations. This comment reports on results, using Feldstein's data, for

one alternative specification. The results do not support Feldstein's

conclusion.

                                                                                   2




          Consider the following simple model.2 Let I denote investment,

      output, and           the net capital stock. Assume that the short run

production function is one of fixed proportions and that firms may at

times be "off" of this production function in that they may at times

hold either or both "excess" capital and "excess" labor. Let KMIN

denote the minimum amount of capital needed to produce Y , and call

      —           excess capital. Finally, let               denote "desired" net in-
          KNINt
vestment. Assume that desired net investment is a function of the

amount of excess capital on hand at the beginning of the period and of

current and past output changes:


(1)                  I= 0(K1 —      KNIN
                                               +             + 2t—1

One can think of the current and past output changes as proxying for ex-

pected future changes. Assume next that there are costs of adjusting

net investment and more specifically that


                                                       < 1
(2)                  AI =   X(I—   IIi) , 0 <      X




Combining (1) and (2) yields:


(3)                  AI =   X0(K1   -
                                        KNIN
                                                       + XaiAY +   2t—l -
          As noted above, it is in the spirit of Feldstein's Lecture to add

various rate—of—return variables to equation (3) to see if they are signi-

ficant. If they are, then this would be support for his conclusion that


2The theory behind this model is discussed in Fair (1974, 1976).
The model seems to provide a fairly good explanation of the aggregate quar-
terly U. S. investment data. Feldstein's data are annual.
                                                                            3




rate—of—return variables are significant across quite different speci-

fications. For present purposes three variables have been tried: net

return (RN) ,    net   return cyclically adjusted (RNA) , and the differ-

ence between the potential and actual cost of funds (MPNR — COF)

The data on these three variables are presented in Feldstein's Tables

I and IV. Data on I/Y are presented in Table I, but data on

and Y are not presented separately. Data on 1n and Y were col-

lected from the Survey of Current Business (Tables 5.3 and 1.2, resp—

pectively). A supplement to the Survey (The National Income and Product

Accounts of the United States, 1929—74) was used for the data for 1972

and back; the July 1977 issue was used fOr the 1973 data; the July 1978

issue was used for the 1974 data; and the July 1979 issue was used for

the 1975—1978 data. The ratios of I to          Y matched Feldstein's

ratios in Table I up to the number of digits presented in Table I.

Feldstein also presents data on Ir/K in Table I, and K1 was taken

to be        divided by In/Kr .    Data on Y were collected back to 1951

(Table I begins with 1953) because some of the equations required data

back this far.

        In order to estimate equation (3), data on KNIN are needed. Three

different measures were tried in the empirical work. For the first,

KNINt was taken to be Yt/l.47l7l6 , where       1.471716 is the largest

value of YtIK' over the 1953—1978 period (the value in l953). This

measure is based on the assumption that there has been no decline in the

!Ipotentialll productivity of capital since 1953. For the second measure,


3The value of            fell from 1.47 in 1953 to 1.36 in 1958, rose to
1.43 in 1964, fell to 1.28 in 1971, rose to 1.33 in 1973, fell to 1.23
in 1975, and rose to 1.32 in 1978.
                                                                          4




KMIN was taken to be Y/l.4lT3OL(/ , where    1.413047   is the ratio of

Y      in 1963. For the third measure, KMIN      was taken to be
 t t                                         t


Y/(Y/K) , where Yt/K        is one standard error greater than the pre-

dicted value of         from a regression of Yt/K on a constant and

time for the 1953—1978 period. The third measure is based on the assump-

tion that there has been a steady decline in the potential productivity

of capital since 1953. The estimate of the coefficient of t in the re--

gression was — .0066

     The results are presented in Table 1. In rows 1—3 estimates are

presented for the three excess capital measures with no rate of return

variables. The first and second measures give very similar results.

The fit for the third measure is slightly worse than the fits for the

other two. Row 4 contains estimates for the case in which no excess

capital variable is included in the equation. Since the first and second

measures give such similar results, no further estimates using the second

measure are presented in the table.

     Row 5 is the same as row 1 except that RNi is added. The co-

efficient estimate for RNtl is of the wrong sign and is not signi-

ficant. (By "significantt' I will mean a coefficient estimate with a

t—statistic greater than 2.0 in absolute value.) RNt1 and the excess

capital measure are highly correlated, and the introduction of RNt_l

to the equation has lowered the t—statistic for the excess capital

variable from 2.53 to 1.43. Row 6 is the same as row 3 except the RNt1

is added. The coefficient estimate for RNtl is now of the right sign,

but with a t—statistic of only 0.50. Row 7 is the same as row 4 except

that RNtl is added. Without the excess capital variable in the equa—

tion, the coefficient estimate for RNtl is now significant (a t—statis—

tic of 2.03).

     Row 8 is the same as row 6 except that the equation has been esti-

mated by two stage least squares (the endogenous variable on the right

hand side is AY ).     With so few observations, it does not make too
much sense to use the 2SLS estimator, but it is perhaps somewhat encour-

aging that the coefficient estimate for AY is not much affected by

the use of the estimator.

     Rows 9—il are the same as rows 5—7 except that
                                                            RNAt1 replaces
t—l and the sample period is shortened by two years. The results for

RNAt1 are similar to those for RNi .              Rows 12—14 are the same as

rows 5—7 except that MPNRt1 —
                                COFtl replaces RNi and the sample
period is shortened two years. The results are again similar to those

for I— , except     that all three coefficient estimates for

MPNRt1 —   C0F1   are now of the right sign.

     The equations were also estimated under the assumption of first

order serial correlation.4 The estimates of the serial correlation co-

efficient were all small and had a very small effect on the other co-

efficient estimates except for the equations in rows 12—14, i.e., the

equations using MPNRt1 —                    As can be seen in rows 15—17, which

4Feldstein estimated his equations under this assumption. en he lists
the sample period for, say, equation (3.2) as being 1954—78, it has been
assumed that 1954 was used for the lagged values and thus that the true
estimation period is 1955—78. Otherwise, since a lagged value of
is needed (i.e., a value of RN2)        ,
                                                                         1
                                            when equation (3.2) is estimated
under the assumption of first order serial correlation, data on RN for
1952 would be needed. The data for RN begin in 1953.

tion, the coefficient estimate for MPNRi —
                                                     COFt1 is significant
in all three cases, with t—statistics of 2.10, 2.09, and 2.77.

     The basic fit of the equations in Table 1 is considerably better

than the basic fit of Feldstein's investment equations. This cannot

be seen directly from Table 1, but it can be seen as follows. The

sum of squared residuals for, say, Feldstein's equation (3.2) is

.0003438. The left—hand—side variable of this equation is I/Y .                 In
order to compare the basic fit of the equations in Table 1 to this number,

I computed (using the equation estimated in row 3) the predicted value

of Ai for each t and added this value to Il to get a predicted

value of I .        Call this value I .      I   then divided I by Y and

                               /y )2 ,   which is the appropriate sum of squared

residuals    to compare to Feldstein's. The value was .0001798, which is

52.3 percent less than .0003438. This is a considerable difference in

fit for macro time series data. Although this comparison used the equa-

tion in row 3 in Table 1, the fits of all the equations in Table 1 are

close, which means that all of them fit much better than do Feldstein's

equations.

    What should one conclude from the results in Table 1? If one were

forced to decide yes or no about the significance of rate—of—return

variables on investment, the conclusion would probably be no. 't—l and

RNAt1 are significant only when the excess capital variable is omitted

from the equation, and even then the t—statistics are only 2.03 and 2.07.

The results are stronger for MPNRt1 —                    although the maximum
                                             COFtl   ,



t—value obtained is only 2.77. Given the poor results for two of the
                                                                        8



three rate—of—return variables and the marginal significance of the third,

it would not necessarily be unreasonable to conclude that the data do

not support the hypothesis of significant rate of return effects on in-

vestment. A more reasonable conclusion to draw from the results, how-

ever, is that they are inconclusive. The data just do not appear to

contain enough information to decide the issue.

     I hasten to add that I do not think that the model used for the re-

sults in Table 1 is without faults. The model is quite simple, and no

great care has gone into measuring excess capital. I am also skeptical

about using annual data to test hypotheses regarding investment behavior,

and I am uncomfortable analyzing the investment decision other than with-

in the context of a complete model of firm behavior (i.e., a model that

considers at the same time the price, wage, employment, and output deci-

sions of a firm). But any caveats that one may have about the model are

really beside the point. The point is that Feldstein's strong conclusion

does not hold up for an alternative model of investment behavior, a model

that is not a pori particularly unreasonable and that fits the data

much better than do Feldstein's models.
