Alcohol and Student Performance: Estimating the Effect of Legal Access

                                              ABSTRACT

We consider the effect of legal access to alcohol on student achievement. We first estimate the effect
using an RD design but argue that this approach is not well suited to the research question in our setting.
Our preferred approach instead exploits the longitudinal nature of the data, identifying the effect by
measuring the extent to which a student’s performance changes after he gains legal access to alcohol,
controlling flexibly for the expected evolution of grades as students make progress towards their degrees.
We find that students’ grades fall below their expected levels upon being able to drink legally, but
by less than previously documented. We also show that there are effects on women and that the effects
are persistent.

1         Introduction
A large literature links alcohol consumption to adverse health and social outcomes.1 Given
long-standing and persistent efforts to restrict access to alcohol, it is no surprise that this
topic has received considerable attention from researchers. However, relatively little is known
about the effect of legal access to alcohol on the academic performance of students in college,
where binge drinking is often cited as a serious and growing problem (DeSimone 2007). That
alcohol is associated with acute outcomes such as crime, mortality, and sexual activity gives
cause for concern that the effect on student performance may be quite large.
        In this paper, we assess the effect of legal access to alcohol on academic performance using
two identification strategies. The first has been used to address this research question in a
different setting and the second has not, but both approaches exploit the exogenous change in
legality induced by the federally mandated minimum legal drinking age (MLDA). However,
to the extent to which legal access to alcohol influences many factors that are likely to
affect academic performance, we acknowledge that valid instrumental variables estimates of
the effect of alcohol consumption cannot be obtained in our setting. In particular, because
legal access is likely to affect how often students drink, how much they drink when they
drink, where they spend their time (e.g., increasing the amount of time in bars and clubs),
and who they spend time with, the exclusion restriction would likely fail if we were to use
legal alcohol access as an instrument for some measure of drinking.2 As such, we focus on
the reduced-form effect of legal access on college performance—inclusive of several potential
    1
     In particular, quasi-experimental methods have been used to consider effects on mortality (Dee 1999;
Carpenter 2004; Carpenter and Dobkin 2009), crime (Markowitz and Grossman 1998; Carpenter 2005a;
Carpenter 2007; Carpenter and Dobkin forthcoming), sexual activity (Chesson, Harrison, and Kassler 2000;
Rees and Argys 2001; Sen 2002; Rashad 2004; Carpenter 2005b; Waddell forthcoming), employment (Mullahy
and Sindelar 1996; Terza 2002; Dave and Kaestner 2002; MacDonald 2004), and teenagers’ educational
outcomes (Cook and Moore 1993; Dee and Evans 2003; Chatterji and DeSimone 2006), among others.
   2
     We confirmed this concern in pilot surveys undertaken in upper-division undergraduate classes at the
University of Oregon where 21-year-old students were asked to compare their behaviors in the four months
after they turned 21 to their behaviors in the four months before. Based on this sample of 78 students,
on a weekly basis, turning 21 increased the number of alcoholic beverages consumed 1.4, the number of
days consuming an alcoholic drink by 0.5, the number of days drinking to the point of intoxication by
0.2, and the number of days going to a bar or club by 1.1. 25 percent of students reported they started
to hang out with different people, and 21 percent reported that they changed the amount of time spent
with earlier friends. More generally, 10 percent reported they started to hang out with a different crowd,
suggesting that changing group dynamics may also be important around the 21st birthday. Among students
reporting changes in who they spent time with, approximately two-thirds attributed the change to changes
in drinking-related activities.


                                                    2
mechanisms—while remaining no less relevant to policy.
   That said, and despite the fact that some individuals drink illegally prior to turning 21,
Carpenter and Dobkin (2009) show that legal access has a significant impact on drinking
behavior. Most relevant to our setting, they show that college-aged young adults just over
age 21 report drinking 11-21 percent more than than those just under 21, depending on
the measure of consumption used. While obtaining valid first-stage estimates is problem-
atic in our setting for the reasons described above, that turning 21 is associated with such
large increases in alcohol consumption suggests that increased consumption is an important
mechanism through which performance may be impaired.
   Our first identification strategy to estimate the effect of legal access follows Carrell,
Hoekstra, and West (2011) who exploit the sharp change in legality that occurs at age 21
in a regression discontinuity (RD) framework to estimate effects on student performance.
While it is relatively straightforward to use an RD design to estimate effects of turning 21
on crime or traffic accidents, as in Carpenter and Dobkin’s works, it is less straightforward
as an approach to estimating effects on academic outcomes since they are not measured
frequently. For this reason, the RD approach uses age from 21 at the end of the academic
term as the running variable. As such, the estimates capture the effect of legal access to
alcohol for students who obtain access near the end of the academic term. In the limit, the
thought experiment compares the performance of students who turn 21 the day before their
final exam to the performance of students who turn 21 on the day of their final exam. The
resulting estimates can therefore be characterized as measuring a local average treatment
effect (LATE) which may have limited external validity.
   Our second and preferred identification strategy overcomes this limitation by making
use of the longitudinal nature of the data. In particular, we identify the effect of legal
access to alcohol by comparing a student’s post-21 academic performance to his own pre-21
academic performance with individual-fixed effects models—implicitly arguing that the best
counterfactual for a student’s post-21 performance is his own performance prior to turning
21. In addition, our regressions include fixed effects for the number of accumulated credits
to account for the possibility that students may systematically improve, “slack off,” or take
easier classes as they progress towards degree completion. Although it is not typical for


                                             3
researchers to be able to separately identify effects of experience (or accumulated credits in
our case) and the effects of age (or an age-dependent treatment in our case), we can do so
in our context by leveraging the variation in college starting ages. As in the first approach,
we use a student’s course performance relative to their classmates’ as our outcome variable,
which will also serve to control for selection into courses.3
    The data and institutional setting that we consider—transcript-level data from under-
graduates at the University of Oregon—allow us to make several additional contributions
to the literature. One of the unique features of Carrell, Hoekstra, and West’s (2011) study
using data from the U.S. Air Force Academy is that underage drinking prohibition is taken
extremely seriously there—much more so than in other institutional settings in which en-
forcement is more lax and punishment less severe.4 As such, assuming Air Force Academy
students are representative of the general student population, their RD estimates tell us
about the local average treatment effect of prohibition in environments where enforcement
and penalties are unusually strict. In contrast, our results are more likely to speak to the
effect of minimum drinking age laws as they are conventionally enforced and, in turn, the
effect of the changes in drinking behavior that are typically associated with legal access to
alcohol. As we describe in the next section, the University of Oregon is also more representa-
tive of U.S. institutions, which we anticipate leading to improved external validity. Further,
our data include over four times the number of observations used in this earlier research, and
approximately ten times the number of females which allows a more-precise consideration of
heterogeneity across gender.
    The results from our preferred approach indicate that students’ grades fall below their
expected levels by approximately 0.03 standard deviations upon being able to drink legally,
a modest amount compared to the 0.06 to 0.13 standard-deviation effect estimated in earlier
   3
     In related studies, Williams, Powell, Wechsler (2003) and Powell, Williams, and Wechsler (2004) consider
the effect of alcohol consumption on college GPAs using data from the Harvard School of Public Health’s
College Alcohol Study. These studies involve cross-institution comparisons of student GPAs, with measures
of alcohol costs serving as an instrument for drinking intensity among those who drink. Kremer and Levy
(2008) consider a different-but-related question, exploiting the random assignment of roommates at a large
state university in order to identify the effect of having a roommate who drinks.
   4
     Carrell, Hoekstra, and West (2011) highlight this feature, pointing to the fact that two incidents of
underage drinking at the Air Force Academy resulted in expulsion and that some related incidents (e.g.,
driving under the influence) have also resulted in expulsion.

research. The effect is statistically significant, manifests in the term a student turns 21,
is not strongly related to when within the relevant quarter a student has their 21st birth-
day, and persists into later academic terms. In addition, we find that effects are especially
large for female students, “low-ability” students, and males who are most likely to be from
disadvantaged backgrounds.
        The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the data used in
this analysis as well as the representative nature of the University of Oregon campus. In
Section 3 we present an RD strategy and discuss the resulting estimates. In Section 4 we
present our preferred longitudinal approach and discusses our main empirical findings. We
conclude and discuss the implications of our results in Section 5.



2         Data
In this paper, we use administrative student-course level data from the University of Oregon,
spanning fall 1999 to winter 2007, for students entering at 18 or 19 years old. We focus on
performance during the fall, winter, and spring terms.5 Because our identification strategies
use variation provided by the federal MLDA law, we require students in the sample to be
observed at least one term in which they are at least 21 years old. The resulting sample
consists of 13,102 students contributing 479,342 total observations.
        As one contribution of this paper is to provide insight into the effects of MLDA laws
in a “typical-college setting,” Table 1 compares characteristics of students at the University
of Oregon to those at other U.S. public-four-year institutions. While Column 1 provides
summary statistics based on our sample, Column 2 considers a more comprehensive set of
characteristics based on data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System
(IPEDS). Similarly, Column 3 shows statistics on other public-four-year institutions, also
using data from IPEDS.6
    5
      One reason for excluding summer terms is that summer enrollment could itself be considered an outcome
variable. In addition, summer terms tend to be fundamentally different from other terms in class size, course
offerings, student attendance, teacher and student attributes, and term structure.
    6
      In comparing across institutions we have used variables that provide a snapshot of school admissions and
graduation rates, general academic standards, undergraduate student demographics, and student financial
costs and aid. The statistics reported in columns 2 and 3 are based primarily on the 2003-2004 academic
year, which is close to the median year for our data.


                                                      5
    Table 1 largely supports that the University of Oregon provides a representative-college
setting. While it is twice the size and has higher admission rates than the average public-
four-year institution, it is similar in terms of enrollment rates and in the ability of enrolled
students as measured by SAT scores. It is also very similar to the average college in terms
of costs and financial aid. Like most other institutions, the University of Oregon is over half
female and predominately white, although at seventy-five percent it has a larger share of
white students than average.
    In contrast, the U.S. Air Force Academy, the only other institution where this research
question has been addressed, offers a relatively unique setting. In addition to being highly
selective, it is very different from most schools in terms of its students’ objectives. In
particular, all students at the Air Force Academy are given full scholarships but are expected
to serve a five-year commitment as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Air Force following
graduation. Moreover, females comprise only eighteen percent of its student body, which
stands in stark contrast to the nation-wide average of fifty-five percent. As mentioned in
the introduction, it is also important to note that the Air Force Academy is an outlier in
strongly enforcing the MLDA law. That students at the Air Force Academy are such a select
group from the distribution of all students, in both ability and preferences, and that they
are in an environment that is unusually strict with respect to underage drinking, gives cause
for concern about the external validity of earlier estimates and highlights the importance of
considering the research question in different contexts.



3     RD Analysis

3.1    Empirical Strategy

In this section, we estimate the effect of having had one’s 21st birthday before the end of
the academic term on academic performance using the following regression equation:


                       Gijt = α0 + α1 1{AGEit ≥ 0} + f (AGEit ) + ijt                      (1)




                                               6
where Gijt is the normalized grade for student i in class j in term t. Normalized grade is
calculated as a student’s grade deviation from the class mean divided by the class standard
deviation. AGEit is the student’s age at the end of the term in days, centered on 21 years.
For example, in the comparison of means as estimates approach the treatment threshold
from each side, a bandwidth of 90 days would put weight on all students who had their 21st
birthday in the range 90 days prior to the end of the term (i.e., AGE = 90) through 90 days
after the end of the term (i.e., AGE = −90). Last, f (AGEit ) controls for a student’s age
at the end of the term in a flexible manner. In practice, we estimate models that do not
control for age at the end of the term, models that control for age at the end of the term
with a linear specification flexible on each side of the cutoff, and models that control for age
at the end of the term with a quadratic specification flexible on each side of the cutoff, and
consider bandwidths between 20 days and 240 days.
       It is important to note that this identification strategy departs from the usual RD exer-
cise. Typically, we observe—or know as a result of institutional details—the extent to which
the treatment of interest jumps on the “treatment side” of the threshold. For example, in
DiNardo and Lee’s (2004) unionization study, all elections with union support greater than
fifty percent lead to unionization while elections with less support do not. Similarly, in
Angrist and Lavy’s (1999) class-size study, we observe class-size reductions above multiples
of forty enrolled students. Our example is similar insofar as all students on the “treatment
side” of the threshold have had the opportunity to drink alcohol legally prior to the conclu-
sion of the academic term. However, because the underlying effects on drinking behavior is
unobserved, the magnitude of any estimated effect will be somewhat difficult to interpret.
Even though we know that drinking tends to increase when one turns 21 (Carpenter and
Dobkin, 2009), we do not know to what extent this holds true for students who turn 21 near
the end of an academic term, which this identification strategy pre-supposes. As such, the
comparison involved with this RD approach is informative about the effect of drinking on
college performance but its “local” nature (close to 21 and close to the end of the term)
introduces additional interpretive challenges.7
   7
    We note that all RD-based studies that consider the effect of being able to drink legally are local in
the first (close to 21) sense but that the second sense is specific to this application, driven by the fact that
outcomes are not measured daily.



                                                       7
      In the absence of estimated effects on drinking behavior, the results are appropriately
characterized as intent-to-treat effects, measuring the reduced-form effect of the minimum
drinking age law which is certainly of interest in itself. However, that the RD design only
provides an estimate of a very local intent-to-treat effect, corresponding to students gaining
legal access to alcohol at the end of the academic term, remains a disadvantage of this
approach, something that we improve on with the identification strategy presented in the
next section where we exploit the longitudinal nature of the data.


3.2       Results

Table 2 presents RD-based estimates of the effect of legal access to alcohol at the end of
a term on academic performance. Across the fourteen columns, the table shows estimates
based on a wide range of bandwidths and functional-form choices. While Panel A reports
unadjusted estimates, Panel B controls for course-by-quarter-by-year fixed effects, birth-year
fixed effects, accumulated-credits fixed effects, gender, math and verbal SAT scores, high-
school GPA, and indicator variables for university athletes, private high school attendance,
race, and ethnicity.8
      Overall, the set of results in Table 2 provides evidence that turning 21 before the end
of a term has a negative impact on a student’s grades. While the point estimates vary
somewhat from specification to specification and are sensitive to control variables, they are
routinely negative and suggest that students who turn 21 prior to the end of the quarter
score roughly 0.03 to 0.05 standard deviations lower than those who turn 21 after the quarter
ends. However, the sensitivity of RD estimates to the inclusion of controls—primarily the
inclusion of individual characteristics and accumulated credits—casts doubt on the validity
of this strategy in our setting.
      As a further robustness check, Table 3 reports the results from a similar exercise but
instead considers the effect of turning 20 before a quarter ends. In particular, these results
test for a “twentieth birthday effect” which would raise the concern that the estimates in
Table 2 might reflect a “21st birthday effect” that cannot be separated from the effect of
gaining legal access to alcohol near the end of the term. Although the estimates in Table
  8
      Race and ethnicity controls consists of a set of indicator variables for being black, Hispanic, or Asian.


                                                        8
3 are rarely significant, the fact that 26 of the 28 point estimates are negative casts further
doubt on the validity of this strategy in our setting.9



4       Longitudinal Analysis
In this section, we use our preferred approach to estimate the effects of legal access to
alcohol, which focuses on within-student variation over time. Although we first present
estimates from more parsimonious models, we ultimately arrive at estimates derived from
the following regression:


                                  Gijt = θAGE21it + βXijt + αi + uijt                                         (2)


where Gijt is the normalized grade for student i in class j in term t, AGE21it is an indicator
variable that takes a value of one if the student could drink legally at any time during term
t and zero otherwise, Xijt can include term- or class-varying individual characteristics, αi
are a set of individual fixed effects, and uijt is a random error term. In practice, we always
include “experience controls” in Xijt , i.e., fixed effects for the number of accumulated credits
(in intervals of four) to control for grade changes that are expected as a student progresses
towards his degree.10 For example, these variables are intended to control for phenomena
such as “senioritis.” As such, the estimation strategy essentially compares a student’s grades
after turning 21 to what would be expected based on his average prior performance and
accumulated experience.11
    9
      In the appendix we show that a similar exercise considering the effect of turning 22 before a quarter ends
indicates limited evidence for the presence of a birthday effect. Carrell, Hoekstra, and West (2011) conduct
a similar analysis and find no evidence of 20th or 22nd birthday effects at the U.S. Air Force Academy. In
an attempt to separate the short-term birthday effect from that of a potentially-persistent effect of legal
access to alcohol we have also explored the use of a donut-RD approach (Carpenter and Dobkin, 2009;
Barreca, Guldi, Lindo, and Waddell, forthcoming; Barreca, Lindo and Waddell, 2011). In particular, we
have conducted a similar analysis after dropping observations 1, 2, 3, 10, and 15 days to either side of the
cutoff. This analysis continued to show similar estimates when considering the effect of turning 20 and 21.
   10
      While it would be attractive to also include fixed effects for the number of terms a student has been at
the university, doing so is likely to introduce problems of multicollinearity in conjunction with the individual
fixed effects and cumulative-credits fixed effects since there is little variation in credits attempted each term.
For example, such a model would be impossible to estimate if all students earned 12 credits each term. We
have explored models that include fixed effects for the number of terms a student has been at the university
instead of the cumulative credits fixed effects and the results are quite similar.
   11
      We also estimate models that control for course characteristics.


                                                        9
4.1        Main Results

Table 4 presents our main results. In Column 1, we show the estimated effect based on
a regression of a student’s normalized grade on an indicator for whether a student could
drink legally at any time during the term. Because we anticipate that relatively low ability
students will be observed more often at older ages (as they take longer to complete their
degrees), we anticipate that this approach will overstate the negative effect of legal access to
alcohol. After we control for ability and other unobservable characteristics with the inclusion
of individual fixed effects, the estimate is indeed much smaller (falling from -0.146 to -0.097
from Column 1 to Column 2). However, estimates in Column 2 may still suffer from bias due
to the potential for grades to fall as students progress towards their degrees while they become
increasingly likely to be 21 years old. As anticipated, the magnitude of the estimate is even
smaller when we remove this source of bias by controlling for a student’s accumulated credits
with fixed effects. That said, the point estimate (shown in Column 3) remains statistically
significant at the one-percent level, indicating that a student’s course-normalized grades fall
by 0.033 standard deviations after they gain legal access to alcohol relative to what we would
expect based on their prior performance and accumulated experience. The estimated effect
is identical when we add controls for subject-by-level fixed effects and term fixed effects
in Column 4, which is not surprising since our outcome variable is normalized at the class
level.12
       Although the above estimates address omitted variable bias that might be induced by
effects on course-taking behavior by normalizing students’ grades relative to their classmates
and by controlling for course characteristics, any effect on course selection is of interest itself.
This issue is explored in Table 5, which considers the effect of legal alcohol access on course
difficulty and course loads. This analysis is identical to that in Table 4 except it is conducted
at the student-by-quarter level rather than the student-by-quarter-by-course level and, as
such, omits course-level controls but still can include term fixed effects. As a measure of
course difficulty, the upper panel focuses on a student’s expected GPA, which is based on
  12
    For these fixed effects, subjects correspond to economics, english, and mathematics. Levels correspond
to either 100-, 200-, 300-, or 400-level classes. As summer terms are not considered as part of our analysis,
terms are fall, winter, and spring.




                                                     10
the average grades in the previous offering of each of the courses he is taking. The lower
panel focuses on the number of credits a student takes in a given term. In the upper panel,
there is evidence that legal access has a small influence on selection into courses based on
difficulty—our preferred estimate in Column 4 suggest that turning 21 leads students to take
course loads with 0.009 higher expected GPAs. In the lower panel, our preferred estimate
reveals no significant impact on the number of credits a student takes in a given quarter.


4.2       Treatment-Effect Dynamics

In order to consider the dynamic effect of being able to drink legally, we replace the post-21
indicator variable with a set of indicator variables corresponding to the number of terms
following the term in which a student gains legal access to alcohol. In particular, we include
separate indicator variables for the term in which the individual turns 21, one term after
a student turns 21, . . . , five terms after a student turns 21, and six-or-more terms after a
student turns 21. The omitted category, essential for identifying individual fixed effects and
trends, is being in a term prior to turning 21.13
       Although it is possible to include indicator variables for terms prior to turning 21 to verify
that grades do not fall below their expected levels in anticipation of gaining legal access—
which we do in the next section in a series of falsification tests—our preferred estimates do
not take this approach. We make this choice out of consideration for the general tradeoff
involved with including pre-treatment indicator variables when using panel data approaches
to estimation. Specifically, as one includes more indicator variables for pre-treatment pe-
riods, the counterfactual for the post-treatment periods becomes worse and worse as fewer
observations contribute to the estimate of the individual fixed effects. For example, if we
were to include indicators for one, two, three, and four terms prior to turning 21, our model
would be projecting a student’s future performance using observations from when he was
under the age of 20. As such, our estimates of interest corresponding to post-21 terms would
be noisier and less reliable than estimates that do not include these indicator variables and
  13
    Note that although summer terms do not contribute to out analysis, such terms are considered in defining
the term-based proximity to the term in which a student turns 21. As such, when the “turned 21 four terms
ago” indicator variable is equal to one we are considering an individual in the term he turns 22.




                                                    11
instead use all pre-21 terms to form counterfactuals.
   Our preferred estimates of the treatment effect dynamics, shown in Column 4 of Ta-
ble 6, indicate that grades fall significantly below their expected levels—by 0.036 standard
deviations—in the term a student turns 21. This suggests an immediate negative effect of
legal access to alcohol on academic performance. Further, the estimated coefficients cor-
responding to subsequent terms are usually significant and of similar magnitude, which
indicates that the effect persists.
   We do note, however, that the coefficient on having turned 21 four terms ago (-0.055)
is somewhat higher than the rest, which may reflect a 22nd-birthday effect. In the next
section, we show that there is no evidence of a similar 20th-birthday effect (in contrast to
the RD-based analysis discussed above) which suggests that a 22nd-birthday effect may itself
be related to legal alcohol access and its associated activities. That said, this estimate is not
significantly different from the estimated effect of being in the term of one’s 21st birthday
(p-value = 0.07).
   In Figure 1 we present a graphical analogue to our preferred approach to estimation. In
particular, we plot average adjusted normalized GPAs by students’ ages in quarters. The
normalized GPAs have been adjusted by taking the residuals from a regression on individual
fixed effects, accumulated credits fixed effects, and the course-specific fixed effects described
above. Like the estimates in Column 4 of Table 6, this figure shows clearly that student
GPAs fall below their expected levels when students turn 21 and, further, they stay below
their below their expected levels for several subsequent quarters.
   Column 5 of Table 6 turns the attention to the timing of a student’s 21st birthday during
the quarter. In particular, in this column we replace the indicator for turning 21 in the
current term with an indicator for turning 21 in weeks 10–11 of the current quarter, weeks
7–9 of the current quarter, weeks 4–6 of the current quarter, and weeks 1–3 of the current
quarter. In large part, it is not clear what pattern of estimates we would expect this analysis
to reveal. On one hand, the effects might be most severe for students who gain legal access at
the beginning of the term since they will be exposed for a longer time, potentially impairing
their learning throughout the entire quarter. On the other hand, an early-term birthday
may allow students to “get it out of their system” early in the quarter, leading to greater


                                               12
focus near the end of the term when studying may be most productive.
      The set of point estimates in Column 4 suggest that there are effects of gaining legal access
to alcohol at any time during a given quarter. However, we note that the estimated effect of
a being able to drink legally as of the tenth or eleventh week of a given quarter is relatively
small, which is what we would expect since a share of these birthdays will have taken place
after students have already completed their final exams.14 The point estimates indicate that
turning 21 in weeks 7–9 reduce current-term grades by 0.035 standard deviations, turning
21 in weeks 4–6 reduce grades by 0.048 standard deviations, and turning 21 in weeks 1–3
reduces grades by 0.038 standard deviations. As such, it appears as if the most severe effects
arise for students who are able to start drinking legally midway through the quarter which
does not provide clear evidence against either of the hypotheses described above. Further,
the standard errors are too large to reject that the effect is the same for students gaining
legal access to alcohol at different times during the quarter.


4.3       Falsification Exercise

In this section, we subject our preferred estimation strategy to a series of specification tests.
In particular, we add to our model indicator variables for terms preceding the term in which
a student turns 21. Simply put, it would be a threat to the validity of the research design if
similar effects are evident in terms before a student turns 21.
      In order to maximize power, we take an incremental approach to adding indicator vari-
ables for terms preceding an individual’s 21st birthday. As we alluded to in the previous
section, if one adds many pre-treatment variables to such a regression model, the individual
fixed effects and trends will be poorly measured and the resulting estimates will be extremely
noisy. As such, a falsification test that simultaneously includes several pre-treatment vari-
ables may not be very convincing even if the “placebo tests” are not statistically significant.
      Table 7 shows the results of this exercise, displaying our preferred estimate from Table
6 in Column 1. In Column 2, we add an indicator for being one term prior to turning 21,
in Column 3 we add an indicator for being two terms prior to turning 21, in Column 4 we
add an indicator for being three terms prior to turning 21, and in Column 5 we add an
 14
      We do not have information on the exact date on which specific courses held final exams.


                                                     13
indicator for being four terms prior to 21. Ultimately, we have ten “placebo tests” across
these four columns where we do not anticipate any effects. Of these ten estimates, none are
significant, which provides support for our preferred identification strategy. We also note
that the estimates shown in Column 5 are what one would get if they were estimating the
effect of turning 20 on student performance. Unlike the RD-approach above, where a 20th
birthday effect is evident, we find no evidence that performance declines with turning 20.


4.4    Treatment-Effect Heterogeneity

In tables 8 and 9 we explore the extent to which there are heterogeneous effects of legal alcohol
access on student achievement. Motivated by prior research documenting gender differences
in educational performance and in tendencies to engage in risky behaviors, these tables
report separate estimates for males and females. We also consider heterogeneity by ability
and financial aid eligibility to determine whether our main results are driven by individuals
more likely to struggle with coursework or those from particular economic backgrounds.
   Table 8 stratifies the sample by student gender and ability, with “high ability” students
defined as those with cumulative SAT scores above the sample median of 1120 and “low
ability” students defined as those at or below the sample median.
   Columns 1 and 2 suggest that the effect of being able to drink legally is larger for females
on average than it is for males. The point estimates remain small, however, with legal access
reducing female grades by 0.045 and male grades by 0.024 standard deviations. Columns 3
and 4 suggests that similar differences exist across ability, with point estimates indicating
that the effect on low-ability students is greater than the effect on high-ability students.
   Columns 5 through 8 separately consider the effects for low-ability males, high-ability
males, low-ability females, and high-ability females. These estimates reveal substantial het-
erogeneity among males. Although there is a significant effect on low-ability males whose
grades fall 0.047 standard deviations below their expected level after they gain legal access
to alcohol, there appears to be no effect on high-ability males. On the other hand, our
point estimates suggest that there are negative effects for both high- and low-ability females,
although the estimated effects are greatest for low-ability females.
   Table 9 stratifies the estimates by financial-aid eligibility and gender for the seventy


                                               14
percent of students who submitted a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).
Column 1 shows that the estimated effect for this sample of students (-0.042) is somewhat
larger than the estimated effect based on the full sample (-0.033). The set of estimates
suggests that, among males, the effect is concentrated among those who are likely to be from
disadvantaged backgrounds. In contrast, the estimated effect is similar across differing levels
of financial aid eligibility among females.



5     Discussion and Conclusion
As a whole, our analysis suggests that legal access to alcohol does affect student performance,
reducing grades by 0.03 standard deviations. To put this magnitude into context, it is
equivalent to causing a student to perform as if his or her SAT score were 20 points lower.
    In addition to what was discussed in the introduction, one of the benefits of our longi-
tudinal analysis is its ability to speak to the extent to which the effect is sensitive to the
timing of a student’s 21st birthday within the term. The estimates suggest that the effect
is just as great for those turning 21 at the end of a term as it is those turning 21 at the
beginning of the term. As such, the effect we identify is smaller than Carrell, Hoekstra,
and West (2011) who find that gaining legal access at the end of the academic term reduces
grades by approximately 0.10 standard deviations. Given the more conventional enforcement
of MLDA at large public universities, this difference might exist because legal access has a
different effect on alcohol-related behavior across the two settings. We also find substantial
heterogeneity across gender and ability, in ways that diverge meaningfully from the prior
research. In particular, given that the U.S. Air Force Academy is more selective and has
a much larger fraction of men than the University of Oregon, it is perhaps surprising that
we find no evidence of an effect among high-ability males. In addition, in contrast to this
earlier work, we identify a significant effect on the performance of females that exceeds the
estimated effect on the performance of males.
    While these effects are small, and potentially resulting from a rational calculation in which
students trade off higher grades in exchange for perceived-higher-quality leisure, our results
do suggest that it may be important to consider other longer-term outcomes. In particular,


                                               15
given that our results provide suggestive evidence that the effect is persistent, there might
be important impacts on subsequent labor-market outcomes. The literature’s best evidence
linking alcohol and labor market outcomes in the U.S. uses state-level aggregates (Dave and
Kaestner 2001), survey data from the 1988 National Health Interview Survey (Mullahy and
Sindelar 1996; Terza 2002), and from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (Renna
2009), where power is a challenge to identification. We see this as an important area for
future research with a great need for improved sources of data.
