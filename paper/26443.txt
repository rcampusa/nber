                                         ABSTRACT

We use data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) for the years 2004 - 2012 to
examine the impact of economic shocks on the family's out-of-pocket health care spending
burden. We define this burden as the share of family income devoted to out-of-pocket health care
spending. In contrast to static, cross-sectional analyses, our study examines how the within-
family change in spending burden over the two-year MEPS observation period responds to losses
in family income, insurance, and employment. We also consider the impact of such losses on
single-mother and two-parent families. To do so, we apply fractional response and health
expenditure models using the correlated random effects (CRE) method to control for time-
invariant, unobserved heterogeneity across family units. We find evidence that the change in the
out-of-pocket spending burden is sensitive to income shocks, and that income changes rather than
changes in health spending per se appears to drive changes in the out-of-pocket burden.

           How Do Economic Shocks Affect Family Health Care Spending Burdens?

I. Introduction
       An economic shock which compromises a family's economic status can have important

implications for its spending on critical goods and services, such as health care. Given the

importance of access to health care for a family's health security, a critical issue is whether the

family can sustain its health care spending when it experiences a decline in its economic status,

and whether it can do so without compromising its consumption of other essential commodities.

       More specifically, the implications for the family's health, financial security, and

consumption will depend on how the family's responsibility for health care spending changes in

response to an economic shock that alters its income and possibly its health insurance status.

Such losses may reduce the family's demand for health care, and thus have implication for its

health care spending burden. The change in spending burden, defined as the share of family

income allocated to health care, will depend on two factors: (1) How the family's total health

care spending changes with an economic shock, and (2) how its out-of-pocket health care

spending changes in response to the change in its total health care spending. Depending upon the

family's health status, the share of family income required to support its out-of-pocket health

care spending may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged. 1

       In this paper, we consider how the family's out-of-pocket health care spending burden

responds to a change in its income, employment, and health insurance status. While a variety of

papers have examined the out-of-pocket spending burden of families, these have largely been

 Should the family maintain its health insurance coverage, its out-of-pocket spending and
associated spending burden will depend upon whether the family has yet to meet its deductible or
has surpassed its deductible requirement.

static cross-sectional analyses. As such, they have not considered the dynamic nature of the

within-family change in its out-of-pocket spending burden in response to a change in its

economic status. This dynamic change is the focus of our paper, and we apply data from the two-

year Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) described below to assess the implications for

the family's welfare. Finally, we further examine whether the change in its out-of-pocket health

care spending burden is differentially borne by single-mother families compared to two-parent

families. In earlier work examining the impact of economic shocks on the intra-family allocation

of health care spending between adults and children (Monheit, Grafova, and Kumar 2018), we

found that the response was largely due to the behavior of single-mother families.

       The plan of our paper is as follows. In section II we provide background on the issue of

out-of-pocket spending citing research that is particularly relevant for our work. We also devise

an analytical framework to help interpret changes in out-of-pocket spending burden. In section

III we discuss our data and analytical approach, report results in section IV, and conclusions,

implications, and limitations in section V. In general, we find that an economic shock yields an

increase in the family's out-of-pocket spending burden, and that this change is driven primarily

by the decline in family income rather than by changes in its health care spending per se.

II. Background and Analytical Framework

       Concern with the financial vulnerability of families confronting rising health care costs

and the uncertainty regarding their economic circumstances has stimulated interest in the burden

of health care spending borne by families. In part, this reflects both research and media stories

highlighting the contribution of out-of-pocket health care spending to family bankruptcies

(Himmelstein et al. 2009; Doty et al. 2008; Dranove and Millenston 2006); the extent to which

families exceed arbitrary thresholds demarcating catastrophic health care burdens (Galarraga et
                                                                                                       4


al. 2010); and the degree to which health insurance expansions and public policy interventions

can address these financial burdens. Most recently, concern has been raised by the reaction of

enrollees to the large deductibles in some health insurance plans offered through the Affordable

Care Act's health insurance exchanges. Finally, research has been stimulated by methodological

issues related to estimating family health care burdens (Goldman and Smith, 2001), service-

specific studies of health care burdens (e.g., Zuvekas and Selden 2010; Ringel and Strum 2001),

studies examining trends in out-of-pocket health spending (Blumberg et al. 2014), and studies

highlighting the adequacy of public and private insurance in protecting against catastrophic

health expenditures (Galarraga et al 2010).

       By contrast, surprising little work has focused on how the family's out-of-pocket

spending and its health care financial burden respond to changes in the family's economic status.

Perhaps most importantly, this reflects the limited availability of panel data containing health

care spending measures that can be used to assess such a change for specific families over time.

Another limitation in the literature is that the existing cross-sectional analyses of changes in the

family's health care expenditure burden typically focus on a single measure such as the percent

of income allocated to health care without exploring how the underlying factors governing this

burden respond to changes in economic status.

Analytical Framework

       In assessing and understanding the behavior of a family's out-of-pocket expenditures and

its burden on family income, we consider several relevant relationships. Focusing on income

shocks, we begin by representing the family's out-of-pocket health care spending burden as

OOP/Y where OOP represents family out-of-pocket spending and Y represents family income.

Whether this spending burden will increase in response to an income change will depend on the
                                                                                                    5


how out-of-pocket expenditures change relative to the change in income. More specifically, for

an economic shock yielding a decline in income and in out-of-pocket spending, the out-of-pocket

burden will increase if:

                            (OOP/Y) > 0 if |OOP|/OOP < |Y|/Y          (1)

That is, if the percent decline in out-of-pocket spending (OOP/OOP) is less than the percent

decline in income (Y/Y). Should out-of-pocket spending increase or remain the same in

response to an income decline, then the out-of-pocket burden will always increase.

       Next, we note that the change in the out-of-pocket health care spending burden, OOP/Y,

can be written as the following product:

                           OOP/Y = TE/Y* OOP/TE                      (2)

where OOP and Y are defined as before, TE represents total health care spending, TE/Y is the

share of family income devoted to health care, and OOP/TE is the share of total health care

spending borne out-of-pocket by the family. Thus, to fully assess the behavior of the family's

out-of-pocket health care spending burden, we require consideration of how total health care

spending responds to an income change and in turn, how out-of-pocket spending responds to a

change in total spending. Totally differentiating (2) yields the change in the out-of-pocket burden

from time t to time t+1:

       (OOP/Y) t+1 - t = (TE/Y) t+1 ­ t * (OOP|/TE) t + (OOP/TE) t+1 - t * (TE/Y) t       (3)

Thus the change in the out-of-pocket spending burden from baseline time t to time t+1 [

(OOP/Y) t+1 ­ t] will depend on the change in total spending between time t and time t+1 as a

share of income [(TE/Y) t+1 ­ t ] weighted by the baseline share of out-of-pocket spending in

total health care spending [(OOP|/TE) t], plus the change in out-of-pocket spending as a share of

total health care spending between time t and time t+1 [(OOP/TE) t+1 ­ t] weighted by total
                                                                                                   6


health care spending as a percent of income at baseline time t [(TE/Y) t] . We use the

relationship in (3) to guide our empirical work. More specifically, we estimate fractional

response probit models with TE/Y and OOP/TE as outcomes to assess how these components

underlying the change in out-of-pocket burden respond to changes in family economic status

over observation periods.

III. Data and Empirical Approach
Data

       The data for this analysis are from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Household

Component (MEPS), a series of two-year panel data sets maintained by the Agency for

Healthcare Research and Quality. The MEPS collects data from a nationally representative

subsample of households that participated in the prior year's National Health Interview Survey.

Respondents to the MEPS are surveyed five times over a period covering two calendar years

regarding their own and their family members' demographic characteristics, health status, health

care expenditures and utilization, health insurance coverage, income, and employment status.

Our analytical data set includes pooled two-year panels from the MEPS covering the period 2004

through 2012. 2

       Since the focus of our analysis is on the family's health care spending burden, we

constructed family units and obtained family-level characteristics for each year of our two-year

panels based on the characteristics of individual family members, family-level income, the

insurance status of each family member, and each parent's employment history. Our sample of

families consists of those with all members present for both years of the two-year panel and who

 For consistency with our earlier analyses of economic shocks and family health security
(Monheit, Grafova, and Kumar, 2018; Grafova, Monheit and Kumar 2018; and Monheit and
Grafova, 2018), we rely on data for this period.
                                                                                                     7


are related by marriage or by birth. We excluded families with individuals ages 65 years or older

since such families typically have members covered by Medicare. Such families are less likely

than families with non-elders to be affected by an economic shock that would compromise their

health care spending and their out-of-pocket spending obligations.

          We also excluded families with births during the two-year period since such families may

have experienced a one-time spike in their health care spending burden associated with pre-natal

care and childbirth. Finally, we excluded families with children ages 18 or older in an attempt to

represent only nuclear families without children residing outside the household. Such children

may have access to other sources of medical care (such as care obtained through a college health

plan or through their own employment-related plan) and thus are unlikely to be affected by an

economic shock experienced by their parents. These exclusions resulted in a sample size of

43,629 individuals representing 13,821 families. Since we focus on families, we restricted our

analysis to married couples with children and single-mother families. 3 These restrictions yielded

samples of 5,972 two-parent families with children and 2,999 single-mother families for a total

sample size of 8,971 families.

          Total health care expenditures in MEPS data represent the sum of direct payments for

health care services provided during the year. This includes out-of-pocket payments incurred by

the family, and payments by private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, and other sources. We

obtained total and out-of-pocket health care spending for each individual family member and

then aggregated these data to obtain total family health care spending and total family out-of-

pocket spending. We used these variables to create the share of total family health care spending

represented by out-of-pocket spending (OOP/TE), and the share of family income represented by

    We did not have adequate sample size to include single-father families in the analysis.

total family health care spending (TE/Y). Note that our measures of total and out-of-pocket

spending are restricted to spending directly allocated to the family's medical care and do not

include family out-of-pocket contributions to health insurance. Finally, all expenditure variables

are expressed in 2012 dollars.

Empirical approach

       To assess how the family's health care spending burden responds to an economic shock,

we examine the within-family change in the family's out-of-pocket health care spending as a

share of family income over the two-year MEPS observation periods. Additionally, given our

decomposition of the out-of-pocket burden in (2) above, we also consider how an economic

shock is related to the within-family change in the share of income allocated to total health care

spending and the share of total health care spending paid out of pocket. Since these measures are

proportions which will generally lie within the zero ­ one bound, we estimate fractional probit

models (FRM). 4 We estimate the FRMs using the correlated random effects (CRE) method to

control for time-invariant, unobserved heterogeneity across family units (Papke and Wooldridge

2008; Wooldridge 2010).

        Following Wooldridge (2010), the FRM takes the following functional form using the

probit response function:

        P(yit = 1 | xit, ait, ci) = (xit, ait, ci) for the ith family over time periods t=1, . . . T.




4
 The ratio of family out-of-pocket health care spending to family income can exceed unity as
can the ratio of total health spending to family income. To accommodate the fractional response
model, we top-coded values of these variables to one if they exceeded unity. For our measure of
out-of-pocket burden, only 3.5% of single-mother families and 0.5% of two-parent families had
values in excess of unity. For the ratio of total family health care spending to family income,
11.0% of single-mother families and 2.5% of two-parent families had values in excess unity.
                                                                                                    9


Here, yit represents a proportion, for example OOP/Y, the share of family income allocated to

out-of-pocket health care spending by family i, in year t. Following (3) above, we also apply the

model to obtain estimates of OOP/TE, the share of total health care spending borne by the

family, and TE/Y, the ratio of total health spending to family income to assess what is driving

the change in OOP/Y. Additionally, xit represents a vector of explanatory variables describing

family characteristics (some of which will vary over time), ait is a vector of economic shocks i in

time t, and ci represents a vector of unobserved time-invariant family effects. 5 Variables included

in this specification are described below. Following applications of the fractional response model

in the CRE framework (Papke and Wooldridge, 2008), we include averages of time-varying

variables over our two-year observation period to control for possible correlation between ci and

the explanatory variables, and include time-specific dummy variables and time-invariant

explanatory variables in the FRM specification.

       We estimate FRM models for single-mother and two-parent families using the fractreg

procedure in STATA 15, and obtain marginal effects through STATA's margins procedure. We

apply MEPS longitudinal sampling weights to these estimates, and to account for the non-

random design of MEPS, we cluster standard errors at the MEPS primary sampling unit. 6




5
  The CRE approach imposes a strong assumption regarding the dependence between the
unobserved family effects ci and the observed explanatory variables xit. Specifically, this
dependence is assumed to follows the conditional normal distribution Mundalk (1978) and
Chamberlain (1980) where ci ~ Normal ( + x). As we note, x represents a vector of values for
the time-varying explanatory variables averaged over our two-year observation period to control
for possible correlation between ci and the explanatory variables.
6
  We derived family weights for our two-year panel file using family weights from the full-year
MEPS file corresponding to the second year of each longitudinal file and adjusted these weights
for our specific sample. We did this by multiplying by the ratio of the sum of family weights in
this second-year file to the sum of family weights for families who remained in the two-year
panel in the full-year file. We thank Steven Hill of AHRQ for his advice on this weighting issue.
                                                                                                    10


Family and individual characteristics

       In our empirical models, we control for various individual and family-level

characteristics. These include parents' age, education (for two-parent families the spouse with

the highest education), mother's race/ethnicity, whether either parent is in fair/poor health and

whether the either parent has a MEPS priority health condition (we include diabetes, asthma,

arthritis, chronic heart disease). Additionally, we include the number of children in the family

less than age 5, the number of children between ages 5 and 17, the number of children in

fair/poor health, and the family's region of residence.

Economic shocks

       To assess the impact of changes in economic status over the two-year observation

periods, we fit the above models using measures of family income, employment status, and

health insurance status in each panel year. With regard to income changes, we include dummy

variables indicating categories of family income relative to the federal poverty line (FPL),

specifically, whether the family is classified as high income families (400% of the FPL or more),

near-poor (between 100% and 125% of the FPL), low income (125% to less than 200% of the

FPL), middle income (200% to less than 400% of the FPL), with poor income (less than the

FPL) as the reference group. 7 We use differences in predicted average marginal effects between

income groups to assess the impact of an economic shock.




7
  Although we measure continuous income inflated to 2012 dollars, we focus on the poverty
level measures for two reasons. First these measures capture any non-linearity in the income/out-
of-pocket expenditure relationship. Second, movement across these categories over time
represents significant income shocks. For example, moving from the income threshold of four
times the FPL in 2012 for a family of four to the threshold for three times the FPL represents an
income loss of over $30,000 ($92,200 to $69,150). Such a dramatic shift is not likely to be
captured using a continuous measure of income. The disadvantage in using the FPL measure is
that we can miss some significant changes within FPL classes.
                                                                                                   11


          We characterize the family's employment status during each year of the two-year panel

with a set of dummy variables. For single-mother families, these variables indicate whether the

mother was continuously employed all year (the reference group consists of those not employed

all year or those employed only part year) and for two-parent families, we use similar variables

for each parent to indicate whether both parents were employed all year (the reference group

consists of families in which one parent but not both parents were employed all year or families

in which both parents were without employment for the entire year or were only employed part

year). Finally, we also account for changes in the family's health insurance status over each year

of the two-year panel. We do this with dummy variables indicating whether all family members

were insured during the year or whether at least one but not all family members lacked coverage

all year (families with all members uninsured are the reference group). In our fractional response

models, the derived marginal effects of each set of these economic status dummy variables

convey the within-family change in economic circumstances over the two-year panel observation

period.

          Our models also account for time periods encompassing the Great Recession (December

2006 to June 2009) through the use of several dummy variables indicating the two-year time

periods in which families in specific MEPS panels were observed. Families whose two-year

observation period occurred during the 2004 - 2006 period were designated with the dummy

variable PRE1 and PRE2 indicating that they were in the first or second year MEPS panels in

pre-recession period. Those whose two-year observation periods spanned the years 2006 - 2008

were designated with the dummy variables ONSETP1 and ONSETP2 indicating that they were

in the first or second year of the recession's onset; those whose two-year observation periods fell

primarily in the recession period (2008 - 2010) were designated with the dummy variable REC1
                                                                                                   12


and REC2; while those observed during the 2010 - 2012 post-recession period were designated

with dummy variables POST1 and POST2. The difference in the estimated year-specific

coefficients and marginal effects (e.g., REC2 ­ REC1) represents the within-family change in

outcomes between the first and second years of these time periods. However, the key test for

these time period variables is to determine whether the change in outcomes over the two-year

onset, recession, and post-recession time periods differs significantly from the change in

outcomes over the pre-recession two-year period (e.g., whether (REC2 ­ REC1) ­ (PRE2 ­

PRE1).

IV. Findings

Characteristics of single mother and two-parent families

         In Table 1, we present selected characteristics of our single-mother and two-parent

families based upon data from individuals in the first year of each MEPS panel. We find that

mean and median total health care spending for single-mother families are considerably lower

than those for two-parent families, reflecting both differences in family size and in the use of

health care services. Similarly, we also find that mean and median out-of-pocket spending for

single-parent families to be considerably lower than those for two-parent families. As regards the

out-of-pocket burden, we find that the mean burden for single-mother families (6.85% of family

income) is more than twice that of two-parent families (2.93%), while by contrast, median family

burden is about a third higher for two-parent families (1.34% of family income) compared to

single-mother families (1.08%). The difference between mean and median burden reflects the

highly skewed nature of the out-of-pocket spending distribution, similar to that observed for total

health care spending by each family type.
                                                                                                  13


       We also observe that single-mother families are at a significant disadvantage with regard

to their economic status. Average family income for single-mother families is just a third

(36.2%) of that for two-parent families, reflecting the presence of a working spouse in the latter

families (where nearly 90% of fathers are employed). Over two-thirds (69.8%) of single mothers

have low incomes or are poor or near-poor compared to only 22.5% of two-parent families. Only

27% of single-mother families are middle income and 11.5% are high income. By contrast, over

a third of two-parent families are middle income and 40.9% of these families are high income.

       These differences in economic status by family type are also reflected in differences in

mother's education and race/ethnicity. We find that half of mothers in two-parent families

graduated from college compared to only a fifth of those in single-mother families (51.9% to

19.4%, respectively). Given earnings disparities between whites and other racial/ethnic groups,

the differences in economic status between single-mother families and two-parent families may

also reflect the significantly higher proportion of white mothers in the latter families.

       We also find that single-mother households are less likely to have very young children

compared to two-parent families (27.9% compared to 34.9%), and that the health status of

children and mothers in single-parent families is inferior to that in two-parent families. On

average, the number of children in fair/poor health in single-mother families is nearly three times

that in two-parent families (0.11 compared to 0.04), and the likelihood that a mother in a single-

mother family will be in fair/poor health in nearly twice that found in two-parent families 22.5%

compared to 11.9%). Finally, we find that single-mothers are more likely to have MEPS priority

health conditions than married mothers, specifically with regard to diabetes (5.05% compared to

3.05%), asthma (13.45% compared to 8.50%) and arthritis (14.81% compared to 11.30%).

Econometric results: economic shocks and out-of-pocket expenditure burden

       In Table 2 we present estimates from the FRM/CRE models of the impact of economic

shocks on the within-family change in its out-of-pocket expenditure burden over a two-year

period. Results are provided for single-mother and two-parent families. These estimates

represent average marginal effects presented both as percentage point and percent changes in the

family's out-of-pocket burden in response to changes in family economic status. To obtain the

percent change in burden for each economic status and time period category, we compute the

ratio of the percentage point change to the first-year measure of burden associated with each

category.

       Holding the effects of changes in parents' employment and family insurance status

constant, we find that income shocks experienced by both single-mother and two-parent families

generally result in relatively small but statistically significant percentage point increases in out-

of-pocket spending burdens (columns 2 and 4). For example, for single-mother families, a loss of

economic status from high-income to lower-income categories (i.e., high income to middle, low,

or poor income) yields percentage point increases in out-of-pocket burden of between roughly

two and five percentage points . We also find small percentage point increases in out-of-pocket

burden for shifts among other income categories, with the most pronounced results from shifts

to incomes below the federal poverty line. Finally, we observe similar increases in burden for

income losses experienced by two-parent families, with the largest increases in burden for

families shifting from high income to poor income (a 7.07 percentage point increase) and from

middle income to poor income (a 5.20 percentage point increase).

       With regard to health insurance and employment shocks, we also find some evidence that

losses of health insurance result in small percentage point increases in burden for two-parent
                                                                                                    15


families. However, we find no effect for single-parent families, and find no impact of

employment losses for either family type. Finally, we observe very small percentage point

declines in burden across time periods associated with the Great Recession, but no change in

burden over each time period compared to the pre-recession period.

       In columns 3 and 6, we translate these percentage point changes in out-of-pocket burden

into percent changes over the two-year observation period. To do so, we use base-year levels of

out-of-pocket burden for each of the rows to compute the percentage change (e.g., the mean out-

of-pocket burden for families with high income in the first year of the two-year panel). While the

percentage point changes reported above are small in terms of their absolute values, they

represent substantial percent increases in out-of-pocket burden over the respective baseline levels

of burden. For example, shifts from high-income to low-income, near-poor, and poor income

status result in percent increases in out-of-pocket burden well in excess of 100% for both single-

mother and two-parent families. We also find that shifts among other income categories yield

substantial percent increases in burden. Finally, the statistically significant increase in burden for

two-parent families experiencing a loss of insurance for all family members yields a 62.8%

increase in burden. By contrast, the relatively small percentage point decreases in burden for

time periods associated with the Great Recession also translate into comparatively small percent

decreases.

What's Driving the Change in Out-of-Pocket Burden?

       As noted in equation 3 above, the change in out-of-pocket spending burden will depend

upon changes in total health care spending as a share of income and in out-of-pocket health care

spending as a share of total health care spending. Using this insight, we estimated FRM models

for out-of-pocket spending as a percent of total spending (OOP/TE) and for total health care
                                                                                                   16


spending as a share of income (TE/Y). Estimates revealed no change in OOP/TE in response to

economic shocks (results available upon request). As discussed next, TE/Y did respond to

economic shocks for both family types. We display these results in Table 3.

        As the table reveals, income losses yield increases in TE/Y. For the substantial reductions

in income that we measure, the effects are especially strong (well over a 100% increase in

columns 3 and 4 for shifts from high income to low, near-poor and poor economic status), and

are found for both single and two-parent families. Shifts in income among lower-income strata

are generally considerably smaller in magnitude. Additionally, while we find no statistically

significant effects of an insurance loss on TE/Y for single-mother families, a loss of insurance

for all members or for some members in two-parent families yields statistically significant

increases in TE/Y (corresponding to a 40.6% increase and 30.7% increase respectively). Finally,

we find some evidence that for two-parent families, the second year of the pre-recession, onset,

and Great Recession periods yields very small declines in the share of health care spending as a

percent of family income.

        We also examined expenditure models for out-of-pocket and total health care spending to

assess whether these measures were sensitive to economic shocks and thus were prominent

contributors to the change in family out-of-pocket burden. Since nearly all families incurred

some out-of-pocket spending (100% of all single-parent families and 95% of two-parent

families), we estimate a generalized linear expenditure model (GLM) which takes the following

form:

                                    E[cit| xit, ait] =  = f(xit, ait)

Where E[cit| xit, ait] and  represent mean family expenditures for family i at time t conditional on

family characteristics xit, and economic shocks, ait. The GLM model employs a link function
                                                                                                    17


which relates the conditional mean E[cit/ xit, ait] to the vector of explanatory variables, and a

logarithmic link is typically used in expenditure studies to address the skewness of the health

spending distribution. The GLM model also requires specification of a variance function for the

conditional mean, and we applied the modified Park's test to select the variance function. We

further applied the Hosmer-Lemeshow test to assess the goodness of fit of the model. 8 On this

basis, our estimated expenditure models employ a Poisson variance function, and we use a

logarithmic link function as is commonly employed in expenditure estimation to address the

skewness of the total and out-of-pocket spending distributions. We further applied the CRE

framework to the expenditure models by including average values of the time-varying

explanatory variables, thereby obtaining estimates of the within-family change in health care

spending over our two-year observation period. Finally, we use STATA's margins command to

obtain average marginal effects: the change in predicted expenditures due to changes in our

economic shock variables.

       Results for both out-of-pocket spending and total spending outcomes revealed small and

generally statistically insignificant within-family changes in these outcomes in response to

changes in our income, employment, and health insurance measures (displayed in appendix

tables A and B). These findings, along with our lack of findings for out-of-pocket spending as a

share of total spending (OOP/TE noted above) and statistically significant increases in total

spending as a share of family income (TE/Y) reported in Table 3, suggest that over our short-run

observation period, families appear to absorb income shocks and maintain their out-of-pocket

  Park's test involves regressing the log of the squared residuals from a designated expenditure
function on the predicted values of expenditures. The Hosmer-Lemshow test involves regressing
the residuals from the expenditure model on the deciles of predicted expenditures. An
insignificant joint-F test of the coefficients indicates that the model fits the data well.

and total health care spending. As a result, the change in out-of-pocket burden in response to

economic shocks is largely driven by the decline in family income underlying such changes in

economic status rather than changes in out-of-pocket and total spending per se.

V. Summary and Conclusion

       In this paper, we have considered how the family's out-of-pocket health care spending

burden responds to economic shocks, specifically with regard to changes in the family's income,

health insurance, and employment status. Our study was motivated by consideration of how the

family's health security ­ in terms of its out-of-pocket spending responsibility in relationship to

its income ­ is affected by changes in its economic status. Our work departs from previous

analyses that have considered the magnitude of the family's out-of-pocket spending burden in a

static, point-in-time framework and do not differentiate burden estimates by family type. By

contrast, our study examines the within-family change in overall spending burden when the

family's economic status is compromised and provides estimates for both single-mother and two-

parent families. Our use of two-year observation periods from the Medical Expenditure Panel

Survey for the period 2004 to 2012 thus provides a more dynamic perspective on the family's

welfare as regards its out-of-pocket spending obligation.

       To examine the change in out-of-pocket spending burden, we decomposed this metric

into two components: the change in out-of-pocket spending as a share of total health care

spending and the change in total health care spending as a share of family income. We found no

response of the former measure to economic shocks, but found substantive responses of the latter

to income shocks for both single-mother and two-parent families. Additionally, as displayed in

Appendices A and B, we found little evidence that out-of-pocket or total health care spending

responds to economic shocks in either family type, inferring that the change in out-of-pocket
                                                                                                  19


burden is largely driven by the change in family income. Our findings thus reinforce the need for

measures that protect families from broad changes in their economic status, especially from those

driven by family income changes. Minimizing the consequences of large income shifts can help

to ensure that the increased share of income to support out-of-pocket health care spending does

not compromise the family's ability to obtain other essential goods and services.

       Finally, we note that our study has a specific limitation. Since we can only observe the

change in income and out-of-pocket spending burden over a two-year period, we cannot

determine whether the changes we observe and estimates obtained are likely to be transitory or

more permanent in nature. Additionally, sample size limitations preclude our identifying whether

families in particular economic and health-related circumstances are more likely to be subject to

economic shocks that substantially change their out-of-pocket burden. A more in-depth

understanding of these dimensions of changes in economic status may prove essential in devising

more efficient policy interventions that target families most likely to need financial support when

they experience an economic shock. Finally, our impact on burden is obtained using fairly large

changes in income based on multiples of the federal poverty line. As we note, these changes are

of a substantively important magnitude and thus very likely to elicit a change in health care

burdens in response to income shifts. However, in using such large income intervals, we may be

missing important income changes within each of the poverty line intervals. Thus, additional

work looking at alternative measures of income status would be useful in assessing whether

smaller changes have important implications for family health care burdens.

Model specifications include the following set of family characteristics: For single-mother
families, mother's age and education; mother's race/ethnicity; whether the mother is in fair/poor
health; whether the mother has a selected MEPS priority health condition (diabetes, asthma,
arthritis, chronic heart disease); the number of children in fair/poor health; number of children <
age 5; number of children ages 5­17; and the region in which the family resides. Characteristics
of two-parent families include mother's age and race/ethnicity; highest education obtained by a
parent; whether a mother or father is in fair/poor health; whether a mother or father has a
selected MEPS priority condition; the number of children in fair/poor health; number of children
< age 5; number of children ages 5­17; and the region in which the family resides. In both
specifications. Economic shocks are based upon changes over our two-year observation period in
family income categories defined as a percent of the federal poverty line; in parent's employment
status; and in family insurance status. We use differences in predicted average marginal effects
between income categories, family insurance status and family employment status to
assess the impact of a realized income shock. Dummy variables associated with the Great
Recessionindicate whether the family is observed in the first or second year of the pre-recession
period (PRE1 or PRE2), onset of the recession (ONSET1 or ONSET2), recession (REC1 or
REC2), or post-recession period (POST1 or POST2). Differences in the estimated marginal
                                                                                                 26


effects for these dummy variables are used to assess the change in outcomes of interest between
the first and second year of each time period.

Baseline (first year) measures of out-of-pocket burden (mean total family out-of-pocket health
care spending as a percent of family income): For single-mother families: high income (2.26);
middle income (2.76); low income (3.19); near poor (3.02); poor income (5.52). In the first year
of the pre-recession period (24.3%); first year of the onset period (23.3%); first year of the
recessionary period (27.5%); first year of the post-recession period (23.2%); In the first year for
all family members insured ( 3.7%); some but not all family members insured (4.1%); mother
employed all year (2.3%). For two-parent families: high income (1.59); middle income (2.63);
low income (3.20); near poor (2.86); poor income (5.23). In the first year of the pre-recession
period (26.7%); first year of the onset period (23.7%); first year of the recessionary period
(26.4%); first year of the post-recession period (23.2%). In the first year for all family members
insured (2.5%); some but not all family members insured (2.9%); parents employed all year
(2.6%).
