We explore the rise and fall of pellagra, a disease caused by inadequate niacin consumption, in
the American South, focusing on the first half of the twentieth century. We first consider the
hypothesis that the South’s monoculture in cotton undermined nutrition by displacing local food
production. Consistent with this hypothesis, a difference-in-differences estimation shows that
after the arrival of the boll weevil, food production in affected counties rose while cotton
production and pellagra rates fell. The results also suggest that after 1937 improved medical
understanding and state fortification laws helped eliminate pellagra.

1. Introduction

        The by-product of insufficient niacin consumption, pellagra is a nutrition-related disease

characterized by dermatitis, aggression, diarrhea, dementia, and in extreme and untreated cases,

death. During the early 1900s, pellagra deaths were recorded in every state in the US, but the

disease was much more pronounced in the South. At the disease’s peak in 1928, there were

approximately 230,000 cases of pellagra in the American South (equal to the population of

Atlanta at the time) and more than 7,000 deaths annually (Bollet 1992). In some southern states,

it was the ninth or tenth leading cause of death, and had a death rate comparable to malaria. 1

Early observers believed pellagra was contagious and unrelated to nutrition. It was only during

the late 1930s that scientists established that the disease was caused by a niacin deficiency. Soon

after this discovery, states throughout the country began passing laws mandating the enrichment

of bread, flour, and corn products with niacin. Today the disease is largely unknown in the

United States, except among homeless populations and others in extreme deprivation.

        In this paper, we examine the rise and fall of pellagra in the American South. We begin

our analysis by exploring the long-standing claim that pellagra stemmed from the South’s cotton

monoculture. In particular, widespread cotton production is thought to have displaced local

production of niacin-rich foods and driven poor southern farmers and mill workers to consume

milled midwestern corn, which was relatively cheap but also devoid of the niacin necessary to

prevent pellagra. Previous work has sought to document the connection between cotton

production and pellagra by using simple time series and cross sectional comparisons. These

correlations show that when and where cotton production was high so too was the pellagra rate

(Park et al. 2000, Goldberger et al. 1920, Rajakumar 2000). However, ascribing causality to the

1
 Data from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (Dublin 1919, pp. 255, 259) suggest the average annual
mortality rate from pellagra in southern districts was 4.3 deaths per 100,000, while the average annual morality from
malaria over the same period was identical (4.3).


                                                                                                                   3
positive correlation between cotton production and pellagra is problematic. For example, it might

conflate changes in income with changes in food availability: perhaps years of high cotton

production were also years of low income, and it was the reduction in income, not the reduction

in local food production, that drove the increase in pellagra. 2

        To test for a causal link between cotton production and pellagra, we follow previous

research and treat the arrival of the boll weevil in the cotton belt during the early 1900s as an

exogenous shock that disrupted cotton production. Using a difference-in-differences estimating

strategy and county-level data from North Carolina and South Carolina, we regress pellagra

mortality against an indicator variable for boll weevil infestation interacted with pre-boll weevil

measures of cotton production or pellagra.

        Our results show that counties with high levels of either cotton production or pellagra

experienced relatively large reductions in pellagra mortality following the arrival of the boll

weevil. These results are robust to potential confounding factors such as malaria, urbanization,

interpolation of inter-census population estimates, and changes in overall mortality. In addition,

we run a series of placebo tests on death rates from other diseases and find no evidence that they

fell in response to the boll weevil. These results suggest that the reductions in pellagra that

followed the arrival of the boll weevil were not caused by improvements in the overall disease

environment. Finally, we do not find evidence that the groups most likely afflicted with pellagra

(e.g., women and children) migrated out of cotton producing counties (post-boll weevil) at higher

rates than less vulnerable groups.

        As further evidence, we also establish a mechanism linking the arrival of the boll weevil

with reductions in pellagra. In particular, we show that the arrival of the boll weevil in cotton-

2
 Such concerns are only heightened by the long-standing claim that cotton over-production left farmers much
poorer than they otherwise would have been. See, generally, DeCanio (1973), Wright and Kunreuther (1975),
McGuire and Higgs (1977), Wright and Kunreuther (1977), and McGuire (1980).


                                                                                                         4
producing counties prompted farmers to diversify their crop mix by planting niacin-rich foods.

This, in turn, would have increased the availability of niacin to nearby populations.

        Having explored cotton’s role in the rise of pellagra, we then turn to an analysis of the

forces that helped bring an end to the disease in the American South. Pellagra rates dropped

sharply during the 1930s and 1940s. This drop happened shortly after the discovery that pellagra

was caused by niacin deficiency in 1937 and continued after the passage of state laws in the

1940s mandating that breads and grains be enriched with niacin. Historical observers have long

hypothesized a causal connection between these events and concurrent reductions in pellagra. To

test this claim, we use county data from North Carolina and South Carolina and a difference-in-

differences estimation approach. The results suggest that improved medical understanding and

state fortification laws significantly reduced pellagra related mortality.

        Taken together, our results contribute to four literatures. First, the observation that

malnutrition can emerge in poor agricultural societies that rely heavily on cash crops is not

unique to the American South; development economists and colonial historians offer similar

arguments for other parts of the world (e.g., National Academy of Sciences 1978, p. 44; and

Bhatia 1963). Second, the American South has long lagged behind the North in economic

performance. While southern states exhibited productivity growth between 1900 and 1920, it

was only later in the century that incomes converged with those in the North (Mitchener and

McLean 2003; Wright 1987). Common explanations for these patterns fall into one of three

categories: institutional, technological, and disease-related. 3 The results here reinforce the idea




3
 Institutional explanations consider national labor standards (Wright 1987); Civil Rights legislation (Wright 2013,
Collins 2003); and the decline of paternalism and other institutions hostile to black economic progress (Alston and
Ferrie 1993, 1999). Technological explanations focus on air-conditioning (Biddle 2008, 2011), electrification
(Downs 2014), and the mechanization of agriculture (Alston and Ferrie 1993, 1999). Disease-based explanations
consider the eradication of hookworm and malaria (Bleakley 2007, 2010; Kitchens 2013).


                                                                                                                 5
that the South’s disease environment – particularly as it relates to nutrition-related diseases – is

important to understanding the long-term economic evolution of the region.

       Third, the literature that explores nutritional shocks primarily achieves identification by

focusing on shocks that adversely affect both nutrition and income (Lumey et al. 2011). The

results here complement and extend this literature. Of particular interest is our use of the boll

weevil, which breaks the usual correlation between nutrition and income. Most shocks that

reduce nutrition also reduce income, and it is difficult to disentangle the two effects as they are

mutually reinforcing. The boll weevil, however, induced farmers to abandon a profitable crop

(cotton) for less profitable crops (local food). As explained below, the shift to less profitable

crops was often associated with expansions in local food supplies, which helped to improve

nutrition despite the reductions in income that came with producing less profitable crops.

       Finally, over the past decade, there has been revived interest in the role of the boll weevil

in southern economic history. Fabian Lange et al. (2009) show that in anticipation of the arrival

of the boll weevil, cotton farmers in the South increased production but once the pest arrived

shifted to the production of other crops. Deirdre Bloome et al. (2017) explore how the boll

weevil interacted with tenancy to shape marriage patterns. Their results indicate that with the

arrival of the boll weevil, tenancy fell as did the frequency of marriages at early ages among

African Americans. This reversed an early pattern of rising tenancy and marriage rates among

young African Americans. Philipp Ager et al. (2017) also find evidence that the boll weevil

reduced the number of tenant farms, wages in agriculture, and female labor force participation in

cotton producing counties. On a more positive note, Richard Baker (2015) shows how the arrival

of the boll weevil promoted convergence in black and white school enrollment rates, as demand

for child labor in cotton related tasks fell. Our results complement these findings.

2. Historical Background

       Pellagra caused thousands of deaths in the South during the first half of the twentieth

century. Pellagra is characterized by “the four D’s”: dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia, and death.

Conrad Elvehjem showed definitively that pellagra was caused by inadequate niacin

consumption in 1937 (Elvehjem et al. 1937). Prior to that, physicians and public health workers

had a range of theories, most of which focused on pellagra being a disease of unclear origin

(Mooney et al. 2014, Siler et al. 1914, 1915). The dermatitis and skin discoloration associated

with severe cases of pellagra facilitated a proper diagnosis.

       For many, pellagra was a seasonal affliction, emerging in late spring and early summer,

which is itself suggestive that access to local food supplies might matter in the propagation of the

disease. In healthy populations, pellagra took about six months to develop (Goldberger et al.

1915, 1923). In cases where diets were supplemented, pellagra tended to go away within a few

months. The relationship between duration of pellagra and death is not clear. Because of the

distinctive symptoms of the disease in severe cases, death rates for pellagra are probably well

estimated (assuming all deaths are recorded systematically).

       Pellagra was much more prevalent in the South than in other parts of the United States.

Figure 1 shows state pellagra death rates in 1920 and in 1935. Unfortunately, southern states

were not part of the United States death registration system until the mid-1910s, so the numbers

of deaths during early twentieth century are not precisely known. What we do know is that by

1907 pellagra deaths were reported in Journal of the American Medical Association articles and

by 1911 the Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service expressed concerns regarding the

growing prevalence of pellagra, particularly in the American South (Bollet 1992).




                                                                                                  7
          Why was pellagra more prevalent in the South? The diet for poor whites and blacks in the

South consisted primarily of salt pork, molasses, and corn – foods with very little niacin. Table 1

documents the importance of corn in southern diets. This table is based on the Study of

Consumer Purchases in the United States, 1935-1936, which collected data on food purchases

from a large sample of households including southern households in both urban and rural areas.

The table demonstrates that compared to non-southerners, southerners were eating more corn

meal, more salt pork, less bread, fewer potatoes, fewer eggs, and less meat, and they were

drinking less milk. In comparison to corn, wheat and potatoes have about twice as much niacin

per gram (Krehl et al. 1946). Salt pork was low in niacin, relative to other types of meat. Eggs

and milk have tryptophan, which can be converted to niacin in the body.

          In addition to varying regionally, the number of pellagra deaths varied over time. The

time series variation is clear in Figure 2, which plots pellagra deaths and cotton production in

North Carolina and South Carolina over time. These data suggest that pellagra was widespread in

North Carolina and South Carolina in the mid-1910s. The boll weevil first arrived in a county in

South Carolina in 1917, had reached 40 percent of counties in North Carolina and South Carolina

by 1920, and reached the final counties in 1922. The growth in pellagra stops during the late

1910s at around the same time that the cotton economy stagnates with the spread of the boll

weevil.

          One of the central themes of the extant literature on pellagra is that the disease stemmed

directly from the South’s cotton monoculture. Cotton production crowded out local food

production, leading to the importation of less healthful food. In his study of South Carolina,

Walter Edgar (1992) argues that a high debt burden forced many farmers to plant cotton, a cash

crop with higher expected returns than other crops. Despite the population of South Carolina




                                                                                                  8
tripling from 1850 to 1935, the amount of food production remained about the same. As a result,

South Carolina “had to import $70-$100 million worth of food annually. For poverty-stricken

tenant farmers with little ready cash, this meant that there was less to eat. The consequent

increased dependence on a diet of pork, cornbread, and molasses made poor Carolinians more

susceptible to disease” (Edgar 1992, p. 47).

       The importation of food into the South would tend to increase pellagra if the food being

imported had lower levels of niacin than locally grown food. Indeed, historical observers often

attribute the increase in pellagra to changes in the milling of midwestern corn (e.g., Park et al.

2000, Goldberger et al. 1920, Rajakumar 2000). Previous milling technology had removed less

of the germ, retaining some niacin. The Beall degerminator, which was patented in 1900 and

1901, removed the germ. This led to a finer cornmeal with a longer shelf life, but with much less

niacin and other micronutrients. Expansion of large-scale milling and movement of goods by

railroad meant that this corn reached the South in increasing quantities. Alfred Bollet (1992, p.

219) notes that “in the textile mill towns, surrounded by cotton fields, food was shipped in by

railroad, and the cornmeal that could be purchased in the company stores was processed in the

Midwest, where it had been degerminated.” In addition, a survey conducted by the Thompson-

McFadden Pellagra Commission of residents in six mill towns in South Carolina revealed that

almost 60 percent of residents consumed shipped cornmeal on a daily basis and only 10 percent

of residents never consumed shipped cornmeal. In contrast, 12 percent of residents consumed

locally produced cornmeal on a daily basis, and 80 percent of residents never consumed locally

produced cornmeal (Siler 1915, pp. 21, 34).

       Also relevant for our empirical analysis below, Lange et al. (2009) present evidence that

the boll weevil reduced cotton production and increased local food production. The boll weevil, a




                                                                                                9
beetle that feeds on cotton leaves, squares (flower buds), and bolls, appeared in Texas in 1892. It

then progressed north and east through the cotton belt. By 1922, the boll weevil had spread

throughout the entire cotton region. The arrival of the weevil had a large effect on agriculture. In

their analysis of the boll weevil on the South, Lange et al. (2009) write (p. 710): “Overall, the

corn results indicate a greater movement to alternative crops than suggested in the literature,

which has downplayed the boll weevil’s effects on diversification.” In a footnote, they add (p.

710): “Based on the census data, we also find production of hay, Irish potatoes, peanuts, rice, and

sweet potatoes; sugar cane, among other crops, showed statistically significant increases after the

arrival of the weevil.” We further examine the effect of the boll weevil on food production in

North Carolina and South Carolina below.

          Increased production of southern corn and other crops following the arrival of the boll

weevil was likely to increase niacin consumption. For corn, this could occur through increased

consumption of fresh corn, the crowding out of midwestern cornmeal, or both. Southerners

tended to plant and harvest sweet corn, which contained relatively high levels of niacin, while

the corn varieties grown in the Midwest contained 30 to 50 percent less niacin than sweet corn

(Burkholder et al. 1944; Ayer 1895, p. 12-13). Southerners made “stone ground” corn meal,

which was neither kiln dried nor degerminated, and so preserved the niacin. Locally sourced corn

could also be used to make hominy grits. If prepared correctly (in a lime/alkali solution), hominy

grits contained more niacin than ordinary corn, cornmeal, or corn bread. Peanuts and sweet

potatoes are high in niacin, so increased production and consumption would also affect niacin

intake.

          Figure 2 shows that pellagra rebounded during the late 1920s, shortly after the effects of

the boll weevil began to recede and the cotton economy recovered. Pellagra plummeted again




                                                                                                 10
during the late 1920s and early 1930s, with the onset of the Great Depression and a sharp decline

in cotton-acres harvested. It is only after the discovery of niacin in 1937, marked by the dashed-

vertical line in the graphs, and the passage of laws mandating the fortification of grains and

breads with niacin, that the correlation between cotton production and pellagra seems to break

down.

        In 1936 and 1937 Conrad Elvehjem and his collaborators were conducting experiments

with rats and dogs that would lead to the discovery that niacin cured black tongue in dogs. Black

tongue in dogs had long been recognized as being related to pellagra in humans. He published

their results in September 1937 in a letter to the editor of the Journal of the American Chemical

Society. The implications of these animal experiments for treatment of pellagra in humans were

clear. In 1938, some bakers began voluntarily fortifying their bread with high vitamin yeast. The

direct effects of voluntary fortification on the South are unclear because bread was not consumed

in large quantities and was often made at home (Park et al. 2000, 2001).

        Thus, by 1937, the medical profession knew that increased consumption of niacin rich

foods could be used to address pellagra. Before this, doctors adopted ineffective treatment

strategies. For example, a review of articles on PubMedCentral published between 1910 and

1937 suggests that during the 1910s, doctors in the American South focused treatment on

chemical interventions, particularly Salvarsan, which had been used to treat syphilis.

        In 1939, the Council on Foods and Nutrition of the American Medical Association

encouraged “with some qualification, fortification of certain staple foods with vitamins and

minerals, specifically the restorative additions of thiamine, niacin, riboflavin, iron, and calcium

to white flour and white bread” (Wilder 1956, p. 1540). The committee had previously approved

adding vitamin D to milk and iodine to salt. In 1941 the FDA established standards for the




                                                                                                11
fortification of bread. In 1943 War Food Order No. 1 stated that all bread sold in interstate

commerce had to meet FDA standards. Fortification of flour was not required and regulation was

left to the states. The law was officially repealed in 1946 (Niemesh 2015).

       Over the period 1942-1949, 28 states passed some type of mandatory fortification law.

For example, South Carolina passed a law in 1942 covering bread and flour and it was extended

in 1943 to cover corn meal and corn grits. North Carolina passed a law in 1945 that covered

bread, flour, corn meal and corn grits. (States that passed laws pertaining to cornmeal and

hominy grits were: Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas.)

Spurred by this, major producers of cornmeal and grits in the Midwest began fortifying their

products.   A 1957 survey found that nearly all hominy grits sold were enriched, and that

cornmeal was generally enriched, except in Florida and Virginia, where enrichment was less

typical (Park et al. 2001, National Research Council 1958).

       These discoveries and laws were reflected in reduced pellagra. In particular, pellagra

rates dropped sharply and permanently shortly after the discovery that pellagra was caused by

niacin deficiency in 1937. The decline continued after the passage of states laws in the 1940s

mandating that breads and grains be enriched with niacin. By the 1950s, the disease was largely

eliminated from the United States.



3. A Simple Economic Framework

       In this section, we sketch out a simple economic framework that can explain how the

South’s reliance on cotton might have promoted higher pellagra rates in particular, and poor

nutrition more generally construed. One of the central messages of this framework is that cash

cropping does not necessarily result in poor nutrition; it only does so under certain conditions.




                                                                                                    12
        Consider a largely agricultural economy, where farmers decide how to allocate their land,

labor, and capital. They can either plant, harvest, and sell a cash crop in an international market

(in this case, cotton), or they can deploy their resources to produce food for the local market. In

deciding how to allocate resources, farmers look toward expected prices. 4 To the extent expected

cotton prices are relatively high, farmers would allocate their land and resources to planting and

selling cotton and produce little food for the local market. This would decrease the supply of

locally produced foods, driving up the relative price. Consumers, in turn, would then substitute

away from local foods and begin importing food produced elsewhere.                           In the case here,

consumers turned to degerminated corn from the Midwest, which as noted above, had low niacin

content.

        As an empirical matter, we cannot observe the expected price of cotton or the price of

locally produced foods. However, we can observe acres dedicated to cotton and food production,

which is perhaps an even better indicator of farmers’ beliefs about the expected relative

profitability of food and cotton. In addition, we also exploit a setting where expected prices did

not drive planting decisions: the arrival of the boll weevil, which induced farmers to shift away

from cotton and diversify crops.

        For the process above to generate high rates of pellagra, two conditions would need to be

satisfied. First, it must be the case that there are, in fact, nutritional differences between imported

corn and locally-sourced foods. Although we cannot directly test this proposition, there is

anecdotal evidence to suggest this was the case. In the case of corn, as explained in the previous

section, locally-produced southern corn was not degerminated, and so it is thought to have been

healthier and richer in niacin. There is also evidence (discussed below) that aside from corn,

4
 Risk might also enter such considerations, but in the case of the American South, cotton not only exhibited higher
average profitability; it also had lower variance and was a relatively low risk crop. See McGuire and Higgs (1977)
and McGuire (1980).


                                                                                                                13
southern farmers would switch to growing peanuts and sweet potatoes when cotton prices were

low or when cotton production was not feasible. Peanuts and sweet potatoes are both rich in

niacin and other micronutrients. Second, it must be the case that the price effect dominates any

income effect. 5 More precisely, if demand for nutrition grows with income and higher cotton

prices, it is possible that consumers in the region might begin importing relatively expensive

niacin-rich foods, rather than degerminated corn. Having said this, nutritionally rich foods in

general, and foods that were high in niacin, in particular, were poorly understood during our

study period. Put another way, if cash cropping generates sufficiently high wages and income,

and nutrition is a normal good, cash cropping need not imply poor nutrition.



4. Data

        County-level crop production data are from the 1909, 1919, 1924, and 1929 Censuses of

Agriculture. These data are compiled in Michael Haines et al. (2015) United States Agriculture

Data, 1840-2010. We use data on cotton, corn, peanut, sweet potato, and tobacco acreage and

acreage per capita.

        We use data on county and state population, the year the boll weevil arrived in a county,

and the dates that states passed fortification laws. Population data are from the 1900 to 1950

Censuses of Population. We linearly interpolate county and state populations between decennial

censuses. Data on the first year the boll weevil arrived in a county are taken from Lange et al.

  This point is relevant to our boll weevil identification strategy. The arrival of the boll weevil had two
countervailing effects. First, it caused farmers to shift away from cotton toward food production, lowering the price
of locally-sourced (high-niacin) foods. This would have helped lower pellagra rates. Second, the arrival of the boll
weevil also reduced the income of southern farmers. This second channel, would have worked against the price
channel and put upward pressure on pellagra rates. For the arrival of the boll weevil to have reduced pellagra, the
first channel must have dominated the second channel.


                                                                                                                  14
(2009), which originally came from USDA boll weevil maps. 6 The year of state fortification law

passage was taken from Youngmee Park et al. (2001).

        We collected data on pellagra mortality at the county-level for North Carolina from 1915-

1949 and for South Carolina for 1916-1949. North Carolina and South Carolina are the only

states, to our knowledge, that consistently reported pellagra deaths at the county level during this

entire time period (1915-1949). Pellagra deaths for counties in North Carolina come from The

Annual Report of the Bureau of Vital Statistics of the North Carolina State Board of Health.7

The North Carolina State Board of Health did not issue a vital statistics report for the years 1918

and 1919; accordingly we do not have data on pellagra deaths for those years. Pellagra deaths for

counties in South Carolina from 1916-1949 come from the Annual Report of the State Board of

Health of South Carolina.

        To supplement the analysis of pellagra in North Carolina from 1915 to 1925, we

collected county-level deaths for the following diseases: malaria, measles, pneumonia, typhoid,

and tuberculosis. Comparable data are not available for South Carolina. 8

        Table 2 presents summary statistics for three types of counties. We define high cotton

counties as counties in the top 25 percent of the distribution of cotton acres per capita in North

Carolina and South Carolina in 1909, which is prior to the arrival of the boll weevil. All of these

counties received the boll weevil. Low cotton producing counties include all counties that

received the boll weevil, but were not classified as high cotton producing counties. Finally, 22

  We reviewed the original USDA boll weevil map published in Hunter and Coad (1923) and found a few
discrepancies between the map and the coding of the boll weevil arrival in Lange et al. (2009). The map shows that
the boll weevil arrived in Cherokee County, South Carolina in 1920, but it is coded as 1921 in Lange et al. (2009).
The map shows the boll weevil arriving in Iredell County and Wake County, North Carolina in 1921, but it is coded
in Lange et al. (2009) as 1922. We changed the coding in these cases to align with the original map.
7
  In 1920 and 1921 these reports are found in The Health Bulletin published by the North Carolina State Board of
Health.

  Ideally, we would have collected these data for South Carolina, but the death rates for these diseases are missing
for much of our study period. Typhoid fever deaths are not consistently reported in South Carolina until 1919;
pneumonia and measles deaths are not consistently reported until 1934.


                                                                                                                 15
counties did not receive the boll weevil. For ease of exposition unless there is a risk of confusion,

we will refer to these counties as high cotton, low cotton, and no cotton counties. When

compared to low cotton or no cotton counties, high cotton counties had higher cotton acres in

1909, higher numbers of pellagra deaths in 1916, larger populations in 1910, higher cotton per

capita in 1909, and higher pellagra death rates in 1916.



5. Cotton, The Boll Weevil, And Pellagra

         Lange et al. (2009), Baker (2015), Bloome et al. (2017), and Ager et al. (2017) all use the

boll weevil as an exogenous change to examine a range of outcomes. These authors argue that it

is reasonable to treat the timing of the boll weevil as exogenous because there was little farmers

and local officials could do to prevent the boll weevil from invading their county. 9 Following the

lead of these previous studies, we use the arrival of the boll weevil to test the long-standing

hypothesis that pellagra stemmed, in part, from the South’s monoculture in cotton.

         Our empirical work on the boll weevil proceeds in three steps. We first focus on how

disease rates responded to the arrival of the boll weevil, and show that the boll weevil was

associated with reductions in pellagra. We then implement a series of econometric tests to see if

our findings are robust to the following: additional controls for changes in overall mortality;

dropping the years of the Great Influenza Pandemic; dropping counties with border changes; an

explicit control for population; and placebo tests involving diseases other than pellagra. In the

online appendix, we further explore the robustness of our results, giving particular attention to

the possibility of selective migration, our measure of cotton intensity, and interpolation. The

third and final part of our empirical analysis here focuses on the mechanisms linking pellagra

 Farmers tried burning crops and applying calcium arsenate to deter boll weevil infestation, but these were not
widely adopted. See Lange et al. (2009) for a full discussion of mitigation techniques.


                                                                                                                  16
and the boll weevil. We do this by analyzing how the boll weevil altered planting choices and

prompted farmers to harvest food crops instead of cotton.

        Figure 3 motivates the first part of our empirical analysis. Panel A (B) plots pellagra

deaths (death rates) against cotton production for counties in South Carolina and North Carolina

from 1915 to 1925. The vertical lines indicate key dates regarding the arrival of the boll weevil.

From both panels, it is clear that following the arrival of the boll weevil, pellagra deaths and

pellagra death rates were declining everywhere, but they fell more in cotton producing counties

than in non-cotton counties (that were not invaded by the boll weevil).

        To study the relationship between the boll weevil shock and pellagra, we estimate the

following equation:

          𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙[𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝]𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐                                                                                                   (1)

                                   = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝜃𝜃1 [𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤]𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜃𝜃2 [𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤]𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 × [𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖]𝑐𝑐

                                   + 𝜃𝜃𝑐𝑐 + 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐


In equation (1), 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙[𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝]𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is the log of pellagra deaths or the log of the pellagra death rate

in county c in year t. [𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤]𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is an indicator variable that takes a value of one after the

boll weevil has arrived in a county. We interact the boll weevil indicator with a measure of

intensity of treatment [𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖]𝑐𝑐 . We adopt two measures of intensity. First,

[ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡]𝑐𝑐,1909 is an indicator variable if county c was in the top 25 percent of the

distribution of cotton acres per capita in North Carolina and South Carolina in 1909. Second

[ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝]𝑐𝑐,1915 is an indicator if a county was in the top 25 percent of the distribution of

pellagra death rates in North Carolina and South Carolina in 1915 and 1916. Finally, we include

county fixed effects to control for unobserved time invariant county characteristics and year




                                                                                                                                             17
fixed effects to control for any unobserved shocks in a particular year that are common across the

sample.

        In some specifications, we control for the malaria death rate in 1915 and the urbanization

rate in 1910. According to Hoyt Bleakley (2010), the malaria intervention in the American South

occurs almost concurrently with the arrival of the boll weevil in North Carolina and South

Carolina. Accordingly, we control for the county-level malaria death rate in 1915, just prior to

the arrival of the boll weevil, interacted with year fixed effects. We also control for the percent

of the county population living in an urban area during the 1910 census interacted with year.

This controls for urban-rural differences in access to food.

        For the analysis of pellagra deaths and death rates, we again use the sample period 1915-

1925, restricting the sample to counties that existed in 1910. This provides us with pellagra death

data for 98 counties in North Carolina and 43 counties in South Carolina over this time period,

giving us a sample of 141 counties and 1,353 observations. 10

        Our analysis presents results for both pellagra deaths and the pellagra death rate. We

present results for both deaths and the death rate for the following reason. The pellagra death rate

calculation is based on population numbers that are linearly interpolated between census years.

As a result, the calculated death rate will be based on population estimates that are too low prior

to the boll weevil and too high following the boll weevil in counties where the boll weevil causes

a decrease in population. In counties that see an increase in population after the arrival of the boll

weevil, the interpolated population will too high prior to the boll weevil and too low following


10
  Because we do not have data on pellagra deaths in North Carolina for 1918 and 1919, we have only 882
observations for North Carolina (98 counties in 9 years). Additionally, we are missing data for Calhoun County and
Laurens County South Carolina in the year 1915 meaning that we have 471 observations for South Carolina (43
counties in 11 years). We do not include the following counties in our analysis because they were founded after
1910: Avery County, North Carolina (founded in 1911); Hoke County, North Carolina (founded in 1911); Allendale
County, South Carolina (founded in 1919); Jasper County, South Carolina (founded in 1912); McCormick County,
South Carolina (founded in 1916).


                                                                                                               18
its arrival. Although neither deaths nor the death rate is a perfect measure, using both measures

can help us assess the robustness of our results to concerns about interpolation.

         Table 3 shows the effect of the boll weevil on pellagra deaths and pellagra death rates in

North Carolina and South Carolina. In columns 1-3, pellagra deaths fell statistically significantly

following the arrival of the boll weevil and fell statistically significantly more in counties with

high pre-boll weevil pellagra death rates (column 2) and in high cotton counties (column 3).

Pellagra fell 40 percent more in counties with high pre-boll weevil pellagra death rates than in

counties with low pre-boll weevil pellagra death rates. 11 Pellagra fell 23 percent more in high

cotton counties than in low cotton counties. Column 4 adds controls for malaria and urbanization,

each interacted with year fixed effects. Pellagra fell 31 percent more in high cotton counties than

in low cotton counties. The patterns in columns 5-8 for pellagra death rates are similar in sign

and significance, although the magnitudes of the interaction terms are smaller. This is because

the rates adjust for the declines in population, which the counts do not.

         Table 4 examines the robustness of the results in Table 3 to three sets of concerns: the

influenza pandemic (1918-19); changing county borders; and the aforementioned interpolation

concern. For comparison, column 1 restates the results for pellagra deaths from Table 3 column 4.

Column 2 drops 1918 and 1919 for South Carolina, since we do not observe data in North

Carolina in those years. Column 3 drops counties that change borders. Column 4 uses a different

method of adjusting for population for counties that receive the boll weevil during that decade.

This is done to address concerns that interpolated population measures for inter-census years

could be overestimated in the face of boll-weevil induced outmigration. Hence, instead of

interpolating population, population is assumed to be constant from the census year to the year

11
  When the dependent variable is log(pellagra deaths) we interpret the coefficients in the text as percentage changes
using the formula 𝑒𝑒 𝛽𝛽 − 1, where 𝛽𝛽 is the coefficient being interpreted. This explains the difference between the
coefficients that are reported in the table and our interpretation of them in the text.


                                                                                                                  19
prior to the arrival of the boll weevil, and then drops or increases to its value in the next census

year after the boll weevil arrives. We are, therefore, assuming that population changes, which

might occur due the arrival of the boll weevil, happen in the year the boll weevil arrives.

Columns 5-8 repeat the analysis for pellagra death rates.

        In the Online Appendix (Table A.3), we further explore the robustness of our baseline

model. In particular, we obtain similar (though weaker) results if we use cotton acres as a share

of total acres as our intensity of treatment measure. We also consider different controls and

measures of mortality, showing that we obtain the same results if we control for the overall death

rate or use the ratio of pellagra deaths to total deaths as our dependent variable. Finally, we

interpolate pellagra deaths for 1918 and 1919 for North Carolina and show that our central

results remain.

        In Table 5 we use data from North Carolina to examine the effect of the boll weevil on

diseases that are not caused by nutritional deficiencies. 12 All columns control for the county-

level malaria death rate in 1915 interacted with year fixed effects and the percent of the county

population living in an urban area during the 1910 census interacted with year fixed effects.

Column (1) displays the baseline effect of the boll weevil on pellagra in North Carolina. The

arrival of the boll weevil is associated with a 22 percent decrease in pellagra deaths. Columns

(2)-(6) examine the effect of the arrival of the boll weevil on typhoid fever, tuberculosis, measles,

pneumonia, and overall deaths (minus pellagra deaths), respectively. The boll weevil is

associated with a small but statistically significant increase in overall deaths (minus pellagra

deaths) of 5 percent. Columns (7)-(12) examine the effect of the arrival of the boll weevil on

   It is possible that improved nutrition might improve immunity leading to long-run gains in overall health.
However, we believe that the short-run effects of improved nutrition would be most evident in nutritional diseases,
like pellagra, not non-nutritional diseases.


                                                                                                                20
death rates of different disease. The boll weevil is not associated with significant decreases in the

death rate of any of the non-nutrition related diseases or the overall death rate.

        One concern surrounding our analysis is the possibility that the groups most affected by

pellagra migrated out of high cotton producing counties at a higher rate than the rest of the

population. To address this issue, we looked for evidence of differential migration among

affected groups. We used the 1910, 1920, and 1930 complete count census data to count the

population of groups most affected by pellagra: children age 2-10 and females age 22-44. We

then generated two population counts for each county-year cell in North Carolina and South

Carolina, the count for the affected group and the count of the rest of the population. We

regressed these counts on year fixed effects, county fixed effects, and a post boll weevil indicator

interacted with cotton (or pellagra) intensity and interacted with an indicator if the count was for

the affected group.

        The results of these “triple difference” regressions are displayed in Online Appendix

table A4, columns (2)-(5). The coefficient on the triple interaction is never significant and is

close to zero in all specifications. Therefore, there is no evidence that children age 2-10 or

females age 22-44 are migrating out of high cotton producing counties at a higher rate than the

rest of the population after the arrival of the boll weevil.

        Online Appendix table A4, column (1) also provides what might be a more direct test of

whether groups most affected by pellagra migrate at a higher rate after the arrival of the boll

weevil. In this specification we regress the population of a county in NC or SC on year fixed

effects, county fixed effects, and a post boll weevil indicator interacted with cotton intensity and

pellagra intensity. Again, the coefficient on the triple interaction term is not significant, meaning

that counties with high cotton production and high pellagra did not experience differentially high




                                                                                                  21
outmigration after the arrival of the boll weevil.                              These patterns suggest the groups most

vulnerable to pellagra did not migrate out of high cotton/high pellagra counties at elevated rates.



6. The Boll Weevil and Local Food Production

       We next turn to the effect of the boll weevil on crop acreage and crop acreage per capita

in North Carolina and South Carolina. We adopt a specification similar to Lange et al. (2009):

         𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙[𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜]𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐                                                                                    (2)

                                = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝜃𝜃1 [𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑙𝑙]𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜃𝜃2 [𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤]𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐

                                × [𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝]𝑐𝑐,1909 + 𝜃𝜃3 𝑡𝑡𝑆𝑆𝑐𝑐 + 𝜃𝜃4 𝑡𝑡 2 𝑆𝑆𝑐𝑐 + 𝜃𝜃𝑐𝑐 + 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐


This specification is similar to equation (1), but the outcome is the log of acres dedicated to

cotton, corn, peanuts, sweet potatoes, or tobacco or the acres per capita dedicated to these crops.

In addition, we include a quadratic time trend, 𝑡𝑡 and 𝑡𝑡 2 , interacted with the share of cotton in

total acres harvested in 1909, 𝑆𝑆𝑐𝑐 . We restrict the sample to counties that existed in 1909. This

restriction leaves us with 141 counties. Standard errors are clustered at the county level.

       Table 6 displays the estimates from equation (2) for the agricultural censuses between

1909 and 1929. Cotton yields and cotton acres per capita fell more in high cotton counties after

the boll weevil arrived. In addition, corn acres per capita, peanut acres, and sweet potato acres

per capita, all saw significant increases in high cotton counties after the boll weevil. Notably,

corn acres per capita increased 7.5 percent in high cotton counties relative to low cotton counties.

Our results for North Carolina and South Carolina show evidence that acres and acres per capita

devoted to food production increased after the boll weevil and are similar to the Lange et al.

(2009) results for the South more broadly. These results suggest a mechanism (i.e., increased




                                                                                                                                    22
availability of nutritionally-rich, locally-sourced foods) through which the arrival of the boll

weevil might have promoted better nutrition, particularly in relation to niacin and pellagra.



7. Niacin and the Fall of Pellagra

         To motivate our analysis of the decline of pellagra, Figure 4 plots pellagra deaths and

death rates in South Carolina and North Carolina. The figure compares cotton producing counties

and non-cotton producing counties from 1934 to 1949. Following the discovery of niacin as a

cure of pellagra in 1937 (marked by the dashed lines in Figure 4), pellagra deaths and pellagra

death rates fall overall and fall more in cotton producing counties.

         To describe the effect that the discovery of niacin had on pellagra we estimate a variant

of equation (1) where [𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤]𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is replaced with a dummy variable that takes a value of

one starting in 1937. We run this regression on county-level pellagra data for North Carolina and
                    13
South Carolina.          We again use two intensity of treatment variables. The first is an indicator

variable that takes a value of one if county c was in the top 25 percent of the distribution of

pellagra death rates in 1928, prior to the discovery of niacin. The second intensity of treatment

variable is an indicator variable if county c was in the top 25 percent of the distribution of cotton

acres per capita in North Carolina and South Carolina in 1909.

         Table 7 uses three different time periods to explore the effects of the discovery of niacin

and the passages of mandatory fortification laws. Columns (1) and (2) use the time period 1934-

1941 to study the effects of the discovery of niacin on pellagra death rates. Pellagra deaths fell

more after the discovery of niacin in high-pellagra counties and in high cotton counties. Columns

(3)-(5) use the time period 1938-1949 and study the effects mandatory fortification laws on

   Results for state-level pellagra data for southern states are presented in the appendix. Pellagra deaths by county for
all states were only reported in the Vital Statistics of the United States for the years 1946-1948.


                                                                                                                      23
pellagra death rates. The passage and implementation of a mandatory fortification law is

associated with a decrease in the pellagra death rate, with larger decreases occurring in high-

pellagra and high-cotton counties. Finally, columns (6)-(7) use the entire time period 1934-1949

and study the effects of both the discovery of niacin and the passage of a mandatory fortification

law. When estimating the effects simultaneously, we still find that the pellagra death rate

decreased more in high-pellagra and high-cotton counties after the discovery of niacin and after

the passage of a mandatory fortification law. High-pellagra counties saw about a 16 percent

decrease in the pellagra death rate after the discovery of niacin, and high-cotton counties saw

about a 7 percent decrease. Both high-pellagra and high-cotton counties saw around a 11 percent

decrease in the pellagra death rate after the passage of a fortification law.

       Overall, the results in Table 7 indicate that counties with high cotton acreage per capita

and poor baseline nutrition gained the most from the discovery of niacin and mandatory

fortification laws. In Online Appendix Table A.5, we also use state (rather than county) level

data to show that the passage of mandatory fortification laws was associated with decreases in

the pellagra death rate and that these decreases were larger for states with poor baseline nutrition

and high cotton acreage per capita.



8. Conclusion

       In this paper we have explored the rise and fall of pellagra in the United States. Prior

researchers suggested that pellagra emerged in part because of increased cotton production in the

American South and the substitution of locally grown corn for corn that was milled in the

Midwest. The midwestern milled corn was degerminated, which stripped the corn of much of its

nutritional value. To establish the causal relationship between cotton acreage and pellagra we




                                                                                                 24
exploit an exogenous shock in cotton production that occurred from the arrival of the boll weevil.

We show that, following the arrival of the boll weevil, the death rate from pellagra fell in

counties with high initial pellagra or high initial cotton production. We also establish a plausible

dietary mechanism to explain this result: the production of locally grown food increased as the

boll weevil prompted farmers to shift away from cotton production.

       These results are robust to confounding factors related to malaria, urbanization, the Great

Influenza Epidemic, changing county borders, and inter-census population estimates based on

interpolation. We also provide evidence that the arrival of the boll weevil was not associated

with overall improvements in health. The death rates for typhoid, tuberculosis, measles, and

pneumonia experienced no significant changes after the arrival of the boll weevil. This implies

that one of the main impacts the boll weevil had on short-run health was improved nutrition.

Furthermore, while the boll weevil induced outmigration in counties with high cotton production,

our estimates suggest the groups most vulnerable to pellagra were not out-migrating at

significantly higher rates.

       In the last part of the paper, we explore the forces that permanently reduced pellagra in

the South. We focus on two sets of events: the discovery that niacin worked as an anti-pellagrant,

which occurred in 1937; and the passage of state-level mandatory fortification laws from 1942 to

1949. Our results indicate that both sets of events mattered and contributed to the (near)

elimination of pellagra in the South.

Notes: This table includes summary statistics for our sample of 141 counties in North Carolina
and South Carolina. High cotton producing counties are defined as counties that were in the top
25 percent of the distribution of cotton acres per capita in 1909. All of these counties received
the boll weevil. Low cotton producing counties include all counties that received the boll
weevil, but were not classified as high cotton producing counties. Finally, 22 counties did not
receive the boll weevil. Most of these counties did not have any cotton production, however,
according to Haines et al. (2015), United States Agriculture Data, 1840-2010, a few of these
counties did have very low level of cotton production. This is reflected in the fact that the
average number of cotton acres in these counties is 4.36.
Sources: Cotton acres come from Haines et al. (2015) United States Agriculture Data, 1840-
2010. Pellagra and malaria deaths come from the state health reports of North Carolina and
South Carolina. County populations and urban populations come from decennial censuses.

The variable “high county pre-boll weevil pellagra death rate” is an indicator if a county was in
the top 25 percent of the distribution of pellagra death rates in North Carolina and South
Carolina in 1915 and 1916. The variable “high county pre-boll weevil cotton acres per capita”
is an indicator if a county was in the top 25 percent of the distribution of cotton acres per
capita in 1909. Malaria and urbanization controls include the malaria death rate in 1915 and
the percentage of the county population that lived in an urban designated area in 1910 both
interacted with a full set of year dummies.
Sources: The dependent variables come from the state health reports of North Carolina and
South Carolina. The year that the boll weevil first arrived in a county comes from Lange et al.
(2009). The high cotton acres indicator comes from Haines et al. (2015) United States
Agriculture Data, 1840-2010.

                                           ONLINE APPENDIX

       In this online appendix, we present more historical background and further robustness

checks. Table A.1 provides details on the bread enrichments standards proposed by the FDA in

1941. Table A.2 provides more details on the arrival of the boll weevil. In particular, it shows

the cumulative percentage of counties in our sample to have been impacted by the boll weevil by

year. Most of the invasion occurs between 1917 and 1922 and 22 counties are not treated by the

boll weevil.

       Table A.3 shows the following. Column (1) uses the log of the pellagra death rate as the

dependent variable and uses a different measure of cotton intensity (cotton acres as a percent of

all fam acres) than in our baseline regressions. Although the not quite statistically significant (p-

value = 0.27), the same sign is obtained as when cotton acres per capita is used. Column (2) uses

the log of the pellagra death rate as the dependent variable, but controls the overall death rate

(minus pellagra deaths). Our main result remains unchanged. Finally, column (3) uses the ratio

of pellagra deaths to overall deaths as the dependent variable and column (4) interpolates

pellagra deaths in 1918 and 1919 for NC and uses the log of interpolated pellagra death rate. In

columns (3) and (4), the dependent variable decreases after the arrival of the boll weevil and

decreases more in high cotton counties.

       Table A.4 is requires a more extensive motivation and that is provided in the following

section.

       Table A.5 uses state level data and presents additional evidence that pellagra declines

after a state passes a mandatory fortification law.




                                                                                                  48
                        IS THERE EVIDENCE OF SELECTIVE MIGRATION?

       One key concern with our results centers on migration. While we adopt several remedial

strategies in to address concerns about migration and population change, in this section we adopt

a series of more direct tests. Our goal here is to explore the possibility that boll-weevil induced

out-migration might bias our estimates. Three observations motivate our concerns about

migration. First, Lange et al. (2009) show that the boll weevil caused laborers to migrate out of

afflicted counties. Second, Ager et al. (2015) show that women in high cotton counties were the

most likely to leave the labor force in response to the arrival of the boll weevil. Third, Spark et al.

(2015, p.77) show that the most affected groups from pellagra were children age 2-10 and

females 22-44. These findings suggest that the two groups most likely to have suffered from

pellagra also might have been the most likely to have migrated out of affected counties after the

boll weevil arrived. In the face of such selective migration, it is possible that some, or all, of the

reductions in pellagra we observe stem not from improved nutrition, but from the elevated rates

of outmigration among the groups most likely to have suffered from the disease. Hence, in this

section, we run a series of regressions in search of evidence that counties with relatively large

numbers of individuals vulnerable to pellagra exhibit elevated rates of outmigration. To measure

the extent of such selective out-migration, we again use the data from North Carolina and South

Carolina and adopt two separate triple difference strategies similar those employed by Aaronson

and Mazmder (2011).

       In our first triple difference strategy, we ask if counties with high initial cotton and high

initial pellagra rates exhibit elevated rates of outmigration. More precisely, our regression

equation is:




                                                                                                   49

All variables are defined as above.

        The main variable of interest for this regression is the triple interaction between boll

weevil, high cotton, and high pellagra. If counties with both high initial pellagra and high initial

cotton exhibit elevated rates of outmigration, the coefficient on this interaction (𝛽𝛽3 ) would be

negative and statistically significant. The coefficients on the boll weevil-high cotton interaction

(𝛽𝛽1) and the boll weevil-high pellagra interaction (𝛽𝛽2 ) are also of some interest. In particular, the

coefficient on the boll weevil-high cotton interaction serves as a sort of replication/verification

exercise and asks if the patterns we observe in North Carolina and South Carolina comport with

Lange et al. (2009) whose work suggests a negative and significant coefficient (i.e., the boll

weevil induced outmigration from high cotton counties). The second interaction on the boll

weevil and high pellagra indicators tells us whether places with high pellagra rates (independent

of their status in terms of cotton production) are generally observing more outmigration.

        In our second triple difference strategy we focus on women (age 22 to 44) and children

(age 2 to 10) and ask if those groups exhibit elevated rates of outmigration in counties with high

intensity treatment. Specifically, the regression is as follows:




                                                                                                                                                50

In equation (4), 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙[𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔_𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝]𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is the population for group g in county c in census year t.

[𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤]𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 and [𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖]𝑐𝑐 have the same definitions as in equation (1), and as above we

include county and year fixed effects. Groups are defined by their vulnerability. In one set of

regressions, the vulnerable group will be children, age 2 to 10, and in another set of regressions

the vulnerable group will be females, age 22 to 44. The non-vulnerable group consists of

everyone not contained in the vulnerable group. Hence, the variable [𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔]𝑐𝑐 is an indicator that

equals 1 if the population group g is vulnerable, and 0 otherwise.

        The main variable of interest here is the triple interaction between boll weevil, intensity,

and group. If women and children (the groups most vulnerable to pellagra) exhibit elevated rates

of outmigration the coefficient on this interaction ( 𝛽𝛽3 ) would be negative and statistically

significant.

        The results are reported in Table A.4. The results from column (1) are consistent with

Lange et al (2009) (high cotton counties exhibit higher rates of outmigration post boll weevil),

and show that high pellagra is not associated with elevated rates of migration in either the double

or triple difference. The results from columns (2) and (3) indicate that females (age 22 to 44) do

not exhibit significantly higher rates of outmigration post-boll weevil than other (less vulnerable)

groups. Similarly, the results from columns (4) and (5) indicated that children (age 2 to 10) do

not exhibit significantly higher rates of outmigration post-boll weevil than other (less vulnerable)

groups. Overall the patterns observed here provide little support for the hypothesis that the



                                                                                                                                                      51
groups most vulnerable to pellagra are migrating out of high cotton counties in response to the

The variable “high county pre-boll weevil cotton acres as percent of farm acres (1909)” is an
indicator if a county was in the top 25 percent of the distribution of cotton acres as a percent of
total farm acres 1909. The variable “high county pre-boll weevil cotton acres per capita” is an
indicator if a county was in the top 25 percent of the distribution of cotton acres per capita in
1909. Malaria and urbanization controls include the malaria death rate in 1915 and the
percentage of the county population that lived in an urban designated area in 1910 both
interacted with a full set of year dummies.
Sources: The dependent variables come from the state health reports of North Carolina and
South Carolina. The year that the boll weevil first arrived in a county comes from Lange et al.
(2009). The high cotton acres indicator comes from Haines et al. (2015) United States

Notes: This table reports OLS estimates. The unit of observation in column (1) is a county-
year cell. The unit of observation in columns (2)-(5) is a county-year-population group cell.
Standard errors, reported in parentheses, are clustered at the county-level. Column (1) reports
the coefficients from a triple-difference estimation where an indicator for Post BW is
interacted with a high pellagra and high cotton indicator. A county is considered a high
pellagra county if it was in the top 25 percent of the distribution of pellagra death rates in
North Carolina and South Carolina in 1915 and 1916. A county is considered a high pellagra
cotton if it was in the top 25 percent of the distribution of cotton acres per capita in 1909. In
columns (2)-(5) each county has two observations per year. The first observation is the
population of a group that was especially susceptible to pellagra; women 22-44 years of age or
children 2-10 years of age. The second observation is the population of the rest of the county
that is not a part of the susceptible group. The coefficients in columns (2)-(5) are from a triple-
difference estimation where an indicator for Post BW is interacted with a high pellagra or high
cotton indicator and an indicator if the observation is for the susceptible population.

Notes: This table reports OLS estimates from equation (3) in the text. The unit of observation is a state-year cell. Standard errors,
reported in parentheses, are clustered at the state-level. States includes in the analysis are: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. “Post niacin discovery” is an
indicator variable that takes a value of one beginning in 1937 with the discovery of niacin. “Post fortification law” is an indicator
variable that takes a value of one beginning in the year that a state past a mandatory fortification law. Alabama passed a law in
1943, Arkansas in 1945, Georgia in 1945, Louisiana in 1942, Mississippi in 1945, North Carolina in 1945, Oklahoma in 1947, and
South Carolina in 1942. The variable “high pre-niacin pellagra death rate (1928)” is an indicator if a state was in the top 50 percent
of the distribution of pellagra death rates in 1928. The variable “high pre-niacin cotton acres per capita (1909)” is an indicator if a
state was in the top 50 percent of the distribution of cotton acres per capita in 1909. Malaria and urbanization controls include the
state malaria death rate in 1928 and the percentage of the state’s population that lived in an urban designated area in 1910 both
interacted with a full set of year dummies.
Sources: The dependent variable comes from the Mortality Statistics of the United States, 1915-1936 and the Vital Statistics of the
United States, 1937-1949. Cotton acres harvested were taken from the United States Department of Agriculture’s National
Agricultural Statistics Service Database (Quick Stats 2.0).
