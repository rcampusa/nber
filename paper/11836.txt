Rising Family Income Inequality in the United States, 1968-2000: Impacts of Changing Labor
Supply, Wages, and Family Structure

                                           ABSTRACT

This study estimates what fraction of the rise in family income inequality in the United States
between 1968 and 2000 is accounted for by change in each of the family income components such
as wages, employment, and hours worked of family heads and spouses, family structure, and other
incomes. The increased disparities in other incomes and labor supply account for, respectively, 29
percent and 28 percent of the rise in the difference in income between the top 10th and bottom 10th
families. Structural changes in wages, largely regarded as the major culprit of the increase in income
inequality, explain less than a quarter of the rise in the measure of family income inequality.
Changing fraction of families with both husband and wife and changes in the composition of the
income sources account for 11 percent and 16 percent, respectively, of the widening of the income
gap. The relative importance of the effect of changing labor supply declined over time, while that
of wage changes increased. For the upper half of the income distribution, wage changes were the
dominant cause of the increase in the gap between the richest 10th and middle-income families. For
the lower half of the income distribution, in sharp contrast, changes in labor supply and other
incomes were the principal causes of the growing distance between the poor and middle-income

families.

1. Introduction
         Rising income inequality is one of the most marked features of the U.S.
economy in the era of globalization and IT revolution.2 Over the last couple of decades,
an extensive literature has been accumulated regarding the patterns and causes of the
growing disparities in incomes. The primary focus of recent studies has been on
changing dispersions in individual wages between and within various demographic
groups possessing different human capital attributes. Some major explanations for the
widening of wage gap between high- and low-skilled workers are: technological
changes, international trade, transfers abroad of production activities, inflow of less-
skilled immigrants, degraded quality of education, decline of labor unions, and
deregulations of industries.3
         Although it is now much better understood how the wage structure transformed
over time and what produced the change, thanks to the large body of evidence suggested
previous studies, it is less clear how the increased income inequality affected the
distribution of the wellbeing of individuals. In particular, it is striking that only a few
studies have rigorously documented the changing distribution of family income. Given
that family members jointly make decisions on labor supply, pool their earnings, and
share family resources, family income is perhaps a better measure of material wellbeing
of a person than his or her own wages. As in the case of individual wages and earnings,
the family income disparity in the United States has sharply widened over the last
several decades. 4 One cannot simply assume that rising wage inequality is the main
story behind the increase in family income inequality because family income is

  Between 1970 and 2000, for instance, the share of the aggregate income received by the lowest
fifth families fell from 5.4 percent to 4.3 percent. In contrast, the share of income earned by the
top 5 percent families increased from 15.6 percent to 21.1 percent during the same decades (U.S.
Bureau of the Census 1996, No. 719; U.S. Bureau of the Census 2004, No. 672).


                                                2
determined by many other factors in addition to individual wages. These factors include
employment and hours worked of each of family members, family structure, and non-
labor incomes.
         Only a small number of studies have paid attention to the effect of changing
labor supply on income inequality. Burtless (1990, 1993) and Moffitt (1990) reported
that the growth in annual earnings inequality for male workers during the 1970s and
1980s was primarily due to growing inequality in hourly wage rates. On the other hand,
Haveman (1996) suggested that the increase in earnings inequality between 1973 and
1988 among working-age men was largely produced by increased variability in the
amount that potential breadwinners worked. 5 Hyslop (2001) reported that, among
married working couples, behavioral labor supply responses to wage changes explain 20
percent of the rise in family earnings inequality in the early 1980s. 6 Lee (2001)
computed that changes in labor market activity of family heads accounted for half of the
increased gap between families in the top and bottom income deciles between 1969 and
1989.7
         The previous studies on income inequality have largely focused on male
workers. However, patterns of individual labor force participation and of hours of work
need to be understood in the context of joint decisions made by family members. For
example, if income effect is strong, fewer working hours or lower wages of a family
head could be supplemented by increased hours worked by the spouse or other family
members. The existing literature is nearly silent about how changes in employment and
hours of family head and spouse jointly contributed to the family income inequality.
Burtless (1993) estimated the contribution of the employment and hours changes by
comparing the actual and counterfactual changes in Gini-ratio for the periods 1969-1979.
However, his study, after all, dealt with individual earnings of men and women rather


5
  These studies use variance of logarithm (VLN) of earnings as the measure of inequality. They
decompose the VLN of earnings into (1) VLN of wage rates, (2) VLN of hours worked, and (3)
a covariance term between the two. They then observed change in each factor over time to
assess its relative contribution to the increase in the VLN of earnings.
6
  The main evidence of this study comes from the own- and cross-covariance structures of
wages and earnings of couples in the 1979-1985 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID).
7
  This study estimates a counterfactual measure of the family income inequality for 1989 that
would have resulted, had the employment and hours distribution as of 1969 remained
unchanged.


                                              3
than family earnings. 8 Hyslop (2001) found that married men and women tended to
increase (decrease) the hours in responses to diminished (increased) earnings of their
spouses. Based exclusively on a sample of employed couples, however, this study fails
to provide evidence regarding the effect of changing pattern of employment on family
income inequality.
        There are a few studies that enable us to predict how changing pattern of work
affected the family income inequality. Decline in employment was particularly severe
among less-educated and low-wage men between 1967 and 1988 (Juhn 1992). The rise
in two-earner couples has been more pronounced in families in which the husband’s
earnings are higher (Cancian, Danziger, and Gottschalk 1993). Employment and
earnings gains have been greatest for wives of middle- and high-wage men (Juhn and
Murphy 1997). The inter-spousal correlation of wages, hours, and employment
increased between 1979 and 1987 (Blackburn and Bloom 1995). Finally, as noted above,
the intertemporal substitution effect of a wage change dominated its income effect for
married women in the early 1980s (Hyslop 2001). These changes in employment and
earnings patterns of men and women should have increased the family income
inequality to some extent. However, the magnitude of the joint effect is unclear.
        The purpose of this paper is to examine what fraction of the rise in family
income inequality in the United States between 1968 and 2000 is accounted for by
change in each of the following components of the family income: (1) employment of
the head, (2) the hours worked of the head, (3) the wage rate of the head, (4) marital
status of the head, (5) employment of the spouse, (6) the hours worked of the spouse,
(7) the wage rate of the spouse, (8) the incomes from other sources than the earnings of
the head and the spouse, and (9) the fraction of the family income coming from a
particular source. More specifically, I estimate what percentage of the change in the
measure of family income inequality (defined in this study as the difference in the log of
the average income between families in different income deciles) is attributable to the
change in the above factors for the period between 1969 and 1999 and the three sub-
periods, 1969-1979, 1979-1989, and1989-1999.

  He ranked individuals into earnings quintiles according to family earnings rather than
individual earnings, and calculates counterfactual mean earnings for each earnings quintile,
assuming no change in the mean employment rate and hours of work in each earnings group.

        This study is distinct from other studies in the following respects. First, this
study explicitly considers at the same time all potentially important factors of the total
family income inequality. To my knowledge, this study is the first that combines the
effects of changing wage, employment, hours worked, family structure, and
composition of income into a single decomposition framework. Second, my study
compares results based on several different samples of populations, namely, (1) all
families headed by persons aged 18 to 64, (2) all households including families and
single householders, (3) families headed by persons aged 25 to 55, and (4) families
headed by males aged 25 to 55. Using alternative samples not only enable me to avoid
sample-selection biases but also help interpret the results more accurately. Finally, my
study covers the entire three decades during which the family income inequality
increased, and compares the results for each decade within the period under study. This
will help understand how the mechanisms of rising income inequality changed over
time.
        The organization of this paper is as follows: I begin with developing a method
of decomposing a change in family income in the next section. Section 3 introduces the
data used in the analysis. Section 4 describes the patterns of changes in the elements of
family income inequality between 1969 and 1999. In section 5, I present the results of
the decompositions that provide explanations for how each of the components of family
income contributed to the changes in income inequality. I also examine how the results
change where alternative measures of inequality are used. Section 6 compares the
results based on several different samples. The final section summarizes the paper.


2. Analytical Framework
        I begin with a decomposition of total family income into several components.
The definition of variable representing each of the components is given in Table 1. The
average annual money income of households in a given income decile, denoted N, may
be presented as


                         (1) N ≡ H hWh Ph + H sWs Ps δ + Q




                                            5
where H h , H s , Wh , and Ws stand for the mean annual hours worked and the mean

hourly wage rates for employed heads and spouses, respectively; Ph and Ps stand for

the employment rates for heads and, if married, spouse; δ is the fraction of households
in which both husband and wife are present; and finally, Q stands for the mean incomes
from other sources.
         As the measure of income inequality, I use the difference in the log of average
family income between two income deciles, say, the top and the bottom income deciles
(denoted by N * ). That is, N * = ln[ N TOP ] − ln[ N BOTTOM ] . Using an approximation, N * can
be decomposed as shown in equation (1), where the asterisk denotes the difference in
the logs of a variable in the top and bottom deciles of families. For example,
H h* = ln( H hTOP ) − ln( H hBOTTOM ). Equation (1) can be rewritten as


                  (2) N * ≈ Φ h ( H h* + Wh* + Ph* ) + Φ s ( H s* + Ws* + Ps* + δ ) + Φ Q (Q * )


where Φ denotes the weight of each of the three income sources. For example,
Φ h [= ( H hWh Ph ) / N ] indicates the earnings of heads as a proportion of the total average
family income.
         It is possible to decompose the change in N * over time, in this case, say,
between 1969 and 1999, by differentiating equation (2) totally, to obtain


              ∆N * ≈ Φ h ∆H h* + Φ h ∆Wh* + Φ h ∆Ph* + ∆Φ h ( H h* + Wh* + Ph* ) +
         (3) Φ s ∆H s* + Φ s ∆Ws* + Φ s ∆Ps* + Φ s ∆δ * + ∆Φ s ( H s* + Ws* + Ps* + δ * ) +
              Φ Q ∆Q * + ∆Φ Q Q *


The first term on the right-hand side of equation (3), for example, represents the rate of
change in the disparity in average hours worked by family heads in the top and bottom
deciles, weighted by the relative share of family income derived from the earnings of
the head. The estimate of this term indicates the relative contribution of the change in
average working hours of heads to the rise in the measure of income inequality between
1969 and 1999. Likewise, the second and third terms show the relative contributions of


                                                  6
changes in hourly wages and in the employment rate of heads, respectively. On the other
hand, the fourth term represents the effect of changing weight, that is, the relative
importance of earnings of family heads as a source of income. If earnings of family
heads are more unequally distributed than other sources of income, an increase in the
share of earnings of the head in the total family income would produce a rise in the
magnitude of inequality.
          It should be noted that I do not follow up the individual families over time
using this method. I am only comparing the families in particular income group today
with the families in that income category in the past, who are not necessarily the same.
The questions to be answered using the method explained above is why the difference in
income between rich and poor families today is much greater than it was thirty years
ago. More specifically, this study examines how the gaps between today’s rich and poor
families in wages, employment, hours, other incomes, and family structure differ from
the disparities in these factors between the rich and the poor in the past. The framework
used in this study, however, can provide only limited hints as to why the distribution of
these family income components changed over time. For instance, the rise in the
disparities in employment and hours of heads and spouses may have resulted from
individual families’ behavioral responses to changes in economic conditions such as
changing wage structure, which cannot be analyzed in the present framework. However,
I believe it is important to understand first what happened even if it cannot be fully
explained why it happened.


3. Data
          The balance of this paper is based on data from Annual Demographic Files on
the March Current Population Surveys (CPS, hereafter) for the survey years 1969 to
2001. Since most of the calculations below are based on annual earnings, weeks worked,
and usual hours of work per week in the year previous to the survey, this study covers
the calendar years 1968 to 2000. The secular rise in the family income inequality started
in the late 1960s and continued thereafter. Accordingly, I choose four bench-mark years,
1969, 1979, 1989, and 1999 to study long-term changes. The patterns of changes in the
determining factors of family income inequality may be sensitive to the choice of the
initial and end years (see, for example, Haveman 1996). I average three years of data


                                           7
centered around the bench-mark years to mitigate possible business cycle effects. Thus
the averages I report for 1969, 1979, 1989, and 1999 are actually based on the 1968-70,
1978-80, 1988-90, and 1998-2000 CPS data.
         The main unit of analysis used in this study is the family which is composed of
two or more related persons. I limit the sample to families whose heads are at working
ages (between 18 and 64).9 However, alternative sample selection may provide different
results.10 The three decades under study have witnessed a great transformation in the
living arrangement. As the fraction of non-family households greatly increased, the
population covered by the sample composed of families should have diminished.
Moreover, the working ages chosen here (18 to 64) may not be fully comparable across
different cohorts because of the secular rise in college attendance and early retirement
over the three decades. The increase in the proportion of female-headed families was
also remarkable. In addition to the primary sample composed of families, for these
reasons, I use several alternative samples covering different populations for testing the
sensitivity of the result to the selection of the sample (see section 6).
         Using these data sets, I calculate the components of the mean family income for
each income decile, as explained above. The incomes and earnings are all converted
into 1982-1984 dollars. The employment rate for family heads (spouses) is calculated
dividing the number of those who worked at least one week last year by the number of
all families for each income decile. I calculate annual hours of work by multiplying
weeks and usual hours worked per week last year.11 I then estimate the annual hours



9
  I exclude a small number of families in which wife is recorded as the head because husband
resides elsewhere while remaining married. The number of families covered by the sample for
each year is 32,964 (1968), 31,499 (1969), 32,016 (1970), 33,842 (1978), 39,839 (1979), 39,842
(1980), 29,790 (1988), 32,316 (1989), 32,101 (1990), 31,188 (1998), 31,431 (1999), and 30,194
(2000).
10
   Karoly (1993) provides a good example of comparing the patterns of changing inequality
based on different populations. Haveman (1996) noted that the increase in the variance of hours
worked accounted for much larger proportion of the rise in the variance of log of male earnings
for all males than it did for employed male workers.
11
   For this computation, the data from the 1968-1975 surveys are not comparable to the later
surveys. For the early years, weeks worked last year are reported only on a bracketed basis and
usual hours worked per week last year are not reported. In order to impute the continuous values
for weeks worked last year, I divide the data from the 1976-1978 surveys into cells according to
weeks worked and use the cell means for weeks worked as the corresponding week’s data for
the early years.


                                               8
worked for those employed in each income decile.12 Other income (Q) is calculated as
the difference between the average total household income and the average earnings of
heads and spouses. Thus, it includes earnings of other household members and non-
labor incomes.13


4. Changes in the Components of Household Income, 1969-1999
         Figures 1 to 7 and Appendix Table present the estimate of the mean total family
income and each of the components of the mean family income for each income decile
for 1969, 1979, 1989, and 1999. It is well documented that measures of family income
inequality increased since the late 1960s and accelerated in the 1980s. The income gap
between the top and bottom income deciles, the primary measure of household income
inequality employed in this study, confirms the long-term rise in the family income
inequality. As presented in Figure 1, the average income of the top 30 percent families
increased rapidly while the incomes of low- and middle-income families stagnated or
even declined. During the three decades, the average income of the top 10 percent
families increased by 57 percent, as compared to a 40 percent decline among the
families in the bottom income decile. In particular, the 1990s witnessed the most
dramatic rise in the income disparity between rich and poor families. During the decade,
the average income of the richest 10th families increased by 30 percentage points

12
   For this calculation, the following method was used: First, I multiply hours worked in the
week prior to the survey and weeks worked for those who worked at least one hour last week.
This estimate of annual hours worked, denoted by H LW , should differ from the actual annual
hours, H LY , because (1) those who worked last week are not the same people as those who
worked last year, and (2) hours worked last week may differ from usual hours worked last year.
To see the size and pattern of the discrepancy, I compare H LW and H LY using data from the
1976-1978 CPS. For each income decile, H LW is only slightly greater than H LY . More
important, the relative size of H LW and H LY is fairly stable across income deciles. I derive
adjustment factors by dividing H LY by H LW and apply them to the data from the 1969-1971
surveys to obtain more accurate estimate of annual hours worked. I also imputed annual hours
worked for the early years following the procedure explained in Juhn (1992: appendix 1). As far
as the average hours worked for each income decile is concerned, H LW is a closer
approximation of H LY than the imputed value.
13
  The average family size, reported in Appendix Table, does not differ much from one income
declie to another. More importantly, the average family size of each income decile changed over
time in a similar manner. Therefore, the patterns of changes in the family income components
and their relative contributions to the rise in family income inequality that will be given below
do not change much if the average per capita family income is considered.


                                               9
whereas the income of all families grew by about 6 percentage points. As a consequence,
the difference in the log of the total family income between the top and bottom deciles,
denoted N * above, increased by 0.96; more than half of the increase (0.5355) was
attributed to the change between 1989 and 1999.
        Figure 2 suggests that shift in the hourly wage rates of family heads ( Wh ) was
probably not a powerful cause of the rise in the family income inequality until the 1990s.
Wages for family heads slightly fell or remained unchanged for low- and middle-income
families between 1969 and 1999. Although wages for the families in the top three
income deciles slightly increased, the difference between high- and low-income families
was relatively small. During the 1990s, on the other hand, the average wages for the top
10th families greatly increased in sharp contrast to the relatively stable wage rates for the
families in the rest of income distribution. Thus, the wage change should have increased
the income inequality to a greater extent during the 1990s than it did in the previous two
decades.
        It is well documented in other studies how labor supply of men and women
with different earnings potentials have changed over time (Juhn 1992, Cancian,
Danziger, and Gottschalk 1993, Juhn and Murphy 1997). The present paper provides a
picture of long-term changes in the elements of labor supply for a more broadly defined
population, namely all families. The overall employment rate for family heads (Ph) fell
substantially over the three decades under investigation, particularly during the 1970s
and the 1990s. The decline in Ph was much greater for lower income families than for
higher income families. For instance, Ph fell 14 percentage points for the bottom income
decile whereas it declined by 5 percentage points or less for the top three income deciles
(Figure 3, and Table A1, row 3). Changes in annual hours worked for family heads (Hh)
exhibits a similar pattern. The decline in hours was particularly pronounced for the
bottom two income deciles, especially from 1969 to 1989 (Figure 4 and row 4 of Table
A1). We may predict from these patterns that uneven changes in Ph and Hh should be at
least partly responsible for the rise in the family income inequality.
        The fraction of husband and wife families (δ ) families in lower half of income
distribution fell considerably between 1969 and 1979, and rebounded during the next
decades, except for the lowest income decile. In consequence, the decline in δ between



                                             10
1969 and 1989 is visible only for the lowest income decile. Between 1989 and 1999, δ
sharply declined for all families, but more severely for lower-income families; δ
remained relatively stable for the top two income deciles (row 9 of Appendix Table). In
sum, family structure had changed in the direction to increase the family income
inequality, especially between 1969 and 1979 and between 1989 and 1999. It should be
kept in mind that this statistic disguises dramatic changes in the living arrangement and
rising instability of the family because non-family households are excluded from the
sample. I will return to this point later.
         Over the period under study, the hourly wage for employed spouse ( Ws )
 increased much faster for high-income families than for lower-income families (Figure
 5). The disparity in the spouses’ wage growth between rich and poor families is much
 more pronounced than that of heads. For example, Ws for the top income decile more

 than doubled between 1969 and 1999 whereas Ws for the bottom three deciles

 remained little changed. This indicates that the change in Ws should be a major source
 of the rise in the family income inequality over the three decades since 1969.
         As the female labor-force participation rate increased, the proportion of
employed spouses ( Ps ) rose considerably. As illustrated by Figure 6, the rise in Ps was
generally greater among middle- and high-income families. For the top income decile,
Ps increased from 59 percent to 88 percent between 1969 and 1999. On the other hand,
there was no gain for wives in the lowest 10th families. This result indicates that the
labor-force participation of spouses changed in the direction to magnify the family
income inequality. The average annual hours of work of employed spouses ( H s ) has
increased for families in all income deciles (Figure 7). In particular, wives in middle-
income families increased the hours of work the most. This outcome tends to suggest
that the effect of change in H s on the family income inequality, if any, should be small
in magnitude.


5. Decomposition of the Changes in Family Income Inequality
         The patterns of the changes over time in the components of household income,
reviewed the preceding section, allow us to predict the direction of their contributions to


                                             11
the shift in household income inequality. For instance, hourly wages of heads should
have been a minor factor that caused the decline in household income inequality
between 1969 and 1989. Also, changes in the employment rate and the hours of work
for heads should have substantially contributed to the widening of the income gap
between the rich and the poor for the period under study. In the following two sections, I
analyze in detail how changes in each of the components contributed to the shifts in the
household income inequality. I begin with a baseline decomposition of the changes in
the difference in the log of the total family income between the top and bottom income
deciles based on equation (3).


5.1 A Baseline Decomposition
        Table 2 presents the result of a baseline decomposition in which the samples of
families headed by a head aged 18 to 64 are included and the difference in the log of
income between the top and bottom income deciles is used as the measure of family
income inequality. For the entire period between 1969 and 1999, in which the difference
in the log of family income between the top and bottom deciles increased by 0.96,
changes in other incomes (Q) and labor supply of heads and spouses (Ph, Hh, and Ps )
explain more than half of the rise in the measure of family income inequality (see the
final column of Table 2).
        The increased inequality in other incomes (Q) accounts for 29 percent of the
rise in the family income inequality between 1969 and 1999. Although Q accounts for
relatively small fraction of the total family income, the difference in Q between the
high- and low-income families increased so rapidly during the three decades to produce
a strong impact on the rise in the overall family income inequality.14 As will be shown
below, the effect of the change in other incomes is completely explained by the relative
decline of other incomes of low-income families. Changes in employment and hours
worked explain another 28 percent of the rise in the family income inequality between
1969 and 1999. In particular, changes in the hours worked and the employment rate for
heads (that explain, respectively, 13 percent and 9 percent of the increase in the income

14
  In 1999, for example, Q was 6196 dollars, about 17 percent of the mean total family income.
Between 1969 and 1999, the rate of increase in Q was much higher for the families in the top
income decile (31 percentage points) than for the lowest income decile (-44 percent).


                                             12
disparity) were major contributing factors, with change in the employment rate of
spouses accounting for another 7 percent of the increase in the measure of inequality.
        It is striking that structural changes in wages, largely regarded as the major
culprit of the increase in income inequality, explain less than a quarter of the rise in the
measure of family income inequality. The effects of the wage changes of heads and
spouses were almost equally important. Changing family structure, measured by the
fraction of families with both husband and wife (δ ), was nontrivial factor of the rise in
family income inequality. It accounts for 11 percent of the widening of the income gap
between the top and bottom income deciles.
        Changes in the composition of the income sources account for the remaining 16
percent of the rise in the measure of inequality. First of all, the rise in the share of
spouses’ earnings ( Φ s ) strongly increased the measure of income inequality (see row 10
of Table 2). Since the percentage of families with married couples and the employment
rate of spouses as well as the mean earnings of employed spouses are much lower for
lower-income families than richer families, the disparity in spouses’ earnings is much
greater than the inequality in heads’ earnings or other incomes. During the three decades
under study, the share of spouses’ earnings in the total family income increased from 13
percent to 31 percent. About two thirds of the effects of increased share of spouses’
earnings were offset by the countervailing effects of the decline of the share of heads’
earnings and the increase in the relative size of other incomes.15
        The first three columns of Table 2 present the results of the decomposition for
each of the three decades. According to the measure of inequality used in this study, the
growing family income inequality accelerated during the 1990s. The upsurge in the
income gap between the top and bottom income deciles between 1989 and 1999 was
greater than the rise in the measure of inequality during the previous two decades
combined.
        The relative contribution of each of the components of family income
considerably differed by decade. First of all, the relative importance of changing labor
supply, especially the employment rate for heads, declined over time. During the 10


15
  The share of heads’ earnings fell from 71% in 1969 to 52% in 1999. The percentage of other
incomes in the total family income increased from 15.9 percent in 1969 to 16.9 percent in 1999.


                                              13
years between 1969 and 1979, changes in employment and hours of heads and spouses
accounted for nearly two thirds of the increase in the measure of income inequality. The
proportion explained by changing labor supply decreased to 33 percent in 1979-1989,
and to 28 percent by 1989-1999. On the other hand, the relative importance of the effect
of changing wages increased over time: the percentage of the rise in the measure of
inequality accounted for by wage changes was 10 percent in the 1970s, 4 percent in the
1980s, and 39 percent in the 1990s. The relative impact of changing distribution of other
incomes (Q) decreased over time.


5.2. Right Tail vs. Left Tail of the Income Distribution
        A widening of the income disparity between the top and bottom income deciles
could result from either a faster growth of income of the richest 10th families or
deterioration of the position of the lowest 10th families, in comparison with the families
in the middle. Likewise, the relative contribution of each of the components of family
income could come from either left or right tail of the income distribution. Similar
decompositions, also based on equation (3), are conducted separately for the differences
in the log of income between the top 10th and the average, and between the average and
the bottom 10th families. The results are reported in Tables 3 and 4.
        The results suggest that 70 percent of the increase in the income difference
between the top and bottom 10th families were produced by deterioration of the position
of the poorest 10th relative to the families in the middle. During the decade between
1969 and 1979, in particular, the widening of the income disparity between the rich and
poor families is completely explained by the relative decline of the bottom 10th families.
This indicates that the sharp rise of the family income inequality was largely due to the
collapse of low-income families.
        For the upper half of the income distribution, wage changes were the dominant
cause of the increase in the measure of family income inequality. Changing heads’
wages account for more than half of the increase in the difference between the incomes
of the top 10 percent families and the average income; changing wages of spouses
explain another 28 percent. The change in the proportion of families with both husband
and wife was the other major factor of rising income inequality. The change in other
incomes did not increase the measure of family income inequality. The overall effects of


                                            14
changes in labor supply and the composition of income sources were trivial.
        For the lower half of the income distribution, in sharp contrast to the result for
the upper half, changes in labor supply and other incomes were the principal causes of
the growing distance between the poor and middle-income families. Shifts in
employment and hours worked account for 36 percent of the increase in the difference
between the incomes of the lowest 10th families and the average income. Change in
other income accounts for 38 percent, indicating that the effect of change in other
income reported in Table 2 is completely explained by the relative decline of other
incomes of low-income families. Only 8 percent of the increase in the measure of
inequality was attributable to wage changes. Changes in the composition of income
sources and the proportion of families with both husband and wife explain 12 percent
and 11 percent of the rising income disparity between the families in the middle and
those at the bottom, respectively.


5.3. Income Disparity between the 2nd and 9th Deciles
        The difference in the log of income between the top and bottom 10th families,
used above as the measure of household income inequality, may not deliver the full
picture of changing inequality. By focusing on the gap between the richest and the
poorest, in particular, it fails to capture any changes in the middle of the income
distribution. In order to supplement this weakness at least partially, a similar
decomposition method is applied to the difference in income between the second and
ninth income deciles. The result is reported in Table 5.
        The rise in the difference in the log of income between the second and ninth
deciles between 1969 and 1999 (0.5477) was about 60 percent in magnitude of the
increased income gap between the highest and lowest 10th families. The relative
importance of the effect of each income component is considerably different between
the two results. Changes in wages, especially of heads, were much more powerful
cause of the widening income disparity when the top and bottom 10 percent families
were excluded from the decomposition. Wage changes alone explain 38 percent of the
rise in the measure of income inequality. On the other hand, the influence of labor
supply changes was much smaller for the income inequality between the families in the
second and ninth deciles. This pattern is generally true for each of the three decades, but


                                            15
more clearly observed for the 1980s during which wage changes accounted for 85
percent of the rise in the measure of income inequality.


6. Sensitivity of the Result to the Choice of Population
        Although the population chosen above, namely families headed by working age
persons, is widely used in the study of income distribution and poverty, there is no
standard rule to select sample to be studied. The pattern of living arrangement and the
family structure have dramatically changed over the three decades under investigation.
Thus, the populations compared above between 1969 and 1999 may be different in
various aspects, and a change in the population covered by the study may lead to a
different conclusion. I repeat the same decomposition using several alternative samples
covering different populations to examine whether the result obtained above is sensitive
to the choice of population.
        I begin with analyzing a broader population, namely, all households including
non-family households. The proportion of non-family households increased from 19
percent in 1969 to 31 percent in 2000 (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1996, No. 66; U.S.
Bureau of the Census 2004, No. 56). We thus tend to look at increasingly narrow
segment of the population over time by focusing on family households. Given that non-
family households are overrepresented in lower-income households, we may have a
different result if this broader sample is used.
        The first column of Table 6 presents the result. The estimated measure of the
rise in the family income inequality (0.9576) and the relative size of each component’s
contribution to the increase in income inequality are remarkably similar to the results
based on the sample of families reported in Table 2. The only notable difference is the
relatively greater contribution of the change in the employment rate for heads (13
percent) where all households are concerned.
        The next issue to be addressed with regard to the choice of the sample is the age
range of family heads. Although persons aged 18 to 64 are largely regarded as the
working-age population, it is not fully comparable across different times for the
following reasons. First, the college enrollment considerably increased between 1970
and 2000, diminishing the proportion of young family heads covered by this study



                                             16
(because the families whose heads are enrolled in school are excluded).16 Second, the
typical retirement age has diminished as early retirement (defined as leaving the labor
force permanently at age younger than 65) became increasingly common.17
         To reduce the effect of the change in the typical working age, I restrict the
sample to families headed by persons aged 25 to 55. The result of the decomposition
based on this sample is reported in the second column of Table 6. Although the results
based on all families and families headed by prime-age persons are not perfectly
matched, their implications are not much different from each other. Similar to the result
for all families, changing labor supply explains about a third of the increase in the
measure of the family inequality; wage changes account for another 31 percent. Notable
differences are relatively small effect of the shift in the composition of income sources
and a large impact of changing family structure.
         Another prominent change in the family structure over the last several decades
is the rise of the proportion of female-headed families. In 1970, less than 11 percent of
families were headed by women (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1996, No. 66); now, 18
percent of families are female-headed (U.S. Bureau of the Census 2004, No. 60).
Moreover, the growth of female-headed families was particularly pronounced among
low-income families. In consequence, female-headed families currently account for
more than half of the lowest 10th families.
         To eliminate the effects of changes in the working age and family structure
introduced above, I decompose the rise in the family income inequality using the
sample of families headed by males aged 25 to 55 (See column 3 of Table 6). The
magnitude of the increase the measure of income inequality between 1969 and 1999 for
this sample (0.6485) is slightly greater than half of the estimate obtained from the
sample of families headed by prime-age persons (1.2390), and about two thirds of the
estimate for all families headed by working age persons (0.9600). This result indicates
that growing instability of the family is a major factor of the rising family income
inequality. The relative contribution of each of the components of family income is also

16
   The school enrollment rate for persons aged 18 to 19 increased from 47.7 percent in 1970 to
61.2 percent in 2000. The same rates for individuals aged 22 to 24 increased from 14.9 percent
to 24.6 percent during the three decades (U.S. Bureau of the Census 2004, No. 206).
17
   The labor force participation rate of men aged 55 to 64 declined from 73 percent in 1980 to 67
percent in 2000 (U.S. Bureau of the Census 2004, No. 570).


                                               17
quite different. In particular, wage changes were the most powerful factor of the
increase in the income inequality among the families headed by prime-age males.
However, similar to the results for the full sample, labor supply changes explain 31
percent of the rise in the measure of income inequality.


7. Conclusions
        This study has estimated what fraction of the rise in family income inequality in
the United States between 1968 and 2000 is accounted for by change in each of the
family income components such as wages, employment, and hours worked of family
heads and spouses, family structure, and other incomes. The increased disparity in other
incomes (Q) accounts for 29 percent of the rise in the difference in income between the
top 10th and bottom 10th families. Changes in employment and hours worked explain 28
percent of the rise in the family income inequality between 1969 and 1999. More
specifically, changes in the hours worked and the employment rate of heads explain,
respectively, 13 percent and 9 percent of the increase in the income disparity, and
change in the employment rate of spouses accounts for another 7 percent. Structural
changes in wages, largely regarded as the major culprit of the increase in income
inequality, explain less than a quarter of the rise in the measure of family income
inequality. Changing fraction of families with both husband and wife accounts for 11
percent of the widening of the income gap between the top and bottom income deciles.
Changes in the composition of the income sources explain the remaining 16 percent of
the rise in the measure of inequality.
        The relative contribution of each of the components of family income
considerably differed by decade. In particular, the relative importance of the effect of
changing labor supply, especially that of the employment rate for heads, declined over
time. On the other hand, a much greater percentage of the rise in family income
inequality during the 1990s is explained by changing wages compared to the previous
two decades.
        The sharp rise of the family income inequality was largely due to the collapse
of low-income families. About 70 percent of the increase in the income difference
between the top and bottom 10th families were produced by deterioration of the position
of the poorest 10th relative to the average household. For the upper half of the income


                                           18
distribution, wage changes were the dominant causes of the increase in the measure of
family income inequality. For the lower half of the income distribution, in sharp contrast,
changes in labor supply and other incomes were the principal causes of the growing
distance between the poor and middle-income families.
           If the families in the second and ninth income deciles are compared, changes in
wages, especially of heads, were much more powerful cause of the widening income
disparity. The results of decompositions based on alternative samples (all households
including families and single householders, families headed by prime-age persons, and
families headed by prime-age males), though considerably different from one another,
provide generally similar implications. It is especially notable that changing labor
supply explains about a third of the rise in the measure of family income inequality
between 1969 and 1999 (28 percent to 36 percent), no matter which sample is chosen.
           The most striking result of this study is that wage changes of heads and spouses
explain only a modest fraction of the widening of the income gap between the top and
bottom 10th families. Prior to the 1990s, in particular, less than 10 percent of the rise in
the measure of family income inequality resulted from wage changes. On the other hand,
changing employment and hours exerted stronger impacts on the increase in family
income inequality than previously thought. The influence of changing labor supply was
particularly powerful prior to 1990, accounting for 63 percent and 33 percent of the rise
in measure of family income inequality during the 1970s and 1980s, respectively. In
particular, the relative decline in the employment rate and hours worked among poor
householders were the single most important cause of the collapse of the families at the
bottom of income distribution between 1969 and 1989.
           Along with changing employment and hours of work, the relative decline in
other incomes of low-income families was an important cause of the rise in the disparity
in family income. Since other incomes of the lowest 10th families are largely composed
of transfer incomes, relative decline of their other incomes may have been in part
produced by changes in government income distribution policy. It may also be partly
attributable to the rise in capital incomes of middle- and high-income families since the
mid-1970s.18


18
     The capital income share in the U.S. personal income increased from around 13 percent in the


                                                19
        Another interesting result is that the 1990s was distinct from the previous two
decades in terms of the magnitude and the mechanisms of rise in family income
inequality. The rise in the measure of family income inequality during the 1990s was
more than twice as large as those of the previous two decades combined. In contrast to
the 1970s and 1980s during which the rise in family income inequality was largely
produced by the relative decline of bottom 10th families, about two thirds of the increase
in family income inequality during the 1990s resulted from the faster income growth of
the richest 10th families compared to entire families. Wage changes were a much more
important factor of the rise in family income inequality for the 1990s than for the
previous two decades. These peculiar features of the 1990s may be explained by the
dramatic increase in the wages of top 10 percent salary earners since the mid-1990s
(Piketty and Saez 2001).
        The results of this study suggest that the rise in the income disparity between
rich and poor families over the last three decades can not simply be explained by
growing wage inequality that has been highlighted. The relative declines of employment,
hours, and non-labor incomes of the families at the bottom were more important factors
of rising family income inequality, especially prior to 1990. Rise in the number of
single-parent families was another non-trivial factor. Given that changes in employment,
hours, non-labor income, and family structure had particularly strong impacts on the
relative decline of the families at the bottom, these factors should be considered more
seriously than wage changes in addressing poverty issues that could be more crucial for
the wellbeing of the people than inequality per se.




early 1970s to 20 percent in 1990 (Piketty and Saez 2001).
