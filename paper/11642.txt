                                           ABSTRACT




How much do internal firm resources contribute to technology adoption in major urban locations,
where the advantages from agglomeration are greatest? The authors address this question in the
context of a business's decision to adopt advanced Internet technology. Drawing on a rich data set
of adoption decisions by 86,879 U.S. establishments, the authors find that the marginal contribution
of internal resources to adoption is greater outside of a major urban area than inside one.
Agglomeration is therefore less important for highly capable firms. The authors conclude that firms
behave as if resources available in cities are substitutes for both establishment-level and firm-level
internal resources.

1. Introduction

A large body of evidence confirms there is significant agglomeration in economic activity (Rosenthal and

Strange 2003). Businesses in major urban areas1 benefit from access to inputs that improve labor

productivity and innovative activity. Organizations with locations outside of major urban areas may try to

replicate the resources available within major urban areas, either by moving resources between locations

or by making special investments at isolated facilities. If these attempts do not succeed then locating

production in a major urban area may shape opportunities to access knowledge essential to innovative

activity (Furman, Kyle, Cockburn and Henderson, 2005) and become a source of sustainable competitive

advantage (Porter 1998).

         The extent of advantage from an urban location is an empirical question. How much do internal

firm resources and investment activities substitute for the advantages of economic agglomeration, if they

do at all? This question has been difficult to address due to a scarcity of data linking geography, internal

resources, and adoption. This paper provides substantial empirical evidence on an important activity in

which both locating in a major urban area and mobility of resources have been linked to improvements in

innovative activity, namely, the adoption of advanced information technology (IT) by firms.

         Two factors set the stage for our study. First, the costs of advanced IT projects are lower for firms

with access to rich local resources in major urban areas (e.g., Columbo and Masconi 1995; Forman,

Goldfarb, and Greenstein 2005). In addition, prior experience on related projects can create internal

capabilities within organizations that reduce the costs to new innovation (Attewell 1992; Cohen and

Levinthal 1990; Åstebro 2002). If firms can move these resources for advanced IT projects—either

between projects in the same establishment or between establishments in the same organization—then

internal resource mobility might make up for the lack of local resources outside a major urban area. 2



1
  We use major urban area, city, and sizeable city interchangeably and, for pragmatic purposes, later define them as
a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) that has a population of over 500,000.
2
  We use the terms firm and organization interchangeably. Multi-establishment firms can have establishments in




                                                                                                                   1
         We focus on the largest investors in IT in the United States. Specifically, we analyze a survey

(conducted by Harte Hanks) of adoption of advanced Internet technologies at 86,879 establishments that

have over 100 employees at the end of 2000. This sample consists of established firms rather than start-

ups, which allows us to treat establishment location as determined prior to the Internet adoption decision.

Approximately two-thirds of the U.S. workforce is employed in the type of establishments studied.

         The sample contains considerable heterogeneity in the dimensions of interest. Establishments

come from all over the United States, both major urban areas and isolated rural locations. Most of the

organizations in the sample have some experience with basic IT technologies, such as personal computers

(PCs), but a much smaller fraction have extensive experience with advanced IT projects. In addition,

45,948 establishments come from one of 7,035 multi-establishment organizations. This allows us to

examine the potential for movement of resources between establishments in the same organization.

         We analyze adoption of Internet technology involving communications internal to the

establishment, which we label within-establishment Internet technology or WEI. Although the installation

and maintenance costs of WEI vary on the basis of being in urban or isolated locations, its average

benefits do not. We show that large establishments from firms in major cities will be most likely to adopt

WEI, while small single-establishment companies in isolated locations will be least likely. We then

disentangle the contribution coming from location and organizational resources by distinguishing between

two sources of what we call capabilities, namely establishment capabilities located within the

establishment and organizational capabilities located outside the specific establishment but inside the

organization. We demonstrate that increases in establishment capabilities make a larger marginal

contribution to technology adoption outside a major urban area than inside one: Establishments with high

capabilities (one standard deviation above the mean) in remote locations have higher adoption rates than

establishments with low capabilities in a dense location. We also demonstrate that increases in




more than one location, more than one establishment in a single area, or both.




                                                                                                           2
organizational capabilities make a larger marginal contribution to technology adoption outside a major

urban area than inside one. These effects, however, are typically too small to make up for a poor location.

These findings are robust to a wide variety of specifications and endogeneity controls and to alternative

models and technologies.

        Overall, our results show that the marginal effect of internal capabilities on adoption is lower in

cities than in other areas. Firms act as if internal resources can substitute for the advantages of

agglomeration. Through rendering the broad question in a concrete setting, our study improves

understanding of why some firms were better able to take advantage of technical change both in this

specific instance and more generally.

2. Hypotheses

As has been noted in many contemporary accounts, the rapid diffusion of the Internet took most

commercial establishments by surprise. We consider a simple model of technology adoption at an

establishment that assumes that new technology becomes available unexpectedly. The only decision for

establishments is whether (and when) to adopt. Establishment i will adopt by time t if and only if

                  (1)      NB(xi,mei,eci,oci, zi,t)   B(xi,mei, zi,t) – C(xi,mei,eci,oci, zi,t) > 0,

where NB is the net benefit of adoption, B is the gross benefit of adoption, and C is the cost of adoption.

        Our data come from one cross-section. Since adoption of the Internet is rarely reversed, we are

comfortable suppressing the time dimension in our model. Under the standard “probit model” of diffusion

(e.g., David 1969; Karshenas and Stoneman 1993), adoption costs decline over time for all potential

adopters. As in this standard model, we interpret the difference between adoption and non-adoption as the

threshold between those with high and low valuations from WEI adoption.

        We let xi describe local geographic conditions, such as population size and density. The variables

mei, eci, and oci, denote firm characteristics: mei denotes whether the establishment is from a multi-

establishment firm, eci describes the establishment’s internal capabilities, and oci describes the presence

of organizational capabilities (at other establishments within the same firm—by definition, mei = 1 for




                                                                                                              3
establishments with oci > 0). The variables zi describes industry and establishment characteristics.3

         The WEI technologies involve communications internal to the establishment but not outside of

the establishment. As was noted in Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein (2005), we expect cross-sectional

variation in the gross benefits of WEI adoption to be minimal, but we do expect the costs of installation

and maintenance to vary with locations. Thus, focusing on WEI allows us to assume a simpler model—

B(xi,mei, zi,t)   B + ui—where B is a constant and u is unobserved establishment-specific error.4 If u is

distributed as a normal i.i.d., then the probability of adopting is a function of how xi, mei, eci, oci, and zi

shape costs.


2.1. Factors Shaping Adoption
Figure 1 depicts the different mechanisms through which xi, eci, and oci, influence the costs of adopting

Internet technology at an establishment. Our main question is, What is the marginal contribution of each

of those mechanisms? In this section, we develop hypotheses that frame our estimation strategy.

         The variable xi captures differences in local supply conditions that arise as a result of changes in

population size and density. Large cities may have thicker labor markets for complementary services or

for specialized skills such as programming in new computer languages. Thicker markets lower the price

of obtaining workers to perform development activities in-house or of obtaining IT services such as

contract programming. Increases in location size also may increase the presence of non-market mediated

knowledge spillovers that reduce adoption costs (e.g., Goolsbee and Klenow 2002). Such locations may

also have greater availability of complementary information technology infrastructure, such as broadband



3
  We include the multi-establishment firm dummy and the number of employees (in xi) to control for the well-known
result that benefits to adoption are increasing in firm and establishment size. While we do not focus on how local
competition influences the net benefits of adoption, we later present robustness checks that control for the extent of
local competition.
4
  If we had examined a technology where the (gross) benefits decrease as city size increases—due, for example, to
the ability of Internet technology to reduce the disadvantages associated with isolation (dB/dxi < 0) —then we would
not be able to identify the cost-reducing role of external resources because, as econometricians, we observe dNB/dxi
< 0, not dC/dxi. In Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein (2005), we conclude that Internet technologies used for
communication across business establishments displayed geographic patterns consistent with the “global village




                                                                                                                    4
services. Increases in each of these factors may decrease the costs of adopting complex Internet

technologies in cities, other things being equal.5

        In Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein (2005), we conclude that the geographic variation in WEI

adoption was consistent with the “urban leadership hypothesis,” that is, adoption costs decrease as

population size and density increase (i.e., dC/dxi < 0, where xi is density). We expect the same again.

Hypothesis 1: Adoption of WEI will be increasing as location size and density increase.

        Internal firm resources that arise as a result of prior investments in other IT projects may also

lower adoption costs. We first discuss the role of oci that arise from prior IT projects at other

establishments and which are easier to identify in our data, and then discuss the role of eci.6 The variable

oci captures how other IT projects at other establishments in the same organization affect the net benefits

of Internet adoption, primarily by reducing the costs of operation and installation. These organizational

capabilities are resources and investments that might be redeployed in other locations. That is, resources

and other investments in the organization are already employed in some IT task, and the new technical

opportunity leads them to be redeployed for use in advanced Internet applications. In the course of

developing IT projects, organizations may develop shared human and physical capital that reduces the

costs of developing Internet applications internally. These features will be important if there are

significant fixed costs to develop this capital. Prior IT projects will also reduce development costs if

programmers are able to transfer lessons learned from one project to another, which leads to economies of

scale and scope.7 The benefits of these prior investments are organizational capabilities, but it is an open




hypothesis,” dB/dxi < 0. Hence, these are the technologies we cannot examine with the framework used here.
5
  This is consistent with prior theory work arguing that firms locate administrative and support functions
strategically. Duranton and Puga (2002) argue that a firm may find it advantageous to locate administrative and
support services in large areas because of better availability and a larger variety of complementary services. In
addition, external services may require repeated face-to-face interactions (Kolko 1999). There is some evidence that
locating such services in large metropolitan areas may improve firm productivity (Davis and Henderson 2002).
6
  Formal identification conditions are discussed in Section 3.3.
7
  For example, software developers may be able to share common tools for design, development, and testing
(Banker and Slaughter 1997), or they may be able to reuse code (Barnes and Bollinger 1991). Software development
may also have learning economies (Attewell 1992) that through experience reduce the unit costs of new IT projects.




                                                                                                                  5
question of whether organizational capabilities move effectively across establishments within the same

firm. If so, then adoption costs decrease (dC/doci < 0) and our next hypothesis holds.

Hypothesis 2a: Firms with greater organizational capabilities will be more likely to adopt WEI
technology at any one of their establishments than firms with lesser organizational capabilities.

         The variable eci measures capabilities at the same establishment. Establishment capabilities affect

costs of adoption in ways similar to oci : Shared human and physical capital, economies of scale and

scope, learning economies, and knowledge spillovers might reduce adoption costs. Once again, it is an

open question how establishment capabilities will affect adoption costs, if at all. Consequently, our next

hypothesis concerns establishment capabilities and adoption costs (dC/deci< 0).

Hypothesis 2b: Greater establishment capabilities will increase adoption of WEI technology.


2.2. Substitution
Can prior experience with other IT projects at the same or at other establishments overcome the cost

disadvantages of being outside a major urban area?8 Evidence on this question is scarce or has ambiguous

interpretations, especially with regards to the performance of innovative activity.9 Our next two

hypotheses posit that capabilities substitute for the advantage of being located in a major urban area, that

is, the cost advantages of location in a city decline in the presence of organizational capabilities

(d2C/dxidoci < 0) and establishment capabilities (d2C/dxideci < 0). 10 For example, shared human capital

arising from other projects at the same establishment may decrease the benefit of increases in the local



The IT projects may also be subject to knowledge spillovers that reduce development costs. Much prior research in
the costs of innovative activity has also long presumed experience with prior related projects can lower the costs of
innovation (Cohen and Levinthal 1990). Internal capabilities may also help customize a general purpose technology,
such as the Internet, to the idiosyncratic needs of the establishment (Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein, 2002).
8
  Vernon (1963) first articulated this idea in a case study of the New York City area. He argues that agglomeration
economies are especially important for small (start-up) firms that lack scale economies in their own organizations.
9
  One exception is Kelley and Helper’s (1999) study, which shows that urbanization and localization increase the
speed of computer numerical control adoption among a sample of manufacturers. Their research, though, is a case
study based on a small sample of industries. Most evidence in other industries suggests a relationship between
agglomeration and factors associated with internal capabilities (Holmes 1999, Holmes and Stevens 2002; Henderson
2003). For example, manufacturing firms in isolated locations tend to use more self-supplied intermediate inputs.
10
   This discussion presumes that we can both measure and identify establishment location and capabilities distinctly




                                                                                                                   6
supply of third-party services. Moreover, when IT labor forces are mobile, shared human capital at other

establishments decrease the value of consultants and thicker labor markets in large cities. Further, as

noted above, prior work on other IT projects may create learning economies and spillovers that decrease

the costs of adapting general purpose IT to organizational needs, reducing the importance of external

consultants and local spillovers. These alternative mechanisms lead to the same empirical prediction: the

marginal contribution of internal capabilities is higher outside cities than inside.

         Access to broadband is available for most of the medium and large establishments we observe,

but, as with other local services, the competitiveness of local broadband markets varies widely between

urban and rural areas. Our hypothesis presumes that the marginal WEI investment will be decided based

on human capital issues instead of infrastructure issues. However, we note the possibility that broadband

may be unavailable in rural areas, in which case internal capabilities will not be a substitute for a lack of

local infrastructure. We treat this possibility as an empirical question.11

Hypothesis 3a: The sensitivity of WEI adoption to increases in location size will be declining as the
internal organizational capabilities found in other establishments within the same firm increase.

Hypothesis 3b: The sensitivity of WEI adoption to increases in location size will be declining as the
internal establishment capabilities increase.

         In our final hypothesis we expect increases in IT capabilities in the organization (establishment)

will decrease the rate at which the establishment (organization) capabilities influence costs

(d2C/docideci<0): that is, oci and eci are substitutes.12 Establishment and organization capabilities will

substitute when internal IT labor forces can be deployed on projects throughout the organization, or when




from other factors. This challenge frames several of the econometric issues we discuss subsequently.
11
   If differences in broadband availability do constrain the value of an establishment’s Internet investments in
enough cases, then internal capabilities and agglomeration would be complements on average, leading to a
coefficient estimate that rejects hypotheses 3a and 3b.
12
   If establishments specialize in differing “types” of capabilities, then establishment and organizational capabilities
may be complements. Again, we treat this alternative hypothesis as an empirical question.




                                                                                                                           7
learning economies and knowledge can be transmitted across IT projects at different establishments.13

Hypothesis 4: Establishment capability and organizational capability are substitutes.


3. Data and Method
The data used in this study come from the Harte Hanks Market Intelligence Computer Intelligence

Technology database (hereafter CI database).14 This database contains establishment- and firm-level data

on characteristics such as number of employees and number of programmers and use of Internet

applications and other networking services. Harte Hanks collects this information to resell as a tool for the

marketing divisions of technology companies. Interview teams survey establishments throughout the

calendar year; our sample contains the most current information as of December 2000.

        Harte Hanks tracks over 300,000 establishments in the United States. Because we focus on

commercial Internet use, we exclude government, military, and nonprofit establishments (mostly in

higher education). Our sample from the CI database contains all commercial establishments with over 100

employees—in total 115,671 establishments. Harte Hanks provides one observation per establishment.

We use the 86,879 clean observations with complete data generated between June 1998 and December

2000.15 Harte Hanks tracks whether an establishment is affiliated with a larger organization. In total, there

are 47,966 distinct organizations, and 7,035 of these have more than one establishment. We adopt a

strategy of utilizing as many observations as possible for establishments in thinly populated areas. This

necessitates routine adjustments for the timing and type of the survey given by Harte Hanks.


3.1. Endogenous Variables
Our analysis focuses on advanced Internet technology, or WEI, that either changes existing internal



13
   Some prior research using patent citations has provided evidence of intra-firm knowledge spillovers in other
innovation settings (e.g. Frost 2001, Furman, Kyle, Cockburn and Henderson, 2005).
14
   This section provides an overview. For more detail, see Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein (2002).
15
   We dropped establishments that did not indicate when they were surveyed and establishments that were not
surveyed on information technology. There is a small bias in the dropped observations toward locations where WEI
adoption is high. The weighting scheme controls for any location and industry bias in the sample.




                                                                                                               8
operations or implements new services. We look for indications that an establishment has made

investments that involved frontier technologies or substantial co-invention. The threshold for defining

substantial is necessarily arbitrary within a range.16 It usually arises as part of other intermediate goods,

such as software, computing, or networking equipment. Investment in WEI involves the use of Internet

protocols in the input and output of data to and from business applications software. Examples include (1)

intranet applications that enable Web access to information stored in business applications software, such

as inventory or accounting data and (2) applications that have functionality involving integration with

back-end databases (e.g., Web access to a data warehouse).17

        Firms adopting complex applications such as WEI may do so at only a subset of establishments.

As we subsequently discuss in further detail, such adoption may cloud the relationship between

geography, internal capabilities, and technology adoption in our establishment-level regressions.

        Hence, as a robustness check, we also examine the determinants of two additional measures of

adoption behavior. One such measure describes whether the IT personnel at the establishment are using

languages that are commonly employed in the building of Internet applications. This variable is equal to

one when the establishment indicates the use of any of the following: XML, Visual Basic Script, Perl,

Java, CGI, and Active-X. The second variable describes when an establishment has made necessary

hardware investments to host Internet applications, and it is equal to one when the establishment has

installed a PC server. Both of the measures represent investment in intermediate inputs that are used in the

building and hosting of Internet applications and may be duplicated at multiple establishments.




16
  We tested a number of slightly different definitions and did not find any significant changes to our findings.
17
  To be specific, an establishment is counted as adopting WEI if it adopts one of the following: (1) business
application software that involve intensive use of database management systems, such as accounting, sales and
marketing, payroll, ERP and MRP, inventory, order processing, and data warehousing; (2) science and research
applications used for financial analysis and modeling, CAD/CAM/CAE, data analysis, and engineering; or (3) office
applications, such as personnel management, project management, and groupware. See Forman, Goldfarb, and
Greenstein (2005) for more details.




                                                                                                                9
3.2. Exogenous Variables

In Table 1, we provide descriptive statistics. Our measure of location size is a dummy variable that equals

one when the establishment is located in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) with a population over

500,000, which we term sizeable MSA. This is the simplest way to represent differences between large

cities and small cities and rural locations. In our earlier research, we considered a wide variety of different

specifications for the effect of increasing density, and these specifications largely did not affect the

results. Here, we employ a dummy for “city” to keep the results stark and easy to interpret. We also

demonstrate that variants on this definition do not affect our qualitative inferences.

         We measure mobile capabilities that can be deployed to build new Internet applications. Our first

measure of capabilities is based on the number of programmers. For establishment capabilities, we

measure the number of programmers located within the establishment. For organizational capabilities, we

examine only the multi-establishment firms within our sample. We compute the total number of

programmers from other establishments within the same firm.18 These measures quantify the total number

of programmers instead of the total quality of programmers or the total cost of programmers. If major

urban areas have different programmer quality or costs than other areas, this may have (ambiguous)

implications on the productivity implications of our results for establishment capabilities. 19

         Our second measure of establishment capabilities utilizes principal components factor analysis on

three variables—employment, programmers, and a measure of non-Internet software use—to compute a

composite variable. This variable provides a more complete description of internal capabilities. The

variable on software use is a dummy that is equal to one when the establishment uses internal application



18
   In our database, the programmers variable is constructed using the following cells: 1-4, 5-9, 10-24, 25-49, 50-99,
100-249, 250-499, and 500 or more. To convert this measure into a continuous variable, we take the midpoint of
each interval and use 500 as the value for the right-censored observations. In our sample, less than 1% (85) of the
establishments have a right-censored value for programmers. Qualitative results do not change if a dummy for 500
or more is included (results available upon request.)
19
   If urban areas have thicker labor markets for higher quality programmers at the same wage rates as rural areas
then that would bias our estimates away from hypothesis 3a and 3b. If urban areas have higher wage rates for higher
or same quality programmers, then the bias in our estimate is ambiguous.




                                                                                                                  10
development software or when it has familiarity with current object-oriented programming languages

such as C or C++.20 Only one factor has an eigenvalue above one and was therefore the only one retained.

This factor explains 50% of the variance. We label this factor the establishment capability factor.

        For organizational capability, we again conducted principal components factor analysis on five

variables: (1) total employment in the organization outside the establishment, (2) number of programmers

in the organization outside the establishment, (3) a dummy for whether at least one other establishment in

the organization used development software, (4) a dummy for whether at least five other establishments in

the organization used development software, and (5) a dummy for whether at least ten other

establishments in the organization used development software. Again only one factor has an eigenvalue

above one. It explains 59% of the variance. We label this factor the organizational capability factor.21

        Table 1 shows that there are few systematic differences in the distributions of either

organizational capability measure. For the establishment capability measures, both the means and the

standard deviations are slightly higher in cities. The differences are small enough not to affect our

interpretation of the marginal effects across major cities and other areas.

        Our regressions also include controls for establishment employment, controls for whether the

establishment is part of a multi-establishment firm, three-digit NAICS dummies, and dummies for the

month the survey was conducted. 22 These variables control for many other unmeasured determinants of

demand and supply.


3.3. Statistical Method

We estimate a probit model of adoption for the WEI technologies previously described. Our endogenous



20
   We experimented with a variety of alternative measures of software use, including additional measures of
development applications as well as measures of complex client/server applications such as enterprise resource
planning. These alternative measures gave qualitatively similar results.
21
   We also experimented with adding quadratic and other higher-order terms for establishment and organization
capabilities. These terms had no effect on adoption.
22
   Establishments were interviewed over a two-year period. Those interviewed toward the end of the period are more
likely to have adopted. Therefore, we control for the month surveyed.




                                                                                                               11
variable is yj, the value to establishment j of WEI adoption. The variable yj is latent. We observe only

discrete choices, namely, whether or not the establishment chooses to adopt a technology. In either case,

the observed decision takes on a value of either one or zero.

        In our base specification we assume the value to adopting WEI technology is

                       (2) yi=αxi+βoci+γeci+δocixi+φecixi+λocieci+θ1mei+θ2zi+εi,

where α captures the influence of location on adoption, β captures the influence of organizational

capability on adoption, γ captures the influence of establishment capability on adoption, δ captures

whether organizational capability and location are substitutes, φ captures whether establishment capability

and location are substitutes, λ captures whether organizational capabilities and establishment capabilities

are substitutes, θ1 controls for whether the establishment is part of a multi-establishment firm and θ2

captures the influence of a vector of controls including three-digit NAICS industries, employment, and

time of survey. The role for capabilities and location is therefore identified from the variation between

establishments within the same industry. We weight models by the actual geographic distribution of

establishments for industry and size, according to Census County Business Patterns data. If our data under

samples a given two-digit NAICS at a location relative to the Census then each observation in that

NAICS-location is given more importance (for details, see Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein 2002).

        This study focuses on the coefficient estimates for α, β, γ, δ, φ, and λ , which represent the

influence of internal capabilities in reducing (or enhancing) the importance of agglomeration on WEI

adoption at the organization and establishment level. The estimation of θ1 and θ2 is needed to control for

other factors that may affect WEI adoption. With these controls, a positive sign on α supports Hypothesis

1, a positive sign on β supports Hypothesis 2a, a positive sign on γ supports Hypothesis 2b, a negative

sign on δ combined with a positive sign on β +δ supports Hypothesis 3a, a negative sign on φ combined

with a positive sign on γ +φ supports Hypothesis 3b, and a negative sign on λ supports Hypothesis 4.

        Our identification strategy relies on four core assumptions. First, we assume that the location of

an establishment is predetermined. Hence, it is econometrically exogenous to the decision to adopt WEI


                                                                                                            12
technology. This assumption is supported by the unexpectedly rapid diffusion of the Internet. Also, the

establishments in our sample are large and from firms with long histories. They did not suddenly relocate

when the Internet became available. Said succinctly, we assume that the average unobserved benefits of

adopting WEI are independent of where establishments are located, be they in urban or rural areas.

        Second, we assume that our estimates are not influenced by firm-level simultaneity bias. Our base

econometric specification assumes i.i.d. errors. In other words, we assume the error in measuring the

adoption decision of one establishment is independent of the error in every other establishment’s adoption

decision, including other establishments in the same firm. We recognize that this assumption is

questionable for multi-establishment firms in which a central executive decision maker (e.g., Chief

Information Officer) possibly coordinates the choice of whether to adopt for each establishment under his

domain and allocates mobile internal capabilities across establishments within the firm. In particular, if IT

investment decisions are centralized and these firms have greater capabilities, then the coefficient

estimates for capabilities for multi-establishment firms will be biased. To look for biases, we estimate the

coefficients both with all the data and with a subsample of establishments with autonomy to make their

own decisions. Furthermore, while we present results without clustering of standard errors, all of our

significance results are robust to clustering the standard errors by firm.

        Third, our econometric model assumes that capabilities are exogenous to the decision to adopt the

technology. In support of this assumption we note that many of the establishments in our sample maintain

large Information Systems groups that support many internal IT services, so that the WEI technologies

will be only one of many projects. Yet, we also recognize that marginal changes in our measures of

capabilities could make them statistically endogenous. We believe that endogeneity most likely upwardly

biases the coefficients on capabilities, that is, in the event that capabilities and IT capital decisions are co-

determined. If this bias arises, it biases our establishment capability estimates in favor of Hypothesis 2b.

It is less likely to bias our organizational capability estimates.

        We take several actions to control for this third form of endogeneity. As was previously noted, we

re-estimate our regressions over a subsample in which the establishments have autonomy to make IT


                                                                                                              13
investment decisions. If the bias is large, then this subsample should alter the estimate on organizational

capabilities, but not establishment capabilities. In other words, if the bias is large, the result is more likely

to hold for Hypothesis 2b in this subsample, but it is not more likely for Hypothesis 2a. Next, we estimate

capabilities in a variety of ways while looking for robustness. We also present results of instrumental

variables regressions that use capabilities of other establishments and organizations in the same industry

as instruments for establishment and organizational capability. We also instrument for endogeneity of the

location-capability interaction variable with capability of other establishments in other industries in the

same location. While we do present results of instrumental variables regressions that control for potential

endogeneity between establishment and organization capability levels, we have no reason to believe the

endogeneity affects the interaction between capabilities and location. Our results support this belief

because we find no qualitative differences in the core results of a number of different specifications.

        Fourth and finally, our statistical approach relies on the accumulated weight of many different

tests, not any specific coefficient estimate. Any specific coefficient estimate is vulnerable to concerns that

unmeasured demand correlates with our measures of costs, especially those in Hypothesis 2b, as was

noted above. Nevertheless, we gain confidence in our interpretation from estimating the sensitivity of the

statistical inference to a variety of (1) different estimation corrections, (2) different implementations for

the endogenous and exogenous variables, and (3) different samples.


4. Results

4.1. How Does Location Affect the Contribution Of Internal Capabilities?
In this section, we first show the impact of changes in location size and internal capabilities on IT

investment. We then examine the interaction between the roles of internal capabilities and of cities on

technology adoption. The results in Columns (1) through (4) of Table 2 show the coefficients of the main

results; those in Columns (5) through (8) show the marginal effects.

        We first show that urban leadership holds for WEI, supporting Hypothesis 1. Specifically, an

increase in location size has a significantly positive effect on the adoption of WEI technology. The results



                                                                                                                14
in Columns (5) and (6) show that establishments that are located in sizeable MSAs are 1.3 percentage

points to 1.8 percentage points more likely to adopt WEI. Agglomeration in economic activity increases

the likelihood of adoption, other things being equal.

           Increases in capability significantly increase adoption, which supports Hypotheses 2a and 2b.

Increases in establishment capabilities have a significantly positive effect (at the 1% level) on the

adoption of WEI in all specifications. A one-standard-deviation increase in the log of the number of

programmers at the establishment increases adoption by 3.6 percentage points.23 This is a significant

increase when compared to the adoption rate of 11.9%. A one-standard-deviation (equivalent to one unit

by construction) increase in our composite establishment capability factor has a similar effect, namely,

increasing the adoption of WEI by 3.0 percentage points. Internal establishment capabilities significantly

reduce the costs of adoption.

           Increases in organizational capabilities have a similar, but smaller, impact on WEI adoption. A

one-standard-deviation increase in the log of the number of programmers increases the likelihood of

adopting WEI by 0.45 percentage points, which is statistically significant at the 1% level. Increasing the

composite organizational capability factor by one standard deviation increases the likelihood of adoption

by 0.6 percentage points. Although these effects are smaller than those for establishment capabilities, they

are still large when compared to the adoption rates for WEI.

           We next examine the extent to which internal capabilities can substitute for the benefits of

agglomeration. The results in Columns (3), (4), (7) and (8) of Table 2 present the main results of our

paper. Later, in Tables 4 through 6, we show the results of a number of robustness checks. The key effects

of agglomeration and internal capabilities are similar to those in Columns (5) and (6). The key effects are

all in the expected direction and significant at the 1% level.

           There is considerable evidence that internal capabilities substitute for the benefits of



23
     These quantities are computed by multiplying the marginal effect by the change in the variable.




                                                                                                             15
agglomeration, supporting Hypotheses 3a and 3b. In Table 2, the interactions between internal capabilities

and xi are all in the expected direction and significant at the 1% level. The results in Column (7) show that

establishments outside cities benefit 0.9 percentage points more than establishments in cities from a one-

standard-deviation increase in the log of organizational programmers. Similarly, establishments outside

cities benefit 1.1 percentage points more from a one-standard-deviation increase in the log of

establishment programmers. Interestingly, while establishment programmers have a much stronger effect

on the likelihood of adoption than organizational programmers (marginal effects of 3.6 percentage points

versus 0.2 percentage points), the extent of substitution between cities and establishment capabilities is

almost equal to that of cities and organizational capabilities. This suggests that while only a fraction of

organizational capabilities are mobile, they perform similar activities to establishment capabilities and are

able to substitute similarly for cities.24

           To put this in perspective, at mean values for organizational programmers, establishments in

cities are 3.6 percentage points more likely to adopt than establishments in other areas. At the 90th

percentile, the difference is just 1.4 percentage points. Similarly, at mean values for establishment

programmers, establishments in cities are 4.3 percentage points more likely to adopt WEI than

establishments in other areas; however, establishments in cities with values for establishment

programmers that are at the 90th percentile are only 1.4 percentage points more likely to adopt than those

with equivalent capabilities in other areas. Similar results hold for our composite capability variables.

Thus, Hypotheses 3a and 3b are strongly supported.

           Figure 2 presents another view of the main results. It presents the predicted probabilities of

adopting WEI using the results in Column (3) of Table 2 under different combinations of location size

and internal capabilities. In this figure, we use of the log of programmers as our measure of internal

capabilities; results using our composite measure of capabilities are qualitatively similar. We now discuss



24
     These results are also robust to allowing organizational capabilities in the same location (MSA or state) or in the




                                                                                                                       16
Figure 2a, which presents the results for organizational capabilities, and we compare the results briefly to

the results for establishment capabilities in Figure 2b, which are qualitatively similar: Figure 2a shows the

positive impact of agglomeration on adoption (Hypothesis 1). When the firm has no internal organization

capabilities, location in a sizeable MSA increases the probabilities of adoption considerably, from 11.6%

to 16.1%.25 This 4.5 percentage point increase is the difference at the intercept. Moreover, Figure 2a

provides support for Hypothesis 2a: The upward sloping lines show that the probability of WEI adoption

increases as organization capabilities increase, whether or not the establishment is in a sizeable MSA.

         Figures 2a also demonstrates how the prediction of Hypothesis 3a shapes adoption behavior: The

curve depicting establishments in sizeable MSAs is flatter than that for other establishments. The

marginal impact of increasing organizational capabilities is lower for organizations in sizeable MSAs:

Changing —from low (oci = 0) to average (oci = 1.738) capabilities increases the probability of WEI by

1.5 percentage points for establishments in low-density areas, and increases the probability by 0.5

percentage points for establishments in an urban location. Organizational capabilities, however, are

unable to completely substitute for the benefits of an urban location. Even for very capable organizations

that are one full standard deviation above the mean (oci = 4.028), adoption rates are 2.3 percentage points

higher in sizeable MSAs than in rural areas.26 In summary, we find no evidence that organizational

capabilities and agglomeration are complements.

         These results illustrate the importance of establishment capabilities, organizational capabilities,

and external capabilities in reducing the costs of adoption. Although it is difficult to compare them

because of differing metrics, the slopes of the organizational capabilities lines in Figure 2a are not nearly

as steep as the slopes of the establishment capabilities lines in Figure 2b. For establishments located




same industry (three- or six-digit NAICS) to have a separate effect on adoption costs.
25
   Simulations assume establishment capabilities are equal to zero.
26
   To ensure the results are not driven by functional form, we estimated a quadratic specification of capabilities. The
coefficients on establishment capabilities squared, organizational capabilities squared, and their interactions with the
city dummies are both statistically and economically insignificant. Results are available upon request.




                                                                                                                     17
outside of cities, an increase in establishment capabilities from zero to their mean level (eci = 0.510)

increases the likelihood of adoption by 4.1 percentage points, while an increase in establishment

capabilities from zero to their mean level (oci = 4.028) increases the likelihood of adoption by 1.6

percentage points. These results reflect the coefficient estimates on establishment and organizational

capabilities in the first two rows of Table 2.

         Moreover, these figures also are suggestive about the relative importance of internal versus local

external capabilities in lowering adoption costs. For example, an establishment with high organizational

capabilities (one standard deviation above the mean), which is located in a low-density location has a

lower adoption rate (15.0%) than a similar establishment with zero organizational capabilities, which is

located in a high-density location (16.1%). Yet, an establishment with high establishment capabilities in a

low-density location has a higher adoption rate (24.6%) than a similar establishment with mean values for

establishment capability and a high-density location (19.5%).

         Overall, these results suggest that internal capabilities are substitutes for agglomeration when

adopting complex technologies. Yet, they also suggest that internal establishment capabilities are more

effective at lowering adoption costs than are organizational capabilities.


4.2. Substitutability of Organizational Capability and Establishment Capability
In Table 3, we present evidence that establishment and organizational capabilities are substitutes

(Hypothesis 4). No matter how we measure capabilities, the interaction between organizational and

establishment capabilities is negative and significant at the one-percent level.27 The results in Column (2)

show that at mean values for the log of establishment programmers, an increase in the log of organization

programmers by one standard deviation will decrease the marginal effect of establishment capabilities by

0.42 percentage points. This magnitude is of moderate size when compared to the effect of establishment



27
  Capability is potentially endogenous if establishments in weak organizations hire more programmers to
implement a planned adoption. Nevertheless, the negative correlation on the interaction term still suggests
substitutability between establishment and organizational capabilities irrespective of the direction of causality.




                                                                                                                     18
capabilities on adoption. By comparison, an increase in the log of establishment programmers from 0 to

its mean value will increase the likelihood of adoption by 2.69 percentage points when organizational

capabilities are equal to zero, that is, when the establishments have no organizational capabilities.

           The results for our composite measure are similar: Assuming a value for our composite

establishment factor of one, a one standard deviation increase in organizational capabilities will decrease

the marginal effect of establishment capabilities by 0.84 percentage points. By comparison, an increase in

the establishment capability composite variable from 0 to 1 will increase the probability of adoption by

5.66 percentage points. Overall, these results suggest that there exists significant substitution between

establishment and organizational capabilities for WEI adoption.

4.3. Robustness Checks

In Tables 4 through 6, we show the results of a number of robustness checks. In Table 4, we explore the

exogeneity assumptions relating to location and capability. In Table 5, we explore definitions by city size

and technology adoption. In Table 6, we examine whether our results are driven by industry competition.

           Columns (1) and (2) of Table 4 show data only for establishments in multi-establishment firms

that reported that their IT investment decisions are made locally at the establishment. Our baseline

specification implicitly assumes that the error terms of establishment adoption decisions are

independently distributed. This assumption is particularly likely to hold for this subset of establishments.

Although this reduces our sample size considerably, the qualitative results remain the same.

           For the remainder of Table 4, we use instrumental variables techniques to examine the

assumption of exogenous capabilities. In particular, instrumental variables probit regressions were used.

Following Maddala (1983, p. 247–52), we used Amemiya Generalized Least Squares.28 We define five

instruments. One, we instrument for a firm’s establishment capabilities with the establishment capabilities

of other establishments in other firms in the same two-digit NAICS industry in the other locations that the



28
     In the first stage, the endogenous variables are treated as a linear function of the instruments and the exogenous




                                                                                                                          19
firm has an establishment. Two, similarly, we instrument for a firm’s organizational capabilities with the

organizational capabilities of other establishments in other firms in the same two-digit NAICS industry in

other locations where the firm has an establishment. These instruments should be correlated with the

capabilities of an establishment but not with the propensity of the establishment to adopt, conditional on

its industry. Three and four, we use two instruments for the interaction of establishment capability and

city. First, we interact the previous instrument for establishment capabilities (i.e., instrument 1) with a city

dummy. Second, we use establishment capabilities at other establishments in other industries in the same

location. These capabilities will be affected by the same local supply conditions but will not be directly

correlated with adoption. For our fifth instrument we construct the interaction of organizational

capabilities and cities with the interaction of the previous instrument for establishment capabilities (i.e.,

instrument 1) by using other establishments in the same location with a city dummy.29 We therefore have

five main instruments for four potentially endogenous variables.

         As was noted, we are concerned that establishment and organizational capabilities may be

correlated with adoption. In Columns (3) and (4), we use instruments for the establishment and

organizational capabilities variables. They do not instrument for the interactions of these variables with

location. While significance on the interaction term for establishment capability is lost when capability is

defined by programmers, all other significance remains and the signs do not change. The main results do

not appear to be driven by the endogeneity of the capabilities variables. Nevertheless, it is also possible

that establishments or organizations in particular locations are more capable. Therefore, to ensure

robustness, in Columns (5) and (6), we use all five instruments for the four potentially endogenous

variables, namely, establishment capability, organizational capability, and their interactions with being in

a city. Establishment and organizational capability are still positively correlated with adoption, and while




variables. The second stage probit uses the predicted values for the endogenous variables from the first stage.
29
  We do not use the organizational capabilities equivalent to the second establishment capabilities instrument,
because it is not clear how organizational capabilities of establishments in a city will be correlated.




                                                                                                                  20
some significance disappears, the coefficient on the interaction of being in a city with either capability

measure is negative. In summary, the results are robust to instrumental variables techniques.

         In Table 5, we explore the robustness of the variable definitions. Columns (1) through (4) show

that the results are robust to different definitions of what constitutes a city. In our base specification, we

define a city as an MSA with a population of over 500,000. Columns (1) and (2) define a city as any

MSA. Columns (3) and (4) define a city as a location with a population density greater than the sample

median (610 people per square mile). We also ran regressions that use three kinds of MSA: small

(<500,000), medium (500,000-1 million), and large (over 1 million). The establishment capabilities

interaction is largely monotonic in city size. The main divide for organizational capabilities is between

MSAs and non-MSAs.30 In all cases, the qualitative results remain the same.31 Columns (5) through (8) of

Table 5 check the interaction of location and capabilities on different technologies. The results for

Internet development languages (columns (5) and (6)) and PC servers (columns (7) and (8)) are similar to

the results for WEI.

         We also examined whether our results were specific to any particular sector of the economy. The

results in Appendix Table 1 show that the substitutability between internal and external factors holds

across a number of industries and is not special to any particular sector of the economy.

         Sizeable MSAs not only have greater external resources, but may also have stronger competition

in industries that sell non-tradeable goods and services. Thus, our city dummy may also capture the

effects of competition. To examine this hypothesis, the results in Table 6 show whether our results are

robust to the inclusion of variables measuring competition. In Columns (1) and (2), we include the total

number of other establishments in the establishment’s same six-digit NAICS and county, and in Columns




30
   The coefficients on the interactions of establishment capabilities and city sizes are -0.0357, -0.0796, and -0.0989
for small, medium, and large MSAs respectively (non-MSA is the base). For organizational capabilities, the
coefficients are -0.0408, 0-.0408, and -0.0456 respectively. Full results are available from the authors on request.
31
   The inference also does not change with other city definitions, including MSAs with a population of over one
million, a continuous population measure, and a continuous density measure. Results are available upon request.




                                                                                                                     21
(3) and (4), we include the total employment in the same six-digit NAICS and county. We also interact

these variables with establishment and organizational capabilities.

        If our city dummy proxies for external resources beyond the effects of competition, our core

results should remain qualitatively unchanged. They do. In particular, Columns (1) and (3) show that our

results using establishment and organizational programmers remain significant at the 5% level, regardless

of whether we include establishments or employment in the same industry-county. Columns (2) and (4)

show that our results using establishment factors remain significant at the 1% level, while our results

using organizational factors are significant only when we use employment measures of competition (at

the 10% level). As a further robustness check, we also examined whether these results were robust to

estimating these regressions using only establishments in service industries. Service sector establishments

will be more likely to be influenced by competition with local establishments. Again, these results are

qualitatively the same.32 Overall, the proxies for competition have little impact on our core results.


5. Discussion and Conclusions

We show that the marginal contribution of internal capabilities to technology adoption is lower for

establishments in urban locations than for establishments elsewhere. We also find a symmetric role for

internal capabilities: Establishments that are in firms with a greater number of IT personnel adopt WEI

technology more quickly, as did those with prior experience with related non-Internet applications.

Overall, we conclude that establishments located in major urban areas behave as if they face fewer

constraints and have lower costs of adopting WEI technology.

        These findings suggest that the advantages of agglomeration will be most important for single-

establishment firms that have been unable to develop internal capabilities. The findings are consistent

with researchers who have argued that agglomeration of firms with similar input demands can provide

benefits through the provision of complementary third party services and knowledge transfers. These




                                                                                                          22
benefits will be most valuable among small firms and for firms in young or infant industries, where

internal capabilities and business processes are still being developed.

           Our findings are also consistent, albeit more speculatively, with researchers who have argued that

as industries mature and average firm size increases, there is less need for the complementary resources

and knowledge transfer found in cities. As a result, firms may relocate to shape their innovative activities

(Furman, Kyle, Cockburn and Henderson, 2005), or economize on transportation costs or save on wages

(Duranton and Puga 2001). Nevertheless, caution is warranted in following this line of reasoning. We

have examined only one reason why firms would desire urban locations. When a technology diffuses

(whether expected or not – in our case, not), the costs of adopting are lower in a city. Firms may

agglomerate in the same location for a variety of related reasons: knowledge transfer, labor market

pooling, knowledge spillovers, and transportation costs among them.

           This study raises several questions for further research. First, our findings are consistent with the

view that large firms with mobile organizational capabilities may be more likely to locate IT-intensive

business processes in low-cost remote locations. Second, these findings further reinforce the theme of our

earlier research—that location shapes decisions to develop new IT applications internally or decisions to

use external resources, both market-mediated and not. Third, the results also suggest that the competitive

advantage associated with investing in advanced IT depends partially on the preexisting locations of

establishments. Fourth, our findings imply that since businesses in large urban areas have access to both

internal and external sources of supply of IT capabilities they will have lower costs of adoption and use

for frontier IT. Productivity should therefore be higher on average for the same dollar of IT capital.

Finally, these themes have implications for ongoing research about outsourcing. It is a comparatively

unexplored theme in outsourcing research whether the location of an establishment shapes the propensity

of establishments to use market-mediated external channels for IT application development.
