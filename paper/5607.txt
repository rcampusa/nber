                                             ABSTRACT



       This paper proposes      an alternative   to the traditional   model for explaining      the spread

between taxable and tax-exempt       bond yields.     This alternative   model is a special case of a

general class of clientele models of portfolio choice and asset market equilibrium.           In particular,

we consider a setting with two types of investors, a taxable investor and a tax-exempt             investor,

who hold specialized bond portfolios.      The tax-exempt     investor holds only taxable bonds, and

the taxable investor holds only tax-exempt bonds.        Both investors hold equity, and the taxable

and tax-exempt    bond markets are linked through the equilibrium         conditions     governing    equity

holding and bond holding for each type of investor.          In contrast to the traditional    model, this

alternative model has the potential to explain the small observed spread between taxable and tax-

exempt yields.   In addition, this model predicts that the yield spread between taxable and tax-

exempt bonds should be an increasing         function   of the dividend    yield on corporate        stocks.

Although   the substantial   changes in the tax code during the last four decades complicate             the

testing of this model, we find some support for the predicted relationship             between the equity

dividend yield and the yield spread between taxable and tax-exempt bonds.

         What determines      the yield on tax-exempt      municipal bonds relative to the yield on

similar taxable bonds? This paper suggests that factors outside the taxable and tax-exempt

bond markets,       in particular the yield on common         stocks,   may affect   this yield spread.

According to the traditional model, the yields on taxable and tax-exempt             bonds must adjust

so that, in equilibrium, a taxable investor is indifferent        between   holding the two kinds of

bonds.      This model is the basis for most of the previous studies of yields in the tax-exempt

bond market.      Poterba (1 989) offers one survey of this literature; Litzenberger and Nir (1 995)

is a recent example.       In this setting, the marginal tax rate on interest income determines the

ratio of the tax-exempt        to taxable   yield.   As a result, relative yields should move with

statutory     tax rates.   Fortune (1 988),   Poterba (1 986),   Skelton (1 983),    and various other

studies have presented evidence that confirms this prediction.

         In this paper we develop an alternative framework         for analyzing the relative yields of

tax-exempt     and taxable bonds. We move beyond the traditional model, in which there is only

one type of investor with a given tax rate, to consider a model in which there are two types

of investors who face different tax rates and specialize in different kinds of bonds. The first

type of investor is a tax-exempt       institution which holds taxable bonds but no tax-exempt

bonds. The second type of investor is a wealthy taxpayer who holds tax-exempt                bonds but

no taxable bonds. What links the two bond markets is that both investors hold equities.              In

this model, the relative pricing of taxable and tax-exempt          bonds is determined    by equating

each bond’s after-tax risk-adjusted return, for the investors who hold that type of bond, to

the analogous return on corporate stock.             Neither type of investor considers holding both

taxable and tax-exempt        bonds, so there are no investors who are indifferent        between   the

yields on these two types of bonds.

         Our model is a simple special case of a more general class of clientele models in
financial economics.    In this sense, it is similar in spirit to Green’s (1 993) model of the term

structure in the taxable and tax-exempt          bond markets.         Green suggests that the standard

comparison between       par taxable bonds and par tax-exempt              bonds is inappropriate,        and he

emphasizes    that yields on tax-exempt          bonds should be compared              with   yields on “tax-

advantaged”     portfolios   of taxable       bonds.       His empirical    findings    suggest    that    such

comparisons help to explain the smaller implicit tax rate on longer-term than short-term tax-

exempt bonds. Our analysis also suggests that factors beside the yield on taxable par bonds

affect yields on tax-exempt     bonds.

       Despite some important differences from the traditional model with a single type of

investor, our model nevertheless       shares many of the features of this model.                 Both models

predict that the yield spread moves with statutory tax rates.               Hence, much of the evidence

for the traditional model is also consistent with our alternative model. This alternative model

can, in addition, potentially explain why the yield ratio seems “too small” on average to be

explained by the traditional model.       In 1993, for instance, the yield on high-quality long-term

tax-exempt    bonds was 87 percent of the yield on similar Treasury bonds.               This ratio, together

with the traditional model, implies a marginal tax rate of only 13 percent.                   By contrast, the

marginal federal into-me tax rate for high-income households was about 40 percent at this

time. Hence, the tax-exempt      and taxable yields were too close together to be easily explained

by the traditional view, without introducing other factors such as differences in risk between

municipal and Treasury bonds.         Our alternative        model can resolve this puzzle because it

predicts a narrower      yield differential     between      taxable   and tax-exempt         yields than the

traditional model.

       Our alternative model also predicts that the spread between taxable and tax-exempt

yields will fluctuate   with the dividend yield on the stock market.              Because dividends and



                                                       2
capital appreciation are taxed differently, the dividend yield affects the relative tax burden that

taxable investors face on common stocks and, therefore, their required return on tax-exempt

bonds.     We test this prediction using time-series data from 1955 to 1994.           Although the

results are not completely consistent with the model, we do find evidence that the dividend

yield is related to the spread between       taxable and tax-exempt     bond yields.    This finding

supports our general suggestion that available returns on assets other than taxable bonds may

affect the pricing of tax-exempt    bonds.

          This paper is divided into four sections.    The first develops the framework      for our

analysis of yield spreads. The second section documents the substantial differences between

top statutory marginal tax rates and implicit tax rates in the tax-exempt     bond market.    It also

shows how our alternative model can resolve this puzzle. The third section presents empirical

evidence that the yield spread between taxable and tax-exempt         bonds is related to the equity

dividend yield.    The fourth section is a brief conclusion.




1. The Multiple-Investor    Framework

          This section describes the standard model of municipal market equilibrium, and then

presents our alternative model.     First, we consider a taxable investor with a marginal tax rate

of r. If this investor is to be indifferent between holding a par taxable bond with yield r~ and

a par tax-exempt     municipal bond with yield rM, it must be the case that (1 -T)r~ = rM. This

implies


                                             rr - rM - zrT                                      (1)
If taxable investors hold both taxable and tax-exempt       bonds, then the yield spread should be

set according to this equation.      Much of the literature on the municipal bond market has

shown that the tax rate impIied by this equation in fact moves with statutory marginal tax

rates.   This evidence provides some support for this model, but as we will see, it may be

consistent with other models as well.

         We now develop an alternative model by introducing a second class of investors: tax-

exempt institutions.   Because tax-exempt      bonds earn a lower return than taxable bonds, no

tax-exempt    investor holds them.   At the same time, because the spread between the yields

on taxable and tax-exempt    bonds is so small, no taxable investor holds taxable bonds.       This

model is thus related to the “preferred habitat” models of asset-market      equilibrium that have

been proposed in various contexts.

         Consider the equilibrium conditions for each type of investor.     A tax-exempt   investor

compares the return on stock with the return on bonds Plus an equity risk premium.           If d is

the dividend yield, g the expected capital gain, and 0 the risk premium, then the tax-exempt

investor earns the same risk-adjusted return on taxable bonds and stocks when


                                         rT+O-d+g.                                             (2)


A taxable investor compares the tax-exempt        bond yield with the after-tax   return on stocks.

If ~q is the tax rate on capital gains, then the taxable investor’s equilibrium condition is


                            r~ + (1 - Tq)# - (1 - t)d        + (1 - Tcg)g                      (3)

where (I-    rq)e’ is the taxable investor’s   after-tax   risk premium on equity.   Note that we

assume that taxable and tax-exempt      investors have the same expectations      regarding capital

gains.    In addition, we assume that the equity risk premium falls as the tax rate on capital

gains rises, because the government takes on some of the risk through capital-gains taxation.



                                                  4
         We can solve for r~ - r~ using the equilibrium conditions for the taxable and tax-exempt

investors.   By subtracting equation (3) from equation (2), we obtain


                                rr - rM - [(l-tq)w   - e] + f d + Cc, g.                            (4)


This expression depends on g, the expected capital gain on equities, which is not observable.

We can, however, rearrange equation (2) to solve for g and substitute into equation (4). We

obtain


                                                                                                    (5)


This expression shows that the spread between taxable and tax-exempt            yields should depend

on both the taxable bond yield and the equity dividend yield. The coefficient on the bond yield

is the capital-gains    tax rate, not the interest-income   tax rate.    The difference   between   the

interest and capital-gains tax rates multiplies the dividend yield.

         In the alternative model summarized in equation (5), the yield spread is an increasing

function of the tax rate on interest income, so the previously cited evidence that tax policy

affects the yield spread is consistent with the current model.          The mechanism by which the

interest tax rate affects the yield spread, however,        is quite different than in the traditional

model.    In the two-investor    case, the tax rate on interest affects the yield spread between

taxable and tax-exempt      bonds because it determines the tax burden on dividends, which is

part of the return on one of the taxable alternatives to tax-exempt         bonds.

         Data on portfolio holdings provide some support for the notion of a clientele equilibrium

in the tax-exempt      bond market.    At the end of 1992, the most recent period for which it is

possible to disaggregate households and nonprofit institutions in the Federal Reserve Board

Flow of Funds accounts, households held $581.1         billion in municipal securities directly. They

also heId additional tax-exempt debt through mutual funds. Nonprofits, which are tax-exempt,
held only $0.1 billion of such securities.          Households held $182.8     billion of taxable Treasury

securities, and another $157.3         billion in savings bonds, while nonprofits held $110.9       billion

of taxable Treasuries.      Both nonprofits and households report substantial holdings of corporate

equities.

        The notion that tax-exempt         institutions compare taxable bonds and equities is fully

consistent with these portfolio data.            The portfolio pattern exhibited by households is more

difficult to interpret.    Although households hold more tax-exempt           bonds than taxable bonds,

they nonetheless hold substantial amounts of taxable bonds, which appears inconsistent with

our stylized model.       It is possible, however, that holdings of taxable debt are concentrated        in

tax-deferred   investment      vehicles such as Individual Retirement Accounts and Keogh plans.

In this case, household ownership of taxable bonds is consistent with the model.

        We should note that the ownership pattern of tax-exempt               debt is very different today

than it was twenty        years ago.   When Fama (1 977) suggested that commercial banks were

the marginal investors in all short-term           municipal obligations,   and that the pricing of these

bonds depended on the tax rates of these banks, commercial banks were major investors in

this market.   Since the Tax Reform Act of 1986 limited banks’ ability to invest in tax-exempt

securities and borrow the principal in a tax-deductible           way, the role of commercial banks in

this market has declined.        Households have become the largest holders of tax-exempt            debt

in the ten years since the 1986 act.

        The changing pattern of municipal-bond ownership poses a challenge to testing models

of yield determination.       If details of the tax code and financial regulations determine the set

of investors for whom holding tax-exempt             bonds is a viable option, and if these rules change

over time, then it may be problematic to find a sufficiently long time series to permit careful

testing of these models.        Alternatively,     if shifts in marginal tax rates coincide with shifts in



                                                        6
the identity of investors in the municipal bond market, there may be changes in risk premia

and other factors that confound econometric testing. We consider these issues further below.




2. The Implicit Tax Puzzle

       Motivated   by the traditional model, economists often summarize the yield differential

between taxable and tax-exempt        bonds by the imr)licit tax rat Qthat equates the after-tax yield

from a taxable and tax-exempt        security.   This implicit tax rate ~ is (r~ - r~)/r~, where the two

yields are for securities with similar characteristics.

       A standard source of information           on the yield curve for taxable       and tax-exempt

securities is Salomon Brothers’ Analytical Record of Yields and Yield S~read~, which presents

estimates of yield curves for par bonds on the first of each month.           Like many studies of the

determinants of the yield spread between taxable and tax-exempt            bonds, including Buser and

Hess (1 986), Poterba (1 986), and Kochin and Parks (1 988), we focus on the spread between

newly issued Treasury      securities    and prime-grade      general obligation   tax-exempt    bonds.

“Prime” is the least risky category of municipal bonds presented in the Salomon Brothers data,

so both the taxable and tax-exempt         rates are close to riskless.   Chalmers (1 995) examines

data on pre-defeased-municipal       bonds and presents striking evidence that default risks do not

explain the pricing of high-quality municipal and taxable bonds.

       Table 1 shows annual averages of the twelve monthly implicit tax rates for 20-year

bonds. We focus on yield spreads for long-term bonds, which have almost always exhibited

a smaller implicit tax rate than short-term bonds. At some points in the late 1960s and early

1980s, the difference between the implicit tax rates on one- and twenty-year           bonds exceeded

twenty-five   percentage   points.      The upward slope of the tax-exempt         term structure has

sometimes been steep enough to imply future short-term municipal rates greater than those



                                                     7
suggested by the taxable term structure; see Kochin and Parks (1988).

          The data in Table 1 show that the implicit tax rate on these bonds has historically been

low, and that it declined substantially      during the 1980s.     In 1980, the implicit tax rate was

32.4 percent.      Since individual investors could face marginal tax rates as high as 70 percent

on taxable interest income, the implicit tax rate was well below the top tax rate. The implicit

tax rate on twenty-year      bonds declined to 20.0 percent in 1990, and subsequently          fell to an

average value of 13.0        percent in 1993.       The top federal marginal tax rate on individual

investors in 1993 was 39.6        percent, again much higher than the implicit tax rate.

          Our alternative model also allows the computation of an implicit tax rate, although such

a computation requires more assumptions.            In patiicular, suppose that the two investors place

the same risk premium on equity (0 = d’) and that capital gains are not taxed (r-           = O). Then

the implicit tax rate r is (r~ - r~)/d.   We call this the @alternativeimc)licit tax ratQ. For a given

yield spread, the alternative       model implies a much larger implicit tax rate, because the

dividend yield is normally much below the taxable bond yield. Conversely, for any given tax

rate, the alternative model predicts a much smaller spread rT - r~.

          Table   1 also presents the time series of the alternative          implicit tax rate.    This

alternative    implicit t=   rate is consistently   higher than the traditional implicit tax rate and,

therefore, closer to statutory tax rates.       In the years since the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the

alternative implicit tax rate has ranged between 29.4 percent (1 993) and almost 60 percent

(1987).       In some cases, both in this period and before, the alternative        implicit tax rate is

greater than the highest statutory        marginal tax rate on interest and dividend income.        This

finding may reflect our extreme assumption that the effective            capital-gains tax rate is zero.

More generally, our computed value for the alternative            implicit tax rate, (r~ - r~)/d, should

equal ~ + (r~/d -1 )Tq, which is greater than the tax rate on dividends r. Like the implicit tax



                                                      8
rate computed under the standard model, the alternative implicit tax rate declines during the

1980s,     but the level of the alternative   implicit tax rate does not fall substantially   below

statutory marginal tax rates.

          Our discussion of the alternative implicit tax rate is not designed to supplant the use

of the traditional implicit tax rate.   The traditional implicit tax rate measures the tax rate at

which an individual investor would be indifferent between holding a taxable and tax-exempt

bond, and this is often a useful construct.         However,   under our assumption   that taxable

investors who hold tax-exempt       bonds are not investing at the margin in taxable bonds, this

calculation does not convey information on the marginal tax rates of the investors who are

setting prices in the tax-exempt     bond market.




3. Regression Evidence

         To compare the traditional model and our alternative model of municipal bond yields,

it seems natural to regress the yield spread r~ - r~ on the taxable bond yield r~ and the equity

dividend yield d.    That is, we consider regression models of the form:


                                   rr - rM-6+a*rr+fl*d+e                                       (6)

Note that this regression nests the traditional model (equation 1) and our alternative model

(equation 5) if tax rates and risk premia are held constant.    For any given set of tax rates, the

two models give precise predictions about the magnitude of the coefficients in this regression.

According to the traditional model, a = T and # = O, where ~is a marginal tax rate on interest

income.    According to the alternative model, a = T= and B = ~ - ~=, where r= is the effective

marginal tax rate on capital gains. The theory developed above suggests that d = (1 -T~)(O’ -

8), the difference in the after-tax risk premia that taxable and tax-exempt     investors demand

for holding equities.
          As we    noted    above,   estimation   of such a regression      would   convey    the most

information if it were conducted        during a period when the regulations affecting       who could

profitably own tax-exempt         bonds were stable, but when interest rates and dividend yields

varied substantially.      Such a data sample’ is not available.   Nonetheless, to get a rough gauge

of the validity of the two models, we try estimating this regression for the sample periods that

are available, even though they span tax reforms and other changes in the tax-exempt                bond

market.

          An important issue concerns the interpretation        of the error term c in the regression.

Within the model we are examining, this error term arises if there are differential changes in

the risk premia on equity         or if there are changes      in tax rates.    The key question      for

identification    is whether    this error is correlated   with either the taxable bond yield or the

dividend yield.

          There are at least three ways in which such correlation might emerge.         First, if changes

in the dividend yield are correlated with changes in the required risk premia on corporate

equity, then the coefficient on d will reflect more than simply the difference between the tax

rates on dividend income and capital gains.           The net effect of this bias is not clear, for it

depends on correlation of the dividend yield with the difference in risk premia between the

two investor types.

          A second source of potential        bias arises from the effect      of changes in d on the

marginal tax rates of investing households.       If fluctuations in the dividend yield are attributable

to changes in dividend payments, and an increase in aggregate dividends raises the taxable

income of some investing households enough to increase their marginal tax rates, then

increases in d will raise the yield spread by more than the asset-market         equilibrium conditions

imply.    This will lead the coefficient    on d to overstate the actual differential   in margi:, al tax



                                                    10
rates.   This effect is unlikely to be large, however.    If the taxable investors who are holding

both corporate equities and tax-exempt      bonds face the top marginal tax bracket, then this

effect does not operate.      Moreover,   because most of the variation in d is attributable      to

fluctuations in share prices, not changes in dividends, a relatively small share of the variation

in d is likely to be associated with changes in investor marginal tax rates.

         A third effect that warrants consideration is a relationship between marginal tax rates

and dividend payout.    Poterba (1 987) presents some evidence from the U.S. time series, and

cites other studies, suggesting that when the differential      between the tax rate on dividends

and that on capital gains rises, firms reduce their payout ratios. This would suggest that an

increase in ~which raises the yield spread between taxable and tax-exempt        bonds would also

reduce d, thereby leading to a negative bias in the estimate of ~.

         Although these concerns suggest some caution in interpreting the regression evidence,

we nonetheless     proceed in estimating    the equation     (6) as a first step in evaluating   the

alternative model.    We use monthly data for the period 1955:1-1994:12.           The results are

shown in Table 2. The first three rows present estimates for the full sample period, while the

last three rows correspond to the period 1982:1-1994:12,         the period after the top marginal

tax rate on unearned income was reduced from 70 to 50 percent in the Economic Recovery

Tax Act of 1981.

         In bivariate regressions that include either the taxable bond yield or the dividend-price

ratio, each of these variables has a positive and statistically significant correlation with the

yield spread. The explanatory power of the equation that includes the dividend yield is smaller

than that of the equation with the taxable yield.        If we exclude the 1950s from our sample

period, the explanatory    power of the two equations is roughly equal, and for some sample

periods, the yield spread is more strongly correlated with the dividend yield than with the



                                                 11
taxable bond yield.

        When both the taxable bond yield (r~) and the dividend yield (d) are included in the

estimation equation, as in equation (6), each variable has a statistically         significant effect on

the yield spread (r~ - r~). Recall that the traditional model of municipal bond pricing predicts

a coefficient    of zero on the equity dividend yield. The data decisively reject that restriction.

        The resulting estimates can be used to compute the implied values of the dividend tax

rate, r, and the effective capital-gains tax rate, ~~, under the assumption our alternative model

is correct.     The implied value of T is 48.6         percent, while the implied value of ~= is 17.0

percent.      Keep in mind that these are not estimates of the tax rate under any particular tax

code, but rather estimates         based on forty years of data that span several tax regimes.

Viewed in this light, the estimates seem reasonable.            The effect iv~ capital-gains tax rate has

long been recognized to fall well below the statutory tax rate; Feldstein and Summers (1 979)

divided the statutory rate by four to allow for the effects of deferral of realization, and basis

step-up at death.      The estimated dividend tax rate of nearly fifty percent is somewhat        higher

than the top statutory marginal tax rate in the post-1 986 period, but is well within the range

of marginal tax rates in earlier years.

        The last three~ows of Table 2 present estimates of the same equation for the 1982:1-

1994:12       time period.   Because marginal tax rates vary less in this period than between this

period and earlier years, we thought that the regression might work better for these years

alone. This conjecture, however, was not confirmed.              The regression results suggest that the

coefficients     are not stable over time.    When we relate the yield spread to either the taxable

bond yield or the dividend yield in a bivariate regression, the coefficient          estimates continue

to be positive and statistically        significant.     When    both variables are included together,

however,       the coefficient   estimate   on the taxable      bond yield is positive and that on the



                                                       12
dividend yield is negative (and statistically significant).

        The subsample instability in Table 2 calls attention to our aggregation          of data from

many different    tax regimes.      Therefore,   we next consider specifications      that allow      for

variation in tax rates over time.    In particular, we estimate


                                                                                                     (7)


If our alternative model is correct and if we use the correct marginal tax rates for the investors

who are determining      prices in these asset markets,       then the alternative    model predicts

coefficient   estimates of u’ = B’ = 1.

        To estimate this equation,      we construct variables based on the marginal tax rates

facing highest-income    individuals.   We use two measures of the effective         capital-gains    tax

rate: the statutory rate and one quarter of the statutory rate. As we noted earlier, the latter

approach is used by Feldstein and Summers (1 979) to allow for the effects of deferral of

realization and basis step-up at death.     We then construct synthetic variables by multiplying

these tax parameters by the return on taxable bonds and the dividend yields.            We use these

synthetic variables in the above regression.

        The results are in Table 3. In some ways, the results are supportive of the model.                 In

all cases, the coefficients   are statistically significant and of the correct sign. For the entire

sample, the fit is better than for the comparable          regression in Table 2, which implicitly

assumes constant tax rates. Moreover, the results are more robust over subsamples.              On the

other hand, the coefficients      are not always       of the right magnitude.   In particular,      the

coefficient on the dividend-yield variable, although always positive and significant, is less than

the value of unity predicted by the alternative theory.

4. Conclusion

       Traditional    analyses of how taxes affect the yield spread between taxable and tax-

exempt bonds have assumed that a single class of taxable investors is indifferent                  between

holding these two securities.     This paper has proposed and examined an alternative model of

the pricing of municipal       bonds,    in which   there    is heterogeneity      in investor    type   and

segmentation in the bond market. Taxable investors hold tax-exempt bonds, while tax-exempt

investors hold taxable bonds.      What links the investors, and the two bond markets, is that

both investors hold equities.       The model generates          the novel prediction that the spread

between taxable and tax-exempt          bond yields depends on the dividend yield paid by equities,

as well as on the taxable interest rate and on the marginal tax rates for dividends and capital

gains. The time-series data gives some support to this prediction, although the results are not

completely consistent with the simple model presented here.

        One natural extension of the model developed here would allow for investors who can

hold assets in both taxable       and tax-exempt         form.    Individual   investors   with   access to

Individual Retirement Accounts, Keogh plans, 401 (k) accounts, or similar investment vehicles

can reduce their tax burden by allocating assets among accounts                   according to their tax

characteristics.     Such-a model can potentially explain some of the anomalous results reported

here. In Table 3, for example, we reported that the equity dividend yield, adjusted by the tax

rate, has a significant impact on the spread between taxable and tax-exempt                bond yields, but

that the size of the effect is smaller than the model predicts.         Perhaps the explanation is that

individuals hold low-dividend stocks in their taxable account and high-dividend stocks in their

tax-exempt   account.     Such behavior would lower the effective tax rate on dividends and, as

a result, reduce the impact of the dividend yield on the spread between bond yields.

        The generaI lesson from our analysis is the importance of considering assets other than



                                                    14
taxable bonds when modelling the yield on municipal bonds.      In this sense, we have built on

the analysis of Green (1 993),   who considers a model with various kinds of taxable bonds,

some selling at par and others selling below par.       In his model, tax-exempt         bonds are

arbitraged to yield returns comparable   to those on favorably-taxed   taxable bonds, not par

bonds.   Our analysis shares the insight that explaining the pricing of tax-favored      securities

may be easier if one expands the set of assets that investors are able to hold.       Yet it also

suggests that for analyzing the yield spread between taxable and tax-exempt       bonds, it may

be important to consider developments     in equity as well as fixed-income   markets.
