                                         ABSTRACT

Have bank regulatory policies and unconventional monetary policies—and any possible
interactions—been a factor behind the recent “deglobalisation” in cross-border bank lending? To
test this hypothesis, we use bank-level data from the UK—a country at the heart of the global
financial system. Our results suggest that increases in microprudential capital requirements tend
to reduce international bank lending and some forms of unconventional monetary policy can
amplify this effect. Specifically, the UK’s Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) significantly
amplified the effects of increased capital requirements on cross-border lending. Quantitative
easing did not appear to have a similar effect. We find that this interaction between
microprudential regulations and the FLS can explain roughly 30% of the contraction in aggregate
UK cross-border bank lending between mid-2012 and end-2013, corresponding to around 10% of
the global contraction in cross-border lending. This suggests that unconventional monetary policy
designed to support domestic lending can have the unintended consequence of reducing foreign
lending.

1. Introduction

         Global financial intermediation has changed significantly since 2008. Cross-border
capital flows have contracted sharply (Figure 1), mainly due to a reduction in
international bank lending. In contrast, FDI and international portfolio exposures have
not declined by nearly as much and have bounced back since the 2008 crisis (Figure 2).
This evolution in cross-border bank lending has been described as “financial
deglobalisation” (Forbes, 2014) and “the great cross-border bank deleveraging” (Cerutti
and Claessens, 2014). It can be divided into two stages: the sharp initial contraction that
occurred during the crisis, and a more recent decline that began in 2012—what we refer
to as the “second phase of banking deglobalisation”. This most recent decline in
international lending stands in sharp contrast to the relative stability in domestic bank
lending over the same period, in both the UK and the world (Figure 3). Proposed
explanations for the initial phase of banking deglobalisation include government
intervention in the banking system (Rose and Wieladek, 2014), increased home bias
(Giannetti and Laeven, 2012), reduced demand for loans, and reduced availability of
wholesale funding for banks. 1 Although a substantial literature has analysed various
effects of regulatory and unconventional monetary policy, no previous work has
examined whether these policies could be an important factor behind this contraction in
global banking. 2 Also, no other work has studied the second phase of banking
deglobalisation. This paper aims to fill these gaps.
         Many countries have significantly tightened bank regulations over the past few
years (such as shown in Figure 4a for UK capital requirements) in order to strengthen the
resilience of their financial systems. At the same time, many of the world’s major central
banks pursued unconventional monetary policies, such as quantitative easing (shown in
Figure 4b for the UK), and credit easing aimed at stimulating aggregate demand. While
these policies are obvious candidate explanations for the contraction in cross-border bank



1 See Cerutti and Claessens (2014) and Forbes (2014) for more detailed discussion of various potential causes.
2 Most papers examining the impact of unconventional monetary policy focus on the effects on domestic and international
financial market prices. Fratzscher, Lo Duca, and Straub (2013), Ahmed and Zlate (2013), and Koepke (2014) are some of the
few examples of papers which instead assess the impact on global capital flows, especially to emerging markets.

                                                                                                                             1
lending, there are several reasons why no other work has evaluated their effects
empirically. First, distinguishing between cross-border loan supply and demand is
difficult. Second, the temporal clustering of these different policies, in direct response to
the financial crisis in most countries, makes disentangling their individual effects
challenging using only time-series data. Finally, it is difficult (if not impossible) to obtain
the necessary data on all the relevant policies in most countries.
          This paper is able to address these challenges with a unique UK dataset combined
with the policy responses of the UK over this period. The dataset includes external bank
lending by country, which we have merged with detailed regulatory data 3 on
microprudential capital requirements, as well as with information on bank balance sheets
and different forms of unconventional monetary policy. The resulting bank-country-time
panel allows us to separate country-specific loan demand from supply via country-time
effects (as in Aiyar et al., 2014). The UK also actively used different regulatory and
unconventional monetary policies after the peak of the financial crisis: UK quantitative
easing was conducted from 2009-2013; micro-prudential regulatory requirements were
adjusted throughout; and the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS), a policy designed to
stimulate domestic lending, was introduced in July 2012. Finally, the UK is an ideal case
study because UK-resident banks are at the heart of the global financial system and have
played a major role in the deglobalisation of bank flows. 4 Consequently, this dataset and
the interplay of various UK policies over this time period allow us to identify and tackle
the important question of what has caused the recent contraction in international bank
lending.
          Our results suggest that increases in capital requirements, and their interactions
with certain types of unconventional monetary policies, have led to a significant
reduction in international bank lending. We find that an increase in a bank’s capital
requirement of 100 basis points leads to a contraction in its external lending growth of

3 To construct a continuous series of microprudential capital requirements, it was necessary to merge data across three different

regulatory forms, as reporting requirements changed substantially over this time period.
4 UK banks provide more international loans (bank-to-bank assets) than any other country in the world, with 15% of

international interbank activity booked in the UK and the average UK bank lending to 53 countries. Cross-border UK bank
assets and liabilities both contracted by over 2% of global GDP from 2008Q4 through 2013Q4—the largest contraction in
global interbank activity corresponding to an individual country over this period.

                                                                                                                               2
about 3.4%. For banks which specialised in FLS-eligible lending (before the introduction
of this policy), the effects of increased capital requirements were amplified by a
significant amount. More specifically, the same increase in a bank’s capital requirement
led to a larger contraction in external lending under the FLS—with estimates suggesting a
substantial amplification effect for the average bank. The evidence suggests that this is not
the case for quantitative easing (QE). The main results on the significant effects of
increased capital regulations and its interaction with the FLS on international lending are
robust to different data cleaning techniques and the inclusion of various control variables.
These results are also robust to an alternative estimation framework aimed at addressing
any potential endogeneity between capital requirements and international bank lending,
as well as to regulatory changes in liquidity regulation over this time period (which could
have also contributed to the contraction in bank-to-bank lending).
         A more detailed analysis of the different components of the FLS program supports
these main findings and provides additional detail on precisely how this type of credit
easing interacted with and amplified the impact of capital regulations. This significant
interaction between the FLS and increased capital regulations only occurred when the
full FLS program—targeted at supporting both household and non-financial corporate
(PNFC) lending—was in place. The interactions are less powerful during the second
phase of the FLS—aimed at supporting only the much smaller component of PNFC
lending. This is not surprising, since household mortgage lending is a much larger
fraction of UK bank lending than PNFC lending. 5
         Moreover, we document that this effect is only present for international bank-to-
bank (but not bank-to-nonbank) lending, which is the type of lending behind the recent
decline in cross-border banking flows since 2012 (as shown in Figures 5a and 5b). These
results support the thesis that the interaction of increased capital requirements with the
FLS (which began in 2012) may have contributed to the ‘second phase of banking
deglobalisation’. We also find evidence that these spillovers from changes in UK policy



5
 Bridges et al. (2014) note that mortgages make up 65% of total UK domestic real sector lending, with PNFC lending making
up the remaining 35%.

                                                                                                                            3
on international bank lending can vary across countries. For example, countries with
stronger bank capital regulations experienced a smaller reduction in cross-border bank
lending after changes in UK capital requirements.
          In order to assess if our estimates based on UK microeconomic data can explain a
meaningful amount of the total contraction in international bank flows, however, it is
necessary to aggregate the results. Based on conservative assumptions, we calculate how
cross-border bank lending would have evolved in the absence of increased capital
requirements and their interaction with the FLS. This counterfactual 6 suggests that
international bank-to-bank lending would have been higher in the absence of tighter
capital requirements, and substantially higher in the absence of their interaction with the
FLS. This calculation suggests that the level of external UK (global) lending at the end of
the first phase of the FLS in 2013 was approximately 30% (10%) lower as a result of these
policies. This is striking as our estimates only capture the policy impact of one country—
and many other countries were simultaneously increasing bank regulations and adopting
various programs aimed at supporting domestic lending and the real economy. The effects
of these policies—and their interactions—could explain a significant share of the
reduction in international lending that occurred not only in the UK, but also in many
other countries. 7
          Overall, this series of results suggests that credit easing designed to support
domestic lending, such as the UK’s Funding for Lending scheme, might have the
unintended consequence of amplifying the impact of microprudential capital
requirements on external lending. The paper does not explicitly test for the domestic
effects 8 of these policies, and instead focuses on the spillover effects to other countries. 9
We show that the magnitude of these types of spillovers can be substantial and have
global repercussions, even if the country of origin is relatively small.10 An assessment of


6 Just as in any counterfactual exercise, the findings will be subject to the Lucas Critique, but they are nevertheless useful to
demonstrate the scale and economic significance of our results.
7 See Forbes (2014) for details on the contraction in cross-border lending by country over this period.

8 Since these policies were explicitly aimed at domestic activity, our focus on the cross-border impact makes identification

easier, since reverse causality is less of an issue.
9
  The latter is easier to identify since the policy was not intentionally aimed at reducing cross-border lending.

the welfare consequences is beyond the scope of this paper, but the results have
widespread implications for issues such as: the availability of credit, country vulnerability
to foreign and domestic shocks, and the effectiveness of monetary policy.
          The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the various
regulatory and unconventional monetary policies adopted by the UK during this period,
explains why these policies and their interactions could impact cross-border lending, and
summarizes the data. Section 3 develops the empirical framework and presents the main
results, including a series of robustness tests. Section 4 presents five extensions: an
analysis of the different phases of the FLS; a breakdown of the impact on different types
of international lending; a closer look at whether a country’s macroeconomic and
macroprudential characteristics affected these banking spillovers from UK policies; tests
for the impact of changes in liquidity regulations; and an analysis to address endogeneity
concerns. Section 5 calculates the aggregate effects on international bank lending implied
by the results and Section 6 concludes.


2. UK Bank Capital Regulations, Unconventional Monetary Policy and their Potential
Interactions


2.1 Background on UK Policies
          Since the introduction of Basel I in 1988, bank capital requirements in most
countries were set at a fixed value, at or above the minimum of 8 percent of risk-
weighted assets. In the UK, however, regulators also set bank-specific capital
requirements, otherwise known as minimum trigger ratios 11, to address operational, legal
or interest rate risks, which were not accounted for in Basel I (Francis and Osborne,
2012). Within this regulatory framework, capital requirements were split into two pillars.
Pillar 1 capital requirements are set at the minimum Basel I 8 percent level and are meant
to capture credit and market risks. Pillar 2 capital requirements are supplementary add-



11
  A trigger ratio is the technical term for capital requirement, since regulatory intervention would be triggered if the bank
capital to risk-weighted asset ratio fell below this minimum threshold.

                                                                                                                                5
ons, meant to capture risks that were not contained in the first pillar, that differed across
individual banks, and which were changed at the supervisors’ discretion. They were
reviewed either on an on-going basis or every 18 to 36 months. This regulatory regime
was first implemented by the Bank of England, before responsibility was handed to the
Financial Services Authority (FSA) in 1997.
          These Pillar 2 capital requirements are the main variable of interest in this paper.
Understanding how they are determined and what they represent is therefore important
for the estimation and identification in this paper. The FSA-based regulatory decisions for
banks relied on a system of guidelines called ARROW (Advanced Risk Responsive
Operating frameWork), which covered a wide array of criteria related to operational,
management, business as well as many other risks. 12 Econometric analysis 13, anecdotal
evidence from senior policymakers’ speeches 14, and parliamentary inquiries into UK Bank
failures 15, all suggest that capital requirement changes within this regulatory framework
for the period from 1998 to 2006 were mainly determined by factors other than loan
growth or credit risk. Not surprisingly, following the failure of the British bank Northern
Rock and the financial crisis that started in 2007, there was a greater focus on credit risk
in setting microprudential capital requirements. 16
          During the time period analysed in this paper, UK authorities implemented two
main forms of unconventional monetary policy: quantitative easing (QE) and the Funding
for Lending Scheme (FLS). 17 Quantitative easing was initiated by the Bank of England in
March 2009 in response to the fall in demand associated with the onset of the global


12 The ARROW approach also encompassed prudential risks, but this was not one of the core supervision areas.
13 Aiyar et al. (2014) show that, while bank size and writeoffs appear to be important determinants of the level of capital
requirements in the cross-section, bank balance sheet variables can typically not predict quarterly time variation in capital
requirements. Similarly, Aiyar et al. (2015) estimate a bank panel VAR model on PNFC loan growth and capital requirement
changes. They find evidence of causality running from changes in capital requirements to loan growth, but not vice versa.
14 In his high-level review of UK financial regulation prior to the financial crisis of 2008, Lord Turner (then chief executive of

the FSA), concluded that: ‘Risk Mitigation Programs set out after ARROW reviews therefore tended to focus more on
organisation structures, systems and reporting procedures, than on overall risks in business models’ (Turner, 2009).
15 The inquiry into the failure of the British bank Northern Rock concluded that ‘under ARROW I there was no requirement

on supervisory teams to include any developed financial analysis in the material provided to ARROW Panels’ (FSA, 2008).
16 This is discussed in more detail in Section 3.1 and our regression analysis considers how changes in bank-specific credit risk

and international exposures might affect a banks’ Pillar 2 capital requirement. Section 4.5 reports an analysis aimed at
addressing any potential bias resulting from endogeneity.
17 Earlier versions of this paper also investigated the impact of forward guidance, which was implemented at the end of the

period. Measuring and calibrating forward guidance is difficult, however, and results using different approaches were generally
insignificant and not robust to various iterations of the model.

                                                                                                                                6
financial crisis in the UK. Under this program the Bank of England purchased a pre-
announced stock of sovereign debt.18 To avoid issues arising from the lack of stationarity,
we identify changes in quantitative easing in our econometric analysis by using
announcements on the flow of purchases.
          The second main form of unconventional monetary policy was credit easing in the
form of the Funding for Lending Scheme. This program was announced in June 2012 and
coordinated between the Bank of England and Her Majesty’s Treasury (HMT). This was
specifically designed to increase bank lending by ensuring that high bank funding costs
and capital constraints within the British banking system did not impede lending to the
UK’s real economy. This scheme consisted of several components—which we exploit in
our econometric approach to help better identify the impact of this policy. First, the FLS
provided funding to participating institutions for an extended period at below market
rates, which likely led to lower interbank funding costs and hence lower effective interest
rates on mortgage and PNFC loans in the UK.19 Even institutions that did not directly
participate in the scheme would presumably have benefited from this reduction in
interbank funding costs. The cost at which banks were able to borrow from the FLS
facility was decreasing in the amount of the Bank’s “FLS-eligible” lending—which was
initially defined as lending to PNFCs and households.
          A second component of the program provided preferential capital treatment for
specific FLS-eligible lending in order to stimulate domestic lending. More specifically, as
discussed above, UK-regulated banks are subject to a minimum 8% capital requirement
(Pillar 1) and bank-specific capital requirements (Pillar 2). These bank-specific capital
requirements can be split into different components, one of which is the “capital-
planning buffer” (also referred to as Pillar 2b). Banks were expected to hold this capital-
planning buffer on top of the total minimum capital requirement (consisting of the 8%
Pillar 1 requirement and any other Pillar 2 capital requirements). When the bank’s actual



18 This was different than the US program of QE, which focused on the flow of asset purchases and included purchases of
government debt, as well as mortgage-backed securities.
19
   The FLS allows participants to borrow UK Treasury Bills in exchange for eligible collateral, which consists of all collateral
eligible in the Bank’s Discount Window Facility.

                                                                                                                                   7
buffer falls below the bank’s planning buffer, this usually triggers heightened scrutiny
from regulators. Under the FLS, however, banks were allowed to apply for permission to
reduce this capital-planning buffer by the amount of capital that was pledged on FLS-
eligible lending. While the receipt of this Pillar 2b offset was not automatic and banks
had to apply for it, this option to offset capital buffers for certain types of lending under
the FLS would likely have changed the value that banks attached to FLS-eligible versus
other types of lending.
       A final key aspect of the FLS was how it was changed over time. In response to the
improvement in household credit availability and conditions and renewed momentum in
house price inflation, the subsidy to household lending under the FLS was removed on
January 1st 2014. More specifically, both components of the FLS (the eligibility to count
towards the type of net lending that warrants additional borrowing allowances from the
FLS, as well as the capital offset option) were ended for household lending, but not for
PNFC lending (which had shown less improvement). It was hoped that removing the
support for household lending, but keeping the program in place for PNFC lending,
would encourage banks to lend more to PNFCs, including small businesses. These two
different phases of the FLS therefore provide a natural experiment to further test and
explore how various components of the policy affected cross-border lending.
       Finally, unconventional monetary policy (in the forms of QE or the FLS) could
interact with changes in microprudential regulation (in the form of bank capital
requirements) to have different effects on domestic and external lending growth through
their different effects on risk weights. The UK, as for all other European countries,
adopted Basel II and the corresponding model-based risk weights. Unconventional
monetary policy could affect these risk weights in a number of ways—such as by affecting
the outlook for the UK macroeconomy, loan terms and interest rates. For example, for
mortgage lending these risk weights are based on the loan interest rate, the risk of
unemployment, and loan terms (such as the LTV ratio). Any of these variables could be
affected by unconventional monetary policy, thereby providing a direct interaction
between these policies, risks weights, and bank lending.


                                                                                                8
2.2. Why Capital Requirements, Unconventional Monetary Policy, and their Interactions
could affect International Bank Lending
          Economic theory suggests that tighter capital requirements after the crisis could
partially account for the observed reduction in cross-border lending. Figure 6a illustrates
that a rise in capital requirements can lead to a decline in risk-weighted assets and
lending. But for this to be the case, i) bank equity needs to be more expensive than bank
debt; and ii) capital requirements need to be a binding constraint on a bank’s actual
capital choice. Theory 20 and evidence 21 suggests that this is the case. Indeed, a series of
Bank of England research papers on the UK, summarized in Appendix A, documents the
negative impact on loan supply following a rise in capital requirements.22 Taken at face
value, the findings from this literature would suggest that the steep rise in
microprudential capital requirements since 2009 would generate a substantial contraction
in bank loans, split between domestic and external assets.
          The decision on which type of lending to contract, however, may depend on the
presence of unconventional monetary policies, including through their impact on relative
risk weights. If equity is expensive and capital buffers binding, the only way to adjust
quickly to higher capital requirements is to reduce risk-weighted assets. This is most
easily achieved by reducing those loans with the highest risk weights. In contrast,
reducing assets with a zero percent risk weight, such as government debt, will not reduce
risk-weighted assets at all. Moreover, UK banks have adopted model-based risk weights
since 2008, which are typically based on borrower risk and loan terms. These models
typically suggest that the probability of default, and hence the risk weights, for mortgage


20 Condition i) implies a failure for banks of the Modigliani-Miller (1958) theorem, as otherwise changes in capital
requirements do not need to affect a bank’s cost of funding. But economic theory provides reasons for why condition i) should
be satisfied, such as asymmetric information (Myers and Majluf, 1984) and different tax treatment for debt and equity.
21 Similarly, empirical work documenting the impact of adverse shocks to bank capital on loan growth, as in Bernanke (1983)

and Peek and Rosengren (1997, 2000) provides support for this assumption. Several other empirical studies also suggest that
condition ii) is likely to be satisfied, with wide-ranging evidence that capital requirements were a binding constraint on banks’
choices of capital structure during the 1998-2011 period. See Appendix A.
22 In theory, higher capital requirements could increase lending at banks with very low or negative net worth, particularly if

they help to address the debt overhang problem. Similarly, in the medium-run, improvements in the stability of the banking
system that result from higher capital requirements could improve banks’ abilities to raise funds in the market. Given the time
period of this study, however, the effect of the decline in loan supply is expected to dominate in the short run.

                                                                                                                               9
lending increases in unemployment risk, the LTV ratio, and the loan interest rate. As
illustrated in Figure 6b, if unconventional monetary policy lowers interest rates or
improves the economic outlook and hence reduces the risk weight, it will skew an
individual bank’s incentives to reduce one type of lending over another in response to
higher capital requirements. Conceptually, this is how policies such as quantitative easing
could interact with changes in microprudential requirements.
       The FLS, a type of credit easing, was specifically designed to reduce bank funding
costs and increase bank lending in targeted sectors. The cost of funds borrowed directly
from the facility was decreasing with the amount of the new FLS-eligible (i.e., household
and PNFC sector) lending by the borrowing bank. This is likely to have contributed to a
general decline in bank funding costs (see Churm et al., 2015). Moreover, the
corresponding pass-through to interest rates should have had a direct negative impact on
the probability of default and hence risk weights associated with UK bank loans, just like
with QE. As discussed above, the FLS had an additional effect of providing preferential
capital treatment for FLS-eligible lending. This differential treatment by loan type could
have further reduced risk weights on FLS-eligible domestic lending. This would have
made qualified domestic lending relatively less capital intensive than international
lending. Figure 6b shows that, through these channels, the FLS could have magnified the
impact of coincident changes in microprudential capital requirements on external
lending. Finally, when the definition of FLS-eligible lending was changed in 2014 to
exclude household lending (but still included PNFC lending), this would be expected to
weaken any impact of such policies on the transmission of capital requirements on cross-
border lending. The effect of this change in the FLS could be substantive because
household lending forms a relatively larger share of UK banks’ balance sheets.


2.3 Data
       Appendix B provides information on the data that is used for our main regression
analysis. Table B1 defines each of the variables and explains how they were constructed.
Table B2 provides summary statistics. Our main dependent variable of interest, country-


                                                                                           10
specific cross-border bank lending, is volatile in its raw form, with some suspicious
outliers in the growth rate of lending. 23 We therefore adopt several data cleaning
strategies (with alternatives discussed in the sensitivity analysis). In our base case, we
drop any growth rates of external lending that are greater than 100% in absolute value.
We also drop small recipient countries (those with less than £500 million in received
funds on average) and bank-country lending pairs if the stock of lending did not exceed
£1 million on average. 24 Figure 7 shows the histogram of changes in one of our main
variables, the change in the bank-specific capital requirements, both before and after
2007. This figure suggests that the number of increases in capital requirements is greater
during the more recent period.


3. Empirical Framework and Central Results
           This section begins by discussing the framework to test each of the proposed
hypotheses about how microprudential capital requirements and their interactions with
unconventional monetary policies affect international bank lending. Then it reports the
main results and a series of robustness checks.


3.1 Empirical Framework
           Our central framework to test the proposed hypotheses about the effects and
interactions of regulatory and unconventional monetary policy on cross-border bank
lending is the following regression model:


                 3

     ∆𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = � ∆𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 �𝛽𝛽𝑘𝑘 + 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑡𝑡 + 𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡 + 𝜌𝜌𝑘𝑘 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 + 𝜎𝜎𝑘𝑘 (𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡 ∗ 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 )� + 𝛾𝛾(𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡 ∗ 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 )
                𝑘𝑘=0

                              +𝛬𝛬𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 +𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,


23
   UK bank lending refers to the lending of both UK-owned banks and foreign subsidiaries in the UK, i.e., entities subject to UK
capital regulation.
24 We only consider observations of bank-lending pairs if the stock of lending exceeds a share of 0.2% in the current or the

preceding quarter’s total stock of external lending (rather than large percent changes relative to small stocks). Keeping only
significant portfolios ensures that we focus on economically meaningful changes in external lending. The 0.2% is chosen
because it is one tenth of the average portfolio share for UK banks (which is 2%) - i.e., the average UK banks lend to 50
countries. Results are robust to choosing a higher threshold.

                                                                                                                                     11
where ∆𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the growth rate of lending by bank i to country j at time t. In other words,

the dependent variable is bilateral cross-border lending by the UK-incorporated PRA
regulated entity. ∆𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the rise 25 in bank i’s minimum capital requirement (in percent
of risk-weighted assets) in quarter t. Following previous work by Aiyar et al. (2014), the
contemporaneous value and three lags of this term are included to allow lending to adjust
gradually to changes in the regulatory ratio. 𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑡𝑡 is the announced flow of asset purchases,
scaled by 2009Q1 UK nominal GDP. This only varies with time, which means that, unless
interacted, it is absorbed by the time effects. 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡 is a dummy variable that takes the
value of zero until 2012Q2, and the value of 1 thereafter. This also only varies with time
and is meant to capture the idea that during this time period, all UK banks benefited from
the option to apply for beneficial capital weighting, regardless of their direct participation
in the scheme. The key to identification is that the extent to which the enactment of the
FLS will skew a bank’s incentive to cut back one type of lending versus another will
depend upon the fraction of FLS-eligible to total lending 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 (which then merits the
reduced risk weighting). 26 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡 is therefore interacted with 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 , the pre-FLS 2012Q2
fraction of FLS-eligible to total lending on bank i’s balance sheet, to capture its effect. To
complete the specification, these terms are also interacted with ∆𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 independently.
          This simple design has one feature worth highlighting: 𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , the country-specific,

time-fixed effects, is a way of asking whether the same country in the same time period
borrowing from multiple UK-incorporated banks experiences a larger decline in lending
from the bank facing a relatively greater increase in minimum capital requirements. This


25 Most studies of UK capital requirement changes (i.e. Bridges et al., 2014; Aiyar et al., 2014a) pool capital requirement
increases and decreases into one variable. This is because for the time period that they consider (1997-2007), it is not possible
to reject the null hypothesis that the sums of coefficients on capital requirement increases and decreases are the same. As
shown in Appendix Table B3, however, this hypothesis can be rejected at the 5% confidence level for the period 2010-2015.
This may not be surprising given that banks may have held back on expanding lending when faced with a loosening in capital
requirements in preparation of higher banking-system wide requirements due to the introduction of Basel III. Therefore, for
the remainder of the paper, we only model and study the impact of capital requirement increases (tightening).
26 The change in the relative risk-weights of cross-border to domestic lending only applies to new lending. The fraction of the

existing stock of these types of lending on the balance sheet is likely to reflect a bank’s business model. Clearly, if a bank
specialises in domestic lending, one would expect a relatively larger pull back in non-core activities, such as cross-border bank
lending. On the other hand, a bank that mostly specialises in cross-border bank lending would probably not cut back cross-
border lending more relative to domestic lending. It is of course possible that banks chose to change their specialisation in
response to the FLS. But given any lack of indication that this policy was permanent, this strikes us as unlikely.

                                                                                                                              12
term is therefore the direct analogue of the firm-specific, fixed-effects methodology
pioneered by Khwaja and Mian (2008) to absorb changes in demand conditions. Since the
comparison is across banks for the same country in a given time period, all demand
shocks in country j at time t should be absorbed by this term.
          An important assumption in this regression model is that ∆𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is exogenous with
respect to external lending by bank i in country j. Aiyar et al. (2014) document that the
word ‘cross-border lending’ was not even mentioned in regulatory guidelines pre-2006.
This concern is more likely after the global financial crisis, however, when regulators
paid more attention to bank-specific vulnerabilities and adjusted capital requirements
more regularly (as discussed in Section 2.1). We take two approaches to addressing any
potential econometric bias from this reverse causality.
          First, our main dependent variable of interest is cross-border bank lending by
bank i to country j at time t. As discussed in Section 2.1, capital requirements can be split
into two pillars; Pillar 1 which is set at the minimum Basel I 8 percent level and is meant
to capture credit and market risks, and Pillar 2 which are supplementary add-ons,
changed at the supervisors’ discretion, and meant to capture risks not contained in the
first pillar. Pillar 2 capital requirements, the main variable of interest in this paper,
would therefore only be changed in response to external exposures to one individual
country if these were not adequately captured by the credit risk component in the first
pillar. Conceptually, one would therefore expect any omitted variable and endogeneity
bias to be less severe for external than for domestic lending or total credit growth, and
especially for external lending to one specific country. 27
          Nonetheless, endogeneity may still be a concern, so we also adapt a second
approach that goes further and is discussed in detail in Section 4.5 and Appendix C. This
extension explicitly tests for any effects of endogeneity and other bank-specific omitted
variables by modelling the backward and forward-looking determinants of capital



27This could of course be different for lending to the home country of the bank, such as in the case of the Icelandic banks in
the UK. Similarly, some countries might be riskier than others and prudential regulators may set capital requirements in
response to very quickly growing exposure to one particular country. Country-time effects should pick up some of these
concerns, but not all.

                                                                                                                             13
requirements and separately identifying the exogenous and endogenous components of
increases in capital requirements. We use the residuals from this analysis as a measure of
increases in capital requirements that are exogenous and do not result from changes in
balance sheet risk. Our main results using the alternative measure of capital requirements
are very similar, and often stronger relative to the baseline, across a number of
specifications. This is precisely what would be expected if the degree of endogeneity has
become smaller under the alternative approach.
          Finally, this main framework used in this paper easily maps into several different
testable hypotheses. First, to examine how increases in capital requirements affect
external lending, we sum the 𝛽𝛽𝑘𝑘 coefficients and use an F-test to assess if this sum is
different from zero. Second, to assess how QE has affected the transmission of changes in
capital requirements, we sum the 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 coefficients and also use an F-test. Third, to test for
the impact of the FLS interacted with capital requirements, we also sum the above with
the 𝜎𝜎𝑘𝑘 coefficients and perform another F-test. We can also test for independent effects of
the FLS (with the 𝛾𝛾 coefficient). This framework therefore allows us to simultaneously
test for the effects of microprudential regulations, and how these microprudential policies
have interacted with unconventional policies such as QE and the FLS.
          Economic theory predicts that the sign of the main coefficient measuring the
direct impact of increased capital regulations, ∑3𝑘𝑘=0 𝛽𝛽𝑘𝑘, should be negative. If equity is

expensive and capital requirements are a binding constraint on an individual bank’s
choice of capital structure, one would expect that an increase in capital requirements
would generate a reduction in loan supply. As discussed above, QE would be expected to
have a greater impact on domestic relative to external risk weights, so that reducing
external lending would be a more effective way to respond to increased regulations than
reducing domestic lending. In other words, QE would amplify the effect of increased
regulations on external lending and the sign on ∑3𝑘𝑘=0 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 would be expected to be
negative.28 The FLS probably reduced interbank funding costs, and hence loan terms and



 Note that a positive value of the QE variable is expansionary monetary policy. A negative coefficient is therefore consistent
28

with amplifying the effect of changes in capital requirements.

                                                                                                                            14
interest rates, in the UK. FLS-eligible lending also provided the option to apply for a
capital offset to all banks, regardless of their participation in the scheme. For all of these
reasons, the FLS would be expected to have had a much stronger impact on domestic, as
opposed to external, risk weights. Therefore, the predicted sign on ∑3𝑘𝑘=0 𝜎𝜎𝑘𝑘 would also be
negative, as the FLS would also amplify the effect of increased regulations on external
lending.


3.2 Baseline Results and Robustness Checks
          The resulting estimates of the model are presented in Table 1. Column 1 shows
that increases in capital requirements have a negative and statistically significant impact
on cross-border bank lending, as expected. 29 Column 2 adds the FLS term and its various
interactions. The coefficient on changes in capital requirements continues to be negative
and significant at the 5% level, as is the coefficient where this is interacted with the FLS
term and share of FLS-eligible lending. The sum of coefficients on the interaction is -
28.62, which seems large at first sight. This estimate, however, is for a bank with a
fraction value (𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 ) of 1, meaning that this bank only does FLS-eligible lending. Such a
bank would, of course, not engage in external lending and hence not enter our sample. A
more useful way to interpret this estimate is for the value of the FLS interaction term for
the average bank in the sample, which is 0.153. This means that for the average bank, the
relevant coefficient is -4.3, which is of a similar magnitude as the coefficient on changes
in capital requirements. In other words, the presence of the FLS would, for the average
bank, roughly double the negative impact of increases in capital requirements on external
lending.
          Column 3 tests for a similar effect of QE. The sum of coefficients on the QE
interaction has the expected negative sign, but is not significantly different from zero.
This result is reinforced in columns 4 through 6, which each simultaneously control for



29The magnitude (of -3.39) is smaller than that reported in Aiyar et al. (2014). When we estimate our model up to 2006 only,
however, as done in their paper, the magnitude of the coefficient is closer to theirs. One potential explanation for the smaller
magnitude when more recent data is included is that the adoption of model-based risk weights introduced an additional
margin of adjustment in response to changes in capital requirements.

                                                                                                                              15
the effects of QE, the FLS and changes in capital regulations. The coefficients on the FLS
and QE interaction terms remain negative in each specification, but only the FLS
interactions are significant. Column 5 includes a number of additional controls for
individual bank characteristics. Column 6 reports the same analysis, but for easier
interpretation, rescales 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 (the fraction of FLS-eligible, to total, lending) to take a value of
one for the average bank. Since this scaling makes it easier to infer the effect for the
average bank from the tables directly (as shown above), we will use this rescaling for the
presentation of all subsequent results. Finally, column (7) shows that the point estimate
for our main variable of interest increases when excluding the ∆KR*QE interaction.
       Table 2 reports a series of robustness checks to the baseline from column 6 in
Table 1. These tests are particularly important in our analysis given the volatility and
noise in the banking data, especially for international loan growth. Columns 1 and 2 in
Table 2 show results when we winsorise the dependent variable at 1/99% and at 5/95%,
respectively. Column 3 clusters by country-time, as opposed to by bank-time as done in
the baseline. Column 4 shows estimates when the sample is restricted to larger banks,
defined as banks with an average balance sheet in excess of 2 billion pounds sterling. In
column (5), we exclude affiliates with a parent headquartered in the Euro Area (EA) and
in column (6), we include an interaction of KR*FLS*Fraction with a dummy that is 1 if
lending is to a country in the EA. Both of these extensions are aimed at testing if the
coincident crisis in this region significantly impacts the key results. As expected, our
country-quarter fixed effects appear to control sufficiently for demand in other parts of
the world (including the EA) and the interaction with the EA dummy does not turn out
to be significant or impact our key results. In column (7), we run the regression from
2008 Q3 onwards to make sure that the results hold in a post-crisis sample. In each of
these robustness tests, the variable capturing the interaction of the FLS, FLS-eligible
lending and increased capital requirements is negative and significant, confirming that
the presence of the FLS amplified the negative impact of increases in capital requirements
on cross-border lending.




                                                                                               16
       In columns (8) and (9), we perform two placebo tests to ensure that the timing of
the results agrees with the timing of the FLS. In column (8), we examine the impact of
switching the FLS dummy on in 2008 Q3 – before the FLS was announced. As expected,
this yields different results. The coefficient drops in size and loses significance. In column
(9), we let this adjusted dummy equal one until 2012 Q2 – i.e., the part of the post-crisis
period before the FLS was introduced. Excluding the FLS period now yields a positive and
insignificant coefficient on the main variable of interest, providing further assurance that
our results are indeed driven by the introduction of the FLS.
       The key results are robust across these various iterations in Tables 1 and 2, and the
estimated magnitudes of the key coefficients are quite stable. Increases in capital
regulation tend to decrease cross-border bank lending and the FLS significantly magnifies
this effect of capital regulations on international lending. This magnification effect is
substantial and estimated to roughly double the magnitude of the impact of increases in
capital requirements for the average bank. QE may also have magnified the effects of
capital regulations on cross-border bank lending, but any such impact is estimated to be
substantially smaller and usually insignificant. Therefore, different unconventional
monetary policies appear to have different effects. The Funding for Lending Scheme, a
credit easing policy targeted at boosting domestic bank lending, appears to have had the
consequence of reducing international bank lending.


4. Five Extensions: Two Phases of the FLS, Different Types of External Lending,
Receiving-Country Characteristics, Regulatory Changes in Liquidity, and Addressing
Endogeneity
       This section reports five extensions of our baseline model in order to address
specific aspects of UK regulatory and unconventional monetary policies, as well as
receiving-country policies, which could bias our results. First, it begins by analysing if
results change across the different phases of the FLS, which targeted different types of
lending. Second, it tests for different effects on different types of external lending—
namely bank-to-bank versus bank-to-nonbank international lending. Third, it controls


                                                                                             17
for different macroeconomic, institutional, and regulatory policies in countries receiving
UK bank lending. Fourth, it examines if changes in regulations related to liquidity
regulation could affect the results. Finally, it ends with a more detailed discussion of
potential endogeneity between external lending and capital requirements, including a
series of additional results aimed at addressing these concerns.


4.1 The Two Phases of the FLS
       As described in Section 2.1, the Funding for Lending Scheme was announced in
June 2012, but changed on January 1st 2014—about half way through our sample period.
More specifically, in response to an improvement in the housing market and household
credit conditions, the Bank of England and HMT decided to reduce both the funding
subsidy and the beneficial capital weighting for household lending. The preferential
terms for PNFC (private non-financial corporate) lending, however, were maintained.
Figures 8a and 8b show the fraction of FLS-eligible lending during the two phases of the
FLS. When household mortgage lending is included, the share of FLS-eligible lending
with respect to the total balance sheet is clearly much larger. Therefore, we would expect
that the impact of the FLS on relative risk weights, and hence the overall effects on
external lending through the interaction with capital requirements, would become
weaker after January 2014.
       To test this, column 1 of Table 3 repeats the base case analysis from column 6 of
Table 1, but includes two sets of FLS interaction terms: one set for the first phase of the
program that included household and PNFC lending; and one for the second phase which
only covers PNFC lending. The main coefficient of interest, the interaction between
changes in capital requirements and FLS-eligible lending, continues to be significant for
the first phase of the FLS. As expected, it is also slightly larger in magnitude than in the
estimates that include the full period of the FLS program. On the other hand, the same
interaction term is no longer significant in the second phase of the program—although
the coefficient still has the same negative sign. This is intuitive, since mortgage lending is
typically a much larger fraction of the average bank’s balance sheet than PNFC lending.


                                                                                               18
This result therefore provides some additional support that the estimation framework is
capturing the effects of the FLS as discussed above.
       One possible caveat to this conclusion is the introduction of the Basel III
definition of capital in the EU, and hence the UK, in January 2014. This coincides with
the onset of the second phase of the FLS. At first sight, this could affect the econometric
results presented above. But it is likely that the transition to Basel III capital standards
started well before the formal introduction in January 2014, since the details were known
ahead of time. From an economic perspective, this regulatory change would have led to
an additional tightening in capital standards. If changes in the FLS were irrelevant, we
should therefore observe an even greater impact on external lending. But our findings of
no significant effect are instead consistent with the interpretation that our econometric
estimate reflects the impact of the second phase of the FLS, rather than the formal
introduction of Basel III.


4.2 Effects on Different Forms of External Lending
       Next, it is also possible to decompose external bank lending data (both in BIS and
UK data), into lending to banks abroad and lending to non-banks abroad. Figures 5a and
5b show these two series for all BIS reporting banks as an aggregate and for the UK’s
banking system. These figures suggest that much of the contraction in external bank
lending, and virtually all of the contraction since 2012 (the “second phase” of bank
deglobalisation) is due to a contraction in bank-to-bank, as opposed to bank-to-nonbank,
cross-border lending.
       To test if credit easing or regulatory policy had different effects on these different
types of international bank flows, and in turn if this could explain these trends across
different types of bank lending, columns 2 and 3 of Table 3 reestimate the baseline model,
except now split the data into bank-to-bank and bank-to-nonbank lending. The
coefficient on which we have been focusing—the interaction between changes in
regulation and FLS-eligible lending, is only statistically significant for bank-to-bank
lending, but not bank-to-nonbank lending. It is also only statistically significant for the


                                                                                               19
first phase of the FLS, but not the second, as found in column 1. This interaction term is
also larger in magnitude when estimated only for bank-to-bank lending than for the
larger lending category. This result could arise from a number of factors, but it is
noteworthy that the sharpest contraction in cross-border capital flows—which occurred
in cross-border bank-to-bank lending—is for the type of flow most strongly affected by
the introduction of the full FLS program (and its interaction with capital regulations).
This supports the hypothesis that the FLS played a substantive role in explaining the
second phase of banking deglobalisation.


4.3 Impact of Receiving Country Characteristics
       The previous analysis has focused on how UK unconventional monetary policies
have amplified the effect of UK capital regulations on the international lending of UK
banks. But the policies and characteristics of the foreign countries that are receiving these
loans could also interact with UK regulations and make them more or less susceptible to
any spillovers. Avdjiev, Gambacorta, Goldberg and Schiaffi (2016) make this point when
they show that tighter capital requirements shield a given country from the negative
effects of global shocks on cross-border bank loans. Cetorelli and Goldberg (2012) also
document how country characteristics affected how global banks reallocated liquidity
internationally during the Global Financial Crisis. Could tighter capital requirements also
shield a given country from the effects of changes in another country’s policies that affect
its international bank lending? And could other country-specific characteristics—such as
its loan demand, domestic institutions, capital controls, and other regulatory policies—
either mitigate or magnify the spillover effects of UK policies on UK cross-border bank
lending?
       To test if receiving-country characteristics affect the extent of spillovers from UK
capital regulations, we focus on the variables that Koepke (2014) highlights as domestic
“pull factors” affecting cross-border bank lending. More specifically, we test for any
significant impact of: domestic macroeconomic indicators (GDP growth, domestic equity
returns, and country risk), the quality of domestic institutions (based on a rule-of-law


                                                                                           20
index), domestic macroprudential policies 30 (capital regulation, loan-to-value ratio caps,
and local currency reserve requirements), and/or or domestic capital controls (using a
broad measure of all controls on capital inflows and outflows). Appendix Tables B1 and
B2 provide more detailed definitions, data sources and summary statistics. Our goal is to
test whether any of these characteristics of foreign markets affect the spillovers from UK
regulatory policy, so we interact each of the variables above with the change in UK
capital requirements (∆KR). We continue to include all of the variables and interactions
from the base case, including all of the bank controls, as shown in Table 1, column 6. 31
          The results from including these various controls for receiving-country
characteristics are shown in Table 4. Columns (1) and (2) report results with the
additional controls for domestic macroeconomic indicators and institutional quality,
respectively. Columns (3) and (4) report results for the additional controls for
macroprudential regulations and capital controls, respectively. Data on two of these
macroprudential regulations (loan-to-value caps and local currency reserve requirements)
is more limited and significantly reduces the sample size. These two variables are also not
individually significant, and including them has no noteworthy impact on the other key
results, so we drop them in the remaining specifications. Column (5) then includes the
measures of macroprudential regulations and capital controls simultaneously. Column (6)
includes all the variables and column (7) includes only the variables which are significant
(at the 10% level) in at least one specification.
          The signs for each of the coefficient estimates are consistent across specifications
and suggest receiving country characteristics can be important. For example, the negative
coefficients on country risk and capital controls, and positive coefficient on institutions,
implies that after an increase in UK capital requirements, UK banks cut lending more to
countries with higher country risk, more capital controls, and weaker institutions. The
significance of these estimates, however, varies across specifications. The coefficient

(2015) database that have a good cross-country coverage.
31
   Quarterly variables such as returns and CDS spreads are lagged by one quarter before being interacted with capital
requirements. All cross-country variables (except indices) are winsorised at the 1% level.

                                                                                                                              21
estimate which has not only a consistent sign, but is also statistically significant across all
specifications, however, is the positive coefficient on capital regulations. This implies that
after an increase in UK capital requirements, UK banks cut lending less to countries with
stronger capital regulations.
          This significant coefficient on the impact of domestic regulations supports the
evidence in Avdjiev et al. (2016) that tighter capital requirements can “shield” a given
country from the negative effects of shocks that originate outside the country’s borders
(although in this case, the shock originated in one country ‒ the UK ‒ instead of being
global). These results are also consistent with recent evidence on the transmission of
macroprudential policies, which finds that in some cases cross-border lending can enjoy a
comparative advantage relative to domestic banks, as the foreign bank lending is not
always captured by tighter domestic capital requirements (Buch and Goldberg, 2016;
Reinhardt and Sowerbutts, 2015). 32
          To summarize, this extension provides some evidence that receiving country
characteristics can affect the extent to which a country is affected by spillovers from
changes in UK regulatory policies. Stronger macroprudential regulations, and possibly
fewer capital controls, lower risk ratings and stronger institutions, can partially mitigate
any spillover effects from changes in foreign regulatory policies. It is also worth noting
that the key result from our base analysis—the significant negative coefficient on the
interaction between capital regulations, the FLS and fraction of FLS lending, remains
negative and significant in each specification. This suggests that even after controlling for
a range of receiving-country characteristics, changes in UK regulatory and
unconventional monetary policy can significantly affect cross-border lending.


4.4 Impact of Regulatory Changes on Liquidity
          The reduction in international bank-to-bank lending during the first phase of the
FLS coincides with changes to liquidity regulation in the UK. We believe that these are



32
   Consistent with the latter paper, there was no comparable significant effect for regulations on loan-to-value caps or reserve
local currency reserve requirements, as shown in column (3).

                                                                                                                              22
unlikely to impact the main results and are, if anything, more likely to lead us to
underestimate the effect of the first phase of the FLS. Nonetheless, we perform two
empirical tests to ensure that our results are not biased by the coincident changes in
liquidity regulation.
          Basel III introduced liquidity coverage ratios (LCR), meaning that banks need to
hold a minimum fraction of high quality liquid assets on their balance sheets in order to
cover outflows of liabilities over specific stress scenarios. The regulatory definition of
high quality liquid assets (HQLA) includes government debt and central bank reserves,
but not interbank market loans, in order to reduce systemic risks. The latter has been
traditionally used by many banks for liquidity management purposes. It is therefore likely
that there is some substitution away from external (as well as domestic) interbank debt in
response to the introduction of LCR. In addition, banks could possibly sell illiquid assets
(both externally and domestically) as this would increase the ratio of HQLA to stressed
liability outflows. Within the European Union, the LCR was only introduced at 60% in
January 2015, increasing on a graduated basis until full implementation.
          The UK moved earlier than most countries in implementing liquidity regulations,
however, by introducing individual liquidity guidance (ILG), a prudential liquidity policy
similar to the LCR.33 There were two macroprudential changes to liquidity regulations in
the UK: first, the ILG requirements were relaxed in June 2012, by widening the collateral
eligible to count as liquid assets. Second, in June 2013, the FPC announced that it would
reduce the required LCR in 2015 to 80%, rising thereafter to reach 100% in 2018. The
long transition phase to the full LCR makes it unlikely that our main results, which are
for the period 2012Q3-2013Q4, are impacted. In addition, with the UK’s implementation,
liquidity requirements were – as described above - actually loosened in June 2012 and
2013. This would incentivise banks to substitute away from interbank lending by less,
which would cause our estimated effect of the FLS to understate the true effect.



33See Banerjee and Mio (2015) for a detailed description of the UK’s ILG regime and an empirical analysis of the ILG on banks’
sterling balance sheets. The ILG is, similar to the LCR, designed to make the banking system more resilient to liquidity shocks
by requiring banks to hold a minimum quantity of high quality liquid assets (HQLA) consisting of cash, central bank reserves
and government bonds to cover net outflows of liabilities under two stress scenarios lasting different periods.

                                                                                                                            23
       Nonetheless, to assess the possible impact of liquidity regulations, we perform two
exercises. The first is already reported in columns (5) through (7) of Table 1, where we
include the share of liquid assets in banks’ balance sheets as a control variable. The
variable is negative and insignificant, and does not meaningfully impact the results. For a
second test, we use data on the UK’s ILG regime to check whether the introduction of
ILG or subsequent tightening of the ILG percent requirement has any bearing on our
main results. Specifically, we define the variable Δ ILG as a dummy that is equal to 1 in
the quarter when ILG requirements were introduced or tightened and 0 otherwise. To
match the specification of capital requirements, we include the contemporaneous value
and three lags of this dummy. The bottom of Appendix Table B4 reports the tests of joint
significance. It shows that the introduction/tightening of ILG had a significantly negative,
albeit quantitatively small, effect on external bank lending. Moreover, column (2) shows
that the effect is insignificant for cross-border bank-to-bank lending, which is where the
greatest contraction in international lending occurred (as discussed in Section 1 and
shown in Figure 5). Most importantly, our main results on the interaction of the FLS with
capital requirements are not affected.


4.5 Potential Endogeneity between Capital Requirements and External Lending
       An important assumption in our main regression model in Section 3.1 is that
∆𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is exogenous with respect to external lending by bank i in country j. As discussed
in Section 2.1 and Section 4.4, however, the regulation of capital requirements around the
world has changed significantly since the Global Financial Crisis. There is now a greater
focus on balance sheet and credit risks. In the UK’s current regulatory regime, Pillar 1
capital requirements are meant to address credit and market risks directly. Changes in
Pillar 2 capital requirements, the main variable of interest in this study, are made at the
discretion of the regulator to address risks that are not believed to be captured in the
Pillar 1 capital requirement. If the first pillar captured all of the credit and market risks
contained in balance sheet variables, then one would expect changes in Pillar 2 to be
orthogonal to changes/growth rates in balance sheet and credit risks. This section tests


                                                                                                24
this proposition and then reports results from an alternative specification which attempts
to control for any endogeneity between capital requirements and external lending.
       To begin, we examine whether the current, lagged or annual growth rate of 31
different variables that supervisors could have taken into account in their regulatory
decisions predict changes in Pillar 2 capital requirements. Appendix C discusses the
estimation and approach in more detail. To summarize, we use single and Bayesian Model
Averaging regressions to identify the most important predictors of increases in capital
requirements. The results (in Appendix Table C2) suggest that the strongest predictors are
domestic lending growth to the real sector, financial and operating charges, and other
operating income. These variables alone explain 30% of the 𝑅𝑅 2 of increases in capital
requirements. This suggests that the majority of capital requirement increases are due to
non-balance sheet risk, in line with our initial assumption.
       Nonetheless, there is still a valid concern about endogeneity, so we pursue a
second and more formal approach to see if this could affect our central estimates. More
specifically, we use the key variables and results from above to predict increases in capital
requirements using two different models (as shown in Appendix Table C3 and discussed
in more detail in Appendix C). We then use the residuals from these two regressions as
two alternative measures of ∆𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 , which we refer to as ‘Model 1’ and’ Model 2’. These

should be more reflective of increases in capital requirements due to operational risk, as
opposed to credit and market risk, and should therefore not be affected by changes in
cross-border lending. In other words, these residuals are orthogonal to balance sheet
characteristics by construction.
       Table 5 reports regression results with these alternative and more exogenous
measures of capital requirements than used in the base case. Before discussing the results,
it is important to note that the baseline sample is different from the main regression
sample. This is because supervisors adopted a new regulatory form, the FSA003 form,
after the UK’s financial crisis in 2008. This form is a critical source of information to
identify key variables used in setting capital requirements during this relevant post-crisis
period. The availability of this form causes the number of observations in our sample to


                                                                                               25
shrink substantially from 47,421 to 13,411. Column 1 in Table 5 begins by evaluating if
this change in the sample affects the main results (while still using our initial measure of
changes in capital requirements). Reassuringly, the baseline results are robust to
estimating our regression model on this much shorter sample, although now the
estimated magnification effect of the FLS on changes in capital requirements is larger. 34
          Next, columns 2 and 3 show results when we use our constructed and more
exogenous measures of increases in capital requirements, i.e., the residual measures based
on the regressions that predict regulatory changes with detailed balance-sheet
information. The sum of our main coefficients of interest, ∑3𝑘𝑘=0 𝜎𝜎𝑘𝑘 , remains positive and
statistically significant, suggesting that our main results are robust to addressing
endogeneity. It is also worth noting that this coefficient is quantitatively larger than in
column 1. This could occur if any reverse-causality between external lending growth and
changes in capital requirements generates an upward bias in ∑3𝑘𝑘=0 𝜎𝜎𝑘𝑘 in a reduced-form
regression.
          Some authors argue that the contemporaneous term in panel time-series
regressions is subject to a greater endogeneity bias than the lagged dependent variables. 35
Therefore, we re-estimate our baseline model, but drop the contemporaneous capital
requirement term everywhere. The results are presented in columns (4) to (6) of Table 5,
for the baseline estimates and then the two models controlling for endogeneity,
respectively. There are no substantive differences from the baseline estimates. 36
          Then, in columns (7) and (8) of Table 5, we put the variables which were found to
be important predictors of capital requirements in Table B3 directly into our main
regression (instead of using the residuals from the estimates of changes in requirements). 37
The results are again consistent with our baseline estimates.



34 This is not surprising as these estimates, obtained with the shorter sample, are equivalent to removing a large number of
zeros in the interaction term in our application.
35 See for example, Cornett, Strahan and Tehranian (2011).

36 For the application in this paper, it is of course impossible to know if we fail to model an important part of the transmission

mechanism by omitting the contemporaneous term. For this reason, we follow the standard approach in this literature and
include the contemporaneous term in the baseline regression. Nonetheless, it is reassuring to know that excluding this term
does not significantly change our results.
37 Specifically, we include the contemporaneous value and three lags to match the lag structure of capital requirement changes.



                                                                                                                              26
          The analysis so far has relied on backward-looking determinants of changes in
capital requirements, since balance sheet data do not reflect a bank’s future lending
strategy. It is likely, however, that supervisors also consider forward-looking measures of
international portfolio performance when setting capital requirements. To account for
this potential source of endogeneity, we repeat the extension controlling for endogeneity,
except now also include a measure of exposure-weighted changes in GDP forecasts (for
the receiving countries). 38 This variable is intended to capture any future changes in the
economic outlook of those countries to which the bank is exposed. It is therefore a
measure of future international portfolio performance, which supervisors may take into
account when setting capital requirements today. In column (9) of Table 5, we report our
second-stage results after including this exposure-weighted GDP forecast variable in the
first-stage regression (reported in column (4) of Appendix Table C3). In column (10) of
Table 5, we include this exposure-weighted GDP forecast variable directly in the
regression. The coefficient on this variable is negative in the first-stage regression,
consistent with the idea that a bank exposed to countries forecasted to perform more
strongly than before is less likely to increase capital requirements. In both of the second-
stage regressions predicting cross-border lending, the key results do not change
significantly. 39
          To summarize, the issue of whether an explanatory variable is exogenous with
respect to the dependent variable is often difficult to resolve in an applied economics
paper. In the absence of appropriate instruments for our main variable of interest, we
have modelled changes in bank-specific capital requirements as a function of a wide array
of balance sheet and regulatory variables, both backward and forward looking, and used
the residuals from those regressions as a more exogenous measure of changes in capital
requirements. This exercise suggests that our baseline results are robust to concerns about
endogeneity. This is not surprising given our theoretical prior that most of the credit risk

38 GDP forecasts are from the historical IMF WEO database. The variable is defined as two-year ahead forecasted real GDP

growth less last year’s two-year ahead forecast. Exposure weights are calculated using the portfolio shares by bank and
multiplying by the GDP forecast. We use the change in GDP forecasts (instead of their levels) because some banks might
specialize in lending to emerging markets (with high growth rates), while others lend more to advanced economies (with
lower growth rates). Our measure captures improving/deteriorating future portfolio performance while controlling for this.
39 We have also checked that including GDP growth forecasts into Model 1 yields similarly robust results.



                                                                                                                             27
exposure should have been reflected in the Pillar 1 capital requirement, so that
movements in Pillar 2 capital requirements (our key explanatory variable) should reflect
mostly non-balance sheet risks, and hence be exogenous with respect to bank balance
sheet variables.


5. Aggregate Effects on International Bank Lending
        The purpose of this paper is to asses if changes in regulation and credit easing
contributed to the sharp deglobalisation in banking since the financial crisis, and
especially since 2012. This contraction in cross-border lending is documented in
aggregate BIS and UK banking-system data, but the analysis in this paper is based on
individual UK bank balance sheet data. The granularity of these microeconomic data was
critical to identify and estimate our model, but it raises a valid question whether the
interaction we focus on in this paper is economically relevant in explaining the broader
international macroeconomic trends. Next, we attempt to bridge this gap with an
aggregation exercise. This requires a number of assumptions, and therefore the results
should be taken as illustrative only.
        In order to perform this exercise, we use our central results from the estimated
regression model reported in column (1) of Table 3, which includes results for the
different phases of the FLS. We use the estimates from this table of the impact of those
coefficients which are statistically significant. Since only the sums of coefficients
associated with (𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡 ∗ 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 )∆𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 are statistically significant, only these terms are used for
the aggregation exercise (and not the impact of the capital requirement itself). We then
use, for each bank, the counterfactual growth rates together with initial stocks of total
external lending in pound sterling as of 2011Q3 (one year before the FLS was introduced)
to estimate a series of counterfactual stocks. The resulting series is then summed across
banks to give an aggregate series of international bank lending by UK banks.
        Figure 9a shows the resulting calculation of international bank lending after
removing the estimated effects of the interaction of the FLS and increases in capital
regulations (in red). Actual data on international bank lending is also shown on the figure


                                                                                                     28
(in blue). A comparison of the two lines suggests that aggregate external bank lending
would have been substantially higher in the absence of interaction between the FLS and
increased capital regulations. Specifically, external bank lending was £1300bn before the
introduction of the policies and fell to about £1060bn by the end of 2013. The red line
shows a decline to only £1130bn predicted in the absence of the FLS combined with
increased regulations. In other words, the £240bn decline in international bank lending
would have been a decline of only £170bn (or 30% smaller) in the absence of these
policies. Since the decline in UK external bank lending during this period accounts for a
third of the decline in the corresponding BIS data covering most banking flows, this
suggests that just the interaction of the FLS and UK capital requirements can explain
about 10% of the global contraction in bank lending during this period. The magnitude of
the drag on external bank lending from the FLS is therefore economically meaningful,
not only for the UK, but globally
        Finally, the results in Section 4.2 suggest that most of the negative effect of the
FLS on international bank lending occurred through reductions in bank-to-bank lending
(instead of bank-to-nonbank lending). Therefore, we repeat this aggregation exercise to
focus on the estimated effects of the FLS on aggregate bank-to-bank lending. For this
calculation, we use the estimated coefficients reported in column 2 of Table 3, which
finds that changes in capital requirements ((𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 )∆𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ), as well as its interaction with the
FLS ((𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡 ∗ 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 )∆𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ), are significant. We therefore remove the effects of both of these
terms when constructing a counterfactual estimate for international bank lending.
        The resulting calculations are shown in Figure 9b. The blue line shows actual
international bank-to-bank lending. The green line shows estimated lending absent the
effects of increased capital regulations, and the red line shows estimated lending absent
the effects of increased capital regulations and its interaction with the FLS. The
calculations suggest that external bank-to-bank lending would have been higher in the
absence of increases in capital requirements. It would have been substantially greater in
the absence of the FLS and its interaction with higher capital requirements. In fact, the




                                                                                                   29
FLS seems to have more than doubled the effect of tighter capital requirements on
international bank-to-bank lending.


6. Conclusions
          Following the Global Financial Crisis, many countries around the world
strengthened their prudential policies to improve the resilience of their financial systems.
Many of the world’s major central banks also introduced quantitative and credit easing to
stimulate demand, support lending, and boost growth. At the same time, international
bank lending experienced a historically unprecedented contraction—not only in the
initial phase of the crisis, but in a “second phase of deglobalisation” that started in 2012.
This paper examines if these developments are related, using the experience of the United
Kingdom as a case study.
          While a number of papers have analysed the effects on domestic lending of recent
changes in prudential policies, quantitative and credit easing, 40 we instead focus on the
effects of these policies on international lending. Cross-border lending has declined by
substantially more than domestic lending since the 2008 crisis. Unlike previous work, we
also focus on the second phase of banking deglobalisation (instead of the initial
contraction in 2008/2009). Perhaps most innovative, we focus on the interactions
between various forms of unconventional monetary policy and changes in
microprudential capital requirements. Specifically, we investigate if policies such as
quantitative easing and the UK’s Funding for Lending Scheme amplified the impact of
higher capital requirements on external lending.
          Our results show that the interaction of increased capital requirements with
quantitative easing may have contributed to a reduction in international lending, but any
such effect is estimated to be insignificant, small in magnitude, and not robust to different
perturbations of the model. In contrast, credit easing in the form of the FLS appears to
have substantially magnified the contraction in external lending resulting from increased


40For evidence of how UK domestic lending was affected by changes in prudential regulation, see Aiyar et al. (2015) and
Bridges et al. (2014); for evidence on the effects of the FLS and QE, see Churm et al. (2015). Also see the papers summarized in
Appendix A.

                                                                                                                             30
capital requirements. More specifically, our baseline estimates suggest that a 100 basis
point rise in capital requirements reduced external loans by 3.4%, and this effect roughly
doubled in the presence of the FLS. These results are robust to a number of tests and
extensions, including a model aimed at addressing potential endogeneity. We also find
that the contraction in external lending, and primary effects of the FLS on external
lending, occurred through reductions in bank-to-bank lending (as opposed to
international bank-to-nonbank lending), consistent with the broader global contraction
in international lending. An additional extension shows that the spillover effects of
increased capital requirements were significantly smaller in receiving countries with
stronger macroprudential regulation, especially in the form of increased capital
regulations.
             Finally, a back of the envelope aggregation of these results based on micro-level
UK bank data indicates that the estimated effects of changes in UK capital regulations and
the FLS on external bank lending were also important at an aggregate level. Indeed, these
effects can explain a meaningful part of the contraction in international bank lending,
especially in international bank-to-bank lending that occurred from mid-2012 to 2014.
This paper does not asses these effects and interactions in other countries, but given that
many countries around the world have also increased regulations, adopted quantitative
and credit easing, and simultaneously experienced a reduction in their own cross-border
lending, it is likely that the UK effects documented here also occurred elsewhere. When
any such effects are aggregated across countries, they could go even further in explaining
the second phase of banking deglobalisation.
             Unconventional monetary policy, and its interaction with regulatory policy, can
have important global spillovers. This paper does not, however, assess the welfare
implications of these spillovers. 41 This would require a complicated assessment of the
various costs and benefits of international lending, as well as an analysis of any second-
round effects of changes in UK prudential policies, the FLS, and quantitative easing (such

as from stimulating domestic growth, which could support exports from other
economies).
       Our results do, however, clearly show that a policy targeted at boosting domestic
lending can unintentionally reduce international lending. The magnitude of these
spillovers can be significant, with global implications, even if the policy originated in a
relatively small country. The analysis also shows that monetary policies can magnify the
effects of bank-specific regulatory policies—an important interaction that is typically
ignored by standard macroeconomic analysis. Future research could explore whether
these types of interactions also occurred in other countries and in conjunction with
which types of regulatory and unconventional monetary policies.

Note: The table presents the estimated parameter values from fixed effects panel regressions. The dependent variable is the quarterly percentage change in external
bank lending. Column (1) winsorises the LHS variable at the 1% level. Column (2) winsorises the LHS variable at the 5% level. Column (3) clusters standard errors at
the country-time instead of the bank-time dimension. Column (4) excludes banks with less than £2bn balance sheet on average. Column (5) excludes affiliates with a
parent headquartered in the EA. Column (6) includes an interaction of KR*FLS*Fraction with a dummy that is 1 if lending is to a country in the Euro Area. Column (7)
runs the regression from 2008 Q3 onwards. Columns (8) and (9) are placebo tests. Column (8) checks whether switching on the FLS dummy in 2008 Q3 (before the
FLS was announced) yields different results. Column (9) lets this adjusted dummy run only until 2012 Q2 – i.e. the part of the post-crisis period before the FLS was
introduced. The data are discussed in Section 2.3 and variables are discussed in Section 3.1 and Appendix B. Standard errors are clustered at the bank-time level. *** is
significant at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level. The sample period is 1997Q1 to 2015Q1.

Note: The table presents the estimated parameter values from fixed effects panel regressions. The dependent
variable is the quarterly percentage change in external bank lending. Column (1) includes interactions of capital
requirement changes with GDP growth, stock market returns and CDS spreads (as proxies for loan demand).
Column (2) includes a proxy for the institutional quality of a country, namely an indicator on the strength of
the rule of law. Column (3) adds measures for the intensity of macroprudential regulation taken from Cerutti et
al. (2015). Column (4) includes the overall capital account restriction index from Fernandez et al. (2015).
Column (5) includes both capital regulation and capital controls. Column (6) keeps all variables except the
previous insignificant prudential regulations, in which case the sample size drops by half. Column (7) keeps all
variables that were significant at the 10% level in at least one specification. Quarterly variables, such as returns
and CDS spreads, are lagged by one quarter before being interacted with capital requirements. The data are
discussed in Section 2.3 and variables are discussed in Sections 3.1 and 4.3 and Appendix B. Standard errors are
clustered at the bank-time level. *** is significant at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level and * at the 10% level. The
sample period is 1997Q1 to 2015Q1.

Note: The table presents the estimated parameter values from fixed effects panel regressions. The dependent variable is the quarterly percentage change in
external bank lending. Column (1) reproduces our baseline result for the shorter period for which we could identify exogenous changes in capital
requirements due to availability of regulatory data (2009 Q2 to 2013 Q4) - see Section 4.5. Column (2) uses the residuals from Model 1 in Table C3 as an
exogenous measure of capital requirement tightening. Column (3) uses the residuals from Model 2 in Table C3 as an exogenous measure of capital
requirement tightening. Column (4) drops contemporaneous capital requirement tightening and only retain the three lags. Columns (5) and (6) again use
the residuals from Model 1 and 2 in Table C3, but now without contemporaneous changes in capital requirements. Columns (7) and (8) include the
contemporaneous and three lags of the variables found to be important predictors of capital requirements in Table C3. Columns (9) and (10) repeat the
exercise of columns (3) and (8) for the specification where we also include our measure of exposure-weighted GDP forecasts, either by including it as a
determinant of capital requirements in Table C3 or directly into the regression. The exposure-weighted GDP forecast is from the IMF WEO database and
defined as forecasted real GDP growth averaged over the following two years minus the same forecast last year. The data and variables are discussed in
Sections 2.3 and 3.1, respectively, and Appendix B. Standard errors are clustered at the bank-time level. *** is significant at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level,
and * at the 10% level.

Appendix A: Summary of Bank of England Research on Impact of Prudential Policy

This survey briefly summarizes recent Bank of England studies on the impact of prudential
policy on the banking system and the broader economy. Appendix Table A1 provides more
detail about each paper.

Several Bank of England staff papers examine balance sheet adjustment in response to
changes in UK microprudential capital requirements. If bank equity is more expensive than
debt and changes to capital requirements are binding, a bank will either have to raise outside
capital, retain earnings or cut back risk-weighted assets in response to a rise in capital
requirements. These studies test the last implication and report the annual impact in
response to a 1% rise in capital requirements. Frances and Osborne (2009) find that this 1%
rise in capital requirements in 2002 would have led to a decline in aggregate lending (risk-
weighted assets) by 1.2% (2.4%) four years later. Aiyar, Calomiris and Wieladek (2012) use
more recent data and report that PNFC lending growth declines by 5.7%. Bridges, Gregory,
Nielsen, Radia and Spaltro (2014) find that commercial real estate, other PNFC and
household lending contract by 8.07%, 3.86% and 0.94%, respectively. Uluc and Wieladek
(2015) report that individual mortgage loans contract by 5.1%. Aiyar, Calomiris, Hooley,
Korniyenko and Wieladek (2014) find that cross-border lending falls by 5.4%. Bahaj, Bridges,
Malherbe and O’Neil (2016) find a smaller impact when lending prospects are good and
legacy assets healthy. Banerjee and Mio (2015) do not find an impact of individual liquidity
guidance ratios on real economy lending. Despite different methods and datasets, all of these
papers concur that a rise in capital requirements leads the affected bank to contract lending.

Credit substitution from foreign branches can offset this effect, however, either via direct
competition (Aiyar, Calomiris and Wieladek, 2012) or by arbitraging the regulatory impact
on their affiliated UK subsidiary (Aiyar, Calomiris and Wieladek, 2014). In aggregate, these
channels are estimated to offset the negative loan supply impact of higher capital
requirements by 40%. Similarly, Reinhardt and Sowerbutts (2015) find evidence for leakages
in a cross-country panel: foreign banks lend more to the non-bank sector in response to
tightening in domestic macroprudential capital regulation. They do not find evidence for
leakages in the case of lending standards regulation, which usually applies to all products sold
in a country.

Therefore, whether changes in capital requirements have real effects depends on the scope of
credit substitution. Indeed, Noss and Tofano (2014) find a significant impact on UK lending,
but not real GDP, in a VAR model. De Marco and Wieladek (2015) study the impact on SME
asset growth of a rise in the capital requirements of their main relationship bank with firm-
level data. They find that SMEs contract asset growth by between 3.5% and 6.9%, and that
this is driven by a reduction in bank funding. Overall, this suggests that firms which are
dependent on a single bank are probably most affected.

                                                                                             41
Two recent papers examine how regulation taken abroad affects lending in the UK. Hills et
al. (2016) find that macroprudential regulation in foreign countries does not affect aggregate
UK domestic lending, consistent with the idea that the UK is a core business destination for
most banks. However, more granular results show that foreign affiliates increase lending to
UK households once there is a tightening in LTV regulation in their home countries.
Danisewicz, Reinhardt and Sowerbutts (2015) show that the organisational form of affiliates
matters for spillovers to UK interbank lending, with foreign branches transmitting foreign
capital regulation to a greater degree than foreign subsidiaries.

Evidence on the interactions between prudential policy and the transmission of monetary
policy has been more limited (with the exception of this paper). Aiyar, Calomiris and
Wieladek (2014) find evidence that changes in interest rates only affect small banks in the
UK, while changes in capital requirements affect all banks, suggesting that monetary policy
would not be able to offset negative effects of prudential policy via the bank lending channel.
De Marco and Wieladek (2015) confirm these findings with firm-level data.

Appendix C: Exogeneity of ∆𝑲𝑲𝑲𝑲𝒋𝒋,𝒕𝒕

          An important assumption in our regression framework is the exogeneity of changes in
capital requirements with respect to bank balance sheet variables. Given the importance of this
assumption to our framework, it needs to be explored more formally. In order to do so, we test if
bank balance sheet variables that supervisors had access to at the time of the regulatory decision
can statistically predict regulatory changes. If this is the case and the balance sheet variables can
explain a high fraction of the variation in capital requirements, then our initial assertion would
have been invalid. If all relevant balance sheet variables have been included in the model
predicting changes in capital requirements, however, then the residual will reflect any capital
requirement changes that reflect non-balance sheet risk. We can therefore use the residual from a
model using balance sheet variables to predict changes in capital requirements to verify if the
results change when we use these “non-balance sheet based” capital requirement changes in our
model.
          We have collected 31 such variables. These are mainly taken from the FSA003 form, the
reporting form that regulators had access to when making regulatory decisions. This form also
contains information on several measures of balance sheet risk, such as interest rate, counter-
party or foreign exchange rate risk. We also incorporate additional balance sheet information that
may be relevant, but was not on this form, such as the growth in lending to different domestic
and external sectors, liquid assets and the deposit ratio. This is a fairly complete and exhaustive
list of the information available to the regulators when making their assessments. Of course,
supervisors could also have considered additional information and less tangible measures, but this
extensive set of variables should allow us to create a fairly exogenous measure of changes in
capital regulations.
          We then explore if changes in capital requirements can be predicted by any of these
variables with the following regression framework:

                ∆𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖 ,

where ∆𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖 is the non-zero change in capital requirements for bank i and 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 is the matrix of
exogenous variables that helps to predict this particular instance of ∆𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖 . Under the assumption
that the information set contained in the vector of predictors 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 , the residual (𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖 ) will reflect
capital requirement changes due to non-balance sheet risk, which are exogenous with respect to
balance sheet items. There is also uncertainty about whether these predictors affect the
supervisory decisions contemporaneously or with a lag. For these reasons, we use growth rates
that are contemporaneous, lagged, or taken with respect to the same value a year ago.
         We adopt a two-step approach to isolate the most important predictors of changes in
capital requirements among these 93 potential candidate predictors. First, we regress each
individual predictor against the change in the capital requirement with a single regression. The
results are reported in Appendix Table C1. We then retain those predictors which are statistically
significant. This allows us to reduce the universe of candidate predictors to about 18. However,
we have little information on whether supervisors looked at these indicators together or
individually to form their judgement about a capital requirement change. With the 18 relevant
variables, there are over 262,144 regression models that could be explored for this purpose. We
therefore follow the Bayesian Modelling Approach (BMA) proposed in the economic growth
literature and discussed in more detail below to explore all of these possible model



                                                                                                     48
combinations. 42 Appendix Table C2 presents the results from this exercise. This suggests that
variables such as domestic real sector growth and financial operating charges are strong predictors
of tightening in Pillar 2 capital requirements.
         Finally, we use all of the important predictors from this BMA exercise in multiple
regressions to derive our measure of exogenous changes in capital requirements. Recognising the
second step nature of the BMA output, we include all predictors that have a posterior inclusion
probability (PiP) of either 40 or 20 percent in regression equations (1) and (2). Results are
reported in Appendix Table C3. Both regression equations include external lending growth,
which is not statistically significant in either case. We only retain predictors that entered as
significant in both of these regression equations in regression equation 3. We refer to regression
equations two and three in Table C3 as models 1 and 2 for the remainder of the paper. Each of the
resulting balance sheet variables used to predict changes in capital requirements are highly
statistically significant in both of these regression models. Therefore, balance sheet characteristics
do predict changes in capital requirements. According to the 𝑅𝑅 2, in these equations, however,
they can only explain 25% to 30% of the variation in capital requirements. Assuming that we
included all relevant balance sheet variables, this means that between 70% and 75% of the
variation in capital requirement changes is due to non-balance sheet risk. This is consistent with
the regulatory approach during this period; credit and market risk would typically be accounted
for in the Pillar 1 capital requirement. The Pillar 2 add on, which is the focus of this paper, is
primarily used as a discretionary supplement to account for other risks.
         Balance sheets, however, only summarize the state of a given bank in a backward looking
way. In practice supervisors probably also took expected portfolio performance into account. To
provide a proxy for this, we weight changes in GDP forecasts based on the countries to which a
bank is exposed. This variable is an indicator of changes in the future economic outlook of these
countries that a given bank lends to, and hence an important indicator of future international
portfolio performance. We include this in column (4) of Table C3. The coefficient has the
expected negative sign, implying that better expected international portfolio performance is
associated with lower capital requirements.
         Given that the residuals of these regressions are, by definition, orthogonal to the balance
sheet characteristics, we can use them as measures of changes in non-balance sheet risk capital
requirements. Using the residuals obtained from model (1) and model (2) and/or including the
forward-looking measures in column (4) to address any endogeneity in capital requirements does
not make a significant difference to our key results.


Details on Bayesian Model Averaging

         This section provides more detail on our implementation of Bayesian Model Averaging.
We have up to 18 (k) possible predictors of the change in capital requirements, but only some of
these predictors seem to matter the most for regulatory decisions. The economic growth literature
has proposed Bayesian Model Averaging to objectively determine which variable has the highest
explanatory power. We follow this approach here to select the best predictors of changes in
capital requirements based on their posterior inclusion probabilities.
         The idea underlying Bayesian Model Averaging is to consider the results for all the
models which include all possible combinations of the regressors and average them. The weights
in the averaging are given by the posterior model probabilities 𝑝𝑝(𝑀𝑀|𝑦𝑦) where M is the model and


42   See Doppelhofer, Miller and Sala-i-Martin (2004).

                                                                                                   49
y is the data. In order to compute the posterior model probabilities by means of Bayes rule, two
elements are required. First, we need the posterior distribution of the parameters in each model
M, which is used to derive the marginal likelihood 𝑝𝑝(𝑦𝑦|𝑀𝑀). Second, we need to specify the prior
distribution of the models 𝑝𝑝(𝑀𝑀). With marginal likelihood and model prior distributions at hand,
the model posterior probabilities can be derived as:

         𝑝𝑝(𝑀𝑀|𝑦𝑦) ∝ 𝑝𝑝(𝑦𝑦|𝑀𝑀)𝑝𝑝(𝑀𝑀).

        As to the setup of the priors, we follow Fernandez, Ley and Steel (2001). In particular, for
each model, we compute the posterior probability distribution of the parameters by assuming an
uninformative prior on the variance of the residuals and on the intercept. For the remaining
                                                                            1
regression coefficients we use the g-prior of Zellner (1986), setting 𝑔𝑔 =      2 ) .We set a
                                                                                    max(𝑁𝑁,𝑘𝑘
uniform prior for the distribution of the models. 43 Since we only have up to 8,388,608 models, we
follow Magnus, Powel and Pruefer (2010) and evaluate each one of them to obtain the exact
likelihood, without having to rely on MCMC methods for approximation. High posterior
inclusion probabilities indicate that, irrespective of which other explanatory variables are
included, the regressor has a strong explanatory power. We argue that this is therefore an
efficient and objective way to select the best predictors of the changes in capital requirements.




 In practical terms, Bayesian Model Averaging is implemented with the STATA BMA function documented in De Luca and

Note: The table presents the estimated parameter values cross-sectional regressions of capital requirement tightening on regulatory and
balance sheet variables. Column (1) uses the lagged change of the respective variables scaled risk weighted assets in the quarter before.
Column (2) uses changes of respective variables scaled risk weighted assets in the quarter before averaged over 1 year and lagged by
one quarter. Column (3) uses the current change of the respective variables scaled risk weighted assets of the quarter before. See
Section 4.5 and this appendix for further information on how we obtain the exogenous component of capital requirement changes.
Robust standard errors are given in parenthesis. *** is significant at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level.

Note: The table presents the estimated parameter values cross-sectional regressions of capital requirement
tightening on regulatory and balance sheet variables. Column (1) keeps variables which have in Table C2 a
posterior inclusion probability (PiP) of 40 percent in addition to external bank lending growth. Column (2)
includes variables with a PiP of 20 percent. Column (3) keeps only the significant variables. Column (4)
includes a measure of forward-looking growth surprises, namely, the forecasted real GDP growth averaged
over the following two years minus the same forecast last year from the IMF’s WEO database. See this
Appendix and Section 4.5 for further information on how we obtain the exogenous component of capital
