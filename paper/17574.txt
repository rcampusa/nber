Welfare Costs of Long-Run Temperature Shifts

                                            ABSTRACT

This article makes a contribution towards understanding the impact of temperature fluctuations on
the economy and financial markets. We present a long-run risks model with temperature related natural
disasters. The model simultaneously matches observed temperature and consumption growth dynamics,
and key features of financial markets data. We use this model to evaluate the role of temperature in
determining asset prices, and to compute utility-based welfare costs as well as dollar costs of insuring
against temperature fluctuations. We find that the temperature related utility-costs are about 0.78%
of consumption, and the total dollar costs of completely insuring against temperature variation are
2.46% of world GDP. If we allow for temperature-triggered natural disasters to impact growth, insuring
against temperature variation raise to 5.47% of world GDP. We show that the same features, long-run
risks and recursive-preferences, that account for the risk-free rate and the equity premium puzzles
also imply that temperature-related economic costs are important. Our model implies that a rise in
global temperature lowers equity valuations and raises risk premiums.

1         Introduction

Given the prospect of global warming over the next century, the potential impact
of temperature variation on GDP, aggregate consumption, and wealth is a matter of
considerable importance.        This article makes a contribution towards understanding the
impact of temperature fluctuations on the macro-economy and financial markets. We present
a long-run risks based equilibrium model that accounts for the observed temperature and
consumption dynamics, and a wide-range of asset market returns and volatility puzzles. We
use this model to ask, how large are the economic costs of temperature variation? That is,
based on current economic state prices embedded in financial markets what are the dollar
costs of insuring against temperature fluctuations, as well as utility-based welfare costs of
temperature stabilization. Further, we use the model to evaluate the role of temperature in
determining asset valuations.

        The Stern Review (2007), and Stern (2008) argue that the overall costs associated with
temperature risks are very large, they are equivalent to losing at least 5% of GDP each
year, now and forever, and can be as high as 20% of GDP. However, these magnitudes have
been questioned, both in terms of modelling assumptions and the inputs. Nordhaus (2007)
argues that the Review’s conclusions decisively depend on the assumption of a near zero
discount rate and would not survive the substitution of discounting assumptions that are
consistent with market facts. Indeed, an important focus of our approach is to consider a
consumption-based asset pricing model, that is quantitatively consistent with a wide-range
of financial market facts — this ensures that the stochastic discounting we utilize has a
sound market basis. The analysis in the Stern Review (2007) and Nordhaus (2008) uses
diﬀerent calibrations of the power-utility model to evaluate climate change-related costs1
Mehra and Prescott (1985) and Hansen and Jagannathan (1991), among others, show that
the power-utility model cannot account for the equity premium and risk-free rate puzzles,
and generally fails to account for a wide-range of financial market facts. This implies that
the consumption-state prices embedded in this model for computing various costs are not
consistent with market facts, and in this sense are implausible.

        Our modelling approach to understand temperature related risks builds on the long-run
    1
     Indeed, Stern uses a standard power-utility agent (log utility), with the time-discount of 0.999 and
an assumed per-capita growth of 1.3% per annum, yielding a risk-free rate of 1.4%. Nordhaus, also uses a
production-based model with power-utility model with risk-aversion at 2 and the pure-rate of time-preference
of 1.5% — this yields a real-risk free rate of 5.5% per annum.

risks model of Bansal and Yaron (2004), who show that the model can jointly account for
the observed consumption dynamics, the risk-free rate, the equity premium, and volatility
                            2
puzzles among others.           The key ingredients in the model are the recursive preferences of
Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1990) with a preference for early resolution of uncertainty,
and a persistent expected growth component in consumption along with time-varying
consumption volatility which allows for risk-premia fluctuations. We entertain an augmented
LRR model in which temperature negatively impacts long-run growth, thus, temperature has
a long-lasting eﬀect on consumption growth. We also consider temperature-triggered natural
disasters which cause a reduction in growth, i.e., negative growth jumps, to assess the impact
of tail eﬀects. Our long-run risks temperature model (LRR-T) model provides two potential
channels through which temperature aﬀects the aggregate economy and financial markets. A
similar approach is followed in Pindyck (2011) where temperature is assumed to impact the
growth rate of GDP as opposed to the level of GDP, and Nordhaus (2008) where temperature
negatively aﬀects TFP.

    In terms of the model specifics, our long-run risks temperature model (LRR-T) assumes
that temperature and growth follow a bivariate process, which is calibrated to match the
data.    In particular, the specification captures the negative impact of temperature on
expected growth. In terms of the model implications, we show that a rise in temperature
lowers the wealth-to-consumption ratio in the economy and that temperature shocks carry a
positive risk premium in the economy when agents have a preference for early resolution
of uncertainty.      In contrast, with power utility and risk-aversion larger than one (as
used in Nordhaus), temperature raises the aggregate wealth-to-consumption ratio, as the
discount rate drops more sharply relative to expected growth. Further, the risk-premium
for temperature risk is negative, as states in which temperature raises the aggregate wealth
increases while consumption falls. This underscores the importance of the LRR-T model
setup to evaluate temperature related issues. We also develop an augmented LRR model
which includes temperature related natural disasters (i.e. negative jumps). We assume the
likelihood of one disaster every hundred years, and a 1◦ C increase in temperature doubles the
probability of a natural disaster in a year. The size of the negative temperature-related jumps
is about -1.0% of consumption. Our calibration intends to explore the potential impact of
    2
      Subsequent work has shown that the model can also explain observed credit spreads, term structure
of interest rates, option prices, and cross-section of expected returns across assets. For the term structure
of interest rates see Piazzesi and Schneider (2007), for credit spreads see Bhamra, Kuehn, and Strebulaev
(2009), for cross-sectional diﬀerences in expected returns see Bansal, Dittmar, and Lundblad (2005) and
Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2008), and for option prices see Drechsler and Yaron (2007)

tail events as in Pindyck (2011) and Weitzman (2009).

   For our quantitative analysis we use the standard calibration for preferences laid out in
Bansal and Yaron (2004). All of our model specifications match the joint consumption and
temperature dynamics. Each of the models also matches the risk-free rate and the equity
premium, as well as the volatility of returns, and the correlations between temperature and
asset returns. Our target is also to match the premium on the consumption claim — Lustig,
Van Neiuwerburgh and Verdelhan (2009) use flexible estimation methods to show that the
premium on the consumption claim is 2.25%, and each of the models matches this feature
as well.

   For each of the variants of the model, we evaluate the welfare costs of temperature
stabilization. As in Lucas (1987), we evaluate what is the amount of consumption that
agents will be willing to pay to insulate consumption from temperature eﬀects. Second, we
evaluate the dollar costs of hedging temperature risk; we consider two consumption claims,
one with and another without temperature exposure, and compute the diﬀerence in the
price of these claims to ask how much should society be willing to pay to insure against
temperature risks as current consumption state prices. Our dollar costs and the Lucas-
style utility costs computations show that temperature fluctuations have a very significant
economic impact. We find that the dollar costs are important, for the category 1 model
the costs are 2.46% of World GDP and for the category 2 model the costs are 5.47% of
World GDP. The costs are driven by the fact that the risk-premium on the zero-temperature
exposed consumption claim is smaller than the one with temperature exposure. The long-
run nature of temperature risks as well as the preference for early resolution for uncertainty
are very important for these magnitudes. Similarly, the utility costs are significant, they are
about 1%. These, as with the dollar costs, depend on the long-run nature of temperature
risks.

   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we setup the long-run
risks model, we present the solution to the model and discuss its theoretical implications
for asset markets. In Section 3 we present our measures to assess the costs of temperature
fluctuations. Section 4 describes the calibration of the economy and preference parameters,
the model implications and results. Conclusion follows.

2     Long-Run Risks Temperature Model

Our long-run risks temperature model (LRR-T) model provides two potential channels
through which temperature aﬀects the aggregate economy and financial markets. First,
temperature fluctuations negatively impact long-run growth.                        Second, an increase in
temperature raises the likelihood of natural disasters. In this section we present the long-run
risks temperature (LRR-T) model which introduces the impact of temperature on aggregate
growth in the LRR model of Bansal and Yaron (2004), and discuss the connection between
aggregate growth and temperature risks.


2.1        Preferences

As in the baseline LRR model, we represent the agent’s preferences using Epstein and Zin
(1989) and Weil (1990) type of recursive representation. An agent maximizes her lifetime
utility,
                               [                        (              ] 1−γ
                                                         [ 1−γ ]) θ1
                                                                          θ
                                             1−γ
                          Vt = (1 − δ)Ct      θ
                                                   + δ Et Vt+1                 ,                      (1)

where Ct is consumption at time t, 0 < δ < 1 reflects the agent’s time preference, γ is the
                                   1−γ
coeﬃcient of risk aversion, θ =       1
                                   1− ψ
                                          , and ψ is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution
(IES). Utility maximization is subject to the budget constraint,

                                   Wt+1 = (Wt − Ct )Rc,t+1 ,                                          (2)

where Wt is the wealth of the agent, and Rc,t is the return on all invested wealth.

    As shown in Epstein and Zin (1989), this preference structure implies the following (log)
Intertemporal Marginal Rate of Substitution (IMRS),

                                               θ
                           mt+1 = θ ln δ −       ∆ct+1 + (θ − 1)rc,t+1                                (3)
                                               ψ

where ∆ct+1 = ln(Ct+1 /Ct ) is consumption growth, and rc,t+1 = ln(Rc,t ) is the continuous
return of an asset that pays a unit of consumption as dividend (i.e., return on wealth). This
return is diﬀerent to the return on the market portfolio since wealth not only includes stock
market wealth but also human wealth, real estate, and other non-financial wealth. The sign


                                                    4
of θ is determined by the magnitudes of the IES and the coeﬃcient of risk aversion. When
the risk aversion parameter equals the reciprocal of the IES, γ = ψ1 , then the model collapses
to the case of power utility where the agent is indiﬀerent about the timing of the resolution
of uncertainty in the economy. As discussed in Bansal and Yaron (2004), when ψ > 1, γ > 1
and the risk aversion exceeds the reciprocal of the IES the agent prefers early resolution
of uncertainty about the consumption path, which is the case adopted in the LRR model.
Finally, for future reference, the notation for the multi-period stochastic discount factor to
discount payoﬀs at date t + j is denoted as

                                                  (∑
                                                   k=j          )
                                Mt+1→t+j ≡ exp           mt+k                              (4)
                                                   k=1



2.2    Consumption Growth Dynamics

As in Bansal and Yaron (2004), we assume that conditional expected consumption growth
contains a small but persistent component xt , and economic uncertainty is modelled as
time-varying volatility σt allowing a time-varying risk. We assume temperature, wt , aﬀects
aggregate consumption dynamics by adversely aﬀecting long-run expected growth and by
increasing the likelihood of natural disasters, Dt+1 . Therefore, growth and temperature
dynamics are described by,

                       ∆ct+1 = µ + xt + σt ηt+1 + φc Dt+1                                  (5)
                        xt+1 = ρxt + σt φe et+1 + τw σζ ζt+1 + φx Dt+1                     (6)
                        wt+1 = µw + ρw (wt − µw ) + τx xt + σζ ζt+1                        (7)

where µ is the unconditional mean of consumption growth, ηt+1 is a standard Gaussian
innovation that captures short-run risks.      The expected growth rate shocks et+1 , and
temperature shocks ζt+1 are also independent standard Normal innovations. The parameter
τw ≤ 0 captures the impact of temperature shocks on long-run expected growth; therefore,
if τw < 0 implies a negative impact of temperature shocks on long-run expected growth.
To capture the feature that growth raises temperature, we allow expected growth rate
shocks to aﬀect temperature with τx ≥ 0. The parameter ρ governs the persistence of
xt , and φe determines the magnitude of the standard deviation of the persistent component
of consumption growth relative to the high-frequency innovation ηt+1 . Mean and persistence


                                              5
in temperature are determined by µw and ρw , respectively.

   In our model, disasters Dt+1 follow a compensated compound Poisson process and are
induced by temperature
                                           ∑
                                           Nt+1
                                  Dt+1 =          ξi,t+1 − λt µc ,                         (8)
                                           i=1

where Nt+1 is Poisson random variable with intensity λt and a jump size ξi,t+1 . Therefore, the
number of disasters at any point in time is Nt+1 . We assume that the jump size is constant
and equal to µc , and that the intensity of the Poisson process is increasing in temperature,

                                    λt = ℓ0 + ℓ1 (wt − µw )                                (9)

where ℓ0 , ℓ1 > 0, wt denotes temperature, and µw its unconditional mean. This implies that
the expected number of disasters, conditional on information at t, increases as temperature
rises from its long-run mean, Et (Nt+1 ) = λt . Our analysis entertains only negative jumps
Dt+1 in consumption growth, that is φc = −1. Disasters can potentially aﬀect long-term
expected growth, this is governed by φx . However, motivated by empirical considerations,
in our calibrations we will set φx = 0 — that is, natural disasters will not aﬀect long-
run expected growth and therefore their impact on consumption growth will be completely
transient and very short-lived. Nevertheless our model solutions can easily accommodate
natural disasters with impacts on long-run expected growth. Our setup for negative jumps
(natural disasters) is similar to that laid out in Eraker and Shaliastovich (2008) for LRR
motivated models.

   Finally, as shown in Bansal and Yaron (2004), to allow for time-varying risk premia we
allow for varying consumption volatility. This volatility follows a simple process,

                               σt2 = σ 2 + ν(σt2 − σ 2 ) + σv vt+1                        (10)

where vt+1 is an independent standard Normal innovation, ν determines the persistence of
the variance of consumption growth, σv is the standard deviation of the variance process,
and σ 2 is its unconditional mean. Time-varying volatility, as shown in Bansal and Yaron
(2004) contributes to the risk premia but more importantly it allows for time-variation in
the risk premia. In our setup, even if we abstract from time-varying volatility we still have
a time-varying risk premia due to the time-varying nature of the conditional volatility of


                                                  6
disasters, which depends on temperature. Nevertheless, we leave the varying consumption-
volatility channel open to ensure that the quantitative implications of the model for risk
premiums and price-volatility match the data closely.


2.3        Temperature, Wealth and Risk Prices

Using the standard asset pricing restriction for any continuous return, the continuous return
on the wealth portfolio must satisfy,

                                         Et [exp(mt+1 + rc,t+1 )] = 1                   (11)


       To solve for the return on wealth (the return on the consumption asset), we use the
log-linear approximation for the continuous return on the wealth portfolio, namely,

                                    rc,t+1 = κ0 + κ1 zc,t+1 + ∆ct+1 − zc,t ,            (12)

where zc,t = log(Pt /Ct ) is log price to consumption ratio (i.e., the valuation ratio
corresponding to a claim that pays consumption) and κ’s are log linearization constants.3
In the Appendix we show that the solution for the price-consumption ratio is aﬃne in the
state variables
                                     zc,t = A0 + Ax xt + Aσ σt2 + Aw wt                 (13)
   3
       These constants are equal,
                                                                   ez c
                                        κ0   = ln (1 + ezc ) −            zc ,
                                                                 1 + ez c
                                                   ez c
                                        κ1   =            ,
                                                 1 + ez c
where zc = E(zc,t ).

   The impacts of expected growth and consumption volatility on the price to consumption
ratio are determined by the preference configuration. Higher expected growth raises asset
valuations and the price to consumption ratio only when the IES is larger than one. Similarly,
a rise in consumption volatility lowers the price to consumption ratio when the IES is larger
than one. Temperature impact on asset valuations is determined by Aw , which is diﬀerent
to zero only if natural disasters have an impact on the economy (i.e. φc ̸= 0 and/or φx ̸= 0).
Figure I plots Aw for various values of the IES. If the IES is less than one then temperature
will raise asset valuations, while IES larger than one is needed for temperature to lower the
aggregate wealth to consumption ratio.

   Replacing the solution for the return on wealth on the expression for the IMRS (3), the
innovation to the pricing kernel conditional on the time t information at time t + 1 equals,

         mt+1 − Et (mt+1 ) = −λη σt ηt+1 − λe σt et+1 − λv σv vt+1 − λζ σζ ζt+1 − λD Dt+1   (17)

where λη , λe , λv , λζ , and λD are the market prices of risks, which are equal to:

                                 λη = γ
                                 λe = (1 − θ)κ1 Ax φe
                                 λv = (1 − θ)κ1 Aσ
                                 λζ = (1 − θ)κ1 (Ax τw + Aw )
                                λD = (1 − θ)κ1 Ax φx + γφc


                                                         8
      As in the standard LRR framework, λη , λe , and λv are the market prices for the short-
run, long-run, and volatility risks. In our framework, innovations on temperature and natural
disasters are also priced, λζ and λD . If the risk aversion coeﬃcient equals the inverse of the
IES, as in the case of CRRA preferences, then θ = 1 and long-run risks, volatility risks, and
temperature risks carry a zero risk compensation. That is, only short-run risks are priced
in equilibrium. Note that when natural disasters do not aﬀect long-run growth, i.e., φx = 0,
they are compensated exactly in the same manner as short-run risks.

      Combining the expressions for the he return on aggregate wealth and the IMRS, the risk
premium, is determined by −covt (mt+1 , rm,t+1 ), and equals,

                          1
       Et (rc,t+1 − rf,t + Vt (rc,t+1 )) = βη λη σt2 + βx λe σt2 + βv λv σv2 + βζ λζ σζ2 + βD λD λt u2c (18)
                          2

where rf,t is the risk-free rate, βη , βx and βv are the betas of the asset return with respect to
the short-run risk, long-run risk, and volatility risk innovations, respectively. The exposure
to temperature is determined by the beta of temperature innovations, βζ , and the beta of
natural disasters βD . As the market prices of risk, all asset betas are endogenous to the
model and depend on preference and model dynamics parameters. The risk compensation
from each source of risk is determined by the asset’s β for that risk times the market price
of that risk, λ.4

      The risk compensation for temperature shocks, βζ λζ , is positive only when agents have
a preference for early resolution of uncertainty and the IES is larger than one. Figure II
depicts the risk compensation from temperature innovations for diﬀerent values of the IES
and a risk aversion parameter equal to 10. As noted above, the market price of risk is zero
when agents have CRRA preferences, i.e., ψ = γ1 . Moreover, the temperature beta is zero
since long-run risks have no impact on asset valuations, Ax equals zero. For values of the
                                            1
IES between the CRRA case, ψ =              γ
                                              ,   and 1, temperature shocks contribute negatively to
the risk premia. In this case, the market price of temperature risk λζ is negative, but the
beta of temperature innovations βc,ζ is positive since long-run growth decreases the value of
assets, i.e., Ax is negative. For values of the IES larger than one, the beta of temperature
innovations is negative because temperature innovations negatively impacts long-run growth,
thereby, asset prices.

      The risk-free rate can be derived using the solution to the IMRS. In the Appendix we
  4
      The expressions for the beta’s are presented in the Appendix.


                                                       9
show that the risk-free rate is aﬃne in the state variables. In particular, the loading on the
expected growth rate xt is positive and equal to the inverse of the IES, while the loading
in volatility as well as temperature is negative under our baseline assumptions. Therefore,
in our model an increase in temperature will lower the risk-free rate. Following Bansal and
Yaron (2004), we also derive the implications of the model about the equity premium. A
detailed derivation can be found in the Appendix.



3       Economic Costs of Temperature Variation

3.1      Dollar Costs of Temperature Variation

To asses the economic costs of temperature we compute the diﬀerence in the market price
of an asset that pays consumption as dividend and an asset that pays consumption after
insuring it from all eﬀects of temperature. The insured consumption claim Ct∗ , t = 1 · · · ∞,
corresponds to the case where τw = 0, φc = 0, and φx = 0; the resulting consumption process
is insured in all states and dates against temperature fluctuations. Thus, the diﬀerence in
the price of C ∗ and C is the premium, in dollar terms, that the society might be willing
to pay to insure against the eﬀects of temperature at current consumption state prices.
The equilibrium prices are determined by the consumption dynamics Ct , t = 1 · · · ∞, which
include the temperature dynamics as described in equation (5).

      More precisely, the market price of a consumption claim is given by,

                                            ∑
                                            ∞
                                   Pt =           Et [Mt+1→t+j Ct+j ]                    (19)
                                            j=1


where M is the stochastic discount factor based on our model. Similarly, the price of an
asset that pays consumption exempt from the eﬀects of temperature in the economy is given
by,
                                            ∑
                                            ∞
                                  Pt∗   =                       ∗
                                                  Et [Mt+1→t+j Ct+j ]                    (20)
                                            j=1

Given the value of consumption at date zero (start date), we can recover the prices of these
two assets using the diﬀerence in the wealth-consumption ratio times the consumption at



                                                     10
date zero. Therefore, we compute the dollar costs of temperature fluctuations as,

                                     ∑
                                     ∞                                ∑
                                                                      ∞
                                                          ∗
                   Dollar Costs =           Et [Mt+1→t+j Ct+j ]   −         Et [Mt+1→t+j Ct+j ]       (21)
                                      j=1                             j=1



      To compute the dollar costs we calculate the price-consumption ratio in both cases, with
and without temperature risks, inside the model, and multiply its diﬀerence by the level
of world consumption for the year 2009, i.e., we assume that initial aggregate consumption
equals that of 2009.5


3.2       Welfare Costs of Temperature Variation

In the spirit of Lucas (1987), we explore the welfare gains of eliminating the eﬀects of
temperature variation on consumption. Let C = {Ct }∞
                                                   t=0 be the stream of consumption in
an economy with temperature eﬀects, and C ∗ = {Ct∗ }∞
                                                    t=0 be the consumption stream in an
economy without temperature eﬀects (i.e, we set τw = 0, φc = 0, and φx = 0). We define the
welfare costs of temperature variation as the percentage increase in consumption ∆ > 0 that
one must give to the agent (in every date and state) to make the agent indiﬀerent between
the stream of consumption which contains temperature risks, and the stream of consumption
without temperature eﬀects. Therefore, this compensating variation ∆ must satisfy,
                                    [ ( )]   [                ]
                                   E U0 C = E U0 ((1 + ∆)C ∗ )                                        (22)


      Our derivation of the costs of economic uncertainty is based on exploiting the close
connection between lifetime utility and the wealth-consumption ratio. Under Epstein-Zin
preferences the lifetime utility of the agent normalized by current consumption is entirely
determined by the wealth-consumption ratio, and the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.
Note that under Epstein-Zin preferences we have a convenient expression that links current
utility Ut and the consumption-wealth ratio,
                                                                      ψ
                                            Ut            ψ  Ct 1−ψ
                                               = (1 − δ) ψ−1                                          (23)

      The solution for the price-consumption ratio without temperature eﬀects is presented in the Appendix.

        Let Zc,t =   Ct
                          be the price-consumption ratio, and note that wealth equals Wt = Ct + Pt
                                      Wt
which implies that 1 + Zc,t =         Ct
                                         ,   then, the normalized lifetime utility equals to,

                                        Ut            ψ               ψ
                                           = (1 − δ) ψ−1 (1 + Zc,t ) ψ−1                               (24)
                                        Ct

        Using this connection between asset prices and the life-time utility, the compensating
consumption change for eliminating the negative eﬀects of temperature variation on
consumption, i.e., ∆, satisfies,
                                              [           ψ
                                                             ]
                                                     ∗ ψ−1
                                             E (1 + Zc )
                                         1+∆= [           ψ
                                                             ].                                        (25)
                                             E (1 + Zc ) ψ−1

The magnitude of welfare costs of temperature variation are determined by comparing
the wealth-consumption ratio in an economy with and without temperature risks on
consumption, Zc and Zc∗ respectively.



4         Model Implications

4.1        Data Sources

We calibrate the model to capture world temperature dynamics, world growth, and world
risk premium. The data on global temperature covering the period 1929–2009 are obtained
from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Data Distribution Centre and comes
from the Climate Research Unit (IPCC fourth assessment (2007)). Land temperature is
constructed using surface air temperature from over 3,000 monthly station records which
have been corrected for non-climatic influences (e.g., changes in instrumentation, changes in
                                                                            6
the environment around the station, particularly urban growth).                 Annual temperature data
corresponds to the average of monthly observations. Stock market data come from Morgan
Stanley Capital International (MSCI) equity index. We consider the MSCI All Country
    6
     To compute large-scale spatial means, each station is associated to a grid point of a 5◦ × 5◦ latitude-
longitude grid, and monthly temperature anomalies are computed by averaging station anomaly values for
all months. Finally, global temperature data are computed as the area-weighted average of the corresponding
grid boxes and the marine data, in coastlines and islands, for each month.



                                                        12
World Index which measures equity returns across developed and emerging markets, 45
countries in total, to compute the world market equity return. We use the three-month T-
bill rate to compute the risk-free rate. Real returns for all countries are obtained adjusting
for U.S. inflation computed using the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator
from the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) tables. Data on world real GDP
and real consumption come from the World Bank Development Indicators and cover the
period 1960-2007.

   Table I presents summary statistics for temperature dynamics, annual world GDP,
consumption per capita growth, the world market real equity return, and the risk-free rate.
The average global temperature is 14◦ , its volatility reaches 0.21 and its autoregressive
coeﬃcient equals 0.87.    The average real GDP growth equals 1.91% while the average
world consumption growth is about 1.84%. GDP growth volatility is around 1.4% and
its autoregressive coeﬃcient equals 0.44 while consumption growth volatility is nearly 1%
and its autoregressive coeﬃcient equals 0.41. The world market return is 6.83%, and the
market return volatility equals 19.65%. The real risk-free rate averages 1.45% per annum,
and its volatility is 2.03%, one-tenth of that of equity.


4.2    Calibration

As is standard in the literature, we assume that the decision interval of the agent is monthly.
Table II presents the parameter configuration we use to calibrate the model, which we choose
in order to match the joint dynamics of consumption growth and global temperature, the
level of the risk-free rate, and the risk premium. Our baseline parametrization for preferences
and the dynamics of consumption is very similar to that used in the long-run risks literature
(e.g., Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron (2007a)). The subjective discount factor δ equals 0.999,
the risk aversion parameter γ and the intertemporal elasticity of substitution ψ are equal
to 10 and 1.5, respectively. Under this configuration, the agent has a preference for early
resolution of uncertainty as in the long-run risk literature (e.g., Bansal and Yaron (2004)).
As in Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron (2007a), we capture the persistence, volatility, and auto-
correlations of consumption growth by calibrating the persistence of expected growth ρ, as
well as φe and σ.

   In the paper we entertain alternative models classified by the impact that temperature
has on the economy. Category 1 model: only temperature innovations have an impact on the

                                               13
long-run component of growth, therefore we abstract from the eﬀects of natural disasters,
i.e., φc = 0 and φx = 0; Category 2 model: not only innovations in temperature impact
expected growth, but also disasters have an impact on the high-frequency component of
growth, φc = −1 and φx = 0.

   To calibrate the the impact of temperature innovations on expected growth τw we aim to
match the response world consumption growth to a temperature shock. Figure III depicts
the impulse-response function obtained from a bi-variate VAR model of consumption growth
and global temperature. In particular, it shows that a one standard deviation shock to
temperature, about 0.2◦ C, reduces growth by 0.3% and its impact persists for up to twenty
years. We choose a value of τw equal to −0.0018 which implies a negative response of
consumption growth to temperature as observed in the data. In the model, a temperature
shock reduces temperature up to 0.2%, and has a non-negligible impact for up to twenty
years, as in the data. More importantly, the response of consumption lies within the 95%
confidence intervals of the empirical VAR model (see Figure IV). This calibration is also
consistent with the empirical evidence in Bansal and Ochoa (2011) where we show that
global temperature and shocks to global temperature have a negative impact on economic
growth. Using a panel of 147 countries we show that a one standard deviation shock to
temperature, about 0.2◦ C, lowers GDP growth by 0.24%. Moreover, our results indicate
that temperature not only has a contemporaneous short-lived impact on economic growth,
but its negative impacts tend to persist over time. Dell, Jones and Olken (2009b) also show
that an increase in temperature reduces GDP growth. Namely, a 1◦ C degree increase in
temperature reduces growth by 1.1 percentage points for countries poor countries.

   We set the compensated compound Poisson shock such that the probability of a natural
disaster in a year is 1%, in other words, we assume the likelihood of one disaster every
hundred years. We calibrate the sensitivity of the Poisson shock to temperature such that a
1◦ C increase in temperature doubles the probability of a natural disaster in a year. Therefore
mean intensity of natural disasters ℓ0 is set equal to 0.01/12 and its sensitivity to temperature
ℓ1 is equal to 0.01/12. We set the size of the Poisson jump µc such that the cost of a
natural disasters equals 1.0% permanent reduction in consumption. As in Pindyck (2011)
and Weitzman (2009), our calibration intends to explore the potential impact of tail events.

   To make the model-implied data comparable to the observed annual data, we
appropriately aggregate the simulated monthly observations and construct annual growth
rates and annual asset returns. The model implications are obtained from population values

                                               14
that correspond to the statistics constructed from 12 × 20, 000 monthly simulated data
aggregated to annual horizon.


4.3    Asset Pricing Implications

Our calibration of the model captures the bivariate dynamics of consumption and
temperature.    Table III presents the model implications for the consumption growth
and temperature dynamics. In all of our specifications the first-order autocorrelation of
consumption is around 0.43, which is very close to the data. Similarly, the model calibration
matches the autocorrelation of temperature. As seen in Figures III and IV the model also
captures the negative and long-lasting response of consumption growth to temperature.
The negative correlation between growth rates and temperature arises from the fact that
temperature shocks impact negatively the expected growth rate of consumption, xt . Even
in the presence of natural disasters, shutting down this channel prevents the model from
accounting for this feature of the data.

   In our framework, where agents are not indiﬀerent about the timing of uncertainty
resolution, temperature risks are priced and contribute to the risk premium on the
consumption claim as well as to the equity risk premium. Using the expression for the
consumption risk premium, equation (18), we find that in the category 1 model the risk
compensation for temperature accounts for about 1.1 basis points of the total risk premium
on the consumption claim of 2.04%. Including the possibility of natural disasters, in the
category 2 model, the temperature impact on long-run growth accounts for 1.1 basis points
of the risk premium while natural disasters account for only 0.1 basis points, therefore
temperature accounts for 1.2 basis points of the risk premium. Therefore, the risk premium
on the consumption claim in category 2 model is slightly larger than category 1, but the
diﬀerence is very small. The figures on the risk premium for the consumption asset are very
close to the results of Lustig, Van Neiuwerburgh and Verdelhan (2009), who find that the
consumption risk premium is 2.2% per year, and the discount rate on the consumption claim
is 3.49% per year.

   The model also matches the moments of the risk-free rate, and the market return (see
Table III). The risk-free rate, in category 1 and category 2 models is about 1.1%, and the
volatility of the risk-free is about 1.14%; for both models the levels and volatility match the
data well. On the other hand, the return on the equity claim is higher and more volatile.

                                              15
For category 2 the expected market return is 7.07%, with a volatility equal to 18.90%, giving
rise to an equity premium of about 6%; the premium is slightly higher in the category 2
model. Moreover, the magnitude and volatility of equity returns are six times higher than
the magnitude and volatility of the return on consumption. As in the LRR model of Bansal
and Yaron (2004) the risks associated with the long-run growth are critical for explaining
the risk premium in the economy, as it not only accounts for a significant portion of the
premium but also magnifies the contribution of the volatility risk.


4.4          Dollar Costs of Temperature Variation

The second panel of Table IV presents the price-consumption ratio and the return on a
asset that delivers the consumption stream, C ∗ , as its dividends. In all cases, as expected,
the asset which removes the eﬀects of temperature variation has a higher price-consumption
ratio as it is insured against temperature related risks. The first panel of the table presents
the diﬀerence in the price of an asset paying consumption with and without the eﬀects
of temperature in US$ dollars of 2009, which represent the losses in US$ dollars from
temperature variation as priced by financial markets.7 The dollar losses from temperature
in our models range from 1.43 US$ trillion to 3.18 US$ trillion dollars, which imply a loss
from 2.46% to 5.47% of GDP.

         The key driver of these dollar costs is the change in the riskiness of the consumption
claim. For example, in the category 2 model, the expected return on the consumption claim
with temperature risk included is 3.29%, while the expected return of the consumption
claim without temperature risks is 3.23%; the diﬀerence is about 0.06%. This leads to
a price-consumption ratio that is higher in the case without temperature risk relative to
the one with it. For example, in the category 2 model the diﬀerence in the annualized
price-consumption ratio is 75.05 − 74.98 = 0.07. This magnitude multiplied by 2008 World
aggregate consumption translates to about 3.18 US$ trillion dollars.

         We use World consumption for the year 2009 to compute the price of these assets as explained in section
3.

4.5    Welfare Costs of Temperature Variation

In the spirit of Lucas (1987) costs of business cycles, we start by asking how much individuals
would be willing to give up, in terms of percentage annual consumption, to live in a world
exempt from the eﬀects of temperature. The first row of Table V presents the welfare costs of
temperature variation for the two alternative models we entertain. In the category 1 model,
when only innovations to temperature have an impact on expected growth, welfare costs
are equal to 0.78Natural disasters have only a small impact relative to temperature shocks
because the size of the disasters are quite small and more importantly, they are transient
and do not aﬀect long-run growth. When φx is positive, natural disasters lower long-run
growth and in this case their impact on welfare can be quite significant. However, for the
most part, evidence indicates that natural disasters have only a short run impact on growth
(see e.g Rasmussen (2004)), and for this reason we set φx = 0

   To interpret these magnitudes for our two models it is useful to recall that welfare
costs computations of eliminating business cycles reported in Lucas (1987) and much of
the literature (see Barlevy (2004) for a review) are quite small, well less than 1% of GDP;
hence our magnitudes of welfare-costs for temperature stabilization are in the upper bound to
those typically reported for business cycles. Furthermore, in line with our findings, Pindyck
(2011) shows that, in a model in which agents have uncertainty about temperature dynamics
and its impact on growth, welfare costs are below 2% for parameter values consistent with
scientific studies assembled by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).


4.6    Interpreting Temperature Related Costs

Two key ingredients in the Bansal and Yaron (2004) LRR model explain the sizeable dollar
and welfare costs associated with temperature fluctuations; (i) the recursive preferences of
Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1990) with a preference for early resolution of uncertainty,
and (ii) a standard long-frequency fluctuation for consumption growth with a persistent
expected growth component. Table VI presents the simulations of our specifications first
                                                                               1
assuming that preferences are described by a CRRA utility function, i.e. γ =   ψ
                                                                                   but otherwise
maintain the LRR specification (CRRA-LRR) for growth rates. We also simulate the model
keeping the original assumption of recursive preferences of Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil
(1990) with a preference for early resolution of uncertainty but letting consumption be iid,


                                              17
thus temperature innovations and natural disasters impact its high frequency component
(EZW-hf). In all exercises we keep the relevant parameter values same as our calibration,
and in the EZW-hf we calibrate the standard deviation of the high frequency innovation
such that it equals the monthly consumption volatility for our category 1 model.

    In the CRRA-LRR model, two important results stand out. First, welfare costs of
temperature variation are less than one-fifth of those that arise in our model. Second,
temperature increases lead to an increase in the value of the consumption asset, which
implies that more risk in the economy due to temperature makes the consumption claim more
valuable; this is entirely due to the fact that the IES is less than one and that reductions in
expected growth lowers the risk-free rate and the discount factor in the economy. Moreover,
the model generates a risk-free rate of about 16% with a volatility of the same magnitude, and
the equity premium is about 1.3%, all of which are far from their data counterparts; hence,
this model specification cannot pass the market-test. In the last two columns we present
the results for our two specifications for the EZW-hf case. Under this scenario, even though
temperature leads to a reduction in asset prices, the welfare costs of temperature innovations
are less than 0.1%, that is, ten times lower than our estimates. More importantly, the model
implies a too small equity risk-premium, and a risk-free rate that is somewhat higher than
the data. The model also significantly undershoots on the volatility of the price-dividend
ratio (not reported in table) and the volatility of the risk-free rate. The welfare costs in
this case are quite small compared to our category 1 or category 2 models. This lower cost
magnitudes reflect the fact that the model does not have the long-run risks needed to match
financial markets risks. In all, this evidence implies that the same features, long-run risks
and recursive-preferences, that capture the risk-free rate and the equity premium puzzles
also imply that temperature-related economic costs are significant.



5     Conclusions

This paper makes a contribution towards understanding the impact of temperature
fluctuations on the economy and financial markets. We present a temperature related long-
run risks equilibrium model, which simultaneously matches the observed temperature and
growth dynamics, and key dimensions of the financial markets data. We use this model to
evaluate the role of temperature in determining asset prices, and to compute the utility-


                                              18
based welfare costs as well as the dollar costs of insuring against temperature fluctuations.
Our model implies that if temperature were to rise it would lower long-run growth, raise
risk-premiums, and adversely aﬀect asset prices — the magnitude of these negative eﬀects
increases with temperature, suggesting that global warming presents a significant risk. We
find that the temperature related utility-costs are about 0.78% of consumption, and the
total dollar costs of completely insuring against temperature variation are about 2.46% of
World GDP. We show that the same features, long-run risks and recursive-preferences, that
account for the risk-free rate and the equity premium puzzles (among others) also imply
that temperature-related costs are important and that temperature-risks carry a positive
risk premium. In future work an important ingredient, as appropriately emphasized by
Weitzman (2009), is to incorporate temperature-related model uncertainty in the analysis.

Appendix

A      Model solution

We assume that the state of the economy is described by the following system,

                       ∆ct+1 = µc + xt + σt ηt+1 + φc Dt+1                              (26)
                        xt+1 = ρxt + σt φe et+1 + τw σζ ζt+1 + φx Dt+1                  (27)
                        wt+1 = µw + ρw (wt − µw ) + τx xt + σζ ζt+1                     (28)
                         2
                        σt+1 = σ 2 + ν(σt2 − σ 2 ) + σv vt+1                            (29)

where ηt+1 , ζt+1 , et+1 and vt+1 are independent standard Normal innovations, and Dt+1 is a
compensated Poisson process,

                                             ∑
                                             Nt+1

                                             i=1


where Nt+1 is a Poisson random variable with intensity λt and jump size ξi,t+1 is constant
and equal to µc ∈ R+ . We assume λt = ℓ0 + ℓ1 (wt − µw ).


A.1     Solution for the Consumption Claim

To obtain the pricing kernel we first solve for the return on the consumption claim, rc,t+1 .
The price of a consumption claim asset must satisfy,

                                   Et (exp(mt+1 + rc,t+1 )) = 1


    Combining the expressions for the pricing kernel (3) and the log-linear approximation of
the return on the consumption claim asset (12) we have,
                               [   (          (      )                                  )]

    Assuming that the solution for the price-consumption ratio is aﬃne in the state variables

    In order to compute the expectation Et [exp(mt+1 + rc,t+1 )] note that we can re-write the
compound Poisson process as Dt+1 = Nt+1 µc −λt µc , where Nt+1 is a Poisson random variable
with intensity, conditional on information at time t, equal to λt = ℓ0 + ℓ1 wt . Therefore, for
a scalar τ ,

     Et [exp(τ Dt+1 )] = Et [exp(τ µc Nt+1 − τ λt µc )]
                       = exp[λt (eτ uc − 1) − τ λt µc ]
                       = exp[λt (Φ(τ ) − 1)] = exp[ℓ0 (Φ(τ ) − 1) + ℓ1 (Φ(τ ) − 1)(wt − µw )]

where we define Φ(τ ) = exp(τ µc ) − τ µc . Note that to go from the first to the second line we
use the definition of the moment generating function of a Poisson process, Et [exp(τ Nt+1 )] =
exp[λt (eτ − 1)], and the last expressions results from replacing the definition of λt . Using
these last results, evaluating the expectation (31) and taking logs of both sides results in the

   To obtain solutions for A0 , Ax , Aw , and Aσ we also need to solve for the linearization
constants κ1 and κ0 . The log-linearization constants are given by,

                                  κ0 = ln (1 + ezc ) − κ1 zc                               (35)
                                          ezc

                                       1 + e zc

where zc = E(zc,t ) = A0 + Aσ σ 2 + Aw w. As can be seen from these expressions, the log-
liner coeﬃcients depend on the values of A0 , Ax , Aσ and Aw which also depend on these
coeﬃcients. Therefore, these must be solved jointly with the loadings A0 , Ax , Aσ and Aw ,
since they are endogenous to the model. Manipulating equations (35) and (36) we have:

                               κ0 = −κ1 ln κ1 − (1 − κ1 ) ln(1 − κ1 )                      (37)

therefore, using (38) we can eliminate κ0 and A0 from (35) leading to the following expression

   Given a starting value for κ1 we solve for Ax , Aσ and Aw , which we use to iterate on κ1
in (39) until it converges. Finally, using the solution for κ1 and Aσ and Aw we can recover
κ0 and A0 from equations (37) and (38), respectively.

   Having solved for the wealth-consumption ratio, we can re-write the log-linear
approximation of the return on the consumption claim as follows,

                                                                            1
rc,t+1 = µ + κ0 − A0 (1 − κ1 ) + κ1 Aσ (1 − ν)σ 2 + κ1 Aw (1 − ρw )µw +       xt + Aσ (κ1 ν − 1)σt2
                                                                            ψ
            +Aw (κ1 ρw − 1)wt + σt ηt+1 + κ1 Ax φe et+1 + κ1 Aσ σv vt+1 + (Ax τw + Aw )κ1 σζ ζt+1
            +(κ1 Ax φx + φc )Dt+1


   Using the solution to the return on wealth rc,t+1 , the IMRS can be restated in terms of
the state variables and the various shocks.


A.2       Solution for the Pricing Kernel and the Risk-Free Rate

The solution to the price-consumption ratio zc,t allows us to express the pricing kernel can
be expressed as a function of the state variables and the model parameters,

 mt+1 = m0 +mx xt +mσ σt2 +mw wt −λη σt ηt+1 −λe σt et+1 −λv σv vt+1 −λζ σζ ζt+1 −λD Dt+1 (40)

with,

            m0 = θ ln δ − γµ + (θ − 1)[κ0 − A0 (1 − κ1 )] + (θ − 1)κ1 Aw (1 − ρw )µw
                   +(θ − 1)κ1 Aσ (1 − ν)σ 2
                      1
            mx   = −
                     ψ
            mσ   = (θ − 1)κ1 Aσ (κ1 ν − 1)
            mw = (θ − 1)κ1 Aw (κ1 ρw − 1)



and

                                   λη = γ
                                   λe = (1 − θ)κ1 Ax φe
                                   λv = (1 − θ)κ1 Aσ
                                   λζ = (1 − θ)κ1 (Ax τw + Aw )
                                   λD = (1 − θ)κ1 Ax φx + γφc


   To derive the risk-free rate at time t, we use the Euler equation which mandates that rf,t
must satisfy,
                                     Et [exp(mt+1 + rf,t )] = 1

which implies that exp(−rf,t ) = Et [exp(mt+1 )]. The expectation can be evaluated using the
expression for the IMRS and is equal to,
                               [
                                   1
        Et [exp(mt+1 )] = exp m0 + (λ2v σv2 + λ2ζ σζ2 ) + (ℓ0 − ℓ1 w)(Φ(−λD ) − 1) + mx xt
                                   2
                                                                                  ]
                            (    1 2         )         (                      )
                          + mσ + (λη + λ2e ) σt2 + mw + ℓ1 (Φ(−λD ) − 1) wt
                                 2

which yields the following expression for the risk-free rate rf,t :

                              rf,t = rf + Af,x xt + Af,σ σt2 + Af,w wt                       (41)




                                                24
with,

                             1
                  rf = −m0 − (λ2v σv2 + λ2ζ σζ2 ) − (ℓ0 − ℓ1 µw )(Φ(−λD ) − 1)
                             2
                Af,x = −mx

                Af,w = −mw − ℓ1 (Φ(−λD ) − 1)


   Using the expression for the return on the consumption claim and the pricing kernel, the
risk premium on the consumption claim equals,

                       1
  Et (rc,t+1 − rf,t ) + Vart (rm,t+1 ) = −covt (mt+1 , rm,t+1 )

                                       = βη λη σt2 + βx λe σt2 + βv λv σv2 + βw λζ σζ2 + βD λD λt u2c

where the β’s are equal to,

                                      βη = 1
                                      βx = κ1 Ax φe
                                      β v = κ1 A σ
                                      βw = (Ax τw + Aw )κ1
                                      βD = (φc + κ1 Ax φx )


A.3     Solution for the Consumption Paying Asset exempt from
        Global Warming Eﬀects

Consider an asset that pays a unit of consumption exempt from the eﬀects of temperature
in the economy, therefore, the dividend of this asset grows as follows,

                              ∆c∗t+1 = µ + x∗t + σt ηt+1                                           (42)
                                x∗t+1 = xt+1 − τw σζ ζt+1 − φx Dt+1                                (43)




                                                  25
where ∆c∗t+1 is consumption growth and x∗t+1 expected growth abstracting from global
warming eﬀects. The log-linear approximation of the return on this asset equals,

                                rc∗ ,t+1 = κ∗0 + κ∗1 zc∗ ,t+1 + ∆c∗t+1 − zc∗ ,t ,                 (44)

where zc∗ ,t is the (log) price-dividend ratio for this particular asset which has c∗t+1 as dividend.
The return on this asset must satisfy,

                                       Et [exp(mt+1 + rc∗ ,t+1 )] = 1                             (45)


   To solve for the return we conjecture that the solution to the price-dividend ratio is
zc∗ ,t = A∗0 + A∗x xt + A∗σ σt2 + A∗w wt + A∗ζ σζ ζt + A∗D Dt . Replacing our conjecture into the Euler
equation as well as the expression for the pricing kernel (40) and evaluating the expectations,
we obtain the following expressions for the loadings on the price-consumption ratio zc∗ ,t :
                                      (            )
                                          1−   1

                                                       + κ∗1 A∗w τx
                          A∗x    =                                                                (46)
                                       1 − κ∗1 ρ
                                   mσ + 21 [(κ∗1 A∗x φe − λe )2 + (1 − λη )2 ]
                          A∗σ    =                                                                (47)
                                                     1 − κ∗1 ν
                                   mw + ℓ1 [Φ(κ∗1 φx (1 − A∗x ) − λD ) − 1]
                         A∗w     =                                                                (48)
                                                    1 − κ∗1 ρw

while A∗ζ = −τw and A∗D = −φx .


A.4     Solution for the Dividend Paying Asset

The market return is the return on an asset that pays a dividend which grows at rate ∆dt+1
described by the following process,

                       ∆dt+1 = µd + ϕxt + πσt ηt+1 + ϕφc Dt+1 + φu σt ut+1                        (49)

and the market return must satisfy,

                                       Et (exp(mt+1 + rm,t+1 )) = 1



                                                           26
   We conjecture that the price-dividend ratio is aﬃne in the state variables, zm,t =
A0,m + Ax,m xt + Aσ,m σt2 + Aw,m wt , and to solve for the loadings on each state variables
we follow the same procedure used to solve for the wealth-consumption ratio. Therefore, we
substitute the market return by its log-linear approximation,

                           rm,t+1 = κ0,m + κ1,m zm,t+1 + ∆dt+1 − zm,t

which after some algebraic manipulation equals to,

rm,t+1 = κ0,m − A0,m (1 − κ1,m ) + µd + κ1,m Aσ,m (1 − ν)σ 2 + κ1,m Aw,m (1 − ρw )µw
           [κ1,m Ax,m ρ − Ax,m + ϕ + κ1,m Aw,m τx ]xt + Aσ,m (κ1,m ν − 1)σt2 + Aw,m (κ1,m ρw − 1)wt
           +ϕσt ηt+1 + κ1,m Ax,m φe σt et+1 + κ1,m A2,m σv vt+1
           +[κ1,m Ax,m τw + κ1,m A3,m ]σζ ζt+1 + (ϕφc + κ1,m Ax,m φx )Dt+1 + φu σt ut+1


   Replacing this expression and the expression for mt+1 into the Euler equation, we find
that the loadings on the state variables must satisfy,
                      (            )
                          ϕ−   1
                               ψ
                                       + κ1,m Aw,m τx
           Ax,m =                                                                           (50)
                           1 − κ1,m ρ
                    (θ − 1)(κ1 ν − 1)Aσ + 12 [(κ1 Ax,m φe − λe )2 + (π − λη )2 + φ2u ]
           Aσ,m   =                                                                         (51)
                                               1 − κ1,m ν
                                               [                                 ]
                    (θ − 1)(κ1 ρw − 1)Aw + ℓ1 Φ[ϕφc + κ1,m Ax,m φx − λD ] − 1
          Aw,m    =                                                                         (52)
                                           θ(1 − κ1,m ρw )

and A0,m must satisfy,
           [                                                                  1
    A0,m = m0 + κ0,m + κ1,m Aw,m (1 − ρw )µw + Aσ,m κ1,m σ 2 (1 − ν) + µd + (Aσ,m κ1,m − λv )2 σv2
                                                                              2
     1                                                      (                               )]
    + (κ1,m Aw, m + κ1,m Ax,m τw − λζ )2 σζ2 + (ℓ0 − ℓ1 µw ) Φ(ϕφc + κ1,m Ax,m φx − λD ) − 1 /(1 − κ1,m )
     2

   As in the case for the consumption claim, we need to solve for the approximating
constants, κ0,m and κ1,m . Using the expressions for the linearization constants κ1,m and




                                                        27
κ0,m and the condition for A0,m we have,

ln κ1,m = m0 + (1 − κ1,m )Aσ,m σ 2 + (1 − κ1,m )Aw,m µw + κ1,m Aw,m (1 − ρw )µw
                                        1
          +Aσ,m κ1,m (1 − ν)σ 2 + µd + (Aσ,m κ1,m − λv )2 σv2
                                        2
           1                                                     [                               ]
          + (κ1,m Aw,m + κ1,m Ax,m τw − λζ )2 σζ2 + (ℓ0 − ℓ1 µw ) Φ[ϕφc + κ1,m Ax,m φx − λD ] − 1
           2

   As in the case for the consumption claim, we use the same algorithm to solve for κ1,m ,
and the states loadings on the solution of the price-dividend ratio A0,m , Ax,m , Aσ,m and Aw,m .

Table I presents descriptive statistics for the world GDP and consumption growth, global temperature, the
world stock market return, and the risk-free rate. The macroeconomic data are real, in per-capita terms,
and sampled on an annual frequency. Global temperature is expressed in degrees Celsius (◦ C) covering the
period 1930 to 2008. GDP data cover the period from 1960 to 2008, and consumption data cover the period
from 1960 to 2006. The world market return data cover the period from 1988 to 2009, and the data on
the real risk-free rate cover 1950 to 2009. Means and volatilities of growth rates and the market return are
expressed in percentage terms. Newey-West standard errors are reported in parenthesis.

Table IV reports the cost in dollar terms of a reduction in consumption due to temperature risks. The cost
of a reduction in consumption is computed as the diﬀerence between the price of a consumption-paying asset
with and without the eﬀects of temperature. The price-consumption ratio and return of the consumption
claim with temperature risks are denoted P/C and Rc , respectively. The price-consumption ratio and return
of the consumption claim without temperature risks in the same economy are denoted P ∗ /C ∗ and Rc∗ ,
respectively. All reported figures are computed based on 12 × 20, 000 monthly data aggregated to annual
horizon. Returns are expressed in percentage terms.

Table V reports welfare costs of setting temperature eﬀects to zero and the return as well as the price-
consumption ratio of a consumption claim in an economy with and without the risks of temperature. The
welfare costs of stabilization represents the fraction of consumption that the representative agent would be
willing to give up to avoid the negative eﬀects of global warming. All reported figures are computed based
on 12 × 20, 000 monthly data aggregated to annual horizon. Returns are expressed in percentage terms.

Table VI presents model based welfare costs, the risk-free rate and risk premia assuming (i) CRRA–LRR,
that preferences are described by a CRRA utility function, i.e. γ = ψ1 but otherwise maintain the LRR
specification, and (ii) EZW-hf recursive preferences of Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1990) with a
preference for early resolution of uncertainty and letting consumption be iid, thus temperature innovations
and natural disasters impact its high frequency component. Rc is the return on the consumption claim, Rf
the risk-free rate, and Rm is the return on the market dividend claim. All reported figures are computed
based on 12 × 20, 000 monthly data aggregated to annual horizon.

Figure II plots the temperature beta, and the contribution of temperature innovations to the risk premia at
diﬀerent values of the IES and setting the risk aversion parameter equal to 10. The CRRA case refers to the
situation when the risk aversion parameter (γ) equals the inverse of the IES (ψ). The the compensation to
temperature innovations, βζ λζ , is expressed in annual percentage terms.

Figure III presents the impulse-response function from a bivariate VAR of world consumption growth and
global temperature. The figure depicts the response of consumption growth to a one standard deviation shock
to temperature (solid line) along with 95% confidence bands (dashed lines). The data on world consumption
is real and covers the period 1960-2007.
