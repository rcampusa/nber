                                              ABSTRACT

A variety of public campaigns, including the “Just Say No” campaign of the 1980s and 1990s that
encouraged teenagers to “Just Say No to Drugs”, are based on the premise that teenagers are very susceptible
to peer influences. Despite this, very little is known about the effect of school peers on the long-run
outcomes of teenagers. This is primarily due to two factors: the absence of information on peers merged
with long-run outcomes of individuals and, equally important, the difficulty of separately identifying
the role of peers. This paper uses data on the population of Norway and idiosyncratic variation in
cohort composition within schools to examine the role of peer composition in 9th grade on longer-run
outcomes such as IQ scores at age 18, teenage childbearing, post-compulsory schooling educational
track, adult labor market status, and earnings. We find that outcomes are influenced by the proportion
of females in the grade, and these effects differ for men and women. Other peer variables (average
age, average mother’s education) have little impact on the outcomes of teenagers.

1. Introduction

    The “Just Say No” campaign of the 1980s and 1990s encouraged children to resist

peer pressure and “say No” to drugs. A key underlying assumption of the campaign,

based on research by Dr. Richard Evans, is that teenagers are susceptible to the influences

of their peers. Despite this perceived wisdom, there is little large-scale empirical

evidence on the long run effect of peers in middle school and high school. This is

primarily due to two factors: the absence of information on peers merged with long-run

outcomes of individuals and, equally important, the difficulty of separately identifying

the role of peers. Using data on the population of Norway and idiosyncratic variation in

cohort composition within schools, this paper examines the role of peer composition in

9th grade on longer-run outcomes such as IQ scores, teenage childbearing, educational

choices, adult labor market status, and earnings. Taken together, the findings provide a

broad understanding of the socio-economic effects of peer composition.

         We extend the existing literature on peer effects along two dimensions. First, we

focus on the role of lower secondary school peers (when children are aged 14 to 16)

instead of earlier schooling; teenagers are often perceived as being particularly

susceptible to peer influence. Second, we are able to look at long-run outcomes and are

not limited to test scores while in school. It is possible that short-term effects of peers on

school grades wear off over time and hence are not so important in determining

completed educational attainment and later earnings.1




1
 This type of effect has been observed with respect to the effects of school starting age. For example, Elder
and Lubotsky (2009) find that it has large initial impacts on school grades but the effects get smaller with
age.

                                                                                                           2
         A key difficulty in the literature is the statistical identification of peer effects.2 In

this paper, we use plausibly random peer group variation to identify the role of peers on

long run outcomes. Starting with Hoxby (2000), researchers have exploited across-grade

variation in peers within schools that arises because of random demographic differences

across cohorts. For example, by chance, 3rd grade may be 55% male in 2000 in a certain

school, but only 45% male the following year.3 One concern with this strategy, however,

is that parents may time the entry age of their child to avoid “bad” cohorts; we deal with

this issue by instrumenting the actual peer characteristics of children with what the peer

characteristics would have been if all children started school on time and progressed one

grade each year. Because, in Norway, the compliance rate with school starting age

regulations is high and grade retention is extremely rare, the first stage relationship is

very strong.

         We study how a child’s outcomes are influenced by the gender composition of

classmates, their socio-economic characteristics (as proxied by their mother’s educational

attainment), and the average age of classmates. The latter variable is influenced by much

prior research suggesting that school starting age influences the long-run outcomes of

children; in this paper, we continue this area of investigation by examining whether there

are spillover effects on classmates. For example, based on earlier work, there is good

2
  Manski (2000) notes that typically behaviors and outcomes are similar among members of the same peer
group and categorizes the possible reasons into 3 groups: (1) Endogenous peer effects occur when
individual outcomes directly influence outcomes of peers (2) Exogenous or contextual peer effects occur
when predetermined characteristics of individuals affect outcomes of peers and (3) correlated effects refer
to non-peer effects reasons for correlated outcomes within peer groups such as endogenous peer group
selection and correlated unobservables of peers. For empirical researchers trying to find evidence of peer
effects, the identification problem amounts to separating (3) out from (1) and (2). See Manski (2000) and
Moffitt (2001). In this paper, we use the term “peer effects” to refer to the combination of endogenous and
contextual peer effects.
3
  A disadvantage of this approach is that exogenous variation in peer groups is at the grade-level rather than
at the classroom-level, as the across-classroom distribution of children within grades is likely to be non-
random.

                                                                                                            3
reason to suspect that having older peers may make it more likely that a teenage girl

engages early in sexual activity and hence is more likely to have a teen birth. 4

           Our main finding is that students are influenced by the proportion of females in

the grade. Interestingly, there are opposite effects for men and women, in that women

benefit from having a higher proportion of female peers while men are disadvantaged by

female peers. There is very little evidence that the other peer variables we study (average

age, average mother’s education) have any impact on the outcomes of teenagers.

           The paper unfolds as follows. In section 2, we discuss the relevant literature. The

empirical methodology and institutional context are described in sections 3 and 4

respectively. Section 5 outlines the data we use. The main results are in section 6.

Section 7 concludes and summarizes the findings.



2. Literature Review

           The publication of the Coleman report (1966) highlighted the importance of peers

to the performance of students, arguing that peers are more important than schools as

determinants of student outcomes. Since that time, researchers have tried a variety of

estimation strategies to isolate the causal effect of peers on student performance.5

           Most recently, the research in the area has taken on three basic strategies. The

closest to ideal is the randomization of peer assignment, enabling the researcher to

eliminate all concerns about selection. As with other experimental work, however, this is

often limited in its generalizability. The best known experimental work on peers has

focused on college roommate assignment (see work by Sacerdote (2001), Zimmerman


4
    See Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2008).
5
    Sacerdote (2008) and Epple and Romano (forthcoming) provide comprehensive reviews of the literature.

                                                                                                           4
(2003), Carrell, Fullerton, and West (2009)), or has focused on elementary schools in

developing countries (Duflo, Dupas, and Kremer (2008)).6 None of this experimental

work has looked at the role of early teenage peers in a developed nation context.

         The second identification strategy uses individual fixed effects; variation comes

from changes in peer groups over time, primarily due to school-switchers and children

who are held back. These changes in peer groups are then related to changes in the

outcomes of the student, most generally as reflected in test scores.7 Hanushek, Kain,

Markman, and Rivkin (2003) use student and school-by-grade fixed effects to estimate

the effect of elementary school peers on test score gains. There are two sources for

variation in peers: mobility into or out of the school and, less importantly, changes in

student circumstances (income or achievement, for example). They find a positive effect

of peer achievement on test score gains that is relatively constant across quartiles of the

school achievement distribution. A key limitation of this strategy, however, is that it

relies on movers for variation in peers, and the decision to move may be endogenous to

school characteristics.8

         A third estimation strategy is to use idiosyncratic variation across school cohorts

to isolate the role of peers. Most closely related to our work is that of Hoxby (2000),
6
  Duflo, Dupas and Kremer (2008) randomize peer groups in Kenya. A key advantage of their paper is,
because of the experimental design, they are able to compare the effects of peers in the presence of student
tracking to the effect of peers without tracking and with only idiosyncratic differences in peers. They find
that students of all ability levels do better with tracking. Interestingly, however, they find that students at
the tracking cutoff (those just above are in high ability classes and those below are in low ability classes) do
equally well, suggesting no peer effects conditional on tracking. However, when they look at the effects of
small differences in peers induced by the randomization of peers, they find positive effects of having high
ability peers.
7
  Because of the inclusion of individual fixed effects, the strategy relies on relating changes in student
performance to changes in peer group over time; this approach is obviously infeasible when looking at
post-school outcomes.
8
  Similar in spirit, Kramarz, Machin, and Ouazad (2009) use British data to distinguish the components of
test scores and test score growth that are related to pupils, schools, and peers. They find that pupil
heterogeneity is a more important determinant of achievement than school quality (although both are
statistically significant). Peer effects are small but significant.

                                                                                                              5
Lavy and Schlosser (2007), Bifulco, Fletcher, and Ross (2010), and Gould, Lavy, and

Paserman (2009).9 Gould et al. (2009) use idiosyncratic variation in the proportion of

immigrants in elementary school grades in Israel and study the impact of immigrants on

high school performance. Bifulco et al. (2010) use U.S. data from Add Health focusing

on the effect of percent minorities and college educated mothers per cohort on the

probability of dropping out of high school, attending college, and likelihood of smoking.

In contrast to our study, they do not use school level administrative data and their

principal focus is on the effect of minorities. Lavy and Schlosser (2007) use Israeli data

to examine how idiosyncratic changes in gender composition affect elementary, middle,

and high school performance. Once they establish that student outcomes are better in the

presence of a higher fraction of girls, they then examine whether it is because of changes

in the composition of the class (boys are worse behaved on average) or changes in the

behavior of the individual students, using survey data of students and teachers. While

similar in spirit, our work looks at a variety of peer characteristics and at a country with a

very different institutional framework. Also, unlike Lavy and Schlosser, our outcome

variables are post-school outcomes rather than in-school test scores.



3. Empirical Methodology

A. Using Idiosyncratic Variation in Peer Characteristics

        Our general equation of interest is as follows:


                                                                                        (1)


9
 Work by Ammermueller and Pischke (2009) uses data from six European countries and within school,
across classroom variation for identification. The authors argue that classroom assignment in primary
school is effectively random, and they find modestly large effects of peer effects on in-school exams.

                                                                                                         6
where yics is the outcome measure for individual i in cohort c, in school s. A cohort refers

to all individuals who are in grade 9 in the same year whether or not they have the same

year-of-birth. As is described in section 5 below, we have information on children from

15 cohorts. Outcomes are a function of the individual’s own characteristics, xics, which

include gender, family size and its square, mother’s education, an indicator for whether

the child is firstborn, mother’s age at birth and its square, and immigrant status. Also

included are the mean characteristics of their peers (peers are defined as everybody in

their grade except themselves),             , which are the average age, the fraction female, and

the average socioeconomic status as measured by mother’s education. Our main

coefficients of interest are those in           . We also control for the number of students in the

grade in the school (gsc) and a full set of cohort dummies where                     is a dummy variable

equal to 1 if the observation is from cohort c, and equal to zero otherwise.10                       refers to

school effects that may or may not differ across cohorts; a key issue is the appropriate

parameterization of          .

         One possibility is to parameterize              by including the mean value of student

characteristics measured at the school level.11 In this case, we study the impact of




10
  The cohort dummies are not school-specific. All individuals in Norway who started school in the same
year will have the same values for the cohort dummies.
     11
        We sometimes refer to this as pseudo fixed effects as it is similar in spirit to including school fixed
effects. Mundlak (1978) showed an equivalence between the fixed effects specification and a particular
correlated random effects specification. This implies that estimating

                                                                                     (2)

using school fixed effects produces the same estimate of        as estimating

                                                                                                        (3)


                                                                                                                  7
variation in peer composition, conditional on the average peer composition over all

cohorts in the school. By controlling for the average characteristics of children in the

school across all cohorts, we are taking account of the fact that some schools may

generally attract better students than others. The regression we estimate is then:


                                                                          (4)


We cluster the standard errors by school to allow for arbitrary within-school correlations

in the errors.

    With this parameterization of             , we are assuming that, conditional on cohort

dummies and average student characteristics in the school, peer characteristics in a

particular grade are as good as randomly assigned. While we know there is sorting based

on place of residence, this is not a problem so long as it does not change over time as it

will then be picked up by the average school student characteristics. However, a key

concern is the existence of trends over time in neighborhoods or schools that are

correlated both with peer quality and student outcomes.12 For example, if a

neighborhood/school is becoming “poorer” over time, the average peer quality and

individual student performance will both be declining. If one does not take into account

these differential changes over time, one might observe a spurious relationship between




without school fixed effects. In equation 3, the means of all variables from equation 2 are taken by school,
and added as additional explanatory variables to the model. So        is the within-school mean of the
individual characteristics, and     is the within-school mean of the peer characteristic.       is then the
proportion of individuals in a particular school that are in cohort c. Estimating (3) gives exactly the
same     coefficients as estimating equation (2) using school fixed effects. Given that, in our context,
           , equation (1) is very similar to equation (4) below and, in practice, the two strategies give very
similar estimates.
12
   Note that national trends will be absorbed by the cohort dummies.

                                                                                                                 8
peer quality and student performance. We therefore also use parameterizations of           that

allow for changes in school quality over time.

School-Specific Trends

   It is common in the literature to allow for school-specific trends (for example, Hoxby

2000) and this is the first approach we take. Given our estimation strategy, it is not

feasible to directly add a linear trend for each school so we implement this in our set-up

as follows: First we regress each individual characteristic, for example female, on school

dummies and school dummies interacted with a linear cohort trend. We then calculate the

fitted value of the characteristic for each school/cohort cell. This fitted value can be

interpreted as the expected peer composition in the school for that cohort if composition

changes follow a school-specific linear trend. We add these fitted values (one for each

peer characteristic) to the specification in equation (4). In effect, this means we study the

effects of variation in peer characteristics conditional both on the mean peer

characteristics in the school, and conditional on the predicted peer characteristics for that

cohort in the school, allowing for a school-specific linear trend.

Moving Average Approach

       The second approach we take to allow for changes in school quality over time

takes a much less parametric perspective. The intuition is as follows: instead of

comparing across long periods of time and imposing a particular functional form on the

trend, we narrow the comparison. For every year, we regress the performance of a

student in that year on the characteristics of her peers, conditional on the average

characteristics of other students in the school taken over that year and the two adjacent

years (the one before and the one after). By construction, any deviation in peer


                                                                                             9
characteristics from this 3-year average cannot be due to a linear trend over this 3-year

period and can therefore be treated as idiosyncratic variation.13 We add the 3-year

moving average of student characteristics as extra control variables in equation (4).

        It is important to note, however, that this is an extremely restrictive comparison.

To the extent that peers in neighboring years actually do have an effect on an individual’s

performance, we will underestimate the role of peers on student outcomes. As a result,

we view this estimate as a lower bound on true peer effects.14



B. Using Sibling Differences

        There is always a concern that the peer variation used in the methods above is not

purely idiosyncratic and there may still remain (conditional) correlations between a

child’s family background and his peers. One way to rule out this possibility is by using

sibling fixed effects. To do so, we restrict the sample to siblings who go to the same

school. With sibling fixed effects, a potential source of bias is if, somehow, the “better”

child in the family ends up in a cohort with a better peer group. The only plausible way in

which this could happen is if parents manipulate school starting age so as to influence the

peer group their children face. Our instrumental variables strategy (described below)

deals with this possibility. Note that while the sibling fixed effects strategy has the

advantage of ruling out any possibility that peer composition is correlated with family

background characteristics, it has the disadvantage that one-child families are excluded

from estimation (and when we split by sex we must omit families with fewer than two

13
  By necessity, we exclude cohorts 1 and 15 as they are not middle cohorts in any 3-cohort sequence.
14
  Our moving average strategy is somewhat similar to that used by Gould et al. (2009). They condition on
the lag and the lead of the relevant peer variable, as well as the number of persons in the class. Their
approach may have greater potential for bias; if the lead and lag are correlated with unobserved school
characteristics, it is likely that the current value of the peer variable is as well.

                                                                                                      10
children of that sex). Thus, the estimation sample is somewhat unrepresentative and

estimates are less precise because of the smaller sample sizes. Also, there is some risk

that if peer quality is higher for one child in a family, this may correlate with other time-

varying features of the school also being better. This is an issue because this strategy does

not carefully control for school-level changes over time.



Endogeneity of School Starting Age

     There is a potential endogeneity problem in equation (4) in that parents may

strategically choose the starting age of their child in response to the peer composition of a

particular cohort in a particular school. For example, a parent may hold back their child

by a year if the child has friends that are not starting until a year later. Thus, while the

peer composition in one’s year-of-birth may be random (conditional on the school), the

peer composition in one’s grade may not be.15 To deal with this, we instrument the peer

variables with what they would have been if everybody had started on time i.e. the peer

characteristics of one’s birth cohort.16 For completeness, we instrument all other variables

with what they would have been if everybody started on time. For example, we

instrument the cohort dummies with birth-year dummies.17 Additionally, we instrument

the actual school starting age of the child with what it would have been if the child started

on time.



15
   If everybody followed the administrative rule, all students in a particular grade would have the same
year-of-birth.
16
   This instrumental variables strategy is similar in spirit to that of Hoxby and Weingarth (2006) who use
characteristics of peers who are assigned to a school as instruments for the actual peer characteristics in the
school.
17
   Our instrumental variables strategy partially motivates the specification we use i.e. equation (4) rather
than equation (2). It would be impossible to instrument 1000+ school-specific trends but it is easily feasible
to instrument the controls for the fitted peer variables with what they would be if everyone started on time.

                                                                                                            11
4. Norwegian School Structure


         In Norway, compulsory education is free; since 1997, schooling has been

compulsory from age 6 to 16 (10th grade). However, the cohorts we consider faced a

school starting age of 7 with 9 years of compulsory schooling. Schools are run by the

local municipality and there is no tracking by ability during the years of compulsory

schooling.18 School attendance is based on your place of residence, and the rules that

pupils attend the school in their catchment area are strictly enforced.19

         The focus of our study is on lower secondary school, which is comprised of

grades 7-9. The mandatory school system in Norway is split into primary schools (grades

1-6) and lower secondary schools (grades 7-9). Most pupils attended separate primary

and secondary schools, while about 20 percent went to combined primary and secondary

schools (Hægeland, Raaum, and Salvanes, 2005). Most combined schools are in rural

areas and have a small number of students.




18
  There are very few private schools in Norway and only about 2% of all pupils attend them.
19
  At the high school level there are differences across municipalities and across time regarding the degree
of school choice but this does not occur until students have completed lower-secondary school.

                                                                                                         12
           Unlike in the United States, students stay with the same group of students for all

their classes in the day and throughout the year. Different teachers are allocated to each

class based on field. There is essentially no grade retention in Norway (Strøm, 2004),

suggesting that all students that start the same year also graduate the same year.

Furthermore, 95.3 percent of the students lived in the graduation municipality for all

three years in the lower secondary school, suggesting very little mobility.



5. Data

           Our primary data source is the Norwegian Registry Data, a linked administrative

dataset that covers the population of Norwegians up to 2006 and is a collection of

different administrative registers such as the education register, family register, and the

tax and earnings register. These data are maintained by Statistics Norway and provide

information about educational attainment, labor market status, earnings, and a set of

demographic variables (age, gender) as well as information on families.20 We focus on

cohorts born between 1959 and 1973.21

           The school data come from the Norwegian education register. Each school in

Norway was legally required to report when a student graduated from primary and

secondary school. As a result, we know from which school each pupil graduated.



Peer Characteristics

            There are a number of ways peers in middle school could affect the outcomes of

an individual. Teachers may adapt the way they teach to be most appropriate to the


20
     See Møen, Salvanes and Sørensen [2004] for a description of these data.
21
     We exclude a small number of individuals who started school more than 1 year early or 1 year late.

                                                                                                          13
group as a whole, peers may help the other students in the class by providing assistance

or acting as role models, and the characteristics of peers may influence the self-esteem of

students in the class. Because there is so little understanding of the mechanisms for peer

effects, it is very difficult to know the appropriate measures of peer

quality/characteristics.

         In our model, we use three measures of peer characteristics.22 The first is the

fraction of girls in the grade. Evidence suggests that girls are better behaved and cause

fewer disruptions in the classroom (Lavy and Schlosser, 2007). Theoretical work by

Lazear (2001) suggests that having less-disruptive students in the class has beneficial

effects on all students in the class; in this case, a higher fraction of girls in the classroom

would have a positive effect on outcomes of both boys and girls. However, a higher

fraction of girls in the class could also provide greater distraction for teenage boys. This

could cause differential effects by gender, with more girls having a negative impact on

outcomes of boys, and, symmetrically, more boys having a negative impact on outcomes

of girls. Ultimately, this is an empirical question.

         Our second measure is the average age in the classroom. In earlier work, we

documented an effect of school starting age on the outcomes of adults; one of the most

notable findings was the effect on teenage childbearing. (See Black, Devereux and

Salvanes, 2008.) Women who start school younger are more likely to have children as

teenagers. One possible explanation for this is the influence of peers; girls who start

school younger have a relatively older peer group and may be influenced by their peers’



22
  In the peers literature, researchers often focus on the effects of peer ability on outcomes (see Lavy et al.
2009 for a recent example). We have no measure of ability and so focus on the effects of pre-determined
peer characteristics.

                                                                                                             14
behavior.23 This would imply that, conditional on own age, having older peers increases

the likelihood of teen pregnancy. Peer age could also affect other outcomes by changing

the average maturity in the classroom. In this case, we would expect that having older

peers would lead to better academic outcomes. Because grade repetition is extremely rare

in Norway, the average school starting age of peers determines the average age of peers

in 9th grade and we use both terms interchangeably.

        Our final measure of peer characteristics is the average mother’s education of the

students in the grade, which we use as a proxy for socioeconomic status.24 In general, we

would expect peers with higher socio-economic status to have positive spillovers. Early

work by Evans, Oates, and Schwab (1992) studies the relationship between the presence

of disadvantaged peers and teenage pregnancy; they find a significant, although small,

relationship between the two which disappears when they control for selection into

schools using a simultaneous equations model and city-level characteristics as

instruments.

        Peers are measured as the group of students in your grade and school in the 9th

grade. There may be substantial persistence in peers over time. As a result, these peer

measures represent not only the peers an individual faces in the 9th grade but, to the

extent these are the same peers they have had throughout their educational experience



23
  Cascio and Schanzenbach (2007) use variation in peers induced by the randomization to classes in the
Tennessee STAR experiment to examine the role of relative age on the performance of students in the 8th
grade as well as whether or not the individual takes the SAT or ACT exam. The authors find little effect of
relative age once controlling for the age of the individual; however, when the data is decomposed by family
background, there is some effect of relative age on the outcomes of more disadvantaged students.

24
  We have also tried creating a socio-economic index by regressing an individual’s educational attainment
on dummies for family size, mother’s education, father’s education, whether the person is an immigrant,
and family income in 1978, 1983, and 1988 and using the predicted value as a socioeconomic index. We
found very similar results for this variable to those we report for mother’s education.

                                                                                                        15
(and will continue to have into the future), the estimated effect represents the cumulative

effect of peers throughout the educational experience.

         As described below, we create instruments for these peer variables using the

individuals who were born in the same cohort and went to the same school (whether or

not they finished in the same year).

         The variation we are using is that in peer characteristics, conditional on average

student characteristics in the school and on cohort fixed effects. To alleviate concerns

about insufficient variation in our variables of interest, we have calculated the fraction of

total variation in peer characteristics that is explained by these control variables using the

R2 from regressions with the peer characteristics as dependent variables. In the

specification that allows for school-specific linear trends, the percentage explained ranges

from 17% (percentage female) to 46% (average age) to about 91% (mother’s education).

With the moving average controls, the percentages are higher at 35%, 51%, and 92%

respectively. This suggests there is still substantial variation left in these variables even

after including cohort fixed effects and detailed controls for school characteristics.25



Outcome Variables

IQ Scores

         The IQ score data is taken from the Norwegian military records from 1980 to

2005. Before young men enter the service, their medical and psychological suitability is

assessed; this occurs for the great majority between their eighteenth and twentieth



25
  The 10th percentile values of the peer variables are .41, 7.2, and 8.8 for the percentage female, the
average age, and the average mother’s education, while the 90th percentile values are .56, 7.4, and 10.9
respectively.

                                                                                                           16
birthday.26 In Norway, military service is compulsory for every able young man; as a

result, we have military data for men only.27

        The IQ measure is the mean score from three IQ tests -- arithmetic, word

similarities, and figures (see Sundet et al. [2004, 2005] and Thrane [1977] for details).

The arithmetic test is quite similar to the arithmetic test in the Wechsler Adult

Intelligence Scale (WAIS) [Sundet et al. 2005; Cronbach 1964], the word test is similar

to the vocabulary test in WAIS, and the figures test is similar to the Raven Progressive

Matrix test [Cronbach 1964]. The IQ score is reported in stanine (Standard Nine) units, a

method of standardizing raw scores into a nine point standard scale that has a discrete

approximation to a normal distribution, a mean of 5, and a standard deviation of 2.28 We

have IQ scores on about 84% of the relevant population of men in Norway.

Teenage Childbearing

        We construct our teenage childbearing variable by restricting the sample to

women aged at least 36 in 2006 and denoting a teen birth if they have a child that is aged

at least 16 in 2006 who was born before the woman was aged 20.29 Approximately 9.7%

of our sample of women had a child before age 20.

Educational Track

        At the end of 9th grade (the end of compulsory education), an individual chooses

(conditional on grades) whether to enter the academic track, the vocational track, or drop

out of school. The academic track (or general track, also called gymnasium) is a three

26
   We add a control for the year the test was taken in the IQ score specifications.
27
   Norway has mandatory military service of between 12 and 15 months (fifteen in the Navy and twelve in
the Army and Air Force) for men between the ages of 18.5 (17 with parental consent) and 44 (55 in case of
war). However, the actual draft time varies between six months and a year, with the rest being made up by
short annual exercises.
28
   The correlation between this IQ measure and the WAIS IQ has been found to be .73 (Sundet et al., 2004).
29
   In order to know whether a woman had a teen birth we need to observe both the mother and child in the
administrative panel. The result is that the cohorts we use are born between 1963 and 1970.

                                                                                                       17
year high school education preparing for college. Students who complete this track are

then eligible for college enrolment. In contrast, the vocational track consists of

vocational training and, although it generally takes 3 years, can require as little as one

year in school followed by an apprenticeship. Upon completion, the individual receives a

certificate of proficiency within their area of specialization. 30 Using OLS and controlling

for family background factors, there is an earnings premium of almost 20% to taking the

high school track rather than the vocational track

Labor Market Variables

         Earnings are measured as total pension-qualifying earnings reported in the tax

registry in 2005. These are not topcoded and include labor earnings, taxable sick benefits,

unemployment benefits, parental leave payments, and pensions. We identify full time

workers (defined as 30+ hours per week) using the fact that our dataset identifies

individuals who are employed and working full time at one particular point in the year (in

the 2nd quarter in the years 86-95, and in the 4th quarter thereafter).31 About 71% of our

male sample are employed full time in 2005; the equivalent figure for women is 48%.

         Table 1 presents summary statistics for our sample.




6. Results


A. Balancing Tests



30
   Overall, 74% of girls follow the academic track, 20% the vocational track, and the remaining 6% drop
out after compulsory schooling. For men, the numbers are 45% academic, 48% vocational, and 7% drop
out.
31
   An individual is labelled as employed if currently working with a firm, on temporary layoff, on up to two
weeks of sickness absence, or on maternity leave.

                                                                                                         18
       Before presenting our results, we first examine the validity of our identifying

assumptions. The basic notion is that, conditional on the controls, variation in peer

characteristics should be “as if random” and, hence, should not be correlated with

predetermined characteristics of children such as their family background variables. To

examine this issue, we regress mother’s education and other predetermined variables on

the peer characteristics using the specifications described earlier but excluding the

predetermined variables (i.e. all the individual control variables) from these regressions.

To the extent that the presence of these variables in the main specifications reduces bias,

these balancing tests provide a worst-case assessment of the situation. The estimates

reported are from IV models where the actual peer variables are instrumented by what

they would be if everyone started school on time. The estimates are in Appendix Table 1.

       The first panel of Appendix Table 1 is the quasi fixed effects specification that

includes controls for the mean values of the peer variables for the school. The second

panel adds controls for the school-specific trends by adding the predicted value of the

peer variables given a linear school-specific trend. The third panel instead adds the 3-year

moving average of the peer characteristics as controls.

       Note that in all 3 panels but particularly in panels 2 and 3, there is a tendency for

a strong negative coefficient on, say, average mother’s education of peers when the

dependent variable is mother’s education. This results from small sample bias and is

similar to the short panel bias that occurs in dynamic fixed effects models. To see why,

consider the 3rd panel where we control for the 3-year moving average of mother’s

education in the school. If conditional on this, your peer average maternal education is

high, your own maternal education will tend to be low (as both your maternal education



                                                                                           19
and that of your peers go into forming the moving average). The 4th panel attempts to

correct for this bias by forming the school means and the moving averages leaving out

observation i. For the most part, the large negative relationships disappear in the 4th

panel.

         Unsurprisingly, the proportion of peers that are female is unrelated to any

predetermined variable in any specification (except a negative relationship with sex as a

result of small sample bias in the first 3 panels). For the other two peer variables, the

results show a clear pattern of improvement from panel 1 to panel 4. The quasi fixed

effects specification in panel 1 is clearly inadequate for studying average mother’s

education of peers. However, any positive relationship between this and a child’s own

characteristics disappear once moving averages are included as controls. Average age of

peers is unrelated to all variables except first-born status in the trends and moving

average specifications. We have no idea why. Overall, the conclusion is that all

specifications are likely to be valid when studying the effect of proportion female.

However, when studying the other two peer variables, we can have far more confidence

in the specifications with trends and moving averages.



B. Education Track

         The first outcome we look at is the education track; Table 2 shows estimates

where the dependent variable is whether the student follows an academic high school

track after completing compulsory schooling, estimated by gender. When we look at the

coefficients for the individual level characteristics for both boys and girls, it is not

surprising that first-borns and students with higher maternal education are more likely to



                                                                                            20
follow this track.32 The OLS impact of school starting age is negative but the IV

estimates are positive and suggest that starting school a year later increases this

probability by about 1% for boys and .7% for girls.33

         The only peer variable that appears to influence educational track choice is the

fraction of the class that is female, and this is only true among boys – more girls make it

less likely that any particular boy does the academic track. To get a sense of the

magnitude of these effects, going from 40% girls to 60% girls reduces the probability by

about .01 from a baseline of about .5. The other peer characteristics are all small and

statistically insignificant with the exception that maternal education has a statistically

significant positive effect in the quasi fixed effects specification. However, this result

disappears once we allow for time-varying school quality using either the trends or the

moving average. None of the other peer characteristics appears important for either sex.

Almost all estimates are insignificant and the peer effects are much smaller than the

analogous direct effects, despite the fact that the standard deviations of the individual

characteristics are much higher than those of the peer characteristics.



C. Completed Years of Education

         For the remaining outcome variables, we report only the IV estimates for the peer

characteristics. Estimates for completed years of education are in Table 3. These results

reveal an interesting dichotomy. A higher proportion of girls has a negative effect on

completed education of boys. However, if anything, more girls have a positive effect on

32
   See Black, Devereux, Salvanes (2005a, 2005b) for analysis of the effects of birth order and maternal
education in Norway.
33
   The change in sign from OLS to IV results from the fact that, in the IV specification, we instrument child
age with what it would have been if the child had started school at the age specified by the administrative
rule. Late school starters appear to be negatively selected and this leads to large negative OLS age effects.

                                                                                                          21
education of girls so it appears that each sex benefits from having more of their own

gender. The size of the effect for boys is about -.2 which implies that going from 40% to

60% girls would reduce average completed education of boys by about .04. The effects of

peer maternal education seem equally small for boys and girls at about .03 – the

coefficient is slightly larger and more significant for girls but the difference is quite

small.



D. Teenage Childbearing

         Motherhood at young ages has been associated with many long-term economic

and health disadvantages such as lower education, less work experience and lower wages,

welfare dependence, lower birth weights, higher rates of infant mortality, and higher rates

of participation in crime (Ellwood, 1988; Jencks, 1989; Hoffman, and Furstenberg, 1993;

Kiernan, 1997). There is an ongoing debate as to the extent that these adverse effects of

teen childbearing are truly caused by having a teen birth rather than reflecting unobserved

family background differences. (See Hotz, McElroy, Sanders 2005 for an example).

However, as a policy matter, efforts to reduce the rate of teen childbearing are often

considered as a strategy to improve the life chances of young women.

         Table 3 presents the results of 2SLS linear probability models of teenage

childbearing. The fraction female is negative and statistically significant in both

specifications. The effect size is about -.025 which implies that if a class went from 40%

female to 60% female, the resultant probability of a woman giving birth as a teen falls by

-.005. Given that the baseline probability is about .1, and this is a large change in class

composition, this seems to be a relatively modest sized effect.



                                                                                              22
       We hypothesized that higher peer age may lead to more teen pregnancies.

However, we find very small and statistically insignificant coefficients in the two

specifications, suggesting that the effect of starting school later on teen pregnancy comes

primarily from absolute rather than relative age effects. There is also little evidence that

peer maternal education matters for teen childbearing.



E. IQ Test Scores

       Table 3 has estimates where the dependent variable is IQ test scores for men at

around age 18. The dependent variable is measured in stanine units with a standard

deviation being approximately 2 stanines. Here, we find some evidence that having

classmates with higher maternal education has a positive effect. However, this effect is

only statistically significant in the trends specification. The maternal education effect of

about .03 suggests that even increasing average maternal education of peers by 1 year

would only increase IQ scores of a student by about 1.5% of a standard deviation. This is

surely a modest effect.



F. Labor Market Outcomes in 2005

       Table 3 also has estimates from a 2SLS linear probability model of whether or not

the individual works full time in 2005 and 2SLS regression of their log earnings in 2005

on our measures of peer characteristics. Because of the fundamentally different labor

market experiences of men and women, we have omitted estimates that pool genders and

simply report results separately by sex. The only peer variable that matters is fraction

female. Once again we have the contrasting effects that more girls appear to increase full-



                                                                                           23
time participation for women but reduce it for men (although the male estimates are not

quite statistically significant). The finding is very similar for earnings with more girls

being beneficial to women but having an adverse, although statistically insignificant,

effect on men.



Results using sibling fixed effects

         The sibling fixed effects estimates are presented in Table 4. Because this method

requires two children of the same sex per family, the sample sizes are much smaller than

before and the standard errors are correspondingly higher. As a result, there are very few

statistically significant peer effects. However, the same general pattern that was seen in

Table 3 is present here – a higher fraction of female peers generally improves outcomes

of girls and hurts outcomes of boys.



Recent Cohorts

         We also have information on children who start school between 1982 and 1996

(Oslo from 1985) and who finish school lower secondary school between 1991 and

2006.34 Because these are more recent cohorts, we do not have labor market information

or even completed education for most of them, and so we report estimates for high school

track.

         For more recent cohorts who started school between 1992 and 1996, we also have

information on 10th grade math scores. Data are collected by the Directorate for Primary

and Secondary Education. Scores are awarded on a scale from one to six, with higher


34
  There is no information on lower secondary school attended for any person who finished lower
secondary school in 1990 so this cohort is excluded from all analysis in this paper.

                                                                                                 24
scores indicating better performance. We focus on marks in math assessed throughout the

year (Math Score1) as well as performance in the final written examination at the end of

10th grade (Math Score2). The final exam mark is based on a five-hour test in math. All

pupils in the country do the same (subject-specific) test, and pupils are randomly

allocated to subjects such as math, English and Norwegian.35 While the grading for the

final exam is anonymous and done by external examiners, the assessment throughout the

year is done by teachers. We use these test scores to compare the results generated with

our datasets (pooled and then by gender, for comparability) to those for in-school scores

in the existing literature.36

         The main estimates are in Table 5. As in the earlier cohorts, we find that a higher

fraction of women reduces the proportion who do the academic high school track and that

this effect is only significant for boys. The magnitude is very similar in these cohorts to

that for the earlier cohorts. The sibling fixed effects estimates in Table 7 also show the

negative effect of more females on academic track. Interestingly, our earlier findings

about the impact of girls also hold for cohorts in which the educational attainment of girls

had increased relative to that of boys.

         On the other hand, while the magnitude and statistical significance of the

estimates varies by specification, both sets of estimates suggest that math scores are

higher when there is a higher fraction of girls. We find this result both for in-class

assessment (Score1) and for exam results (Score2). Given that the standard deviation of

math test scores is 1.1 (see Appendix Table 2), the coefficient values of between .1 and

.27 from the various specifications imply that a 10% increase in the proportion of girls

35
   Because of the fact that the test taken (English, Norwegian, or Math) is randomized so students only take
one of these 3, we only have information on Math test scores for about one third of the sample.
36
   Appendix Table 2 contains descriptive statistics for the sample of recent cohorts.

                                                                                                         25
would lead to between .9% and 2.5% of a standard deviation increase in math test scores.

This result is both qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the findings of Lavy

and Schlosser (2007) for Israel, Kang (2007) for South Korea, and Hoxby (2000) for the

United States. The findings for high school track and math test scores taken together

suggest the possibility that while having more girls in a grade increases test scores, it may

have other detrimental effects (particularly on boys).

       In terms of the other peer variables, there is some evidence that having older

classmates reduced the probability that boys follow the high school track, but this is not

consistent across specifications. Similarly, there is a little evidence that higher maternal

education of peers leads to higher math test scores.

       Table 6 reports sibling fixed effects estimates for the recent cohorts. We do not

split by gender because the standard errors become sufficiently high as to make the

estimates quite uninformative. Also, we do not report estimates for Math Score2 as there

are very few cases where we have scores for two people in the same family. The sibling

fixed effects estimates are less precisely estimated but the coefficients on proportion

female are quite similar to those in Table 5.



Non-Linear Effects

       Our base specification allows for linear effects of the average characteristic over

all peers, excluding the individual him/herself. It also allows for parameter heterogeneity

by gender but not along other dimensions. However, in addition to the homogenous effect

linear-in-means model, we have also estimated more flexible specifications that enable us

to test for non-linear and heterogeneous effects.



                                                                                            26
         To test for non-linear effects, we created 3 categories for each peer variable. For

proportion female, we categorized classes as being less than 40% female, between 40 and

60% female, or being more than 60% female. We created similar splits for the other two

peer variables.37 In all cases, there was no evidence of these types of non-linear effects.38

         An alternative approach to non-linearities is to allow outcomes to depend on a

measure of the variability of peer characteristics in addition to the mean level. We have

implemented this by adding the standard deviation of mothers’ education in the grade and

the standard deviation of age in the grade as additional peer variables. As before, we

instrument these variables with what they would have been if everybody had started

school on time. The estimates are reported in Table 7. We find no effect of the standard

deviation of child age. However, while not all estimates are statistically significant, there

is a clear suggestion that a lower standard deviation of mothers’ education produces

better outcomes.39 The coefficient implies that a one standard deviation increase in the

standard deviation of mothers’ education leads to a fall in completed education of about

.02 of a year on average. This would seem to be a fairly small effect. Also, the

coefficients on average maternal education of peers are generally higher in Table 7 than

in Table 3 because the mean and standard deviation of maternal education are positively

correlated. The increases in the coefficients are small and remain consistent with a very

modest role of average peer socio-economic status.




37
   These non-linearities allow for evidence of threshold, or “epidemic” effects (Crane 1991).
38
   We note, however, that the standard errors become quite high in some of our sample splits so that
differences in coefficients would have to be fairly large for us to reject the linear model.
39
   Note that we control for grade size and have also checked that the estimates are robust to adding
additional controls for the square root and the square of the number of students in the grade in the school.
Thus, our estimates are not contaminated by correlations between the standard deviation of maternal
education and the size of the grade.

                                                                                                           27
       To test for heterogeneity, we carried out separate regressions of the linear-in-

means peers model by different types of individuals. We found no evidence of

heterogeneity when we split the sample by low, medium, or high mother’s education.

Similarly splits by whether first born, whether started school late, whether had a birth

month that predicted being relatively old for the class, or whether was in a large school or

a small school all showed no evidence of heterogeneous effects. It is plausible that school

peer effects might be larger for teenagers who are only children as peer influence does

not compete with the influence of siblings. However, we also found no evidence for this

type of heterogeneity.

       We also estimated some specifications that allowed for both non-linearity and

heterogeneous effects. For example, we allowed the effects of low, median, or high

mothers education to vary by whether the peers were male or female. Once again, there

was no evidence to reject the simple linear-in-means constant effects model.



7. Conclusions

       Public policies are affected by, and often rely on, the fact that an individual’s

peers influence his/her behavior. Despite this, the evidence on the existence of peer

effects has been inconclusive. In this paper, we have investigated the importance of three

peer characteristics in lower secondary school on subsequent outcomes of students. We

have two main findings. The first is that average age of peers and their socio-economic

status (as proxied by mother’s education) have very little effect on long run outcomes.

The non-importance of average age of peers implies that relative age effects cannot




                                                                                           28
explain the finding of Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2008) that girls who start school

younger are more likely to have teen births.

       The second main finding is that the proportion of girls appears to matter and in a

way that differs by gender – a higher proportion of girls is generally good for the longer

run outcomes of girls but bad for boys. This is despite the existing evidence that suggests

that a higher proportion of girls improves shorter run, in-school test scores for both boys

and girls. Importantly, because we are able to look at in-school test scores for a

subsample of our data, we are able to demonstrate that these test score gains are true in

our data as well; short term test score gains due to a higher fraction of girls are offset by

the longer run negative effects of a higher fraction of girls on boys. Our results suggest

that a higher proportion of girls reduces the probability teenage boys continue onto an

academic high school track and reduces completed years of schooling. It appears that, at

least for teenagers, peer sex composition has complicated effects.

Each column reports the estimates from a separate regression. All specifications include additional controls for indicators for cohort. IV
specifications instrument all peer variables with what they would be if all students had started school in accordance with the school starting age
laws in Norway at that time. Cohort dummies are instrumented with year of birth dummies. Standard errors are clustered at the school level.
*: Statistically Significant at the 5% level.
