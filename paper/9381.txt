                                          ABSTRACT

       We propose a framework for understanding recurrent historical episodes of vigorous
economic expansion accompanied by extreme asset valuations, as exhibited by Japan in the
1980's and the U.S. in the 1990's. We interpret this phenomenon as a high-valuation equilibrium
with a low effective cost of capital based on optimism about the future availability of funds for
investment. The key to the sustainability of such equilibrium is feedback from increased growth
to an increase in the supply of funding. We show that such feedback arises naturally when the
expansion is concentrated in a “new economy” sector and when it is supported by sustained
financial surpluses-both of which would constitute an integral part, as cause and consequence, of
a “speculative growth”equilibrium. The high-valuation equilibrium we analyze may take the
form of a stock market bubble. In contrast to classic bubbles on non-productive assets, the
bubbles in our model encourage real investments, boost long run savings, and may appear in
dynamically efficient economies.

1     Introduction

The last two decades have witnessed stark “speculative growth” episodes of extreme stock
market valuations accompanied by brisk economic growth. Most notable was the experience
of Japan in the 1980s and the United States in the 1990s. Figure 1a illustrates the sharp rise
in the Nikkei in the 1980s, followed by the two-year slide of 1990-1992; and the sharp rise
in the NASDAQ in the 1990s, followed by the collapse of 2000-2001. The extremes reached
by valuations shown in figure 1b, and their collapse in the absence of obvious changes in
fundamentals, are suggestive of a stock market bubble. Figures 1c and 1d illustrate the
growth and investment boom-and-bust that accompanied the market’s gyrations.

    The nature and policy dilemmas of speculative expansions have attracted much atten-
tion (e.g., International Monetary Fund 2000, Shiller 2000, Cecchetti et al. 2000), but our
formal understanding of the macroeconomic mechanisms that underlie the relation between
stock market speculation and real economic activity remains quite limited. In fact, the clas-
                                                                              1
sic literature on bubbles in general equilibrium bears little relation to speculative growth
episodes. In this literature, bubbles – understood as asset prices that deviate from funda-
mental values – can only appear in a “dynamically inefficient” economy, that is one whose
structure is conducive to the over-accumulation of capital. Their emergence helps to absorb
saving away from investment and to alleviate the over-accumulation problem. However, the
notion that the emergence of a bubble would crowd out investment, while its bursting would
increase investment, is contrary to the patterns depicted in figure 1. Moreover, empirical
testing of “dynamic inefficiency” has been negative. Abel et al. (1989) tested an implication
of dynamic inefficiency, whether the aggregate market for assets acts as a long-term “cash
sink” for investors, but found no evidence of it in OECD economies.
    This paper proposes an alternative framework for understanding speculative expansions
that is better able to address the facts. Our interpretation of this phenomenon rests on two
premises: (i) the rise in market valuations in speculative growth episodes results from a
low effective long-term cost of capital; and (ii) the boom in investment and growth during
such episodes is a response to increased asset prices along the standard q-theory line. The
central question that arises under this interpretation is: How are expectations of a low
long-term cost of capital consistent with the high demand for savings needed to fund a
high-investment equilibrium? A key component of our equilibrium account is a growth-
saving feedback by which the future supply of savings increases as a result of the conditions

created by a speculative expansion, and ends up lowering the effective cost of capital.
    The kind of stock market bubbles that can arise in the presence of growth-saving feed-
back have very different implications from standard bubbles. First, rather than crowding
out capital accumulation, they naturally encourage investment and growth. Conversely,
their bursting leads to an investment slump as the economy rids itself of what appears ex
post as widespread overcapacity. Second, because they induce greater saving, such bubbles

are expected to reduce the long-run cost of capital; this, one can show, allows them to
arise in a dynamically efficient context. Finally, such bubbles and the resulting specula-
tive expansions are manifestations of a more general class of low cost-of-capital equilibria
that are the result of the feedback from growth to saving. Such equilibria are qualitatively
similar to bubbly equilibria, in that they exhibit high asset valuations and can involve a
collapse in asset prices in the absence of any news. However, these equilibria may or may
not incorporate a bubble in asset markets, depending on how extreme valuation levels are.
In other words, although consistent with market participants’ perception of a stock market
bubble, our account of speculative expansions does not hinge on ascertaining the presence

                                             2
of a bubble.
    In the particular case of the U.S. in the 1990s, we argue, at least two factors created the
conditions for a speculative growth episode: the emerging information technology sector
and conservative fiscal policy. Both factors created favorable conditions for growth-saving
feedback and for the possibility of a speculative equilibrium characterized by extreme stock
market valuations and a potential crash.
    How does the information technology sector generate feedback from growth to saving?
This is an emerging sector of the economy, subject to a lesser degree of diminishing returns
than more mature sectors. As the economy expands, such a “new economy” sector naturally
will expand proportionally more than the rest of the economy and will have a greater
ability to generate income for saving. Moreover, in an endogenous growth version of this
model, we show that a bubble not only might be necessary for productivity growth to
accelerate, but that the resulting expansion in productivity, income, and saving also might
be critical to creating the growth-saving feedback necessary to support the bubble. Thus,
a fundamental expansion in productivity and stock market speculation are not necessarily
competing explanations. A technological revolution might form an integral part – both as
cause and consequence – of a speculative growth equilibrium.
    What about fiscal policy? We note that a significant share of increased saving in the
recent U.S. speculative expansion is attributable to the public sector. To the extent that
pro-cyclical government revenues increase public saving, they reinforce the feedback from
growth to saving. In the short run, fiscal surpluses can arise as a consequence of the stock
market boom and can facilitate the initial rise in investment. More importantly, fiscal
surpluses can play a central role in making the speculative equilibrium feasible by providing
the funding necessary to sustain high investment in the long run. This consideration has
a particularly stark implication for fiscal policy during a speculative growth episode. The
possibility of using the fiscal surpluses that result from such expansions to cut taxes and raise
spending might be illusory, as these surpluses might be necessary to sustain the speculative
growth equilibrium that generated them.
    The speculative growth episodes to which our theory relates are a recurrent phenomenon.
Earlier episodes of vigorous economic expansion under speculative asset valuations have
been documented by economic historians. In the case of the U.S., this phenomenon also
can be observed in the expansions of the turn of the 20th century, the 1920s, and the 1960s
(see, e.g., Shiller 2000). Equally important, our theory can be brought to bear on sustained
low cost-of-capital equilibria, such as the prolonged expansions exhibited in a number of East

                                               3
Asian economies in the post-war period. In fact, the key feedback from growth to saving
in these economies has been documented. Examining the aggregate relationship between
income growth and saving in a cross-country panel of 64 countries over the period 1958-
1987, Caroll and Weil (1994) find that growth Granger causes saving with a positive sign,
but that saving does not Granger cause growth. The pattern of an acceleration in growth
followed by strong increases in saving rates is particularly clear in the high-growth, high-
saving East Asian economies of Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Gavin
et al. (1997) elaborate on this evidence and show that the estimated impact of growth on
saving is not only statistically significant but also very large in economic terms.
Relation to the literature

    In its economic theme, this paper is part of a long tradition of studies of speculative
growth episodes (e.g., Kindleberger 1989). In terms of the recent U.S. experience, this
literature is divided between those who see a case of speculative behavior (e.g., Shiller
2000), and those who, based on the significant acceleration in underlying U.S. productivity
growth, conclude that the expansion was driven by a technological revolution that affected
real fundamentals (e.g., Greenwood and Jovanovic, 1999; Hobijn and Jovanovic, 2000).
From this perspective, our contribution is to provide a unified perspective under which these
two views need not be mutually exclusive. On the contrary, an expansion of technological
opportunities and stock market speculation may be inseparable complements.1
    On the methodological side, our paper belongs to the literature on bubbles in general
equilibrium. As we mentioned earlier, the classic theory of bubbles in general equilibrium
(see Tirole 1985) is not designed well for addressing speculative growth episodes. It implies
that a bubble crowds out investment and only can arise in a dynamically inefficient econ-
omy. Neither of these elements is observed during these episodes. From this perspective,
the main distinctive feature of our framework is the centrality of the growth-saving mecha-
nism. The latter overturns standard conclusions by breaking the crowding-out mechanism
of equilibrium bubbles. Moreover, bubbly equilibria in our setting are a particular case of
low cost-of-capital equilibria, that exhibit the same qualitative features but do not hinge
   1
    The standard “technological revolution” interpretation faces a double challenge. First, in order to
explain the collapse of the market, it must assume a reversal of technological market expectations that finds
no counterpart in the commentary of market participants and their broad consensus that a bubble had
burst. Second, this interpretation does not match well with the decline during the expansion of long-term
interest rates and other measures of the cost of capital. The interpretation we offer in this paper shows that
these two aspects of the US expansion are not only compatible with a technological revolution, but might
be essential factors in its emergence.

on ascertaining the existence of a bubble.
     More recently, several papers have demonstrated that, in the presence of externalities
that create a wedge between private and social returns on investment, bubbles can arise
even if the bubbleless economy is dynamically efficient (e.g., Saint-Paul, 1992; Grossman
and Yanagawa, 1993; King and Ferguson, 1993). That is because dynamic efficiency requires
that the social rate of return exceed the rate of growth of the economy; the possibility of a
bubble instead requires that the private rate of return be below the rate of growth. These
two conditions are simultaneously feasible in the presence of a wedge between private and
social returns. However, the cash-flow test for bubbles developed by Abel et al. (1989)
still applies in the case of externalities because it concerns private returns, and rejects the
possibility of standard bubbles. In contrast, our mechanism does not depend on a wedge
between private and social returns, and a bubble can arise even if the speculative path starts
with a private return that exceeds the rate of growth of the economy. In particular, our
mechanism passes Abel et al.’s test.
     In standard models, bubbles reduce investment and growth by crowding out investment.
Olivier (2000) contributed to this literature by developing a model of bubbles on firm
creation which, like ours, leads to more rather than less investment.2 However, because
he does not incorporate a growth-saving feedback, bubbles in his model raise rather than
lower the long-term cost of capital. This makes it challenging for a bubble to account
simultaneously for high stock market valuations and high investment. In fact, for the
bubble in Olivier’s model to be price-increasing (see Weil 1990) – i.e., for the negative
effect on asset prices caused by the rise in the interest rate to be dominated by the positive
effect of the bubble – a large degree of ex-ante dynamic inefficiency is required.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present a prototypical
model of speculative growth. Our analysis is based on the Diamond (1965) overlapping-
generations model, to which we add adjustment costs and a special assumption about
the saving function. Adjustment costs allow us to characterize stock market booms and
their key role in facilitating the transition from low- to high-investment equilibria. Our
special saving function generically captures the growth-saving feedback that is central to
the existence of a high-valuation equilibrium. Section 3 presents a specific instance of the
generic mechanisms of section 2 in a model of the “new economy.” In section 4, we extend
our analysis to encompass fiscal surpluses and current account deficits as short- and long-
run funding mechanisms. Section 5 concludes and is followed by an appendix that presents

2     Speculative Growth: The Mechanics

In this section we present a prototypical model of speculative growth. Our analysis is based
on the Diamond (1965) overlapping-generations model, to which we add adjustment costs to
capital and a special assumption about the saving function. Adjustment costs are important
in any model in which changes in stock market valuations are central; otherwise the price
of capital would be constant. The special assumption about the saving function is intended
to capture the growth-saving feedback that is central to our interpretation of speculative
expansions. This section introduces the feedback generically through the functional form of
the saving function. The next two sections pay closer attention to specific macroeconomic
mechanisms – the “new economy” and fiscal conservatism – that can create feedback from
growth to saving and help explain recent speculative growth episodes.

2.1   Model Setup

Consider a standard Diamond (1965) overlapping-generations structure with no population
growth and a unit mass of young and old agents who coexist at any date t. Each generation
is born with a unit of labor, L L ≡ , to be used when young, for which it receives a

Preferences and the saving function.   Lifetime utility is a concave function of consump-

Capital market equilibrium. Following production in period t, the old sell their capital to

the young at a price q . The young allocate their savings to the purchase of the existing
                             t

stock of capital and to investment in new capital. Thus the capital market equilibrium
condition is
                                      s     q   x k.   t = ( t +               t)   t   (5)
    For any level of saving, the young take the price q as given and decide how much of     t

their savings will be allocated to purchase the existing stock of capital, k , and how much                          t

to invest in new capital. They do so to maximize their stock of capital when old:
                                        max

which yields the standard q-theory condition for investment:

                                                                  
                                                                                −x .    t


This equation implicitly defines the investment function
                                              xt       =     x(qt ),           x > 0.                                           (6)
   The equilibrium interest rate can be expressed as a function of the stock of capital
and its price. Replacing the saving and investment functions, (4) and (6), into the capital
market equilibrium condition, (5), and substituting the wage from (1), yields
                                                        rt   =    r(kt , qt ).                                                   (7)

Equilibrium dynamics.    Equilibrium dynamics are given by the capital accumulation equa-
tion, (3), and the arbitrage condition for holding a unit of capital from t to t :                                               +1


                                                                                             

The right hand side of this expression is the gross return from holding the unit of capital.
The only somewhat unusual term in this return derives from the adjustment cost function, as
one unit of capital at time t yields G units of capital at t . Since G g x − g x x,

2.2    The Growth-Saving Feedback and Speculative Growth

A generic way to introduce feedback from expansion to saving is through the functional
form of the saving function, s w, r . We assume that if the economy expands past a level

 o


specific instances of economic phenomena that can give rise to such feedback in subsequent
sections. Here we simply write the saving function as

    From equation (13), the k-constant arm is a horizontal line that corresponds to the single
level of q that balances the capital accumulation rate with the economy’s growth rate. On
          t

the other hand, the slope of the q-constant arm reflects equilibrium in the capital market.
The main factor behind this schedule’s negative slope is that, as the capital stock increases,
the price of capital must fall because the young’s ability to purchase the extra capital rises
less than proportionally with the additional investment requirement.3 The exception to this
slope is the upward jump in q at the level k = k where the saving of the young jumps

the classic steady state in the Diamond model. As illustrated in figure 2, for a sufficiently
large feedback from growth to saving, the jump in the q-constant arm will be large enough
to result in a second intersection at (k2 , q ).    ∗        ∗



    Turning to out-of-steady-state dynamics, figure 2 illustrates the dynamics generated by
the system of difference equations, (9)-(10). There are six distinct regions, characterized

    This effect dominates everywhere except at low levels of k. When k is small, the dominant reason for why
the q-constant is downward sloping is that the marginal product of capital declines sharply as k increases,
causing its price to decline.

illustrated in figure 3. The specific functional forms and parameter values underlying the
simulation are presented in appendix B. Starting from the initial conditions of steady-

cost of capital.
    The factor behind the increase in market valuations is the feedback from economic
expansion to saving, incorporated in the jump in the saving function at k . This jump
                                                                                    o


creates an abundance in the supply of funds and results in a decline in the effective cost
of capital. The stock market boom that takes place when the economy moves to the new
equilibrium reflects optimism about the future availability of funds and the cost of capital.
With this in mind, we will refer to the equilibrium that converges to (k2 , q ) as the low
                                                                                ∗       ∗



cost-of-capital equilibrium; and to the equilibrium that converges to (k1 , q ) as the high
                                                                            ∗       ∗



cost-of-capital equilibrium.
Investment and growth. The low cost-of-capital equilibrium exhibits higher investment
and growth than the high cost-of-capital steady state. Since q is above its steady-state
level along the low cost-of-capital equilibrium path, x(q) is also above its steady state level
and the capital stock grows to k2 . The growth in the capital stock causes an expansion
                                     ∗



in income growth during the transition (panel 3c). Over time, the growth rates of capital
and income return to normal, but the low cost-of-capital steady state is characterized by
permanently higher investment as a share of income (panel 3d).
    Conversely, starting from the low cost-of-capital growth path, the economy could ex-
perience an unanticipated dip to a recessionary equilibrium path that takes it back to the
high cost-of-capital steady state. Along that path, the stock market crashes and triggers
a slump in investment and growth as the economy rids itself of what appears ex post as
widespread overcapacity.

2.4   Bubbles as a Low Cost-of-Capital Equilibrium

So far, our discussion deliberately made no reference to bubbles. It turns out that in
our framework an equilibrium with a stock market bubble in the price q of capital –
                                                  12
understood as the difference between the price of an asset and its fundamental value –
can arise as a special case of the low cost-of-capital equilibrium described above. This kind
of bubble will arise if equilibrium investment is sufficiently high that it takes the economy
past a “satiation” point, where the production function is so saturated with capital that
its marginal product falls to zero. Besides the difference between the price of capital and
its fundamental valuation, bubbly equilibria in our model behave qualitatively the same as
non-bubbly low cost-of-capital equilibria.
Proposition 2 (Bubbles)
Suppose the production function has a finite satiation point, k = min{k: f  (k) = 0}. There
exist ∆r > 0 and k0 > 0 such that dynamic system (9)-(10) has precisely two non-degenerate
steady states, (k1∗ , q ∗ ) and (k2∗ , q ∗ ), where k1∗ < k0 < k2∗ and k2∗   ≥ k.   Along the low cost-
of-capital equilibrium path to (k2∗ , q ∗ ), the price of capital includes a bubble component and
becomes a pure bubble for all k > k .

Proof: See appendix A.
    Intuitively, assume the production function reaches satiation at the level of capital k.
A bubbly low cost-of-capital equilibrium can be constructed by increasing the jump r in          ∆

saving function (11) that drives the growth-saving feedback. This rise in saving increases
the capital stock, k2 , in the low cost-of-capital steady state. If the increase in saving, r , is
                     ∗
                                                                                                 ∆

large enough, k2 crosses the satiation point, k. At that point, a rational bubble emerges in
                 ∗



the price of capital. To see this, recall that the price of capital, q , remains the same across
                                                                             ∗



all steady states, given by (13). However, the marginal product of capital for any k2 ≥ k        ∗



is zero. All output in steady state goes to labor, and the aggregate stock market generates
no earnings for its owners. Thus, the positive value of q corresponds to a rational bubble
                                                                ∗



that is only sustained by the possibility of trading with other agents.
    Thus, the bubble that can emerge in this economy can be interpreted as an extreme
case of high stock market valuations driven by a low effective cost of capital.
    Looking at expression (15) for the steady-state price/earnings ratio, it is apparent that
as earnings decline to zero while the price of capital remains unchanged, the price/earnings
ratio goes to infinity and the effective cost of capital, r − GK , declines to zero. Moreover, if
the low cost-of-capital steady state is bubbly, then the price of capital along the equilibrium
path that converges to it also incorporates a bubble.
   The type of bubble that arises in our model differs in several respects from the classic
analysis of bubbles on non-productive assets (e.g., Tirole 1985):

                                                   13
   1. While bubbles on non-productive assets absorb saving away from investment, bubbles
      on capital can incentivize capital accumulation.4
   2. In the classic analysis, by driving up the demand for saving, bubbles increase the cost
      of capital. The key role of the growth-saving feedback in our theory is to reverse this
      effect, and cause expansionary bubbles to drive down the effective cost of capital.
   3. A low cost of capital increases the fundamental valuation of an asset even in the
      absence of a bubble. Bubbles in our model are simply an extreme case of a high-
      valuation equilibrium driven by a low cost of capital. Key to the continuity between
      the characteristics of bubbly and bubbleless equilibria is the growth-saving feedback.
      In the classic analysis, the introduction of a bubble raises the cost of capital and
      generates a macroeconomic outcome that runs counter high fundamental valuations
      due to a low cost of capital.
   4. A central feature of the classical theory of bubbles is that they can only arise in
      economies whose bubbleless equilibrium is dynamically inefficient. This need not be
      the case in our model. The classic argument for the necessity of dynamic inefficiency
      runs as follows.5 Asymptotically, a bubble cannot grow faster than the economy’s
      growth rate, γ . Otherwise, there would come a time when no agent is wealthy enough
      to hold it. Since a bubble must grow at the interest rate, r, its existence is only
      compatible with r ≤ γ. Moreover, since the introduction of a bubble crowds out
      investment and, therefore, increases r, we must have r < γ in the bubbleless equilib-
      rium. This condition implies dynamic inefficiency: capital must be accumulated at a
      rate γ that exceeds its return r, and therefore absorbs more resources than it gener-
      ates. Contrary to this argument, the bubbleless equilibrium in our model need not be
      dynamically inefficient for a bubble to arise. The main difference comes from the fact
      that, in the presence of a growth-saving feedback, introducing a bubble eventually
      reduces r. Thus, it is possible to start from a dynamically efficient (r > γ ) bubbleless
      situation, that turns dynamically inefficient (r < γ ) as a bubble eventually lowers r.6

     See Chirinko and Schaller (2001) for evidence on the response of investment to bubbles in Japan.
   5
     See the seminal discussion in Tirole (1985).
   6
     Note also that the stock market bubble in our model does not need to grow at the rate of interest.
The reason is that the existence of a bubble in q increases the value qGK of the marginal improvement
in capital-accumulation capacity associated with existing units of capital. Essentially, a bubble on capital
generates additional bubbles on the capital this asset helps to produce.




                                                    14
    In our model, what makes a bubble emerge in the price of capital as opposed to other,
non-productive assets? If the bubbleless economy is not dynamically inefficient, the only
asset that might support a bubble is capital. However, it is interesting to note that once
a bubble on capital arises, then it makes room for other bubbles on non-productive assets.
The reason is that our bubbly equilibrium can be shown to always drive the economy into
a dynamically inefficient region.7

3       Speculation and “New Economy” Expansions

A distinctive characteristic of the U.S. speculative expansion of the 1990s is that it was
concentrated in the new technology sector. As shown in panel 4a, the stock-market price
of “new economy” technology and growth companies boomed, while the price of traditional
“old economy” companies did not appreciate nearly as much. Panel 4b shows that during the
same period the share of aggregate investment that went to technology capital experienced a
sharp increase. More generally, speculative growth episodes typically have been associated
with the expansion of newly emerging sectors of the economy (see, e.g., Rappoport and
White 1993). This was the case during the expansion of the turn of the twentieth century,
which witnessed the growth of such new sectors as railroads, steel, and oil, and during the
“Roaring Twenties,” which witnessed the emergence of mass-production manufacturing,
electrification, automotive transportation, etc.
    In this section we argue that the emergence of a new production sector is associated
with a natural growth-funding feedback that provides a prime instance of the mechanisms
that can support a speculative growth equilibrium. We also argue, in an endogenous growth
context, that such speculative growth results in increased productivity growth.

3.1     An Emerging-Sector Model

We make two modifications to the model in section 2: we introduce a second production
sector in addition to the one experiencing speculative growth; and we drop the ad-hoc
   To see this, recall that the effective cost of capital, r − GK , is zero in a bubbly steady state.
    7
                                                                                                        Since
GK = g − g x < g and since, by (13), g = γ , we must have r < γ .
           



  Also note that because of the latter, non-productive bubbles will vanish asymptotically if the stock market
bubble is to survive. If that was not the case, then r = γ and the stock market bubble could not exist.
Without the latter bubble it is still possible for the non-productive one to exist, but it must leave enough
space for capital to drive the economy into the dynamically inefficient region. If this is not the case, then
the steady-state non-productive bubble is not feasible and only an equilibrium with a stock market bubble
could survive.

different type of capital, denoted by Z , and labor, L . We assume the following old-sector

expansion opportunities and reaches maturity earlier than the former. More precisely,
expanding capital in the old sector leads to faster diminishing returns on capital (which
we capture below by assuming |h | to be large enough) and benefits wages less (which we
                                           



capture by eliminating any expansion opportunity in labor beyond L ). Both characteristics             o


are key drivers of our results.
    To avoid increasing the dimension of the economy’s state space, we assume that con-
sumption goods can be transformed one-to-one into Z with no adjustment costs. Thus, the
                                                                                  t

stock of capital in the old sector is related contemporaneously to the interest rate:
                                                h (z +1) = r .
                                                 

We also assume the old sector productive enough that we have an interior solution in the
region of interest:
                                       L =L .            o
                                                         t

In this case, the wage rate in the old sector is equal to the marginal product of labor in
the new sector, w . Also, labor employed in the new sector now differs from the total labor
                    t

force, and is equal to L = L − L = (1 − λ)L, where λ ≡ L /L.

Growth-saving feedback. The second modification we make to the model in section 2 is
to drop the assumption of a jump in the saving function and assume a more conventional
undiscounted log-utility function.8 As is well known, this assumption implies the following
saving function for the young:
                                          s = 12 w . t                t                (17)
    The feedback from expansion to saving no longer comes from the structure of preferences,
but from the saving-generating features of the new sector. As in section 2, capital market

     Note that diminishing returns in the old-sector production function implies the presence of rents, which
effectively accrue to quasi-factors of production. We assume that these quasi-factors do not save.

    The positive feedback from growth to saving induces a negative feedback from growth
to the interest rate, r . To see this, note that by first-order condition (16) the saving surplus
                      t

determines interest rate function r = r(k , q ). While the interest rate function in section

generates more saving than it uses and reduces the interest rate; for high k , it generates                             t

less saving than it uses and increases the interest rate. Given the interest rate function,

Multiple equilibria.  The grow-saving feedback opens the possibility for multiple equilibria
through the emergence of a low cost-of-capital equilibrium. We show this possibility under
a special functional form that preserves the stark discontinuity of the model in section 2
and highlights the parallels with that model. We assume that the old-sector production
function, h(z), is piece-wise linear:

The range of k in which the interest rate dips corresponds to the range where the growth-

decreasing.
    The following proposition establishes the possibility of multiple steady states:
Proposition 3             (Multiple Steady States)
There exist       r+ >     0, ∆ro    >   0   and   zo >       0   such that dynamic system (9)-(10) has precisely


two non-degenerate steady states,                  (k1∗ , q ∗ )   and   (k2∗ , q ∗ ),     where       k2∗ > k1∗ .
     Note that since (16) allows us to solve out for zt+1 as a function of the interest rate, we can focus directly
     9


on the saving that goes into the new sector, defined as skt ≡ st − (1 + γ )zt+1 . By (16)-(18), it is given by
                            1
skt = 12 wt − (1 + γ ) (h ) (rt ) ≡ sk (wt , rt ), with skw > 0 and skr > 0. Having solved out for the old-sector
                            −



capital stock, we obtain a saving function into the new sector that is similar to function (4) in section 2.
However, the difference is that the positive interest-elasticity of sk (wt, rt ) does not come from preferences,
but from the possibility of reallocating saving from the old to the new sector.

                                                                       19
Proof:       See appendix C.
    To illustrate the emergence of multiple steady states, consider steady-state conditions
(13)-(14). Equation (13) equates qt to the level q∗ that balances the capital accumulation
rate with the economy’s growth rate. Equation (14) is an arbitrage condition that equates
the interest rate r(kt , qt) to the marginal return from investing in a unit of kt . As illustrated
by the dashed line in the bottom panel of figure 5, this marginal return is decreasing in
kt because of diminishing returns in the new sector. Given qt = q∗ , a steady state is the
intersection of the dashed line with the interest rate function. As shown in the figure, in
addition to steady state (k1∗, q∗ ), the economy can exhibit a second steady state, (k2∗ , q∗),
characterized by a low cost of capital. This will happen if the growth-saving feedback is
sufficiently strong in the sense that the dip in the interest rate (given by the measure ∆ro of
diminishing returns in the old sector) be large enough compared to the slope of the dashed
line (given by the degree of diminishing returns in the new sector). This condition captures
the idea that the new sector is immature relative to the old sector, in the sense that it
exhibits a relatively low degree of diminishing returns. If this were not the case, the old
sector would compete for saving with the new sector and would cause the interest rate to
rise relative to the new sector’s marginal product. This would prevent a sufficient fall in
the effective cost of capital that is behind the second steady state.10
    Equilibrium dynamics in the presence of multiple steady states are illustrated in figure
6. The heuristic phase diagram in this figure is similar to that in figure 2 of section 2.11 The
one difference is that, because now the discontinuity in the interest rate function r(kt , qt )
also depends on q, the phase diagram exhibits a discontinuity around the rising segment of
the q-stable arm – which, strictly speaking, does not exist in this case. This technicality
does not affect our analysis of equilibrium or dynamics.12 As before, there are two saddle-
path stable steady states: (k1∗ , q∗ ) and (k2∗ , q∗). Both are associated with the same price of
capital, q∗. However, (k2∗ , q∗) exhibits a lower effective cost of capital than (k1∗, q∗).

       A numerical simulation similar to that in section 2 can show that this economy exhibits
  10
     Another factor behind multiple equilibria in our model is the fact that expanding the new sector generates
more income for saving than the old sector. In our model, the type of income that generates saving is the
labor income of the young, but more generally this could also correspond to profits.
  11
     If k1 < kl (q ), which we assume, there can be no equilibrium in the region k > ku (q ). The reason is that
         ∗      ∗                                                                          ∗



in this region the q-stable arm is the continuation of the same arm for k < ku (q ), which is monotonically
                                                                                     ∗



decreasing and has already intersected the k-stable arm at k1 . ∗

  12
     For the latter, there is still a well defined value of q, for any given k in that region, such that dynamics
change from those below an (imaginary) q-constant arm to those above it.

multiple equilibria starting from the low steady state level of capital, k1∗ .13 What determines
transitional dynamics along a speculative growth expansion? Suppose the economy starts
at kt = k1∗ and experiences an unanticipated jump onto the equilibrium path that converges
to (k2∗, q∗). Sector reallocation plays an important role in this transition. The immediate
increase in capital accumulation in the new sector is caused by the reallocation of capital
from the old sector to the new accompanied by a jump in qt , combined with an initial increase
in the interest rate.14 As the new sector expands, it starts generating a saving surplus that
helps restore resources to the old sector and reverses the hike in the interest rate (increases

       Interestingly, had we introduced adjustment costs to the old-sector capital stock, zt , the initial impact
of jump to the speculative equilibrium path would include a drop in the price of old-sector capital, which is
reminiscent of the behavior of the stock price of “old economy” companies in the US expansion of the late
1990s.

the old sector expands beyond its initial capital stock and the cost of capital falls below its
initial level.

3.2   Technology Bubbles

The U.S. speculative expansion of the 1990s not only was concentrated in the technology
sector, but also was associated with an increase in productivity growth beyond what is
attributable to pro-cyclical productivity (e.g., Baily and Lawrence 2001). Table 1 presents
average multifactor productivity growth for the U.S. economy in subsequent five-year inter-
vals. It illustrates the acceleration of productivity growth in the second half of the 1990s.
This type of evidence formed the basis for the case that the U.S. expansion was not caused
by market speculation, but rather by underlying fundamentals that pointed to a techno-
logical revolution (e.g., Greenwood and Jovanovic, 1999; Hobijn and Jovanovic, 2000). To
address this issue, we endogenize growth in our two-sector model and show that the spec-
ulative growth equilibrium is associated with higher productivity growth. Moreover, we
show that increased productivity growth provides increased future income, which fuels the
key feedback from growth to saving. Thus, increased productivity growth is not only a
result of market speculation, but also can play a central role in the mechanisms that make a
speculative equilibrium possible. In our model, a technological revolution can be considered
an integral part – both as cause and consequence – of a speculative growth equilibrium.
Endogenizing growth. In order to endogenize growth, we modify the production functions
in our two-sector model. We now assume linear production functions in the two sectors, set
∆ro = λ = 0, and write aggregate output as
                                Y = AK L + r+Z , A, r+ > 0.

As before, an expansion in K benefits labor (savers) while an expansion in Z does not. We

                                                   22
interpret Kt as “technology” capital, subject to standard external spillovers, and make the
extreme assumption that Kt enters as a pure externality in production, which is indicated
by the superscript e on Kte . Because Kt enters as a pure externality, its private fundamental
value is qf ≡ 0. However, its price may be higher than qf and incorporate a bubble. As
before, Kt is accumulated according to (2), subject to adjustment costs; and Zt is subject
to no adjustment costs.
    Accumulation of Kt is still determined by the q-theory relationship, xt = x(qt). In the
absence of a private dividend, arbitrage equation (8) governing qt becomes

                               (1 + r ) q = (1 + G x(q ))q +1.

As long as Zt > 0, the interest rate is equal to the marginal product of                 Z:
                                                                                          t

    Finally, since the wage is AKte , our assumption of undiscounted log-utility implies that
saving is 12 AKte , and the capital-market equilibrium condition is

                                1 AK e = Zt+1 + (x(qt ) + qt ) K e .                          (22)

                           Figure 7: Endogenous Growth Model

Discussion. This model provides a stark example of speculative equilibrium that results in
sustained endogenous growth. Even though neither the K -sector nor the Z -sector are sub-
ject to social diminishing returns, only the former can be the engine of growth. The reason
is that it is the only one that can generate the feedback from growth to saving necessary
to fund investment along the balanced growth path. In the low-valuation trap, all saving is
trapped in the Z -sector, which does not generate more saving as it grows. If the economy
moves to the high-valuation equilibrium and incentivizes technology accumulation, saving
shifts to the technology sector which will create more saving as it grows. This growth-saving
feedback emerges through the technological spillover associated with technology investment,

                                             24
as productivity growth increases the income of savers. The feedback reduces the effective
cost of capital, r − GK , and gives rise to a high-valuation equilibrium.
    Two aspects of the high-valuation equilibrium are worth noting. First, unlike our previ-
ous models, here the fall in the effective cost of capital does not occur through a fall in the
interest rate, which is equal to a constant, r+ . High valuations in the stock market will not
be reflected by high valuations in the bond market. The reduction in the effective cost of
capital takes the form of an increase in the flow-value, qGK , offered by capital in opening
opportunities for profitable investment. This value increases along with the increase in the
investment ratio, x. Put differently, the speculative increase in the valuation of technology
is not associated with a fall in the interest rate, but rather with an increase in the value
of future investment opportunities opened by technology. This increase in value is tightly
linked with the high pace of investment in the high-valuation equilibrium.
    Second, the effective cost of capital in the high-valuation equilibrium falls to an extreme
level, r − GK = 0, consistent with the emergence of a technology bubble. In the presence
of externalities, such a bubble – if sustainable – can enhance welfare. Speculation of this
type can substitute for well-functioning markets and can encourage investment and growth.
Obviously, the risk is that the bubble may crash and trigger a crisis, an aspect we do not
model in this paper.


4        Public and Foreign Saving

Starting from the initial conditions of the low-valuation steady state in the models of sections
2 and 3, the high-valuation equilibrium implies an investment boom. For this investment
boom to materialize, it is important that it be supported by an increase in saving both in
the short term and in the long term.15
    Both models, whether we consider the short or the long run, rely on an increase in
private domestic saving. Of course, this is only one of the possible saving channels that
can fund investment. Figure 7 depicts the saving channels that funded the investment
booms associated with the Nikkei and the Nasdaq bubbles. The investment boom in both
episodes actually was accompanied by a decline in private domestic saving. The main
funding sources were government budget surpluses and the current account. This evidence
relates to the funding of investment at the inception and “early” stages of the speculative
expansion. Since the bubbles burst in this case, we have no direct evidence on the long-term
    Strictly, the model in section 3 does not need an increase in aggregate saving at impact since reallocation
    15


from old to new sector is possible.

sources of funding, which are at the core of the theory.
   Guided by the short-run evidence and its relevance for the policy debate, this section
focuses on two alternatives to domestic private saving in supporting speculative growth:
government saving and the current account.

4.1   Fiscal Policy and Surplus Illusion

The fiscal surpluses generated during the Japanese and U.S. speculative growth experi-
ences were the combined result of fiscal consolidation measures and the automatic effect of
procyclical tax revenues in a booming environment. The reduction in public debt had a
moderating effect on interest rates in the short run and substituted for increased private
saving to fund the investment boom. It is in this sense that a tight policy of paying down


                                                                    26
the national debt supported the boom in the short term. Turning to the more novel issue
of longer-term sustainability, and hence to a necessary condition for a rational speculative
growth episode, we argue that a continuing policy rule of generating fiscal surpluses provides
critical support to the high-valuation equilibrium.
    To develop our argument, we add a government to the first model of section 3 (with
λ = 0). We assume the government taxes wage income at a rate τ t and spends gtAtL on
goods that do not enter agents’ utility function. Thus the government’s budget constraint
is
                           (1 + γ)dt+1 = (1 + rt)dt − (τ twt − gt) ,                      (23)

where dt ≡ Dt /At L denotes public debt per unit of effective labor.
   Adding the public sector alters two equations in the model. The saving of the young
net of investment in z, skt , is now a function of after-tax wages:

                                    s = s ((1 − τ )w(k ), r ) ,
                                        k
                                        t
                                             k
                                                       t       t       t                          (24)

while the capital-market equilibrium condition is now given by

                          (τ w − g − r d ) + s = d + (q + x(q )) k .
                            t   t   t       t t
                                                  k
                                                  t        t       t       t   t                  (25)

The saving of the government and of the young must fund the purchase of the existing
public debt and capital stock from the old as well as funding new investment. Combined,
equations (24)-(25) implicitly define a new interest rate function rt = r(kt , qt , dt , τ t, gt ). The
economy’s dynamics are described by system (9)-(10) with the new interest rate function
together with the government budget constraint, (23), and a fiscal policy rule.
Let us consider a benchmark fixed-parameters policy rule under which detrended government
spending and the tax rate are fixed at g > 0 and τ > 0. To facilitate comparisons, we
assume that this and other policy rules result in a balanced budget in the low-valuation
steady state – which requires g = τw1∗ – and, therefore, result in the same low valuation
steady state. The important point to notice is that this fixed-parameters policy creates
primary surpluses during expansions beyond k1∗ and primary deficits during contractions.
To see this, note that the fiscal rule implies that the primary government surplus, (τwt − g),
increases with wt in an expansion. Thus the response of the combined “gross” saving of
                                                                              
government and the young to an increase in wages is given by τ + skw (1 − τ ) dwt. As long
as the young’s marginal propensity to save is less than one (skw < 1), which we assumed,
the fixed-parameter rule generates surpluses as the wage rises.


                                                  27
    The increase in saving generated by the fixed-parameters rule not only facilitates the
funding of investment in the short run but, more importantly, plays a central role in facili-
tating the emergence of a speculative growth scenario. This feasibility point is made most
clearly by focusing on the low cost-of-capital steady state, (k2∗, q∗ ), rather than on the entire
path. One can show easily that if, instead of being fixed, government spending is raised
with the endogenous increase in the wage, then aggregate saving falls and so does the level
of k2∗. In fact this fiscal expansion experiment is similar to reducing ∆r in section 2. For a
high enough indexation of fiscal spending to wages, the high investment equilibrium is no
longer feasible. In other words, fiscal surpluses are not only a symptom of the speculative
growth episode, but also can be a central element of the factors that support it.
    The notion that the fiscal surpluses generated by the speculative equilibrium can be
partly spent or rebated to the taxpayer may be an illusion. The surpluses could be a pillar
of the speculative equilibrium, and might swiftly disappear if this equilibrium unravels –
giving rise to what one might term as a surplus illusion.

Proposition 4 (Surplus Illusion)
Let g = g + ατ (w − w1∗ ). If the economy has two saddle-path steady state equilibria for
       t              t

α = 0, there exists an α > 0 such that for any α ≥ α , the high valuation equilibrium
                             m                                      m


disappears.

Proof:      See appendix D.

4.2        The Current Account

The second major source of funding for the investment boom in Japan and the U.S. was
the current account. As a short-term funding mechanism, international capital flows can
moderate the rise in interest rates needed to fund the investment boom.16 Over time, the
whole world may be dragged into a speculative path, with the home economy becoming the
chronic recipient of external resources.
    A simple reinterpretation of the model in section 2 (or 3) helps isolate these short and
long run aspects of capital inflows. For this purpose, let domestic residents now correspond
to the old at time 0, and assume they owe foreigners b0 A0 L = q∗ k1∗ A0L. All future (active)
  16
     Ventura (2001) describes an interesting alternative portfolio channel connecting the current account and
a domestic bubble. In his model, the main effect of the bubble is to raise domestic wealth. As domestic
agents attempt to rebalance their portfolios by investing in non-bubbly domestic equity, external borrowing
rises to finance the investment that is required to build domestic equity.



                                                     28
generations are foreigners that live abroad and export to the domestic economy interme-
diate inputs with 100 percent labor content, measured by L. Only the domestic economy
accumulates capital, Kt. Except for the labeling of the intergenerational flows, this model
can be analyzed in exactly the same way as the model in section 2. Net exports correspond
to A0 Lf (k0)− I0 − (q0K0 − b0A0L) at date 0 and At Lf (kt) − It thereafter.
    Let us use as a benchmark the low-valuation steady state, where the economy experiences
de-trended trade surpluses f (k1∗ )− x∗ k1∗ for the indefinite future. Now suppose that, starting
at the same level of capital, k1∗, the price of capital jumps to a speculative growth path.
Domestic residents sell the spread, (q0 − q∗)k1∗A0L0, to foreigners and consume the proceeds.
Thus the stock market rise fuels a domestic consumption boom financed by foreign capital
inflows. The new high-investment equilibrium is then financed fully by foreigners. If the
high-valuation equilibrium is dynamically inefficient, then net exports are asymptotically
negative, and the domestic economy becomes a resource sink for foreigners. The current
account remains negative throughout and, again, becomes an integral part of the speculative
growth episode.


5    Final Remarks

This paper builds a theoretical framework for thinking about episodes of speculative growth.
We characterize this phenomenon as a low effective cost-of-capital equilibrium based on
optimism about the future availability of funds for investment. Our framework highlights
the key short-term and long-term funding mechanisms necessary to sustain a speculative
growth equilibrium. The emergence of a new sector, fiscal surpluses, or current account
deficits not only are possible consequences of a high-investment equilibrium, but also are
central to generating the saving necessary to support it.
    Ours is not a framework of “irrational exuberance,” although it offers a natural inter-
pretation of such episodes. These occur when a speculative growth path is not backed by
a long-run funding mechanism strong enough to eventually validate the explosive capital
gains dynamics that are needed in the short run to reallocate resources toward the sectors
that drive the boom. A prototypical example of such a scenario is when a bubble attaches
to the “wrong” sector, as it may have been the case in Japan during the 1980s with its large
real estate boom.
    The U.S. experience during the 1990s probably had elements of both: A rational spec-
ulative growth component built on the information technology sector, sound fiscal policy,
and foreigners’ confidence, as well as some elements of irrationality during the late 1990s.

                                               29
From this perspective, it is not at all clear whether much of the U.S. asset markets boom
during the 1990s, even if bubbly, was comdemned to be reversed. In fact, there is a case
to be made for attempting to restart such process rather than letting the economy dwindle
toward the pre-1990s capital/output ratios. Our framework highlights the importance of
fostering long-run funding mechanisms and technology in achieving such goal.

    3. s(w, −1) = 0 for all w ∈ R+ .

    In the main text it was pointed out that under weak conditions rk (k, q) > 0 in all
relevant regions except at points with k = ko . We will simplify the analysis further here
with a condition that ensures that this holds everywhere but at points with k = ko .

Assumption 3           The production function f and the function s satisfy
                                                          

for all k ∈ R+ and r ∈ (−1, +∞).

Assumption 4       The adjustment cost function g                 :   R → R is twice continuously differen-
tiable and satisfies

    1. g(0) = 0,      limx↑∞        g (x) =   ∞,
    2. g (x) > 0 for all x ∈ R and g (0) = 1,

    3.   limx↑∞    g  (x) = 0,

                                                           31
  4. g (x) < 0 for all x ∈ R.

Assumption 5      The rate of technological progress is nonnegative, that is γ ≥ 0.

Proposition 1  Under assumptions 1—5, there exists a ∆r > 0 and a ko > 0 such that the
dynamic system (9)—(10) has precisely two steady states (k1∗, q∗ ) and (k2∗ , q∗), where k2∗ > k1∗.

Lemma 5      Under assumption 4 the investment choice problem of the young agents has a
unique solution x(q) for all q > q and no solution for q ≤ q, where q ∈ (0, 1) is the
unique solution of the equation g(−q) = −1. The function x : (q, ∞) → R is continuously
differentiable, strictly increasing and satisfies limx→∞ x(q) = ∞. If assumption 5 holds as
well, then there exists a unique q∗ such that g(x(q∗ )) = γ and we have q∗ ≥ 1.

   Proof:   As g(0) = 0, g (0) = 1 and g (x) < 0, we have g(x) ≤ x with strict inequality
for x = 0. In particular we have limx→−∞ g(x) = −∞. Then the equation g(−q) = −1 has
precisely one solution q, which must lie the interval (0, 1).
Now consider the problem of a young agent with savings s > 0 of choosing his investment
optimally, facing a price of capital of q > 0. His problem is


                     (x,k)∈R2
                       max      (1 +   g (x))k    s.t.   ( x + q )k     ≤s ∧ k≥   .
                                                                                  0



Clearly this problem has no solution if g(−q) > −1, that is if q < q. In this case the agent
could set x = −q. Then the first constraint is satisfied for all k ≥ 0 and the objective
(1 + g (−q ))k can be made arbitrarily large.

So consider the case g(−q) ≤ −1, that is q ≥ q. In this case the agent can achieve a
positive value of the objective by setting x = 0 and k = qs . As choosing x ≤ −q makes the
objective non-positive and setting k = 0 makes the objective zero, we only need to consider
x > −q ≥ −q and k > 0. Among these choices, it is clear that (x + q )k < s cannot be
optimal. So if
                                           1 + g (x)
                                                                                        (26)

has a unique maximizer x(q) in (−q, +∞), then x(q), x(qs)+q is the unique solution to the
maximization problem of the agent. The derivative of this function with respect to x is
                                                    −
                                       g  (x)(x + q ) (1 + g(x))
                                                                  .
                                                 (x + q )2


Consider the numerator

                                Dq (x) = g  (x)(x + q )     −   (1 +   g (x)).

                                                   32
We have
                                      −            −
                                  Dq ( q) = g  ( q )(q     −q .    )


and
                                 Dq (x) = g (x)(x + q ) < 0

for all x ∈ (−q, +∞). If q = q, then Dq (−q) = 0. In this case the agent would like to set x
arbitrarily close to −q, so the problem does not have a solution. However, if q > q, we have
Dq (−q ) > 0.
Moreover, as g is concave,
                                     Dq (x)   ≤ g x q −
                                                   ( )      1   ,

so
                                       lim
                                      x→∞
                                             Dq (x)    ≤− 1 .

Thus the equation Dq (x) = 0 has a unique solution x(q) which is the unique maximizer on
(−q, +∞) of the expression in equation (26).

So now we have constructed the function x : (q, +∞) → R, and it satisfies

                             g  (x(q ))(q + x(q )) = (1 + g(x(q )))                    (27)

for all q ∈ (q, +∞). By the implicit function theorem, the function x(q) is continuously
differentiable and we have

                              x (q ) = 
                                              −
                                             g  (x(q ))
                                                            > 0,
                                       g (x(q ))(x(q ) + q)
so x(q) is strictly increasing. Suppose limq→∞ x(q) = x̄ < ∞. As g (x̄) > 0, taking limits
of (27) as q → ∞ yields infinity for the left hand side but 1 + g(x̄) < ∞ for the right hand
side. Thus it must be the case that limq→∞ x(q) = ∞.
By substituting q = 1 into equation (27) we see that x(1) = 0.
Finally consider the equation
                                        g(x(q )) = γ.                                    (28)
We have
                                          g (x(1)) = 0,

and since limq→∞ x(q) = ∞ and limx→∞ g(x) = ∞ we have limq→∞ g(x(q)) = ∞. Thus if
γ ≥ 0 there is a unique q ∗ solving equation (28) and clearly q ∗ ≥ 1.         
Lemma 6     Let assumptions 1—5 be satisfied. Then for all q > q, the equation

                                  s̃(w(k), r) = (x(q ) + q )k                           (29)

                                                  33
has a unique solution r̃(k, q) for all k          ∈   (0, k̄(q)) where k̄(q ) >           0   is the unique solution to
the equation
                                               w(k) = (x(q ) + q )k.                                                   (30)
The function r̃(k, q) is continuously differentiable and satisfies                       limk↑k̄   (q) r̃(k, q) = ∞.
   Proof:     Let q > q and k > 0. We begin by analyzing equation (30). Consider the
function Eq : R+ → R where

                                       Eq (k) = w(k)        −    xq
                                                                ( ( )+   q)k.

Then limk↓0 Eq (0) = 0 and
                                       Eq (k) = w (k)      −   xq
                                                                 ( ( )+      q ).

The assumption that limk↓0 w (k) = +∞ ensures that Eq (k) is strictly positive for suffi-
ciently small k. As long as w (k) is strictly positive, it is strictly decreasing. Taking into
account the limits of w (k), this means that the equation Eq (k) = 0 has a unique solution
kmax which is the global maximizer of Eq . Then we have Eq (kmax ) > 0 and Eq (k) < 0 for
k > kmax . Moreover, limk↑∞ w (k) = 0 implies that Eq (k) eventually turns negative. Hence
there is a unique k̄(q) ∈ (0, +∞) such that Eq (k̄(q)) = 0. The function k̄ : (q, ∞) → R+ is
continuously differentiable by the implicit function theorem.
Now consider equation (29). The left hand side is increasing in r and satisfies s̃(w(k), −1) =
0 and limr →∞ s̃(w (k ), r ) = w (k ). So the equation has at most one solution r̃ (k, q ), and this

solution exists if and only if k < k̄(q). The function r̃(k, q) is continuously differentiable by
the implicit function theorem and

                                   s̃(w(k̄(q)), r̄) = (x(q ) + q)k̄(q ),

which contradicts the fact that for finite r̄ we have

The function m(k) is continuous and strictly increasing except for a downward jump at ko .
Hence the equation m(k) = 0 has at most two solutions. We will choose ko and ∆r so that
there are precisely two solutions. Consider the function

It is continuous on (0, +∞) and has m̃ (k) > 0 for all k ∈ (0, +∞), limk↓0 m(k) = −∞ and

For each ∆r ∈ there is a unique k2(∆r ) such that m̃∆r (k2 (∆r )) = 0. The function k2(∆r ) is
strictly increasing and lim∆r →∞ k2 (∆r ) = k̄(q∗). Choosing ∆r such that k2∗ = k2 (∆r ) > ko ,
we have m(k2∗) = 0.                                                                         

Definition 1       1. A speculative path {kt , qt}∞
                                                  t=0 is an equilibrium path with origin k0 < k
                                                                                                o


       that converges to the high valuation steady state (kH ∗ , q ∗ ).


    2. The price of capital at time t along a speculative path has a bubble component if there
       exists N such that n ≥ N implies f  (kt+n ) = 0.

    3. The price of capital at time t along a speculative path is a pure bubble if f  (kt+n ) = 0
       for all n ≥ 1.

Proposition 2     Under assumptions 1—6, there exists a ∆r > 0 and a ko > 0 such that
the dynamic system (9)—(10) has precisely two steady states (k1∗ , q∗) and (k2∗, q∗ ), where
k1∗ < ko < k2∗ and k2∗ > k̄. Along the low cost-of-capital equilibrium path, the price of capital
includes a bubble component and becomes a pure bubble for all k ≥ k̄.

    Proof:     The second part of assumption 6 implies k̄ < k̄(q∗) where k̄(q∗) is defined as
in lemma 5.
From proposition 1 we can choose ko and ∆r such that there are precisely two steady states
   ∗ ∗          ∗ ∗           ∗         ∗
(k1 , q ) and (k2 , q ) with k1 < k < k2 .
                                   o


Recall that in the proof of that proposition we constructed k2∗ by choosing ∆r such that
k2 (∆r ) > ko . But as lim∆r →∞ k2 (∆r ) = k̄(q ∗ ) and both k o < k̄ (q ∗ ) and k̄ < k̄(q ∗ ), we can
also choose ∆r such that k2(∆r ) > max(ko , k̄).
As a speculative path {kt, qt }∞                    ∗ ∗
                                t=0 converges to (k2 , q ) by definition, there exists N such that

t ≥ N implies that kt ≥ k̄ and thus f  (kt ) = 0. Hence qt has a bubble component for all
t ≥ 0. As kt+1 ≥ kt for all t ≥ 0 along a speculative path, kt ≥ k̄ implies that qt is a pure
bubble.                                                                                              

C     Proof of Proposition 3

Assumption 7       The production function f satisfies assumption 1 and in addition f  (k) < 0
for all k ∈ R+ .

Proposition 3   Under assumptions 3—5 and 7 there exist r+ > 0, ∆ro > 0 and zo > 0 such
that the dynamic system (9)—(10) has precisely two steady states (k1∗, q∗) and (k2∗ , q∗ ), where
k2∗ > k1∗ .

    Proof:     We begin by choosing r+ , ∆ro and zo > 0 such that there are precisely two
steady states with positive levels of z. Then we show that for these values of r+ , ∆ro and
z o > 0 there is no steady state with z = 0. We set ρ = 0 as this plays no qualitative role in
the proposition.
From lemma 5 the function x(q) is well defined and there is a unique q∗ such that g(x(q∗)) =
γ . Consider the function Eq∗ : R+ → R with

                                           1
                               Eq∗ (k) = w(k)

                                                       ( (



As discussed in the proof of lemma 6 this function has a unique global maximizer kmax such
that Eq∗ (kmax) > 0, Eq ∗ (k) > 0 for k < kmax and Eq ∗ (k) < 0 for k > kmax. So we can
choose z o such that
                                  0   < (1 + γ )z o < Eq∗ (kmax ),

and as limk→0 Eq∗ (k) = 0 and limk→∞ Eq∗ (k) = −∞ the equation Eq∗ (k) = (1 + γ )zo has
precisely two solutions 0 < kl (q∗) < ku (q∗ ). Also note that there is a unique k̄(q∗) such
that Eq∗ (k̄(q∗)) = 0.
Now if z > 0 then
                          
                              r+ ,    0 < k < k  l (q∗ ) or ku (q∗ ) < k < k̄(q∗),
             r(k, q ∗ ) =
                           r+ − ∆ro ,              kl (q∗) ≤ k ≤ ku (q∗ ),

where ∆ro is still to be determined. The capital stock in a steady state with z >        0   must
satisfy the equation m(k) = 0 where

                            m(k ) =
                                               −
                                       r(k, q∗ ) GK x(q ∗ )       − f k .                  (35)

The function m(k) is strictly increasing and continuous except for a downward jump at

kl (q∗ ) and an upward jump at ku (q ∗ ). Hence the equation m(k) = 0 has at most two
solutions. We will now choose r+ and ∆ro such that there will be precisely two solutions.

k2∗ > k1∗ . Then there exists α > 0 such that for any α ≥ α the high-valuation equilibrium
                                        m                                               m


disappears.
    Proof:  Let α ≥ 0 be given and suppose the high-valuation equilibrium exists for this
α. The two steady state capital stocks are given by

                                                            ro
                                                                GK x q ∗
                                   k2∗ = (f  )−1                        .
                                                        1+      ( )
                                                             GK x q ∗
Note that k2∗ does not depend on α as there are only two levels for the interest rate in this
economy.
Now the interest rate in the high-valuation steady state must be r+ − ∆ro . This requires
that the implied steady state value of z exceeds zo . This yields the condition
          1
          2 (1 − τ̄ )w(k2 ) + (τ̄ w(k2 ) − g2 ) − (1 + r2 )d2 − (x(q ) + q )k2 > (1 + γ)z
                        ∗            ∗      ∗           ∗ ∗         ∗     ∗ ∗                                             o
                                                                                                                                (36)

                                                              39
where g2∗ = ḡ + ατ̄ (w(k2∗)− w(k1∗)) is government spending and r2∗ = r+ −∆ro is the interest
rate in the high-valuation steady state. Using equation (23), we obtain

                                            = − τ̄ wγ(k−2 )r−∗ g2 .
                                                         ∗       ∗
                                      d∗2
                                                             2
Using the fact that ḡ = τ̄ w(k1∗ ), we have

                              ( ) − g2∗ = (1 − α)τ̄ (w(k2∗) − w(k1∗)).
                           τ̄ w k2∗

Then we can rewrite condition (36) as
      1 (1 − τ̄ )w(k∗) + 1 + γ (1 − α)τ̄ (w(k∗) − w(k∗)) − (x(q∗) + q∗)k∗ > (1 + γ )z .
                                                                                     o
      2             2 γ − r∗                 2       1                  2
                               2
By assumption this condition is satisfied for α = 0. But as the left hand side is linear in α
with a negative coefficient, there exists α > 0 such for all α ≥ α the condition is violated
                                               m                      m


and the high-valuation steady state does not exist.                                         
