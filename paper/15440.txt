                                              ABSTRACT

The standard view of U.S. technological history is that the locus of invention shifted during the early
twentieth century to large firms whose in-house research laboratories were superior sites for advancing
the complex technologies of the second industrial revolution. In recent years this view has been subject
to increasing criticism. At the same time, new research on equity markets during the early twentieth
century suggests that smaller, more entrepreneurial enterprises were finding it easier to gain financial
backing for technological discovery. We use data on the assignment (sale or transfer) of patents to
explore the extent to which, and how, inventive activity was reorganized during this period. We find
that two alternative modes of technological discovery developed in parallel during the early twentieth
century. The first, concentrated in the Middle Atlantic region, centered on large firms with in-house
R&D labs and superior access to the region’s rapidly growing equity markets. The other, located mainly
in the East North Central region, consisted of smaller, more entrepreneurial enterprises that drew primarily
on local sources of funds. Both modes seem to have made roughly equivalent contributions to technological
change through the 1920s. The subsequent dominance of large firms seems to have been propelled
by a differential access to capital during the Great Depression that was subsequently reinforced by
the regulatory and military procurement policies of the federal government.

      The Reorganization of Inventive Activity in the United States during the
                            Early Twentieth Century



       According to the standard view of U.S. technological history, inventive activity

was reorganized during the early twentieth century. Individuals had dominated the

process of technological discovery during the preceding century, an era that the great

historian Thomas Hughes has dubbed the golden age of the independent inventor

(Hughes 1989). As the economy shifted from the mechanical technologies of the first

industrial revolution to the science-based technologies of the second, however, the capital

requirements (both human and physical) for successful invention soared. Large firms

were better able to muster the resources needed to develop new technologies, and the in-

house research laboratories they built after the turn of the century enabled them, in the

words of Joseph Schumpeter (1942), so completely to routinize the process of innovation

that advances were realized “as a matter of course.” Although individual inventors never

completely disappeared, they came to play a secondary role in technological change, as

did the small entrepreneurial enterprises with which they were often associated.

       There is, however, another literature that has very different implications for our

understanding of trends in the location of innovative activity. This literature focuses on

capital markets and portrays the early twentieth century as a period when more and more

Americans were investing their savings in equities and, as a result, a broader range of

companies could raise capital from the general public (see, for example, O’Sullivan

2007). The implication of this scholarship is that improved access to finance made it

possible for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to continue to make important
                                                                                               3


contributions to technological discovery, even as the capital requirements for effective

invention rose.

       Until recently the technological history of the twentieth century has been written

as if this second literature did not exist—as if the only story was the shift toward large-

firm R&D. The tide is now turning, and there are a growing number of studies

questioning both the advantages of large firms’ in-house research laboratories and

whether the labs were ever really the dominant source of new technological discoveries.

Thus far, however, the evidence offered in support of this revisionist view has been

mainly anecdotal. The purpose of this article is to bring systematic evidence to bear on

these questions, using data on the assignment (that is, sale or transfer) of patents.

       In the next section of the paper we review the literature on the rise of large-firm

R&D, as well as recent studies that have led to a reassessment of the value of in-house

research labs. We then survey the literature on equity markets and discuss its

implications for understanding the reorganization of technological change during the

early twentieth century. After a brief section describing our data sources, we move on to

an investigation of whether the patterns in the assignment data are consistent with the

view that large firms increasingly dominated the process of technological discovery. We

find that large firms with industrial research labs obtained a rising share of patents during

this period but that so did small entrepreneurial enterprises. Indeed, these two alternative

modes of organizing technological discovery seem to have developed in parallel in

different regions of the country. Large firms accounted for the lion’s share of the

inventions in the Middle Atlantic, though our evidence raises doubts about whether their

ascendancy (at least during this period) owed much to their R&D labs. By contrast, in
                                                                                                        4


the East North Central region smaller, more entrepreneurial enterprises predominated.

To the extent that these latter firms benefited from the growth of financial markets, the

relevant institutions seem to have been regional exchanges that drew primarily on local

sources of capital. Although large firms would later come to dominate technological

discovery, the change seems to have been more a function of the Great Depression and

government policy than of the inherent superiority of in-house R&D.



The Literature on Large Firms’ Industrial Research Labs


        Until the last decade or two, most economists and business historians would have

agreed with Schumpeter (1942) that large firms had become the drivers of innovation in

the U.S. economy.1 The avidity with which large firms built industrial research

laboratories from the 1920s into the 1960s (see Mowery and Rosenberg 1989) certainly

indicates that their executives thought the labs were a superior way of organizing

technological discovery. Moreover, there seemed to be good theoretical reasons to

believe they were right. In the first place, the electro-chemical technologies of the second

industrial revolution were much more complex than the mechanical technologies of the

first. Not only did successful invention require much greater investments in both

physical and human capital, it required the kind of coordinated teamwork at which

industrial research labs excelled. Second, inventors are better able, as a general rule, to

solve production problems or create desirable new products if they have access to

knowledge gained in manufacturing and marketing. Because this kind of knowledge is

largely firm-specific, it is not easily acquired by outsiders, but it can readily be

1977; Hughes 1989; Lazonick 1991; Teece 1993; Cohen and Klepper 1996.
                                                                                                  5


transmitted to researchers in a firm’s own R&D facilities. Third, in-house R&D can

solve the information problems that make it difficult for independent inventors to find

buyers for their inventions and hence impede the commercialization of new technologies.

Before buyers will invest in an invention, they need to be able to estimate its value—to

assess, for example, the extent to which a new process will lower production costs, or

whether a novel product is likely to appeal to consumers. But sellers of inventions have

to worry that buyers will steal their ideas, so they may not be willing to reveal enough

information about their discoveries to effectuate a sale. These problems can be avoided

by moving the process of technological discovery in-house.2

        Of course, there were always dissenters who argued that the value of in-house

R&D for large firms was less a matter of efficiency than of market dominance through

the control of important technologies (see, for example, Reich 1977, 1980, and 1985).

There was also a large literature that questioned the relationship between firm size and

innovation and suggested that most big businesses were considerably larger than the

threshold at which size mattered (see, for examples, Scherer 1965 and Cohen, Levin, and

Mowery 1987). However, it was not until the 1990s, when large firms began to cut back

their R&D expenditures and even shut down their labs, that scholars began seriously to

question the idea that in-house R&D was a superior way of organizing technological

discovery (Rosenbloom and Spencer 1996). As some then pointed out, there were

important information and contracting problems associated with the movement of R&D

in-house that were different from those that afflicted the market exchange of

technological ideas but potentially just as troublesome. In order to learn about and gain

control of new technologies developed in their facilities, for example, firms had to invest

in monitoring their employees’ activities and to create incentives that aligned employees’

interests with those of the firms. It was not easy, however, to design a reward structure

that induced employees to work hard at generating new technological ideas without

discouraging cooperation and the sharing of information within the firm (Lamoreaux and

Sokoloff 1999). The problems of managing research employees were greatly magnified,

moreover, when firms started hiring university trained scientists who wanted to raise their

status in the academic community by publishing discoveries their employers would prefer

to keep proprietary, and who were more interested in working on scientifically interesting

problems than in improving their firm’s bottom line (Leslie 1980, Wise 1985; Smith and

Hounshell 1985, Hounshell and Smith 1988). In addition, the informational advantages

of locating R&D inside the firm turned out not to be as great as expected because

research labs were often sited at a remove from the company’s other facilities. It required

considerable and continuous managerial effort to keep communication flowing across the

different units of the firm (Hounshell and Smith 1988, Usselman 2007; Lipartito 2009).

       At the same time as scholars were highlighting the problems faced by industrial

research laboratories, they were also showing that the difficulties associated with

transacting for technology in the marketplace were not as great as hitherto believed.

Although patent rights are never perfectly enforced, they provide enough protection to

enable inventors to engage in market exchange. Moreover, the information problems that

afflict this kind of trade can be solved in a number of ways. Firms seeking to purchase

outside technologies can invest in facilities for assessing them and can work to cultivate a

reputation for safeguarding inventors’ interests; intermediaries who possess the trust of
                                                                                               7


parties on both sides of the market can take charge of facilitating exchange; and talented

inventors can establish track records that give buyers confidence in the worth of their

discoveries (Gans and Sterns 2003; Lamoreaux and Sokoloff 1999 and 2007). Naomi

Lamoreaux and Kenneth Sokoloff (1996, 2001, and 2003) demonstrated that a vibrant

trade in patented inventions developed during the second half of the nineteenth century,

intermediated by patent agents and lawyers, that enabled talented independent inventors

to specialize in technological discovery. Steven Usselman (2002) and Stephen Adams

and Orville Butler (1999) provided examples of firms that built reputations that

encouraged inventors to bring them their ideas. Ashish Arora, Andrea Fosfuri, and

Alfonso Gambardella (2001) documented the revival of trade in patented technology in

high tech industries in the late twentieth century. Moreover, scholars have uncovered

considerable evidence that large firms continued to purchase inventions from outsiders

even after they created industrial research laboratories. Indeed, David Mowery (1995)

has shown that the original function of most in-house R&D facilities was to keep abreast

of (and vet for purchase) externally generated technology (see also Lamoreaux and

Sokoloff 1999 and 2007). Tom Nicholas (2009) has used geo-coded data on the location

of inventors and research labs to show that a significant fraction of the most valuable

patents acquired by large firms during the 1920s were most likely not generated in the

firms’ research laboratories. Eric Hintz (2007) has provided case-study evidence showing

that, even in the heyday of the industrial research lab in the 1950s, large firms transacted

for important technologies with outside inventors who insisted on maintaining their

independence.

The New History of Equity Markets


       If the 1920s was the decade when large firms first began to build industrial

research laboratories in significant numbers, it was also the decade when securities

markets began to channel funds to firms on the technological cutting edge. To the extent

that the recipients of these funds were the very same enterprises that were building in-

house R&D facilities, the history of the growth of equity markets would simply reinforce

the standard view that large firms were the main drivers of innovation in the twentieth

century. But recent research has shown that small entrepreneurial enterprises also

obtained access to equity markets during this period, a development that is not consistent

with the dominant narrative of American technological history.

       During the nineteenth century trading on the markets was pretty much limited to

the securities of banks, railroads (bonds, not equities), other transportation companies,

and utilities (Navin and Sears 1955; Cull, et al. 2006). The number of industrials whose

securities were listed on the New York Stock Exchange could be counted on one’s

fingers, and the number whose unlisted securities traded in New York was also very low

(Baskin and Miranti 1997). Industrials had a greater presence on regional exchanges

such as Boston’s, but even there their shares traded only infrequently (Martin 1898). The

general view among scholars is that problems of asymmetric information limited the

public’s appetite for equities. Markets were unregulated, firms reported little information

about their affairs, and insiders manipulated both the flow of information and corporate

decisions to their advantage (De Long 1991, Baskin and Miranti 1997, White 2003).

Even the savvy could get taken, as Commodore Vanderbilt found when officers of the
                                                                                              9


Erie Railroad responded to his attempt to buy control by cranking up the printing press

and turning out more and more new shares of Erie stock (Adams 1869).

       By the turn of the century, however, private parties with an interest in expanding

the reach of the securities markets were taking steps to increase the confidence of

investors. For example, the New York Stock Exchange instituted a rule change in 1896

requiring firms listed on the exchange to publish audited balance sheets. A few firms had

already begun to provide this kind of information on their own, but the new rule helped to

make the exchange an imprimatur of quality, increasing trading, the value of listed

shares, and not coincidentally, the price of a seat on the exchange (Neal and Davis 2007).

At the same time, investment bankers such as J. P. Morgan exploited the reputations for

probity they had built up over the years to expand the market for specific securities.

Morgan had worked out a technique for building investors’ confidence when he

reorganized bankrupt railroads during the 1890s, putting his own people on the boards of

directors to reassure stockholders that the business would be run in their interests

(Carosso 1987). The railroads’ return to profitability enhanced his reputation, and

Morgan used the same method to promote the securities of the giant consolidations he

orchestrated at the turn of the century. Studies by J. Bradford De Long (1991) and

Miguel Simon (1998) suggest that stockholders responded by flocking to buy the

securities of “Morganized” firms and also profited handsomely from their purchases.

       This record of profitability whetted investors’ appetites for securities, but it was

not until the 1920s that the market really took off. Investment bankers had developed

new techniques during World War I to sell Liberty Bonds. With the return of “normalcy”

in the 1920s, they applied what they had learned to the sale of equities. Eager to enter
                                                                                            10


this business, commercial banks circumvented laws that prevented them from dealing in

stocks by setting up affiliates to sell securities to their customers. At the same time,

enterprising financiers brought large numbers of small investors into the market for the

first time by creating new investment vehicles that gave them access to diversified

portfolios. The most important of these, the investment trust, served much the same

purpose as mutual funds do today (Carosso 1970; White 1984 and 1990; De Long 1991;

O’Sullivan 2007). Sales were also fueled during this period by competition between the

NYSE and the New York Curb Exchange (which, like the NASDAQ more recently,

specialized in issues of newer firms in technologically dynamic industries), by the growth

of regional exchanges such as Cleveland’s (which promoted the securities of local

enterprises), and by the development of a national network of dealers that sold securities

“over the counter” (O’Sullivan 2007; Lamoreaux, Levenstein, and Sokoloff 2006 and

2007; Federer 2008).

       As investors lapped up what the bankers initially had to offer, firms began to issue

more and more new securities. Mary O’Sullivan (2007) has shown that the number and

size of new corporate stock issues soared in the early twentieth century, reaching levels

during the late 1920s that in real terms were not attained again until the 1980s. Even if

one leaves out the bubble years of 1928 and 1929, issues were higher as a proportion of

GDP during the 1910s and 1920s than in any other period of American history except the

recent dot-com boom. Moreover, the great bulk of the issues consisted of common stock,

with investors seeking to profit as much or more from a run-up in share prices as from

dividend payments.
                                                                                          11


       It might be thought that the primary beneficiaries of this growth in the securities

markets would be large, well-established firms for the simple reason that investors could

readily gather information about them (Calomiris 1995). Certainly, as Tom Nicholas

(2003, 2007, and 2008) has shown, during the 1920s investors particularly favored the

equities of large firms with R&D facilities and substantial portfolios of patents in cutting-

edge technologies (see also White 1990). But this appetite for technology stocks seems

to have spilled over to smaller firms as well. The most obvious evidence is the enormous

expansion in the number of firms about which the financial press reported information.

Whereas only a handful of industrials were even mentioned in the pages of the

Commercial and Financial Chronicle in the 1890s, during the late 1920s Moody’s

devoted more than three thousand pages of its annual securities manual to financial

information on individual industrial enterprises. O’Sullivan (2007) has shown that

investors were particularly attracted to new firms in “high-tech” industries such as radios

and aviation. The advent of commercial broadcasting stimulated a craze for radio stocks

during the early 1920s that led to so many initial public offerings (IPOs) that wags

estimated the number of new shares to be about equal to the number of radios sold.

Similarly, after Charles Lindbergh’s transatlantic flight captivated the public’s

imagination, soaring interest in aviation stocks elicited about 125 additional offerings of

securities, many of them from new entrants to the industry. O’Sullivan has calculated

that the medium age of the issuers was only 0.4 years! Most of the new securities

promoted during the 1920s were not listed on the NYSE, but were instead traded on

regional exchanges, on the curb market, over the counter, or through more informal

channels.
                                                                                                         12


         The implication of the literature on the growth of equity markets is that SMEs on

the technological cutting edge were increasingly able to tap into broader capital markets

to finance their inventive activities. This implication, however, is difficult to square with

the standard argument that industrial research laboratories had already begun to displace

entrepreneurial enterprises as a locus of technological discovery by the late 1920s. In the

rest of the paper we bring systematic evidence to bear on this problem. Our aim is to

determine whether there was a reorganization of technological discovery during the early

twentieth century in favor of large firms, or whether SMEs (and perhaps also independent

inventors) continued to play an important role in the generation and exploitation of new

technologies.



Data Sources


         We approach this problem through the analysis of patent data.3 The starting point

for our analysis is four random cross-sectional samples of patents that we drew from the

Annual Reports of the Commissioner of Patents for the years 1870-71, 1890-91, 1910-11,

and 1928-29.4 For each patent in the samples we recorded a brief description of the

invention, the name and location of the patentee(s), and the names and locations of any

3
  We recognize that some scholars would object that large firms often eschewed patenting in favor of
secrecy, taking advantage of the new legal protections for trade secrets that emerged in the early twentieth
century (Fisk 2001), but we see no reason to assume a priori that large firms were more likely to favor
secrecy than small firms. Indeed, economists working on late twentieth-century data have sometimes
found precisely the opposite. Using survey data, they have shown, for example, that small enterprises
worry that they will be not be able to protect their intellectual property against infringement by large
firms—that they will be for all practical purposes defenseless against giants with the resources to hire the
best legal talent (Lerner 1995; Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh 2002; Arora, Ceccagnoli, and Cohen 2007).
Some scholars might also object that large firms devoted a significant proportion of their R&D resources to
systematizing and elaborating new technologies in ways that often were not patentable (see Usselman 2002
on the railroads, for example). That may well have been the case, but our primary aim in this paper is to
understand whether large firms with R&D facilities were the dominant source of new technological
discoveries by the late 1920s.

  The 1870-71 sample amounts to about 6 percent of total patents; the other samples about 4 percent.

assignees who obtained rights to the invention before the patent was actually issued. We

then linked the patents to other information we collected on the assignees to whom the

patentees transferred their patent rights. For example, we looked up each company that

received a patent in the directories of industrial research laboratories compiled by the

National Research Council (NRC). We also collected information about companies

receiving patents from financial publications: the Commercial and Financial Chronicle

for the 1870-71 and 1890-91 cross-sections; Poor’s Manual of Industrials for 1910-11;

and Moody’s Manual of Investments for 1928-29. Finally, we looked up both individual

and company assignees wherever possible in city directories.

       The information we obtained from these financial publications and city directories

enabled us to classify a large number of the companies who obtained patents by size,

measured in terms of the firms’ total assets (or in a few cases where that information was

not available, total capitalization). We were also able to determine for a large number of

firms whether the inventor was an officer, director, or proprietor of the company to which

he (or in rare cases she) assigned the patent. Our basic strategy was to use this

information to look for changes over time in the relationship between patentees and their

assignees and in the types of companies obtaining assignments. Were inventors

increasingly less likely over time to be principals in the firms obtaining their patents?

Were they more likely to be employees? Was there a shift over time in the types of

firms obtaining assignments toward very large firms or toward firms with in-house

research laboratories?

The Organization of Inventive Activity before the Great Depression


         If there was a reorganization of inventive activity during the early twentieth

century in favor of large firms with their own R&D facilities, one would expect to find,

first of all, that inventors were assigning an increasing proportion of their patents to

companies by the time of issue (because employees typically had to transfer their patents

automatically to their firms),5 and second, that large firms with research labs would

account for a growing proportion of patent assignments. Certainly, the evidence bears

the first expectation out. As Table 1 shows, the fraction of patents assigned at issue

increased quite steeply over time, rising from 16.1 percent in the 1870-71 cross section to

56.1 percent in 1928-29, with 87.2 percent of assignments at issue in the latter sample

going to companies. The proportion of patents that went to large companies also

increased dramatically. For the 1928-29 cross section, the proportion assigned to

enterprises reported by Moody’s as having assets of at least $10 million was 20.5 percent,

and 16.1 percent went to companies in that category listed by the NRC as having

industrial research laboratories.6

         These last figures represented a significant increase over those for 1910-11, when

few large firms had labs and the proportion of patents that went to firms with more than

$10 million in assets was only 3.4 percent. The question, however, is whether the 1928-

29 numbers are large enough to make the case that such enterprises were coming to

5
  Contracts requiring employees to assign all patents to their employers became increasingly prevalent by
the 1920s. See Fisk (1998) and Lamoreaux and Sokoloff (1999).
6
  It is important to bear in mind that assignments to companies can come from outside inventors as well as
from employees, so our figures overestimate the proportion of patents generated by the firms concerned.
Our analysis includes only utility patents granted to residents of the United States. Adding patents awarded
to foreigners would not change the analysis because there were so few of them. Even in 1930, there were
only about 40 in the sample, and intriguingly, somewhat more of them were acquired by firms not reported
in Moody’s than by large firms. We also exclude from the analysis the small number of patents that were
assigned to foreign companies and the small number of patents that were reissued.
                                                                                                          15


dominate the process of technological discovery. Over the same period, the proportion of

patents assigned to companies not covered by publications like Moody’s also rose—from

13.5 to 22.1 percent. The latter number is slightly larger than the proportion of patents

that went to large firms in the same year, so it would seem that small firms were holding

their own as generators of patentable technology.

         There was also a dramatic increase between 1910-11 and 1928-29 (from 4 to 9

percent) in the share of patents acquired by firms where the patentee was an officer,

director, or proprietor or that bore the patentee’s surname (Table 2, Panel A).7 We

presume that these firms were formed to exploit a technology invented by the patentee

and so treat the existence of a patentee-principal as sign of the entrepreneurial character

of the company. Sometimes the patentee was clearly the moving force behind the

enterprise and held a position (such as president or secretary/treasurer) that indicated his

active involvement in running the business. Sometimes another person played the role of

entrepreneur, and the patentee received an ownership interest and a largely honorific title

(such as vice president) in order to ensure his continuing participation in developing and

improving the technology.

         As Table 2 indicates, there was relatively little overlap between the firms we are

defining as entrepreneurial and the large firms covered by Moody’s, particularly those

that NRC surveys indicated had industrial research labs. In 1928-29 only 4 percent of the

assignments to large firms with R&D labs involved patentee-principals, as opposed to 26

7
  Information on directors’ identities comes from city directories and from financial publications such as
Moody’s. Our figures understate the number of patents awarded to principals of firms because we are not
able to identify the officers and directors of small companies located in areas without city directories. Our
figures are also underestimates because we miss companies with inventor-principals in which the inventor
did not happen to receive a patent in 1928 or 1929. Some of the increase we observe may simply be a result
of the growth in the number of firms covered by national financial publications. It is doubtful, however,
whether this expansion in coverage explains much of the change because relatively few of the firms for
which financial reports are available actually had patentee principals.
                                                                                           16


percent of the assignments to firms in the “other” category. Moreover, from Table 3 we

can see that fully 66.3 percent of the assignments by patentee-principals went to “other”

companies and only 7.1 percent to large firms with R&D labs. The “other” category

consists of firms for which we were not able to find reports in Moody’s, which we

assume means that they were generally much smaller in size than those that for which

there were published financial reports. Yet another striking difference between the

entrepreneurial firms and the large-scale enterprises found in Moody’s is that they tended

to be located in different parts of the country. Whereas large firms were

disproportionately concentrated in the Middle Atlantic region, enterprises in which the

patentee was a principal were more likely to be found in the East North Central states

(Table 4 and Table 6). Hence in 1928-29, 53.5 percent of the patents acquired by large

firms went to assignees located in the Middle Atlantic and only 29.0 percent to those in

the East North Central region. By contrast, 43.9 percent of the patents assigned by

patentee-principals went to firms in the East North Central states and only 23.5 percent to

those in the Middle Atlantic.8

           The Middle Atlantic and the East North Central regions were the nation’s two

main technology centers by the late 1920s, each accounting for roughly one third of total

patents (Table 4). The two regions had comparable rates of patenting per capita (Figure

1) and similar overall rates of assignment (Table 5). In both, moreover, large firms

obtained a greater share of assignments in 1928-29 than they had in 1910-11.

Nonetheless, to the extent that there was a reorganization of inventive activity in favor of

large-firm R&D during this period, the change seems to have gone a lot further in the

Middle Atlantic region than in the East North Central. In the former 32.5 percent of all
8
    On this point, see also Lamoreaux and Sokoloff 2009.
                                                                                            17


patents went to large firms and only 19.5 percent to “other” companies in 1928-29; in the

latter the proportions were reversed, with 19.7 going to large firms and 27.5 to “other”

companies (Table 5). Moreover, the proportion of assignments that went to

entrepreneurial firms (that is, to firms where the patentee was a principal) was more than

twice as high in the East North Central as in the Middle Atlantic (Table 5). Rather than a

complete reorganization of technological discovery, therefore, the data suggest that two

alternative modes of organizing technological discovery coexisted during the early

twentieth century. Large firms may have dominated in the Middle Atlantic, but the East

North Central continued to spawn significant numbers of entrepreneurial startups.



Questions of Importance and Technological Sector


       Before one can conclude definitively that two alternative modes of technological

discovery coexisted during the early twentieth century, one must consider the possibility

that the patents assigned to entrepreneurial firms were on the whole less significant than

those acquired by large firms with R&D labs. After all, patent counts can be notoriously

misleading because they weigh equally inventions that are of fundamentally different

importance. One must also consider the possibility that entrepreneurial firms operated in

different technological sectors than large firms with R&D labs—that is, that the patents

they acquired were less “high tech.”

       The question of importance is difficult to resolve for the early twentieth century

because patents were not subject to renewal fees and it was not yet common practice for

inventors to cite prior art in their applications. We employ two alternative, but

unfortunately highly imperfect, measures to assess whether the patents assigned to large
                                                                                                       18


firms were generally more significant than those assigned to their entrepreneurial

counterparts. First, following Nicholas (2003), we use information on whether or not a

patent in our sample was cited much later on (by a patent granted between 1975 and

2002). Second, we collect information on the number of claims allowed in the patent

grant (Lerner 1994; Lanjouw and Schankerman 2004).

        As Table 2 (Panel B) shows, the first measure does not favor large firms with

industrial research laboratories. Only 25 percent of the patents assigned at issue in 1928-

29 to this type of firm were cited by a patent granted between 1975 and 2002, whereas

the proportion for firms not included in Moody’s was 32 percent.9 This result, however,

may not be all that surprising. We know that large firms like the American Telephone

and Telegraph Company (AT&T) patented virtually all the inventions devised by their

employees, whether important or not, for morale reasons and because even minor patents

could be useful for blocking rivals’ incursions in their markets (Lamoreaux and Sokoloff

1999; Reich 1977, 1980, and 1985). Even in absolute terms, however, large companies

with R&D laboratories accounted for a much smaller proportion of patents cited after

1975 than did firms in the “other” category: 12.2 versus 21.8 percent (see Table 3, panel

B). Intriguingly, patents that were not assigned at issue accounted for almost half (48.3)

of those cited after 1975 (Table 3) and had a higher probability of being referenced by

late-twentieth-century patents (36 percent) than those in any of the other assignment

categories (Table 2). The explanation may be that inventors sought to maintain control of

their most valuable discoveries in order to profit more from exploiting them. This

possibility fits with work by Lamoreaux, Margaret Levenstein, and Sokoloff (2006 and


9
  None of our results change when we use the number of later citations as a measure of importance rather
than simply whether or not the patent was ever cited.
                                                                                                         19


2007) showing that important inventors in the Cleveland region often had considerable

bargaining power vis-à-vis their financial backers and that they exercised that power by

licensing rather than assigning their patent rights to their companies.

         Regression analysis of the 1928-29 sample confirms the descriptive finding that

the patents acquired by large firms with R&D labs were no more likely to be cited by

late-twentieth-century patents than those acquired by “other” firms. To keep the focus on

the different types of enterprises, we restrict our attention to patents assigned at issue to

companies.10 The dependent variable is a dummy that takes a value of one if the

invention was cited by a patent awarded in 1975-2002. The independent variables

include dummies for the size category of firms in terms of total assets (the omitted

category is firms for which we have no financial information11), whether the NRC listed

the firm as having an industrial research lab, whether the inventor was a principal of the

firm, the region in which the assignee was located (the omitted category is the Middle

Atlantic), and whether the patent was in a high-tech industry for the time. We use two

alternative definitions of high-tech. The first (high-tech1) is based on our reading of the

text of the patent. It defines patents in the following industries as high-tech and all others

as not: electrical machinery and products, chemicals, petroleum, plastics and rubber,

automobiles, primary metals, mining machinery, and transportation equipment, as well as

the machinery used in production in these industries. The second (high-tech2) defines as

high-tech patents that were classified by Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2002) as falling in

technology subclasses 11-49 (based on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s

10
   The results in Table 7 do not change when we run the estimations on all patents, except that the
coefficients on the dummy for high-tech in the first two estimations become consistently negative and
weakly significant.
11
   This category includes firms for which Moody’s did not include information on assets or capital, as well
as firms that Moody’s did not cover.
                                                                                                       20


classification scheme): chemicals, computers and communication technology, drugs and

medical devices, and electrical and electronics. The estimations are probits, and the

reported figures are the marginal effects of changes in the independent variables.

        As the first four columns in Table 7 show, none of the coefficients is statistically

significant.12 Patents assigned to firms with more than $10 million in assets were no

more likely to be cited at the end of the century than those that went to firms not included

in Moody’s, and firms with R&D labs were no more likely to acquire patents that would

be cited later than those without. Indeed, the point estimates suggest that patents

acquired by large firms with R&D labs were somewhat less likely to be cited. We

obtained the same results when we included dummies for the individual technology

subclasses that make up high-tech2 (not shown). In other words, even within subclasses,

the patents of large firms with R&D labs were no more likely to be cited later on than

those of small firms.13 Nor were there any significant regional differences in the

frequency of citations. Patents assigned to firms in the Middle Atlantic were no more nor

less likely to be cited than those assigned to firms in the East North Central region.

Regardless of how we define high-tech, moreover, patents in the cutting-edge industries

of the time were no more likely to be cited than other patents, and most of the point

estimates have the wrong sign.

        This last result in particular raises the question of whether citations from a much

later period are a good measure of importance. It is at least possible that technology was

changing more rapidly in high-tech industries than in low-tech ones, making inventions

in the former obsolete more quickly and thus less likely to be relevant to patents granted

12
   Including interactions between the R&D and size variables does not change the result. We do not report
these estimations, however, because of serious problems of multicolinearity.

   We do not report these results because of small cell sizes.

in the late twentieth century. For example, Lee de Forest’s patents for amplifiers were

unquestionably important at the time, but because the devices used vacuum-tube

technology they were not cited after 1974.14 On the other hand, one could argue that

patents in old industries circa 1930 were even more likely to be irrelevant by the late

twentieth century and hence still less likely to be cited.

        Because of our doubts about the validly of late-twentieth-century citations as an

indication of a patent’s importance, we collected data for an alternative measure that has

been suggested in the literature—the number of claims allowed in each patent grant

(Lerner 1994; Lanjouw and Schankerman 2004). The estimations (here negative

binomial regressions) are reported in Table 7, columns 5 through 8. Large firms had

more claims per patent than those not covered in national financial publications, which by

this measure would seem to indicate that large firms’ patents were more important on

average than those obtained by small firms. Another interpretation, however, is that large

firms had superior access to legal expertise and thus were able to secure approval for

more claims during the examination process.15 Regardless, patents acquired by firms that

had R&D labs were not more important by this measure than those acquired by firms that

did not; the point estimates have the wrong sign and are weakly significant in the first

two specifications. Moreover, the negative coefficients on the high-tech dummies

(weakly significant for the second of our two classification schemes) raise doubts about

the validity of the number of claims as a measure of importance, just as they did for late-

twentieth-century citations.


14
   We searched in Google patents for de Forest’s patents that included the word “vacuum.” Unlike de
Forest’s other patents, none of these were cited in the late twentieth century.

   When we presented this paper at the NYU Law School, faculty and students in the audience were
skeptical that the number of claims reflected anything but the skill of the patent lawyer.
                                                                                           22


       As for the question of whether the patents acquired by large firms with industrial

research laboratories were more likely to be in high-tech industries than those acquired

by firms operating below the financial radar screen, the answer is yes. For the years

1928-29, fully 78 percent of the patents acquired by the former were in high-tech

industries according to our first definition and 46 percent according to our second (Table

2, Panels C and D). The figures for firms not found in Moody’s were only 52 percent and

21 percent respectively. As the probit regressions in Table 8 show, by our first definition

both large firms and firms with R&D labs were significantly more likely to acquire high-

tech patents than firms without financial reports in Moody’s. By our second measure,

however, only firms with R&D labs were significantly more specialized in cutting-edge

technology. The point estimates for entrepreneurial firms were negative, though not

significant, in all of the regressions. Finally, firms in the Middle Atlantic, where most of

large enterprises with industrial research labs were located, were generally more likely to

acquire high-tech patents than were firms in other regions, including the East North

Central, and the differences were particularly apparent for our second measure.

       Before one leaps to the conclusion that large firms with industrial research

laboratories were dominating inventive activity in the high-tech sectors of the economy

by the late 1920s, it is important to note that firms not included in Moody’s still

accounted for a substantial proportion of high-tech patents: 22.7 percent of the total for

high-tech1 and 19.3 percent for high-tech2, compared respectively to 24.8 and 30.7

percent for large firms with R&D labs (Table 3, Panels C and D). So did firms in the East

North Central: 32.0 percent for high-tech 1 and 27.3 percent for high-tech2, compared

respectively to 38.0 and 42.0 percent for the Middle Atlantic (Table 4, Panel B).
                                                                                                        23


Moreover, it is important to note that large firms were disproportionately high-tech as

early as 1910-11, when few of them had R&D labs. Indeed, in 1910-11 large firms

without R&D labs were much more likely to acquire high-tech patents than the firms that

pioneered in establishing in-house research facilities (Table 2, Panels C and D).

Furthermore, it is not at all clear how many of the patents acquired by large firms with

R&D facilities actually originated in the companies’ labs. For the 1928-29 cross section,

36.9 percent of the patents assigned to large firms with research labs came from patentees

who were located in a completely different state from any of their assignees’ labs.16 This

result is somewhat larger than that of Nicholas (2009), who also found that a significant

fraction of patents acquired by a sample of large firms came from inventors who resided

beyond commuting distance from the firms’ labs.17 It is also consistent with the

argument (Mowery 1995, Lamoreaux and Sokoloff 1999) that the reason that many firms

established R&D labs in the first place was to improve their ability to assess inventions

offered for sale by outside inventors. To give one example, at the end of World War I

Standard Oil of New Jersey founded its first research department on the principle that

“new ideas and inventions … would arise in the main from external sources, and that [the

department’s] primary job … would be to uncover these ideas, test them out, and carry




16
   Adding a variable for whether the patentee resided in the same state as one of the company’s labs does
not change the estimations in Tables 7 or 8. The variable was never significant, though intriguingly the
point estimates suggest that patents by inventors located in the same state as a lab were less likely to be
cited than those by inventors who resided in other states.
17
   Nicholas found that a quarter of the inventions assigned during the 1920s to 69 large firms operating 94
industrial research labs came from inventors who resided beyond commuting distance of the labs. Nicholas
also found that the patents obtained from distant inventors were substantially more important on average
(more likely to be cited by late twentieth century patents) than those acquired from inventors who lived
within commuting distance. In the case of the General Electric Company (GE), Nicholas was able to check
his list of inventors against employment records and found that about a fifth of the patents GE acquired
came from inventors who were not employees.
                                                                                                          24


them forward to some practical end”—not, as has been generally assumed, to foster

“primary research” (Gibb and Knowlton 1956).

         Finally, our data enable us to test one of the arguments that scholars have offered

for the superiority of research laboratories—that they facilitated the teamwork required

for effective innovation in the complex, science-based technologies of the second

industrial revolution. If we take the presence of multiple inventors on a patent to be an

indication of teamwork, we find that large firms, even those with industrial research

laboratories, had only slightly more of it. Fourteen percent of the patents acquired by

large firms with R&D facilities were granted to more than one inventor, as opposed to 10

percent of those acquired by firms not included in Moody’s (Table 2, panel E). That

difference, however, is not statistically significant, as the regressions in the last four

columns of Table 8 show.18

         To recap the results thus far, by the 1920s there seen to have been two main

regions of inventive activity in the U.S., each organized along different lines. In the

Middle Atlantic, large firms with in-house R&D facilities predominated, whereas the

East North Central was characterized by entrepreneurial startups. Assignments to large

firms with R&D facilities accounted for an increased proportion of patents by the late

1920s, but assignments to firms without access to national capital markets represented a

larger (and still growing) share of patents. Moreover, it is by no means clear that the

patents acquired by large firms with research labs were more important than those


18
  There may have been some bias against filing joint patents because they could pose special legal
difficulties. For example, in cases where establishing priority was critical, the date of the invention could
not precede the date when the inventors first started working together. Nonetheless, patents for inventions
that were the joint product of more than one inventor were invalid unless all the inventors were named in
the patent, and firms with R&D laboratories would have had to be very careful on this point. By the 1920s,
moreover, the courts were no longer penalizing inventors who inadvertently, without fraudulent intent,
mistakenly listed a joint inventor on a patent. See Robb 1922, 113-114; and Robinson 1890, I, 561-73.
                                                                                            25


acquired by firms in other categories. Large firms’ patents were, if anything, less likely

to be cited by late-twentieth-century patents than those of other firms, and though they

included more claims on average, that was not the case for patents assigned to firms with

R&D labs. Although large firms’ patents (and those in the Middle Atlantic) were more

likely to be in high-tech industries than those of small firms (and firms in the East North

Central), the latter maintained a significant presence in these industries, especially

according to our first, broader definition. Moreover, the direction of the relationship

between large firms’ investments in industrial research labs and the generation of high-

tech inventions is by no means certain. Large firms disproportionately acquired high-

tech patents in 1910-11, when only a few of them had research labs; many of the patents

acquired by large firms with R&D labs came from inventors located in a different state

from the companies’ labs; and there was no significant association between large-firm

R&D and collaborative invention. Rather than enabling large firms to dominate the

process of technological discovery, it may simply be, as Mowery and others have argued,

that in-house research labs helped them make better decisions about which of the

complicated second-industrial-revolution technologies being proffered on the market they

should buy.



The Role of Equity Markets


       For entrepreneurial firms to make important contributions to technological

discovery, especially in the complex science-based technologies of the second industrial

revolution, they needed to be able to raise capital. One clear advantage that large firms

with R&D labs had over their entrepreneurial counterparts was ready access to the
                                                                                             26


nation’s main financial markets. As Table 9, Panel B shows, the vast majority of patents

assigned to large firms (69.9 percent) and to firms with R&D labs (60.1 percent) went to

enterprises whose shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). By

contrast, the proportion of patents acquired by entrepreneurial firms that were listed on

the NYSE was comparatively miniscule (7.2 percent), and even if one adds to that firms

whose equities traded on the secondary or regional exchanges, the total was still only

19.5 percent. Nonetheless, it is still possible that the growth of equity markets during the

1920s facilitated the formation of entrepreneurial startups. The promise of being able to

go to the capital markets down the road may well have encouraged local financiers to

invest in firms formed to exploit new technological discoveries.

       If such a promise did help entrepreneurial startups obtain financing, the equity

markets that mattered most would have been the regional exchanges and secondary New

York markets like the Curb or the Produce Exchange—not the NYSE. Few

entrepreneurial firms would have been able to jump directly to the Big Board because the

requirements for listing were too stringent. Firms had to submit five years of financial

statements as well as documents detailing their assets and liabilities, and relatively few

passed the listing committee’s muster. In 1927 the committee accepted 116 of 300

applications, in 1928 16 out of 571, and in 1929 80 out of 759 (White 2009). As a

general rule, the only new firms that could meet the NYSE’s standards were

combinations formed by merger or firms with extensive financial backing that were born

large in order to operate efficiently in industries characterized by economies of scale.

Entrepreneurial startups would have had a much easier time listing on a regional

exchange or a secondary market in New York because these exchanges deliberately
                                                                                            27


adopted laxer standards in order to attract this kind of business (White 2009; Ripley

1927). Moreover, unlike the NYSE, listing was not a requirement for trading on these

other exchanges. Whether there was a market for a firm’s securities depended less on

such formalities than on whether investors had sufficient information to evaluate the

enterprise’s prospects. Reports in national financial publications like Moody’s helped,

but the kind of local knowledge that business people could accumulate about firms in

their immediate vicinities probably mattered more.

       It is difficult to get directly at the role that regional and secondary exchanges

played in encouraging entrepreneurial enterprises because the equities of most such firms

in our sample did not trade on any of the markets, at least not at the time we observe them

(Tables 9 and 10). Indeed, most were too small even to be noticed by a publication such

as Moody’s. We can, however, get a sense of the importance of the different exchanges

by focusing our attention on the smaller firms for which we do have financial reports. In

1928-29 enterprises with assets of less than $10 million look much more like companies

not covered by Moody’s than they do firms with more than $10 million in assets.

Whereas most of the assignments to firms in the larger asset category went to enterprises

with R&D labs, most of the assignments to these “small cap” firms went to companies

that did not show up in the NRC lists as having industrial research facilities (Table 1).

The proportion of their patents classified as high-tech was also more like that of

companies in the “other” category than large-cap firms: for high-tech1, 56 percent for

small-cap firms and 52 percent for other companies, compared to 74 percent for large-cap

firms; and for high-tech2, 25 and 21, compared to 40 percent (Table 2, Panels C and D,
                                                                                                        28


and Table 1).19 The small-cap firms also look very different from the larger firms in that

a much greater share of the patents they acquired came from inventors who were

principals in the enterprise. In 1928-29 inventor principals generated 28 percent of the

patents acquired by small-cap firms, compared to 26 percent for other companies and

only 6 percent for large-cap firms (Table 2, Panel A, and Table 1). Finally, small-cap

firms, like firms with inventor-principals more generally, were disproportionately located

in the East North Central region of the country, whereas large firms were concentrated in

the Middle Atlantic (Table 4).

        For each of the small-cap and large-cap firms covered by Moody’s, we collected

information on the markets where the firm’s equities traded (Table 10). Not surprisingly,

unlike the case for large-cap firms, very few of the patents assigned to small-cap firms

(only 6.1 percent) went to companies listed on the Big Board (Table 9, Panel B).

However, over half went to a firm whose equities traded on at least one other exchange—

18.9 percent to firms that traded on a regional exchange, 15.5 percent to firms that traded

on a secondary New York market, and 8.8 percent to firms that traded on both a regional

exchange and a secondary New York market. The rest went to firms for which Moody’s

did not provide listing information, and it is likely that the stock of these companies was

closely held or that it traded only privately. If we go further and break the data down

regionally, we see that the securities of small-cap firms in the East North Central states

were more likely to trade on regional equity markets, whereas those of small-cap firms in



19
  The comparisons in this paragraph of all small-cap and all large-cap firms can be calculated using the
counts in Table 1 as weights to add up the subcategories in Table 2. For the firms not included in Moody’s,
our figures on the proportion of inventors who were principals in the firms receiving their assignments are
probably underestimates because we obtained this information by looking up the firms in city directories
and thus were not able to check assignments to firms located in areas not covered by this source.
                                                                                              29


New England and the Middle Atlantic were more likely to trade on a secondary New

York market.20

           When we trace the listing histories of the firms in our sample in earlier financial

publications (Table 11), we find that that relatively few of them jumped from regional or

secondary markets to the Big Board. The large-cap firms whose equities traded on the

NYSE in 1929 were not just small-cap firms that grew big and shifted their listing. These

firms for the most part were born large (often as a result of mergers), and their listing

history seems to have begun on the NYSE. Similarly, most of the firms whose stock

traded on regional exchanges in 1929 were first listed there, and the same was true for

firms that traded on the secondary New York markets. The main exceptions were firms

whose equities traded both on the secondary New York markets and on regional

exchanges in 1929. A significant proportion of those firms started on a regional

exchange and only later gained access to New York capital through a secondary market.

Some firms, it seems, were able to market their equities on a local exchange and then, as

investors accumulated more information about the firm’s business, tap into broader

markets in other regions. But most firms’ access to capital markets remained local, with

small firms in the East North Central turning primarily to exchanges in that region and

those in the Middle Atlantic to secondary markets in New York.

           Although the evidence is by no means conclusive, the information on listing

locations is consistent with the idea that the growth of regional capital markets, especially

in the East North Central states, encouraged investment in entrepreneurial startups. The

most successful of these firms could anticipate being able to market their securities on

exchanges in their home cities and perhaps move from there to one of the secondary

     We do not show these further breakdowns to save space and because of small cell sizes.

markets in New York, and it may well be that this anticipation was enough to spur

business people in such areas to risk some of their assets in new enterprises. Certainly,

studies of Cleveland and Detroit by Lamoreaux, Levenstein, and Sokoloff (2006 and

2007) and Steven Klepper (2007) respectively point to the existence of local networks of

notables eager to supply venture capital to innovative startups.



The Reorganization of Inventive Activity


       We began this paper by discussing two literatures that have very different

implications for our understanding of how the process of technological discovery was

reorganized in the U.S. in the early twentieth century. On the one hand, the literature on

the rise of industrial research labs claims that invention was increasingly moving into

large firms’ R&D facilities. On the other, the literature on the growth of equity markets

suggests that broadened access to funding enabled entrepreneurial firms to raise the

capital they needed to play an ongoing role in technological discovery.

       Our analysis of the patent data indicates that there is some truth to both of these

perspectives. In the Middle Atlantic region of the country inventive activity was indeed

moving into large firms’ industrial research facilities. The East North Central, however,

was home to a dynamic economy of entrepreneurial startups, supported (there is good

reason to believe) by booming regional exchanges. Neither of these centers of inventive

activity seems to have had a particular edge over the other during the 1920s, as the two

regions accounted for roughly equivalent shares of total patents and had similar rates of

patenting per capita. It is true that large firms in the Middle Atlantic were somewhat

more specialized in the technologies associated with the second industrial revolution, but
                                                                                                         31


they had already developed this characteristic before they built most of their industrial

research labs. Moreover, the inventions acquired by large firms with R&D facilities were

no more likely than those of firms without labs to be the product of teamwork, as

measured by the presence of more than one name on the patent, and large firms still

acquired a significant proportion of their patents from inventors whose state of residence

indicates that they were unlikely to be employees of their assignees’ labs.

         Why then has the literature on the history of technology focused on the large

firms of the Middle Atlantic region and ignored the vibrant entrepreneurial economy

further west? The answer, we think, lies in the events of the Great Depression, which hit

small firms in the East North Central region much harder than large firms in the Middle

Atlantic.21 To measure the differential impact of the financial catastrophe on the two

regions, we looked up the companies covered by Moody’s in 1929 in the edition of the

manual published in 1935. We then estimated the probability that firms that obtained

patents in 1929 would suffer financial distress by 1935. In the first four columns of

Table 12, the dependent variable is a dummy that takes a value of one if the patent was

assigned to a firm for which Moody’s no longer published a report in 1935 or if the report

indicated that the firm was in bankruptcy or being reorganized.22 In the second four

columns, the dependent variable also includes firms whose access to capital markets

seems to have deteriorated over the period 1929 to 1935.23 All of the estimates are

probits, and the independent variables have the same definitions as in the previous tables.



21
   On this point, see also Lamoreaux and Levenstein 2008.
22
   Most of the firms for which there were no reports were listed explicitly as dropped. If small firms ran
into financial trouble, Moody’s was likely to stop publishing information about them, but the journal
usually continued to cover large firms in the same condition because the prospects of these enterprises were
of interest to significant numbers of readers.
23
   For the precise definition of this variable, see the notes to Table 12.
                                                                                                            32


         The differential impact of the depression is clear from the estimations. Although

entrepreneurial firms do not seem to have been more negatively affected by the crisis

than firms without patentee-principals, large firms were significantly less likely to suffer

financial distress than small firms.24 Moreover, firms with their own R&D facilities also

came through the depression comparatively well. As we have seen, both large firms and

firms with R&D facilities were disproportionately located in the Middle Atlantic region.

Yet even when we control for these characteristics, it is apparent that the depression hit

that region less severely than it did other parts of the country. Of particular interest, of

course, are the coefficients for the East North Central region. The point estimates are all

suggestive of financial distress. They are significant at the 5 percent level in the second

set of estimations and at the 10 percent level in the first.25

         The effect of the depression is also apparent in regional patenting rates ( Figure

1), which held up much better during the 1930s in the Middle Atlantic than in the East

North Central region.26 Given the low levels of demand during the Great Depression,

large firms did not find building new productive capacity an attractive strategy. As

Mowery and Nathan Rosenberg (1989) have shown, however, they greatly expanded

their investments in R&D.27 The number of new industrial research laboratories grew by

590 between 1929 and 1936, an increase that compares favorably with the 660 new labs

founded between 1919 and 1928. Moreover, employment in industrial research labs shot

up even more rapidly, multiplying nearly five times between 1927 and 1940 and raising

24
   This result, of course, is not at all surprising. On large firms’ high survival rates from the 1920s to the
1960s, see Edwards 1975. More generally, see also Averitt 1968.
25
   We do not report estimations that control for technology subclasses because of small cell sizes, but the
results are the same except that the coefficient on the East North Central dummy increases in significance.
26
   Patenting rates in any given year reflect applications made several years before. Hence the rise in
patenting rates in most regions during the early years of the depression was a consequence of inventions
generated mainly in the late 1920s.
27
   On this point, see also Bernstein 1987.
                                                                                           33


the number of research employees per 1000 wage earners in firms with R&D facilities

from 0.83 to 3.67. As a result of these investments, large firms in the Middle Atlantic

emerged from the depression with a stockpile of new technologies that enhanced their

competitive position, whereas the smaller firms that survived in the East North Central

had not been able to maintain the same level of patenting activity.

       During World War II government procurement policy favored large firms with

industrial research labs, further encouraging this trend (in all regions of the country), and

the number of research employees in industry again doubled (Blum 1976, Vatter 1985,

Mowery and Rosenberg 1989). When the economy revived in the war’s aftermath,

therefore, large firms in the East North Central looked a lot more like their counterparts

in the Middle Atlantic. Moreover, the regional exchanges that had fostered local

investment in entrepreneurial startups during the 1920s never recovered. The new

Securities and Exchange Commission imposed general listing requirements equivalent to

those on the NYSE on the regional and secondary exchanges, preventing those markets

from continuing to provide a trading venue for enterprises that could not meet the Big

Board’s stringent standards (White 2009).

       As a result of all these changes, little remained by the 1950s of the alternative

entrepreneurial economy that had flourished during the 1920s in the East North Central

part of the country. Its contributions to technological discovery have been largely erased

from our historical memory, and the scholarship of the late twentieth century has been

written as if innovative regions like Silicon Valley were something entirely new. Now

that financial crises are once again buffeting the economy, it is useful to revisit this

forgotten history. The differential impact of the Great Depression on the large-firm
                                                                                         34


economy of the Middle Atlantic and the entrepreneurial economy of the East North

Central is a stark reminder of the competitive advantages that large firms can reap under

such circumstances as a consequence of their superior access to capital. It is also a useful

warning about the dire consequences that macroeconomic shocks can have for innovative

regions.

Sources and Notes: The observations in Panels A and B are random samples of patents
taken from the Annual Reports of the Commissioner of Patents for the years 1870-71,
1890-91, 1910-11, and 1928-29. We report only utility patents awarded to residents of
the United States, excluding patents assigned to foreign companies and patents that were
reissued. “Not assigned” means that the patent was not sold or otherwise transferred by
the time it was issued. We break assignments at issue into categories according to the
identity of the assignee: first, whether the assignee was an individual or a company; and
second, if it was a company, whether it was the subject of a report in a financial
publication (the Commercial and Financial Chronicle for the 1870-71 and 1890-91 cross
sections; Poor’s Manual of Industrials for 1910-11; and Moody’s Manual for 1928-29).
We divided companies for which financial reports existed into two classes according to
the amount of assets on their balance sheets. If no information on assets was reported for
a firm, we used its total capitalization instead. If the firm was part of a larger company,
wherever possible we used the data for the parent on the grounds that that information
better reflected the financial resources available to the enterprise. Information on
whether a company had a research lab came from the surveys published in the Bulletin of
the National Research Council for 1921, 1927, and 1946. We considered the firm to have
a research lab if it was listed as having one in a survey conducted before the year of the
cross-sectional sample or if the 1946 survey, which included historical information, listed
a founding date for the lab that was before the year of the cross section. A few firms in
the category “other company” had industrial research labs, though to save space, we do
not provide the breakdown in this table. The observations in Panel C are the companies
                                                                                         47


to which the patents in the respective cross-sectional samples were assigned. In a few
cases more than one of the assignee companies are subsidiaries of the same larger
company.

Sources and Notes: For a description of the cross-sectional samples of patents and the
categories of assignees, see Table 1. We considered the patentee to be a principal if the
company obtaining the assignment bore the surname of the inventor or if information in a
financial publication or city directory revealed that the patentee was an officer, director,
or proprietor of the company. Data on citations from 1975-2002 come from Bronwyn H.
Hall, “2002 Updates to NBER Patent Data,” http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~bhhall/bhdata.html,
last updated 5 Sept 2006. See Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2002) for further information.
We classified patents in the 1910-11 and 1928-29 samples by technology in two different
ways. For high-tech1, we categorized a patent as high tech if, based on our reading of the
patent, it pertained to electrical machinery and products, chemicals, petroleum, plastics
and rubber, automobiles, primary metals, mining machinery, and transportation
equipment, as well as the machinery used in production in these industries. For high-
tech2, we defined as high-tech patents that were classified by Hall et al. (2002) as falling
in technology subclasses 11-49 (based on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s
classification scheme). These subclasses include patents in chemicals, computers and
communication technology, drugs and medical devices, and electrical and electronics.
We consider a patent to have been collaborative if it the number of patentees on the grant
was greater than one.

Notes and Sources: See Tables 1 and 2. We do not report the distribution for
collaborative patents because the number of patents that named more than one inventor
was so small. Patent claims are the number of individual claims for novel technological
contributions that the Patent Office approved in the text of the patent.

Notes and Sources: The table includes patents in the 1928-29 cross section that were assigned to companies. Information on the
markets where the securities of the assignee companies traded comes from Moody’s Manual of Investments for 1929. The category
“unknown” includes companies which were covered by Moody’s but for which the report did not include information on where the
equities traded. The stock of these companies was probably either closely held or traded privately. If the assignee was a subsidiary of
a larger company, wherever possible we reported the information for the parent company. The variable “patents assigned to firms
with inventor principals” includes firms that bore the patentees’ surnames, as well as firms for which we know the patentee was an
officer, director, or proprietor. All remaining firms are included in “patents assigned to firms without inventor principals.” For
definitions of the other variables, see Tables 1 and 2.

Notes and Sources: The absolute value of z statistics are in parentheses. The estimates
are probits, and the reported figures are the marginal effects. The observations are patents
in the 1928-29 cross section that were assigned to companies for which there were reports
in Moody’s for 1929. Because our observations are patents, the estimations are effectively
weighted by the number of patents each company was assigned. In the first four
columns, the dependent variable is a dummy which takes a value of one if Moody’s no
longer published a report on the firm obtaining the patent or if the report indicated that
the firm was in bankruptcy or being reorganized. Seventeen percent of patents were
assigned to firms classified as distressed by this definition. In the second four columns,
the dependent variable is a dummy that aims to capture deterioration in an assignee’s
access to financial markets using the following coding scheme: Firms that were listed on
the NYSE were coded 5; those listed on both a regional market and a secondary New
York market, 4; those listed on either a regional market or a secondary New York market
but not both, 3; those for which no listing information was given, 2; and those without
any report in Moody’s, 1. The dependent variable obtained a value of 1 if the firm
obtaining the patent had a numerical code that was lower in 1935 than in 1929 or if the
firm was in bankruptcy or reorganization, and a 0 in all other cases. Twenty-four percent
of patents were assigned to firms classified as distressed by this second definition. For
definitions of the independent variables, see Tables 1, 2, 4, and 8.
