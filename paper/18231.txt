                                              ABSTRACT

Extremely long odds accompany the chance that spurious-regression bias accounts for investor sentiment's
observed role in stock-return anomalies. We replace investor sentiment with a simulated persistent
series in regressions reported by Stambaugh, Yu and Yuan (2012), who find higher long-short anomaly
profits following high sentiment, due entirely to the short leg. Among 200 million simulated regressors,
we find none that support those conclusions as strongly as investor sentiment. The key is consistency
across anomalies. Obtaining just the predicted signs for the regression coefficients across the 11 anomalies
examined in the above study occurs only once for every 43 simulated regressors.

1.      Introduction

Caution is warranted when inferring that a highly autocorrelated variable has the ability
to predict asset returns. One reason is the possibility of a “spurious” regressor: If the
unobserved expected return on an asset is time-varying and persistent, another persistent
variable having no true relation with return can appear to predict return in a finite sample.
Ferson, Sarkissian, and Simin (2003) demonstrate how the potential for such regressors
complicates the task of assessing return predictors, and they explain how the underlying
mechanism relates to the spurious regression problem analyzed by Yule (1926) and Granger
and Newbold (1974). Ferson, Sarkissian, and Simin (2003) also explain how data mining
interacts with the problem of spurious regressors. When the potential for spurious regressors
exists (i.e., a persistent time-varying expected return), then the more series researchers search
through, the more likely they are to find a series that appears to predict returns but does so
only spuriously.

    The greater is the prior motivation for entertaining a series as a return predictor, the less
is the concern that its apparent predictive ability is spurious. For example, such a concern is
likely to be lower when the predictor is a risk measure or a valuation ratio, as opposed to, say,
sunspots.1 One quantity with strong prior motivation as a return predictor is market-wide
investor sentiment. At least as early as Keynes (1936), numerous authors have considered
the possibility that a significant presence of sentiment-driven investors can cause prices
to depart from fundamental values, thereby creating a component of future returns that
corrects such mispricing. Baker and Wurgler (2006) and Stambaugh, Yu and Yuan (2012),
among others, find that investor sentiment and/or consumer confidence exhibits an ability
to predict returns on various classes of stocks and investment strategies.2 These studies also
refine the prior motivation of investor sentiment as a predictor. For example, Baker and
Wurgler (2006) argue that sentiment should play a stronger role among stocks that are more
difficult to value. In support of that hypothesis, they find sentiment exhibits greater ability to
predict returns on small stocks, young stocks, high volatility stocks, unprofitable stocks, non-
dividend-paying stocks, extreme growth stocks, and distressed stocks. Stambaugh, Yu, and
   1
      A regressor with prior motivation also often violates the spurious-regressor setting in Ferson, Sarkissian,
and Simin (2003), wherein the regressor bears no relation to return. Instead, the innovation in the regressor
is often correlated with contemporaneous return, whether or not the regressor predicts future return. Such
a correlation is especially likely for a regressor that is a valuation ratio, such as dividend yield. The finite-
sample bias that arises in such a setting is analyzed by Stambaugh (1999).
    2
      Other studies that document the ability of sentiment measures to predict returns include Brown and
Cliff (2004, 2005), Lemmon and Portniaguina (2006), Baker and Wurgler (2007), Livnat and Petrovic (2008),
Yu (2009), Antoniou, Doukas, and Subrahmanyam (2010), Gao, Yu, and Yuan (2010), and Baker, Wurgler,
and Yuan (2012).


                                                       1
Yuan (2012) hypothesize that when market-wide sentiment is combined with Miller’s (1977)
argument about the effects of short-sale impediments, overpricing due to high sentiment is
more likely than underpricing due to low sentiment. Their results support that argument, in
that sentiment predicts profits on the short legs of a large set of anomaly-based long-short
strategies, whereas sentiment exhibits no ability to predict long-leg profits.

    Despite the prior motivations for the properties that investor sentiment exhibits empiri-
cally as a predictor, some might nevertheless be concerned that sentiment is simply a spurious
predictor. Indeed, such a concern is the focus of Novy-Marx (2012). This study assesses the
odds that investor sentiment’s observed ability as a predictor can be achieved by a spurious
regressor. We focus on the role of consistency across multiple return series and hypotheses.
To understand the value of consistency, suppose the true expected returns across a number
of portfolios possess some independent variation, but each expected return’s true correlation
with investor sentiment has the same sign. The greater the number of portfolios, the more
difficult it becomes to find a spurious regressor that will exhibit finite-sample predictive abil-
ity consistently across portfolios comparable to that of investor sentiment. Our setting for
exploring the role of consistency is that of Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2012). That study ex-
amines 11 different anomalies and finds consistent results across those anomalies in support
of three hypotheses: (i) a positive relation between current sentiment and future long-short
return spreads, (ii) a negative relation between current sentiment and future short-leg re-
turns, and (iii) no relation between current sentiment and future long-leg returns. We simply
ask how likely it is that such hypotheses are supported as strongly by a randomly generated
spurious regressor used in place of investor sentiment.

   Out of 200 million simulated regressors, we find none that jointly support the three
hypotheses in Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2012) as strongly as investor sentiment. The odds
are still quite long if one looks at just one of the three hypotheses. For example, comparably
strong and consistent support for the first hypothesis—a positive relation between sentiment
and the long-short return spread—occurs once in every 28,500 simulated regressors. For the
second hypothesis—a negative relation between sentiment and short-leg returns—comparable
support occurs once in every 105,000 regressors. If one sets aside any consideration of
strength (t-statistics) and simply looks at the signs of regression coefficients dictated by
the first two hypotheses, even then only one in every 43 simulated regressors achieves the
consistency exhibited with investor sentiment.

   The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the regression setting
and original empirical results, describes the process for generating spurious regressors, and


                                                2
presents the simulation results. Section 3 concludes.



2.    Empirical setting and simulation results

The empirical setting we analyze here focuses on the main set of regression results reported
by Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2012), hereafter SYY. That study estimates the regression,

                    Ri,t = a + bSt−1 + cMKTt + dSMBt + eHMLt + ut,                         (1)

where Ri,t is the excess return in month t on an anomaly strategy’s long leg, short leg, or
the difference, St−1 is the level of the investor-sentiment index of Baker and Wurgler (2006)
at the end of month t − 1, and MKTt , SMBt , and HMLt are the returns on month t on the
three stock-market factors defined by Fama and French (1993). SYY examine 11 anomalies
documented previously in the literature:

  1. Failure probability (Campbell,Hilscher, and Szilagyi, 2007)
  2. Distress (Ohlson, 1980)
  3. Net stock issues (Ritter, 1991, and Loughran and Ritter, 1995)
  4. Composite equity issues (Daniel and Titman, 2006)
  5. Total accruals (Sloan, 1996)
  6. Net operating assets (Hirshleifer, Hou, Teoh, and Zhang, 2004)
  7. Momentum (Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993)
  8. Gross profitability (Novy-Marx, 2010)
  9. Asset growth (Cooper, Gulen, and Schill, 2008)
 10. Return on assets (Fama and French, 2006, Chen, Novy-Marx, and Zhang, 2010, Wang
     and Yu, 2010)
 11. Investment-to-assets (Titman, Wei, and Xie, 2004, and Xing, 2008)

As in SYY, the sample period is from August 1965 through January 2008 for all but anomaly
(1), whose data begin in December 1974, and anomalies (2) and (10), whose data begin in
January 1972. For each anomaly, SYY examine the long-short strategy using deciles 1 and
10 of a sort based on the anomaly variable, with the long leg being the decile with the highest
average return. SYY also examine a combination strategy that takes equal positions across
the long-short strategies constructed in any given month.

    The coefficient of interest in equation (1) is b. SYY (cf. table 5) report results of
estimating b for each of the 11 anomalies, as well as the combination strategy, in three

                                              3
sets of regressions that relate to the three hypotheses explored in that study. For the first
hypothesis, Ri,t is the long-short return difference, and the estimate b̂ has the predicted
positive sign for all 11 anomalies. The t-statistic for b̂, based on the heteroskedasticity-
consistent standard error of White (1980), ranges from 0.22 to 3.38 across the individual
anomalies and equals 2.98 for the combination strategy. For the second hypothesis, Ri,t
is the short-leg return, and b̂ has the predicted negative sign for all 11 anomalies. The
t-statistic ranges from −1.11 to −3.58 across the individual anomalies and equals −3.01
for the combination strategy. The third hypothesis, in which Ri,t is the long-leg return,
predicts b should be roughly zero. In these regressions, the signs of b̂ are mixed across the
individual anomalies (7 positive, 4 negative), with t-statistics ranging from -2.07 to 1.44,
and the combination strategy has a t-statistic of 0.15. When viewed collectively across the
estimated 36 regressions (12 for each hypothesis), the SYY results appear to present fairly
strong support for all three hypotheses explored.

    In this study, we ask how likely it is that a spurious predictor would support the three SYY
hypotheses as strongly as investor sentiment. We randomly generate a predictor series xt, use
it to replace St , and then re-estimate equation (1) for the same 36 regressions summarized
above. That procedure is repeated 200 million times. Each predictor series xt is generated
as a first-order autoregressive process with normal innovations and autocorrelation equal
to 0.988, which equals the sample autocorrelation of St adjusted for the first-order bias
correction in Marriott and Pope (1954) and Kendall (1954).

    To judge whether xt supports a given hypothesis as strongly as St , we ask whether the
t-statistics for b̂, viewed jointly across anomalies, are as favorable to the hypothesis as those
produced using St . To determine this condition in the case of the first hypothesis, for which
Ri,t is the long-short return difference, define t̄Si as the i-th highest t-statistic for b̂ among
the 11 anomalies when St is used. Similarly define t̄xi as the i-th highest t-statistic for b̂
among the 11 anomalies when xt is used. Let tSC denote the t-statistic for the combination
strategy when St is used, and let txC denote the corresponding t-statistic when xt is used.
Then xt supports the first hypothesis (b > 0) as strongly as St if t̄xi ≥ t̄Si for i = 1, . . . , 11
and txC ≥ tSC .

    Only once in every 28,500 generated xt series, on average, is the first hypothesis supported
as strongly by xt as by St . This result is reported in the last row of the first column of Table
1. The other rows display the frequencies with which fewer of the above inequalities are
satisfied. For example, the first row of the same column reports that at least one of the 11
values of t̄xi exceeds the corresponding value of t̄Si once in each 22 generated xt series. The


                                                 4
sharp increase in values as one moves down the column illustrates the dramatic effect of
requiring consistency across multiple anomalies. Just finding an xt for which more than half
of the t̄xi values exceed the corresponding t̄Si values happens only once in every 833 xt series.
The next-to-last row reports that, for just the combination strategy, the t-statistic obtained
with xt exceeds that obtained with St once in every 67 series.

   The odds for a spurious regressor become even longer when considering the second hy-
pothesis, as we see from the second column of Table 1. That hypothesis is supported as
strongly by xt as it is by St only once in every 105,000 series. The inequality conditions
here are essentially just the reverse of those earlier, since Ri,t is now the short-leg return and
the prediction is instead that b < 0. Let tSi denote the i-th lowest t-statistic for b̂ when St
is used, and let txi denote the i-th lowest t-statistic when xt is used. Then xt supports the
second hypothesis as strongly as St if txi ≤ tSi for i = 1, . . . , 11 and txC ≤ tSC . As with the first
hypothesis, the effects of requiring consistency across the separate regressions are dramatic.
Even for just the single regression with the combination strategy, however, obtaining a neg-
ative t-statistic greater in magnitude than that obtained with St occurs only once in every
169 series.

    The third hypothesis is that b = 0. In order for that hypothesis to be supported at least
as strongly by a randomly generated xt as it is by St, we require xt−1 to be as consistently
weak as St−1 in its ability to predict Ri,t, now defined as the long-leg return. For this case,
let |t|Si denote the i-th smallest t-statistic in absolute value when St is used, and let |t|xi
denote the i-th smallest t-statistic in absolute value when xt is used. Then xt supports the
third hypothesis as strongly as St if |t|xi ≤ |t|Si for i = 1, . . . , 11 and |txC | ≤ |tSC |.

    While the odds for a spurious regressor improve when considering just the third hy-
pothesis, they are still rather long. Again we see the effect of consistency when requiring
the absence of an apparent relation with the regressor. Only once in every 919 randomly
generated xt series do we find one that is as consistently unsuccessful in predicting long-leg
returns.

    Of course, the story does not end with simply considering each of the three hypotheses
in isolation. As SYY explain, these hypotheses arise as a set of joint implications, developed
by combining the presence of market-wide swings in sentiment with the argument in Miller
(1977) that short-sale impediments allow overpricing to be more prevalent than underpricing.
The final two columns report the frequencies with which a spurious regressor xt supports
more than one hypothesis as strongly as St , where comparable support of each individual
hypothesis is judged as before. Only one spurious regressor out of 468,000 supports the first

                                                     5
two hypotheses as strongly as investor sentiment. When we look for a spurious regressor that
supports all three hypotheses as strongly as investor sentiment, we actually find none among
200 million simulated series. When confining the exercise to just the single regressions using
the combination strategy, we still find that only one spurious regressor out of every 6,580
simultaneously supports each of the three hypotheses as strongly as investor sentiment.

   Fairly unlikely is just the possibility that a spurious regressor would give b̂’s with the
predicted signs consistently across all anomalies. Table 2 reports the frequencies with which
a spurious regressor gives the predicted sign across anomalies for the long-short difference
(first hypothesis) and the short-leg return (second hypothesis). For the first hypothesis, one
in every 25 spurious regressors gives the predicted positive sign for all 11 anomalies. For the
second hypothesis, the frequency of getting the predicted negative sign for all 11 anomalies
is one in every 21. A spurious predictor that produces all 22 coefficients with the predicted
signs, as does investor sentiment, occurs only once in every 43 randomly generated regressors.

     Finally, our approach comparing the i-th strongest t-statistic using xt to the i-th strongest
using St is not the only way to demonstrate the importance of consistency across multiple
anomalies. One might instead, for example, focus on just the single anomaly out of the 11 for
which the t-statistic provides the weakest support for a hypothesis. For the first hypothesis,
which predicts b > 0 when Ri,t is the long-short return difference, the lowest t-statistic
produced by St among the 11 anomalies is equal to 0.22. Less than one xt series out of each
50 produces a minimimum t-statistic greater than 0.22. For the second hypothesis, which
predicts b < 0 when Ri,t is the short-leg return, the maximum t-statistic produced by St is
-1.11 (all other t-statistics are greater in negative magnitude). Less than one xt series out
of 2500 produces a maximum t-statistic lower than that value. Thus, comparing just the
weakest results across the individual anomalies also reveals that it is rather unlikely that a
spurious regressor can replace investor sentiment.



3.      Conclusions

It seems extremely unlikely that the observed role of investor sentiment in stock-return
anomalies can be filled by a spurious regressor. Out of 200 million simulated regressors, we
find none. These very long odds—seemingly no better than those attached to winning the
Powerball Jackpot with a single play—reflect the consistency with which investor sentiment




                                                 6
produces results across multiple anomalies for three hypotheses.3 Simultaneous support of
those hypotheses is important, by itself, in that the odds of a spurious regressor supporting
them as strongly as investor sentiment are only 1 in 6,580 even when all of the anomalies
are combined into a single long-short strategy. It is the consistency across the individual
anomalies, however, that raises the highest hurdle for a spurious regressor to clear in order
to play the role of investor sentiment.

   Number of Randomly Generated Predictors Required to Obtain One Predictor
             That Produces Results as Strong as Investor Sentiment

The table reports the reciprocal of the frequency with which a randomly generated predictor xt produces
results as strong as investor sentiment St when xt replaces St in the regression,

                           Ri,t   =    a + bSt−1 + cM KTt + dSM Bt + eHM Lt + ut ,

where Ri,t is the excess return in month t on an anomaly’s long leg, short leg, or the difference, St is the
level of the investor-sentiment index of Baker and Wurgler (2006), and M KTt , SM Bt and HM Lt are the
three stock-market factors defined in Fama and French (1993). The predictor xt is generated as a first-order
autoregression with autocorrelation equal to 0.988, the bias-corrected estimate of the autocorrelation of St .
Let t̄Si denote the i-th highest t-statistic for b̂ (the estimate of b) among the 11 anomalies when St is used,
and let t̄xi denote the i-th highest t-statistic when xt is used. Let tSi denote the i-th lowest t-statistic for b̂
when St is used, and let txi denote the i-th lowest t-statistic when xt is used. Let |t|Si denote the i-th smallest
t-statistic in absolute value when St is used, and let |t|xi denote the i-th smallest t-statistic in absolute value
when xt is used. The row for j anomalies reflects the frequency with which the following conditions are
satisfied:
        t̄xi ≥ t̄Si occurred at least j times among i = 1, . . . , 11, in the long-short column.
        txi ≤ tSi occurred at least j times among i = 1, . . . , 11, in the short-leg column.
        |t|xi ≤ |t|Si occurred at least j times among i = 1, . . . , 11, in the long-leg column.
The “combination” row reflects the frequencies with which a simulated predictor produces t-statistics sat-
isfying the above inequalities when Ri,t is an equally weighted combination of the 11 anomaly strategies.
The final row reflects the frequencies with which the above inequalities are satisfied for 11 anomalies as well
as the combination strategy. The last two columns reflect the frequencies with which the inequalities are
satisfied jointly across the previous columns.

                               Table 2
Number of Randomly Generated Predictors Required to Obtain One Predictor
                   That Enters with the Correct Sign

The table reports the reciprocal of the frequency with which a randomly generated predictor xt
produces an estimate of b with the predicted sign when xt replaces St in the regression,

                     Ri,t   = a + bSt−1 + cM KTt + dSM Bt + eHM Lt + ut ,

where Ri,t is the excess return in month t on an anomaly’s long leg, short leg, or the difference, St
is the level of the investor-sentiment index of Baker and Wurgler (2006), and M KTt , SM Bt and
HM Lt are the three stock-market factors defined in Fama and French (1993). The predictor xt
is generated as a first-order autoregression with autocorrelation equal to 0.988, the bias-corrected
estimate of the autocorrelation of St .
The row for j anomalies reflects the frequency with which a simulated predictor produces an estimate
of b for at least j anomalies with the predicted sign (positive in the long-short column and negative
in the short-leg column). The “combination” row reflects the frequencies with which a simulated
predictors produces an estimate of b with the predicted sign when Ri,t is an equally weighted
combination of the 11 anomaly strategies. The last column reflects the frequencies with which the
predicted signs are obtained jointly across the previous columns.
