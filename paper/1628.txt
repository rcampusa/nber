          Estimating Neonatal Mortality Rates from the
       Heights of Children: The Case of American Slaves



                           ABSTRACT



     Underenumeration of vital events is a problem familiar to

people who work with historical demographic records. This paper

proposes a method for recovering information about neonatal mortality.

The approach utilizes average heights of young children to predict the

birth weight of American slaves. The results suggest that slave newborns

weighed on average about 5.1 pounds, which places them among the poorest

populations of developing countries in the mid-twentieth century. The

birth weight distribution and a schedule of mortality by birth weight

suggest that previous estimates of slave infant mortality are too low.

The poor health and stature of children and the relatively large size

of slave adults is a pattern of growth and development that is unobserved

among poor populations of the twentieth century. Thus   slavery   may have

created an unusual pattern of nutritional resource allocation across ages.

                                  I NTRODUCT ION



      The levels and trends in slave mortality have long been part of the

debate over slavery. As early as the abolitionist period it was recognized

that mortality measures are valuable indicators of the quality of life, and

subsequent research established a high correlation between measures such as

the infant mortality rate and economic development (United Nations, 1973, 132-

142). Although charges and counter-charges about the health and mortality of

slaves were part of the campaign against slavery and the defense of slavery,

systematic efforts at resolution of controversies raised during the debate

have occurred only in the past few decades.

      Studies of mortality in the U.S. during the nineteenth century have gone

forward using various sources and methods. Death registration began in some

localities as early as the 1840s and by 1900 ten states, 134 cities outside

these states, and the District of Columbia had established procedures for

continuously recording deaths (Thompson and Whelpton, 1933, 228—230: Taeuber

and   Taeuber, 1958, 269—272). Beginning in 1850 the census included questions
on deaths that had occurred during the twelve months preceding the census
(Wright,   1900, 98). Genealogies that recorded deaths are an additional source

of direct information (Fogel etal., 1978, 79). Census survival techniques,

model life tables, and stable population analysis have been used to infer

mortality levels and trends (see, for example, Haines, 1979; Farley, 1965;

Eblen, 1974; McClelland and Zeckhauser, 1983).

      The sources and methods commonly used for questions involving the

nineteenth century do not apply or may be unsatisfactory for study of infant,

and especially neonatal mortality, among slaves. Death registration, for

example, began in southern states after emancipation and underenumeration
                                       2




plagues the retrospective inquiries made by the census. Indirect techniques
have been applied to the slave population (Farley, 1965; Eblen, 1974;

McClelland and Zeckhauser, 1983), but the results depend heavily on measured

patterns of mortality in other populations and the methods cannot identify age

patterns of mortality within the first year of life.

       Direct information on slave mortality is available from birth and death

lists maintained by slaveowners (Postell, 1951; Steckel, 197gb). The number

of lists available is small and the data must be interpreted carefully,

however. An extensive search of southern archives turned up less than a dozen

lists that systematically recorded births and deaths, and that lacked overt

instances of underreporting of the date and incidence of death (such as "X"

notations). Low values on some lists for the share of infant deaths that

occurred within one month after birth suggest that some births and deaths were

omitted. Although the record of early mortality on a few lists may be reason-

ably   complete, and these records furnish insights into early mortality
(Steckel, 1985a), data limitations substantially constrain our knowledge in
the area.
       The high rates of loss that ordinarily occur during the first year of
life justify the emphasis given to this aspect of mortality (United Nations,
1973, 121—122).    Deaths occurring soon after birth frequently arise from
genetic defects, from deprivation during gestation,    or from trauma during

birth,   whereas diseases originating from inadequate sanitation, care, and
feeding   predominate as causes of death in later infancy. The contrast in

causes   of death has given rise to a classification of causes and to separate
measures of mortality. 'Endogeneous' factors produce neonatal mortality,
which refers to deaths occurring within 28 days after birth, and "exogeneous"
                                          3



factors cause post-neonatal mortality, which refers to deaths occurring during

the remainder of the first year.' Thus neonatal mortality rates are a measure

of the health, nutrition, and work required of pregnant women, of the quality

of    obstetrical practices, and of the quality of care given to newborns.
        This paper estimates neonatal   mortality rates among U.S.   slaves by uti—
lizing   data on heights in early childhood. Average heights are a sensitive

indicator   of past health and nutrition (Eveleth and Tanner, 1976: Tanner,
1978), and this measure has been applied      recently to a variety of questions in

economic   history (see, for example, Trussell and Steckel, 1978; Steckel,
1979a; Sandberg and Steckel, 1980; Fogel etal., 1983).2 The estimating pro-
cedure uses the average height of young slaves relative to modern height

standards as a predictor of birth weight. Newborn weight is the major deter-

minant of neonatal mortality. Inevitably this procedure requires assumptions

about information that is lacking, and this difficulty is met with sensitivity

analysis and a range of plausible results. The findings suggest that slave

birth weights were on average about 5.1 pounds, which makes them comparable to

those   in the poorest populations of developing countries of the mid—twentieth
century. The birth weight distribution and a schedule of mortality by birth
weight suggests that previous estimates of slave mortality up to the end of
the   first year are too low.



                         SLAVE HEIGHTS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD


       In 1807 Congress passed legislation that would prevent smuggling of

slaves from Africa but permit the interregional transportation of American

slaves through the coastal and waterways trade (Wesley, 1942). The law

required ship captains involved in the coastwise trade to prepare duplicate
                                    4



manifests that described each slave by name, age, sex, color, and height. The
National Archives houses a large number of these manifests under Record Group
36. A collection of 10,562 manifests involving 50,606 slaves comprises the
data base for this paper.3
     Table 1 sets forth the average heights and the corresponding centile of

modern heights achieved by young slave children. The heights at ages 1 and 2

are probably biased downward and should be viewed skeptically. The difficulty

with the measurements at these ages is that many children aged 1 and some aged

2 could not walk or could not stand very long, and the measurements were

probably taken with the children lying down. In this position young children

retract or draw up their legs and unless special care is taken the resulting

lengths are inaccurate. Modern technique takes this into account, and thus

the young slave children appear to be very small by modern standards.   In the

absence of specific information about actual techniques of measurement used by

ship captains, it is difficult to estimate the extent of the bias.

     Although the manifests may contain biases as a measure of the health of

the entire population of U.S. slaves and there may be distortions in the

measurements (such as age and height heaping), as a first approximation it

appears to be safe to take the data at ages 3 and above at face value. At

ages 3 to 6 slave children on average were 4.5 to 5.8 inches below modern

height standards. With the exception of females at age 5 the typical slave

fell below the first centile of modern standards. There was a modest trend of

improvement between ages 3 and 6; males climbed from centile 0.2 to centile

0.5 and females increased from 0.1 and 0.4.

     Why were slave children so small? The origins of poor health can be

traced to conditions during the fetal period (Steckel, 1985a). The slave work
                                          5



routine   was arduous overall and characterized by seasonal peaks in work effort

required of women during planting (March), hoeing (May—June), and especially

harvesting (late August-mid December). Modern studies establish the detrimen-

tal effect of work, particularly effort that requires standing, by mothers on

birth weight (Tafari, etal., 1980; Hytten and Leitch, 1971, 452—454; Naeye

and Peters, 1982; Ashworth, 1980, 20; Briend, 1979, 1980; Hytten, 1981). The

diet was probably poorest from late winter through early summer and infections

such as malaria and gastrointestinal disorders may have contributed to fetal

stress during the summer. The    health       of a child at birth is sensitive to con-

ditions   during the first and last trimesters. First trimester deprivation
leads to stillbirths and birth deformaties, and low birth weight follows
stress    during the last trimester. Through luck in the timing of conception

some newborns may have escaped the seasonal traps of diet, disease, and work

routine and therefore had a good start on life. Substantial numbers were less

fortunate, and if born alive, struggled through childhood. Food supplements

such as pap, panada, and gruel were ordinarily part of the diet by age 4 to 6

months. Supplementation may have begun within a few weeks after birth for

those born during periods of intense work requirements. The poor nutritional

content of the supplements and the unsanitary conditions surrounding food pre-

paration and feeding contributed to disease, poor health, and slow growth.

     Alcohol and tobacco consumed by pregnant mothers may have been a factor

in low birth weight. Tobacco was grown widely within the South and owners

apparently had few if any objections to its use. Some owners forbade liquor

on moral grounds and most probably feared its potential for disrupting the

labor force; but exceptions were often made at Christmas and other occasions

to celebrate the harvest. At other times of the year slaves may have been
                                       6



able to purchase liquor using earnings from the sale of chickens, eggs, and

garden produce. Alcohol and tobacco were probably no more than a contributing

cause of small stature during childhood, however, because these substances

permanently stunt growth and slave adults attained roughly the 28th centile of

modern height standards (Steckel, 1985b). Most of the catch—up growth (climb

through the centiles of modern standards) occurred after slaves entered the

adult labor force at ages 10—12. Ceteris paribus, the additional work

requirements of the adult labor force would have retarded growth, but nutri-

tional improvements were sufficient to more than offset the additional claims

of physical exertion. Thus working adults were reasonably well-fed, and for

this reason it is doubtful that general malnutrition of slave mothers was more

than   a minor cause of the poor health of young slave children.


                             ESTIMATING BIRTH WEIGHT


       The process of growth in humans is self—stabilizing or 11target-seeking'
(Tanner, 1978, 154—160). Individuals follow a growth curve in a pattern anal-

ogous to a missile directed towards a target. Genetic structure in combina-

tion with conditions in utero determine the target or potential for growth.

This target can be expressed as a centile on modern height standards. Chil-

dren can be pushed off the path towards the target by illness or starvation,

but if conditions are satisfactory height returns to or approaches the target

stature for a particular age through catch—up growth. Although the correla-

tion between birth weight and stature at young ages is only .2 and .3 for

individuals, correlations obtained if      entire populations are treated as units
are much higher because individual differences tend to cancel. Therefore
                                       7



average stature in early childhood may be highly correlated with average birth

weight.

     Two conditions substantially limit the data available for estimating the

relationship between stature in early childhood and birth weight. One is that

studies of child growth tend to specialize on infancy or on growth after the

first year. Consequently, there are few data available that combine birth

weight and stature in early childhood. Second, the average slave child

experienced considerable environmental deprivation, and ideally the data for

estimating the relationship should be drawn from many examples encompassing

the probable range of experience faced by slaves. Developing countries fur-

nish a source of this information, but unfortunately the number of studies

having the relevant data is small.

     The most comprehensive source of information on growth and development

under various conditions is Eveleth and Tanner, Worldwide Variation in Human

Growth. Table 2 presents the data from this source on height at ages 3 and 4

and birth weight among poor populations.5 For convenience in estimation (dis-

cussed below), the results are expressed relative to modern standards, which

were obtained from Tanner, Whitehouse, and Takaishi (1966). The table shows

that the range of experience in the environments for growth is wide. The Lumi

of New Guinea are among the very poorest populations in the world for which

systematic information is available.   In this group birth weights attained

68.6 percent and average heights at age 3 and 4 attained 87.4 percent of

modern standards. Casual comparison among other rows in the table reveals a

pattern established in other studies; namely, that weight is more sensitive to

changes or differences in environmental conditions than is height.

     The contention that children tend to follow a target path of growth

suggests that relative nutritional status can be expressed (see Cole, 1979) as
                                               8


                  Height-for—age =           Actual height         ,         (1)
                                     Expected (or standard) height

and in the case of weight as

                  Weight—for—age =           Actual weight                   (2)
                                     Expected (or standard) weight


        The objective is to forecast or predict birth weight from knowledge of

relative height. This raises the question of which variable should be the

regressand and which variable should be the regressor (Maddala, 1977, 97—102).

Since birth obviously occurs before relative height is observed at ages 3 and

4, one can argue that relative birth weight should be the regressor. On the

other hand, it is logical to take the variable to be predicted as the regres—

sand.

        Because the causal relationship between the variables is well-

established, relative birth weight is chosen as the regressor. The fact that

weight tends to be more sensitive to the environment than does height suggests

the following functional form:


             ln(height-for-age) =        +      ln(weight-for-age).          (3)



Estimation of equation (3) based on the data of Table 2 gives the following

results (t—values are given in parenthesis):

                                     =   0.043815    (8.11)

                                     =   0.46864    (17.15)

                                R2 =         .98.

        The estimate of   is biased as a measure of the pure effect of relative

birth weight on relative height at ages 3 and 4 because nutrition after birth

is omitted as an explanatory variable. It is desirable to have an unbiased

estimate of 6 for certain purposes, but the objectives pursued here are

modest. It is clear from the results of estimating equation (3) that relative
                                     9


birth weight and relative height at ages 3 and 4 are highly correlated. Thus,

if height data are available, knowledge of nutrition after birth is largely

redundant for inferring relative birth weight. This is the case despite the

fact that nutrition is essential for growth. The results of estimating equa-

tion (3) constitute a generalization about resource allocation within poor

societies: The conditions of poverty that cause relatively low birth weight

endure to keep the children small.

     It is conceivable that American slaves did not fit the pattern found in

Table 2. Substantial resources could have been invested in prenatal care such

that birth weights were high, for example, and then children were neglected

such that they ended up small at age 3. However, the pattern of resource al-

location that would produce this result makes little sense within an economic

regime of slavery. Furthermore, evidence discussed in Steckel (1985a) sug-

gests that the prenatal environment for growth was poor, especially during

seasonal peaks in the demand for labor.

     On average slave children at ages 3 and 4 attained A6.7 percent of modern

height standards.6 Based on parameter estimates of equation (3) the inferred

value of birth weight is 5.10 pounds or 2320 grams. A simple linear form

involving weight—for—age and height—for—age yields almost identical results.7

Using Fieller's method (Maddala, 1977, 101—102) it is possible to obtain a

tolerance interval for the inferred value of birth weight. An 80 percent tol-

erance interval is (4.95, 5.24) in pounds and (2250, 2380) in grams. Values

in this range place American slave newborns among the smallest documented for

poor populations in developing countries of the mid-twentieth century

(Meredith, 1970; WHO, 1980).

                    FROM BIRTH WEIGHT TO NEONATAL MORTALITY


      The method used to estimate neonatal mortality rates draws upon estab-

lished patterns of the frequency distribution of birth weights and incidence

of neonatal mortality by birth weight. The neonatal mortality rate can be

calculated by adding (across weight categories) the products of these distri-

butions. This section considers the sources and the limitations of the dis-

tributions used for this purpose.

      Although the distribution of birth weight is approximately normal, the

assumption of normality is inadequate for these calculations. The departure

from normality arises primarily because birth weights are skewed to the left.

Furthermore, the extent of skewness tends to increase as average birth weight

declines. Skewness is important to the calculations because mortality rates

are high at low birth weights. Thus the distribution borrowed for calcula—

tions should have a mean close to the estimated mean for slaves. Because the

estimated mean for slave newborns is so low, however, there are few reasonable

choices available in the literature. Among the distributions found readily,

the one having the lowest mean derives from a study of birth weights among the

poor of Bombay (Jayant, 1964). The mean birth weight of males and females in

this group was 2535 grams (N=2,279), which is 215 grams above the estimated

mean for U.S. slaves. The distribution for slaves was approximated by shift-

ing   the Bombay distribution to the left by 215   grams and by assuming that

birth   weights were evenly distributed within each weight category. The
results   are given in   the second column of Table 3. To the extent that skew-

ness increases as average birth weight declines below 2535 grams, use of this

distribution underestimates neonatal mortality.
                                        11


        The schedule of neonatal mortality rates typically follows a U-shaped

pattern (Chase, 1969; Pharoah and Alberman, 1981; North and MacDonald, 1977).

Ordinarily the rate reaches a minimum in the neighborhood of 3000 to 4000

grams. The losses usually increase rapidly below 2500 grams, and before

technological improvements of the 1960s and 1970s, a majority of newborns

weighing less than 1500 grams failed to survive.

      Two considerations are important in selecting a neonatal mortality rate

schedule that approximates conditions faced by U.S. slaves. One is that

losses by birth weight vary between whites and blacks (North and MacDonald,

1977). Compared to whites, nonwhites have lower rates at low birth weights

and higher rates at high birth weights. Second, the quality of obstetrical

practices and facilities influences the chances of survival, particularily for

cases    involving cornpl ications. The first objective alone is relatively easy
to   fulfill; many schedules give results for whites and for nonwhites. The

second is more elusive because midwives usually attended slave births. By the

time that systematic registration procedures for births and deaths were in

place in the United States (the registration area was complete in 1933), mid-

wives had diminished considerably in importance. By 1935, for example, mid-

wives delivered only 12.5 percent of all regi stered births in the United

States (U.S. National Office of Vital Statistics, 1954c, 510). The data prob-

lem is exacerbated by the fact that many states did not require birth weight

information   on birth certificates before the 1940s.
      Fortunately, usable data are available from the Public Health Service,
but they must be interpreted with caution. As part of an effort to assess the
extent   of underregistration of births, the National Office of Vital Statistics

linked a sample of birth and death certificates for persons born in January-
                                      12


March of 1950. These records have been the data source for special reports on
birth weight and survival published by the Public Health Service during the
1950s.   These data are useful for this paper because midwives delivered a

large absolute number of births as late as 1950 and their services were con-

centrated among blacks who lived in the South.   In 1950, for example, midwives

(or other nonphysicians) working outside hospitals and other institutions

attended approximately 38.7 percent of the nonwhite births registered in the

South Atlantic region (U.S. National Office of Vital Statistics, 1954c, 517).

     The last column of Table 3 presents the neonatal mortality schedule for

nonwhite births attended by nonphysicians in metropolitan (SMSA) counties.8

The authors of the specical report caution readers about the potential for

understatement in the measured mortality rates relevant to midwives (U.S.

National Office of Vital Statistics, 1954a, 18-19). Specifically, the data

fail to take into account subsequent hospitilization of some infants delivered

at home or the physician's care given to others soon after delivery by a non—

physician. Perhaps more important is the possible selection of obstetrical

cases involving complications for referral to hospitals and the calling in of

physicians by some midwives to handle difficult deliveries. Furthermore, in

home births there was probably a greater tendency to underreport infants who

died shortly after birth or to misreport them as fetal deaths. To these

sources of downward bias in the mortality rates as a measure of the experience

for slaves can be added the midwives' lack of knowledge about antiseptic pro-

cedures during the early and mid—nineteenth century compared to the mid-

twentieth century. Relative levels of mortality imply that obstetrical ser-

vices were important to survival in the weight range of 1501 to 3500 grams.

Among nonwhite births in this weight group born in metropolitan counties, the
                                           13


loss    rate for physicians in hospitals was less than half of that for nonphysi-

cians working outside hospitals (U.S. National Office of Vital Statistics,

1957, 217-218).

       The expected rated of neonatal mortality calculated from the data in

Table 3 is 152.2 per thousand live births.        In view of previous remarks this

figure should be regarded as a lower bound. Sensitivity analysis establishes

a cluster of values for the loss rate. Substituting a birth weight distribu-

tion from Barua (1973) that also had a mean of 2535 grams produces an esti-

mated   loss rate of 1561 per thousand. The distribution from Jayant (1964) is
preferred for calculations on the grounds of a larger sample size (2,279 vs.
1,086).     Shifts of the birth weight distribution given in Table 3 correspond-

ing    to values of the 80 percent tolerance interval for mean birth weight of
(2250, 2380) imply a loss rate interval of (168.7, 136.8).


                         WERE LOW BIRTH WEIGHTS "OPTIMAL"?

        The laws and institutions of the antebellum South establish that slave—

owners had firm control of their chattel.         It is clear that these arrangements

facil itated the allocation of slave resources within the plantation and within

the South.     Owners and overseers, as representatives of owners, for example,

controlled the daily routine of slaves and could, and did, use force to

extract    work.
        Given this setting it   may   be instinctive for   economists   to conclude that
all    major aspects of slave life were shaped by the owner to fulfill the objec-

tive of long—run profit maximization. Accordingly, owners would have system-

atically collected information about the costs and benefits of alternative

deployments of resources and then reached a decision that established
plantation policy. Plantation documents such as diaries, ledgers, inventor-

ies, and birth and death lists, and the records of market evaluation of slaves

are strong evidence of optimizing behavior.

        Given   the evidence for   optimizing hehavi or in many aspects of plantation

life,    it is natural to ask whether     low   birth weights were optimal.    Should low

birth    weights be taken as evidence that Simon Legree was a typical slaveowner?
In discussing this question it is important to distinguish between            optimal and

deliberate.       The term "deliberatet' implies    a full or nearly full command of

the   facts essential for a decision.       In constrast, decision—makers can opti-
mize despite the lack of considerable information. Thus the question can be
rephrased in terms of what slaveowners might have known about determinants and

consequences of birth weight.
        The available information suggests that owners were largely ignorant of

the causes and effects of low birth weight. Owners were substantially more

confused than in command of the determinants of health and mortality, espe-

cially those aspects involving delays or incubation periods between cause and

effect. Fetal growth illustrates the difficulties of medical inquiry because

development      occurs over several months and little is observed until the final
product is delivered.       Indeed, many important aspects of fetal development
remain conjecture as late as the mid to late twentieth century (Tanner, 1978).

        The practice of taking measurements of newborns originated in Germany

during the 1750s, but was not common in clinics until the mid 1800s (Tanner,

1981, 254—261). Studies published in the late 1700s and early 1800s attempted

to link the dimensions of newborns to the chances of survival. Particular

attention was given to dimensions of the head because it was of major impor-

tance in difficult del iveries.        It is possible,   hut   doubtful that planters
                                        15


were generally aware of the results of these studies. Discussions of the

substance of these studies by slaveowners were notably absent from the major

agricultural journals that circulated within the antebellum South (Breeden,

1980). If owners were aware of these issues, their interest may have focused

on    large births as an obstacle to the health and survival of the mother.
After all, the typical mother may have been worth 15 times as much as    the

typical   newborn (Fogel and Engerman, 1974, 76).
       Even though slaveowners had little scientific understanding of the deter-
minants and rnncniinrc nf mw hirth.:..

tal   practices could have accumulated in the form of traditional patterns.

Through a long process of trial, error, observation, and adjustment, tradi-

tional societies may gravitate towards practices that scientific analysis

could show were desirable. Did slaveowners compell slaves to follow substan-

tially different patterns of prenatal care than were practiced by the free

population? The limited information examined on nineteenth century birth

weights suggests that important differences in prenatal care may have existed.

During the early 1800s the newborns of the poor in Paris had average weights

of 2,940 grams (Tanner, 1981, 256—257), and during the mid 1800s the poor of

Philadelphia had newborns weighing on average above 3,200 grams.9 A poor diet

associated with poverty probably contributed to reduce these weights below

modern standards of about 3,450 grams. Yet an enormous difference existed

between slaves and the poor of Paris and Philadelphia.     It is possible but

doubtful that differences in diet alone could explain the relatively low birth

weights of slaves. The height data suggest that slaves were reasonably well-

fed for the work effort required of them. The major culprit may have been the

detrimental effects of work, especially effort that required standing, on
                                         16


blood flow to the placenta. Slaveowners were probably unaware of these

effects, however, because the earliest studies suggesting that rest during

pregnancy was beneficial to fetal development were not conducted until the

late 1800s (Briend, 1980, 1159). Additional research on birth weights of

nineteenth   century populations would help to clarify the role of work effort
and other factors on low birth weight.
     It   is reasonable to conclude that low birth weights were not deliberate

in the sense that owners compelled hard work and rations insufficient for nor-

mal fetal development based upon well-established calculations that the value

of the extra output and savings in food costs more than offset the costs of

higher    infant mortality that would result. The term "optimize11 suggests that
decision-makers have command of some important facts. The facts best known to

slaveowners   were the benefits of   extra    work effort in terms of output pro-
duced. This     knowledge alone may qualify slaveowners as optimizing agents in

the production of slave health, but the limited sense in which it was true

should be emphasized.



                                CONCLUDING REMARKS


     Underenuneration of vital events is a problem familiar to people who work

with historical demographic records. The difficulties are acute for study of

mortality because a large share of deaths are concentrated soon after birth.

The rare compulsive recordkeeper aside, ordinarily sources are riddled with

births and deaths that were never recorded. Family histories and genealogies,

for example, clearly demonstrate this problem (Fogel etal., 1978). In the

case of slave birth and death lists, the potential for underenumeration is

clear from entries that died unnamed.         In a world of high mortality rates
                                     17



parents were reluctant to. name or otherwise invest psychic attachment in a

child that had little chance of survival. Yet it is the survival or nonsur—

vival of these children that is useful for an assessment of living standards

and other aspects of the quality of life in the past.

     This paper proposes a method for recovering information about mortality

that occurred soon after birth. The method requires height data for young

children, which are abundant for slaves and which are available for other his-

torical populationsJ0 In principle the method could be extended for use with

older children and with adults. The results may not be as precise as those

based on the heights of young children, however, because the older the child

the greater are the chances that environmental conditions different from those

surrounding pregnancy had an influence on stature. Furthermore, the lack of

studies that link birth weight with heights of older children may force a two

step procedure: estimating relative height at age 1 from relative height of

older children or adults and then estimating birth weight from estimated

relative height at age 1.

     With regard to the underenumeration of slave deaths that follow from this

analysis, comparisons are possible with mortality estimates derived from plan-

tation records. A collection of birth and death lists from eleven large

plantations that contain information on the period from 1786 to 1865, and

which among them grew cotton, rice, and sugar, has been assembled for study

(Steckel, 1979b).   In selecting these records from southern archives, care was

taken to avoid lists that had overt instances of underreporting such as X or

udeadui notations. In this sample the measured neonatal mortality rate was

57.8 per thousand (N=1,989),11 which is about 38 percent of the rate of 152.2

implied by the data in Table 3.
                                      18



      The postneonatal mortality rate in the plantation record sample (Steckel,

1979b) was 162.2 per thousand. Assuming a lack of underenumeration in   this
figure and that the distributions in Table 3 accurately portray the neonatal

periods then the implied level of infant mortality is 30 percent. Given the

potential for understatement in the neonatal mortality schedule, the possibil-

ity that the lower tail of the estimated weight distribution is too small, and

the possibility of underreporting in the the calculated postneonatai mortality

rate, infant mortality could easily have been several percentage points above

30.

      Although it is difficult to estimate the extent of possible downward

bias, numbers in the range of 30 to 35 percent, and possibly higher, are rea-

sonable conjectures for slave infant mortality. Figures in this range are

considerably above previous estimates. The raw data of the eleven plantations

discussed above have a rate of 233 per thousand (Steckel, 1979b, 92); based on

a different set of pTantation records, Postell (1951, 158) found a rate of

152.6; Evans (1962, 212) estimated a rate of 182.7; Farley (1970) argues for

288; and Eblen's estimates (1972; 1974) range from 246 to 275.

      The low estimates based on plantation records are easily understood; even

diligent recordkeepers fail to record some vital events, especially if death

occurred soon after birth. The estimates of Evans, Farley, and Eblen are

based fundamentally on borrowing age patterns of mortality observed in other,

presumably similar, populations. The technique of estimating model life

tables is widely employed in demographic work. One of the conclusions of this

paper is that borrowing age patterns of mortality should be undertaken cau-

tiously, especially if the application involves historical populations for

which information about the determinants of health is lacking. Specifically,
                                     19


the level of mortality at young ages among American slaves appears to have

been above those in populations once thought to have been similar.

    The estimated birth weight distribution substantially drives the esti-

mates of neonatal mortality. This distribution also has important implica-

tions for the share of pregnancies lost through fetal deaths. Table 4 shows

the ratios of fetal losses to live births by birth weight for nonwhites in

1950. The schedule is similar to that for neonatal mortality. If the birth

weight distribution of Table 3 and the data of Table 4 are combined, the

implied rate of loss is 114.2 per thousand live births. If the birth weight

distributions corresponding to the 80 percent tolerance interval of estimated

birth weight are used, the implied interval for stillbirth loss is (126.3,

102.8). The extent to which the schedule of loss in Table 4 applies to slaves

is unknown. Because of the great potential for stress during the first tri-

mester among slave pregnancies and the relevance of this stress for still-

births, however, the calculations using the schedule of Table 4 should he

viewed as lower bounds.

     The analysis discussed in this paper can be extended to study of regional

differences and time profiles of health and mortality. Sufficient height data

are available in the National Archives for these purposes, and efforts to

assemble additional data are in progress. One of the major questions involv-

ing time trends concerns possible cycles. Previous work in this area

(Steckel, 1979a) discovered declines in the heights of children during the

1830s and early 1840s. Additional data will enhance study of this question by

region and perhaps by individual years.

     A final point worth making concerns estimates of slave fertility. If

previous mortality estimates are too low, then previous fertility estimates
                                     20


are low as well. At the level of family reconstitution, higher infant mortal-
ity estimates imply that intervals between live births were shorter and the

number of children ever born per woman were higher than previously thought.

New estimates of birth intervals and children ever born could be made based on

a life table revised in light of this paper.

1. Because 'endogenous" factors also cause mortality during the late

     prenatal period, stillbirths and early neonatal deaths are combined into

     a separate measure called perinatal mortality. This measure includes

     deaths from the 28th week of gestation to the seventh day after birth,

     and has the advantage of eliminating some of the measurement problems

     associated with various definitions of stillbirths.

2. See the references cited in the sentence and references therein, for dis-

     cussions of the methodology of using height asa measure of nutrition,

     health, and living standards.

     of possible biases.

5.   In this context poor populations are defined as having average birth
     weights under 3.20 kilograms (7.0 pounds). The modern standard for birth
     weight is 3.45 kilograms (average for males    and females).

6.   In calculating this   figure it is   important to remember that the average

     age of children age 3 at last birthday, for example, is 3.5 years.

7. A simple linear form involving weight—for—age and height-for—age gives an

     inferred value of 5.07 pounds. The coefficient of a dummy variable for

     sex is statistically insignificant (tO.19) if it is included in equation

     (3).

8. The sample for metropolitan counties is preferred on grounds that regis-

     tration was more complete in metropolitan as opposed to nonmetropolitan

     areas (U.S. National Office of Vital Statistics, 1954b, 59).
