                  An Analysis of the Selection of Arbitrators




                                   ABSTRACT




       This paper analyses data on union and employer rankings of different
  panels of arbitrators in an actual arbitration system. A random utility
  model of bargainer preferences is developed and estimated. The estimates
  indicate that unions and employers have similar preferences, in favor of
  lawyers, more experienced arbitrators, and arbitrators who seem to have
  previously favored their side. Alternative rankings models, which are
  estimated to test whether bargainers rank arbitrators strategically, reveal
  no evidence of strategic behavior.

 I.    Introduction

      Arbitration is a rapidly-growing method for resolving disputes. It is

 used widely in the U.S. to resolve private disputes arising under collective

 bargaining agreements and commercial contracts, to resolve certain types of

civil disputes, and to set wages in the public sector-.   Although arbitration

has been applied in a wide range of settings and takes numerous forms, the

central feature of virtually all arbitration mechanisms is that they involve a

third party, i.e., an arbitrator or panel of arbitrators, hearing and deciding

how a dispute is to be resolved. In this respect, arbitration may be viewed

as a private sector analog to the court system with arbitrators performing

similar functions to judges. Arbitration tends, however, to be a cheaper,

quicker, and less formal method of dispute resolution than the court system.

Arbitration systems also tend to provide disputing parties with greater

latitude -in choosing "judges" (i.e., arbitrators) than do court systems.1

      Among persons who are regularly involved in arbitration, it is generally

accepted that "good arbitrators" are the key to "good arbitration.." However,

there seems to be far less consensus about the meaning of the phrase "good

arbitrators." For example, is a good arbitrator someone who favors your side

or someone who is painstakingly fair in arriving at a decision? Is it someone

who has extensive experience with the type of dispute at hand or someone with

good common sense and the ability to analyze, interpret, and judge? Is it

someone who tries to appease the parties by splitting decisions or someone who

strictly "calls them as he or she sees them?"

      Our purpose in this paper is to address these and other related questions

by presenting an empirical analysis of the selection of arbitrators. We do

this by analyzing a remarkable set of data on the preferences of unions and

employers for different arbitrators under New Jersey's Fire and Police
                                      —2-


Arbitration   Law.   According to this law, disputes over terms and conditions of
employment involving New Jersey's organized public safety employees and the

governments that employ them must be resolved by arbitration. Arbitrators,

whose awards are binding by law, are chosen by the bargainers from a roster of

roughly seventy names maintained by the New Jersey Public Employment Relations

Commission (PERC). In cases in which the bargainers are unable to negotiate

an agreement, PERC circulates a list of seven arbitrators and their resumes to

the parties, each of which is instructed to veto three names and to rank, in

order of their preferences, the remaining four names. PERC then appoints as

arbitrator the individual who was not vetoed by either side and whose combined

rank is highest; rank ties are broken randomly by PERC.

     Using information on employer and union rankings of different panels of

arbitrators, along with information on the characteristics of the arbitrators,

we attempt to provide direct evidence on the following three issues:

     (1) How similar are the preferences of unions and employers with respect
     to a given panel of arbitrators?

     (2) What characteristics of arbitrators do unions and employers find
     desirable or undesirable? Do the unions and employers attach the same
     or different weights to specific characteristics? and

     (3) Do unions or employers engage in strategic behavior -in    ranking
     arbitrators?

     In proceeding this way, we also hope to shed light on three broader

issues. First, there has recently developed in the academic literature a body

of theoretical work on the subject of bargaining and arbitration.2 The basic

premise of most of this work is that arbitration is simply a mechanism for

distributing income between conflicting interests. In contrast, institutional

economists and labor practitioners place greater emphasis on arbitration as a

mechanism for helping disputants identify and reach efficient outcomes. In

 their view, arbitrators are professional gatherers and processors of information
                                      —3--


 who play a highly constructive role -in a bargaining process which is better

 treated as a cooperative attempt at problem-solving than as direct economic

 conflict. By analyzing the similarity of union and employer preferences for

 individual arbitrators and for different arbitrator characteristics, we suspect

 that much can be learned about the general issue of whether collective

 bargaining is primarily an institution of cooperation or conflict.

      Second, one of the most important characteristics of arbitration
                                                                         systems
 is that they may be designed in different ways. Indeed, one key dimension in

which arbitration systems differ involves the mechanism for selecting the

arbitrator. Most mechanisms take account of the parties' preferences, either

through a rank-four/veto-three system like New Jersey's, or by allowing each

party to successively veto a name from an odd-numbered list of three or more

arbitrators. Other arbitration systems appoint arbitrators on a purely rotating

basis from a list agreed to in advance by potential disputants or established by

a third party such as the state. A final system involves the appointment of a

single individual or panel of individuals to arbitrate all disputes involving a

particular set of parties and arising in a specified period of time. The key

feature of all of these systems is that they guarantee the appointment of an

arbitrator without requiring explicit agreement (or even face-to-face contact)

by two parties who are unable to reach agreement on some other (substantive)

matter. In addition, these systems all prescreen individuals before they are

added to the master list of eligible arbitrators. However, the first two

systems provide for an additional level of screening by the parties prior to the

appointment of an arbitrator to hear a particular case. This additional level

of screening -is said to contribute to the legitimacy of the arbitrator and his

award in the eyes of the parties. However, it can also contribute to delays in

the arbitration process, which is one of the most frequently cited complaints
                                    -4-

about arbitration. Thus, -it -is -interesting to ask whether the appointment of

arbitrators can be left entirely in the hands of the state or some impartial

organization like the American Arbitration Association or whether it is

important to take account of the parties' preferences on a case-by-case basis.

We will address this question below when we analyze the strength of union and

employer preferences for different members of a set of "prescreened"

arbitrators .3

     Third, our study raises important questions about the possibility of stra-

tegic behavior and its treatment in empirical analysis.   In particular, it is

well known that the outcomes of voting mechanisms can often be manipulated by

the strategic misrepresentation of preferences. Although it is natural to

address this problem by directly estimating a structural model of the underlying

economic game, the complexity and dimensionality of the game may render this

approach infeasible, as it does in our case. Thus, we develop some indirect

tests that we think will let us "back our way" into strategic behavior if it is

there. We suspect that the type of indirect approach we propose may be useful

in a variety of game-theoretic settings in which the games are too complicated

to solve.

      In the next section of the paper we provide some institutional background

on the selection of arbitrators and describe our data.    In Section III we set

out a simple random utility model that we use to represent the preferences of

employers and unions for arbitrators with different characteristics. We also

present the likelihood function we maximize to estimate the parameters of this

model.4 In Section IV we present a descriptive summary of the data. We also

 present estimates of the econometric model as well as two alternative models we

 estimate to test for the presence of strategic behavior. Section V summarizes

 and concludes the paper.

 II. Institutional Background

      Most of the data analyzed in this paper were drawn from the PERC's   arb-itra--

 tiori records. First, we collected information on the lists of arbitrators sent

 by PERC to disputing parties along with the preference rankings returned to PERC

 by the parties. We focused only on cases involving 1980 contract negotiations.

 That was the third year of operation of the New Jersey arbitration system and

 the third (and final) year in which PERC used its original master list of eli-

 gible arbitrators to form panels.5 Thus, we felt that by 1980 the parties had

 reasonably good information about the arbitrators on which to base their pre-

ference rankings. In many cases, at least one of the parties did not strictly

follow PERC's request for a preference ranking. Sometimes parties ranked more

than four names on the list; other times the parties vetoed more than three

names; in a few cases a party responded to PERC by saying that all seven names

were equally acceptable; there were also a number of cases in which a party

either failed to express its preferences to PERC or its preferences were simply

not recorded in the PERC records.6 Altogether we collected information on 193

arbitration panels. Of these, 75 are perfect in the sense that both parties

ranked four names and vetoed three names. It should also be noted that many

(indeed, most) of the cases for which PERC circulated arbitration panels did not

end up being arbitrated. In other words, many disputants were able to reach

voluntary settlements after the arbitration panel was circulated but before a

binding arbitration award was rendered. This characteristic of the

bargaining/arbitration process in New Jersey explains why some parties did not

report their arbitrator preferences to PERC (i.e., either their case was settled

before the due date for reporting their preferences or they expected that it

would not end up in arbitration).
                                    —6-

    Second, we collected information on the characteristics of the 69

arbitrators on PERC's master list. This information was derived from a variety

of sources including PERC's 1978 and 1979 interest arbitration records and

awards, PERC's 1979 grievance arbitration records, and the arbitrators' resumes.

In collecting this background information, we were guided by the institutional

literature on the relevant characteristics of arbitrators and by conversations

with labor relations practitioners.7 Roughly speaking, the relevant character-

istics of arbitrators seem to fall into four categories: (1) impartiality,

(2) consistency, (3) training, and (4) experience.8

     Impartiality refers to an arbitrator's lack of predisposition to rule in

favor of one side or another. This characteristic -is usually judged by

considering an arbitrator's prior decisions. It appears to be the most

important characteristic of an arbitrator since no party is likely to be

satisfied with an arbitrator it perceives to be biased against its position.

There has even been some debate over whether disputants prefer arbitrators who

they perceive to be biased in their favor. On the one hand, such bias is

desirable because it suggests a higher probability of receiving a favorable

arbitration decision. But on the other hand, it damages the integrity of the

institution of arbitration and does not promote the legitimacy and mutual

acceptability of the arbitrator's award.

     Consistency refers to the extent to which an arbitrator decides cases

solely on their merits, without reference to his (or her) "box score" of

previous decisions. The parties' concern with the consistency of arbitrators

stems from their awareness that many arbitrators derive considerable income

from arbitrating and therefore may have an incentive to "split their awards" in

order to appear impartial and maintain their acceptability. Such a practice

greatly threatens the institution of arbitration since it suggests that a
                                       -7-

 certain fraction of cases will be won by a given party, not on their merits,

 but simply because they are brought before an arbitrator.   Consistency is most

 often judged by subjectively reviewing an arbitrator's previous awards to see

 that similar decisions were reached in similar cases.

      A third dimension along which arbitrators differ is their training. Most

 labor arbitrators are lawyers, undoubtedly because legal training is

 well-suited to analyzing and judging the vast majority of labor disputes, i.e.,

 disputes over the terms of existing contracts, also known as grievances.

 However, the New Jersey system involves disputes over the terms of new

contracts, i.e., disputes oF interest, with the most common and important issue

 in dispute being wages. Thus, one might expect that training in other areas,

and especially in economics, might be particularly desirable to the parties.

     Arbitration experience is another important characteristic of prospective

arbitrators. Practitioners generally regard this characteristic as a measure

of an individual's expertise as an arbitrator and usually insist upon an

experienced arbitrator in cases involving complex or otherwise difficult

issues. At a more theoretical level, it seems likely that experience -is

desirable because it reduces the uncertainty that risk-averse disputants have

over the outcome of arbitration and thereby reduces its (indirect) cost.9

Indeed, the acquisition of experience is generally regarded to be the most

significant hurdle faced by aspiring labor arbitrators -in the U.S.1°


III. A Model of Arbitrator Selection

     In this section we outline a simple model of arbitrator selection. We

start by considering a situation in which an employer (E) and a union (U) are

unable to reach agreement on a vector of contract items although they do agree

(or are compelled by law) to have their dispute resolved by arbitration. A list

of seven potential arbitrators along with information on their qualifications is
                                        —8-

circulated among the two parties by an impartial organization.             Each party is

instructed to veto three names and rank the remaining four names in order of

their preference. The individual who is not vetoed by either side and who has

the lowest combined rank is appointed to hear the case; rank ties are broken by

coin tosses.1'

        We now assume that each party has a preference ordering defined over the

entire set of possible arbitration outcomes and that these preference orderings

can be represented by well-behaved Von Neumann-MorgenSterfl utility functions.

We also assume that each party has one set of prior beliefs about the

distribution of arbitration outcomes for each of the seven potential

arbitrators. Finally, we assume that these sets of prior beliefs depend on the

arbitrator's qualifications, some of which are observed.

        In this model, an arbitrator's characteristics determine a party's prior

beliefs about the arbitrator's decision. These beliefs, in turn, determine the

expected utility that a party associates with that arbitrator. It follows

that there exist direct mappings of arbitrator characteristics into an expected

utility for each party. For each potential arbitrator (1), we write these

expected utilities as a linear function of the arbitrator's characteristics.


                                                         1, 2, ..., 7)
 (la)        ''Ei =   XiE   +
                                Ei                (i =


 (ib)        Ui =           + €U-i                (i = 1, 2, .   . ., 7)

where        and       are the expected utilities the employer and union associate

with arbitrator -i; X. is a vector of observed characteristics of arbitrator 1;

    and      are vectors of unknown (reduced-form) parameters characterizing the

 preferences of the employer and union for different arbitrator characteristics;

 and       and €Ui represent random utility effects.

        Given this framework, the simplest model one could adopt for arbitrator
                                        -9-.


 selection would treat each party as ranking arbitrators in order of their

 expected utilities. In other words, each party's stated ranking is assumed to

 coincide with the ordering of its true preferences. More complicated models

 which account for each party's incentives to rank arbitrators some other way

 are possible, too. For now, however, we shall work with the simple model and

 defer consideration of alternative models to Section IV.C.

         In order to make this model of arbitrator selection
                                                                          empirically tractable,
 it is necessary to treat the unobserved characteristics
                                                                             and eU (1= 1,
         7) as random variables. We do this by assuming that these random

 variables have independent extreme value distributions:


 (2)         Pr(€.     x) =   exp(—e)          (p = E, U)
                                               (1 =   1,   .   . . , 7)

This distributional assumption is quite common in random utility models of this

general form.12 It is also quite convenient, both analytically and
                                                                                    computation-
ally, in the present application.

       We derive the likelihood function for each party's rank choices by

developing an expression for the probability of a particular ranking. For

example, suppose the union ranked a list of seven arbitrators in the
                                                                                     following
order:     (1, 2, 3, 4, Veto, Veto, Veto). The likelihood of this ranking is

simply the probability that         >     > "3        >         > ''5          Y). The
general formula for the probability of a particular ranking is given by

             K
(3)         11
                 MNL(A(j) Remaining choice set, )
           J=i


where A(j) denotes the arbitrator who receives the th rank, K is the number of

arbitrators that receive a rank (e.g., four, in the standard case), and MNL is

the mult-inomial logit probability that a party with preference parameters                   will

most prefer arbitrator A(j) given the option of choosing from the 8-j least pre-
                                    -10-

ferred arbitratOrs. This probability is defined as


                                                   exP(XA,
(4)
           MNL(A(J) Remaining choice set, 13) =
                                                        exp(X
                                                  8—j


where qi8 refers to the remaining choice set of 8-j least preferred arbitrators.

      The probability in equation (3) is simply the product of the multinomial

logit probabilities of ranking an arbitrator from among those arbitrators that

have not already been ranked. Notice that this model is extremely amenable to

dealing with the type of unbalanced data configuration we face. For example,

in cases where more than four arbitrators are ranked, the likelihood of the

ranking will simply consist of the product of more than four multinomial logit

probabilities. Thus, this model makes efficient use of all of the preference

ordering information we have available. It should also be noted that this

likelihood function is globally concave. This property guarantees a unique

maximum if the model is asymptotically identified and typically assures numeri—

cal stability in computing maximum likelihood estimates.


IV.   Empirical   Results

      A.   Descriptive Statistics

      We begin our discussion of empirical results by presenting a descriptive

 summary of the data. Table I presents the distribution, across arbitration

 panels, of the number of arbitrators not vetoed by either side. If employer and

 union preferences tend to be in direct conflict, one would expect most panels to

                                                  Alternatively, if employer and
 yield only a single jointly-ranked arbitrator.

 union preferences tend to be similar, one would expect most panels to yield four

 Jointly—ranked names. As the first row of Table I makes clear, neither of

 these extremes appears to be true. Over 80 percent of the panels yielded two

 or three jointly acceptable arbitrators with an average overlap of nearly 2.5

0.   Independent Ranki           11.4



*These statistics, as well as those in Table II and Figure I, are based on the
75 cases in which both sides ranked four arbitrators and vetoed three.
                                          —11—


arbitrators   per panel. Observe also the last row of Table I that presents the

distribution of the number of jointly-ranked names under the assumption that

the parties' rankings of arbitrators are independent of each other. A

chi-square test comparing the observed distribution (row A) to the

independent-rankings distribution (row 0) yields a test statistic of 11.2,

which is statistically significant at the .05 level (3 degrees of freedom).

This result suggests that the parties' rankings are not independent. Moreover,

the biggest contribution to the test statistic comes from the proportion of

lists with 4 overlapping names, providing some evidence of positive correlation

in the parties rankings. In addition, it is worth noting that the distribution

of jointly-ranked names is not statistically significantly different in the

subset of 29 cases that ended up being arbitrated than in the subset of 46

cases that ended up being negotiated (i.e., a chi—square test for the equality
                                                           of 1.4, which is not in the
of the true distributions yields a test statistic

5 percent tail of a x2 distribution with 3 degrees of freedom).

       Since Table I is not informative about the closeness of employer and union

rankings within each panel of arbitrators, we have computed a rank correlation

coefficient (p) for each of the 75 "perfect" cases


                                    — 4

                    -i=1


 where REj and       are the ranks assigned by the employer and the union, respec-

 tively, to the th arbitrator on the panel.13 In Figure I we plot the

 (observed) frequency distribution of this statistic. As can be seen from the

 plot, there are some cases in which the parties' rankings are very different

               -.5), some cases in which they are very similar (i.e., p        .5), and
 (i.e., p

 many cases in which they seem to be uncorrelated. However, on balance, the

 plot seems to produce evidence of a slight tendency for the employer and union

 rankings to be positively correlated (p =       .13).14

       We now take a closer look at the similarity of employer and union

rankings by constructing a two-way contingency table of these rankings and for-

mall')' testing the hypothesis that they are independent.   This contingency

table, which reports the number of times that arbitrators listed on the 75

panels received each of twenty-five possible combinations of employer and union

ranks, is presented in Table II. This table also presents (in parentheses)

theoretical frequencies for each cell computed under the hypothesis that the

rankings are independent.15 The hypothesis of independence is tested using the

familiar x2 statistic which has the value 36.4 for this table. Since

this statistic has 15 degrees of freedom, we reject the hypothesis of

independence at all conventional significance levels (e.g., the critical value

of a       random variable at the 99 percent level is 32.8).

       Before leaving Table II, it is interesting to note that the (1, 1) cell

makes the biggest contribution to the x2 statistic. In other words, the

hypothesis of independence is rejected largely because the unions and the

employers ranked the same individual first -in 21 of the 75 panels they

reviewed. Indeed, the observed frequencies are greater than the theoretical

frequencies for all of the diagonal cells in Table II. This provides some

further evidence that employer and union preferences tend to be at least

moderately similar.

       We now describe the characteristics of the New Jersey arbitrators. To

begin with, 45 percent of the arbitrators have law degrees and 12 percent are

 Ph.D. economists; the remaining 43 percent are labor relations practitioners,

 some of whom have Ph.D.ts in labor relations or other areas.    All of the

 arbitrators, of which there are only four women, have mediation or factfinding

 experience in public sector wage disputes. In addition, two-thirds of the

 arbitrators had rendered at least one interest arbitration award in the New

Jersey system during its first two years of operation, although only 12 percent

of the arbitrators had rendered five or more awards. On average, the New Jersey

arbitrators have about fifteen years of arbitration experience, with the range

of experience being from four years to forty years. Nearly two-thirds of the

arbitrators had been appointed to hear two or more grievance arbitration cases

in the New Jersey public sector in 1979. About one half of the arbitrators are

members of the National Academy of Arbitrators.

     In Figure II we plot the average rankings received from the employers and

the unions by the 65 arbitrators who received at least two rankings from each

party.16 In computing these averages we were able to use ranking information

from most of the 193 panels by assigning vetoed arbitrators a rank equal to the

median of the unassigned ranks. As Figure II makes clear, there is considerable

dispersion across arbitrators in the average rankings they received from the

parties. This provides further evidence that the parties prefer some arbitra-

tors to others. Moreover, the average rankings in Figure II exhibit a fairly

high positive correlation (p =   .51),   providing a further indication of simi-

larity between the partiest preferences. Of course, one weakness of the

average-rank statistics plotted in Figure II is that they do not control for the

characteristics of the other arbitrators who appeared on the same lists.

However, controlling for those characteristics is accomplished by our structural

model of arbitrator selection, to which we now turn.

     B. Estimation Results

     Table III presents estimates of the employer and union preference

parameters of the random utility model in equation (1). Positive signed

coefficients indicate that a particular characteristic tends to increase the

expected utility of an arbitrator and, therefore, the likelihood that the

arbitrator receives a favorable rank. Negative coefficients indicate the

opposite. The estimates were obtained by maximizing the log of the likelihood

function implied by equation (3) for a particular specification of arbitrator

characteristics. The maximization was accomplished on a personal computer

using the modified quadratic hill-climbing method (GRAOX) proposed by Goldfeld

and Quandt (1972). All of the rankings data available from the 193 arbitration

panels were used in the estimation (i.e., we used 129 employer rankings and 160

union rankings). Since the estimates are maximum likelihood, standard tests of

their significance can be performed based on their asymptotic normality.

     In specifying the vector of arbitrator characteristics, we paid close

attention to the institutional literature on arbitrator selection reviewed in

Section II. Thus, we attempted to capture the training dimension of an

arbitrator's characteristics by including dummy variables for lawyers and

economists, with all other arbitrators comprising the reference category. We
have no strong priors on the effect of these variables although it does seem

likely that economists would be viewed as best able to resolve the wage and

benefit disputes that are central to most negotiations in New Jersey. Our

specification also includes variables reflecting an arbitrator's experience.

Specifically, we include the number of grievance arbitration appointments each

arbitrator received in 1979 and the number of conventional and final-offer

arbitration awards each arbitrator rendered in New Jersey prior to 1980.17 If

experience is truly a desirable characteristic, we would expect both of these

measures, which are derived from independent arbitration systems, to be

positively associated with each parties' preferences for an arbitrator.

     Finally, we attempt to control for an arbitrator's impartiality in several

ways. First, we include a variable (FAVU) defined to be the difference between

the number of final—offer cases decided in favor of unions and the number decided

in favor of employers in the years 1978 and 1979. This variable is non—zero for
                                     —15—

 about 55 percent of the arbitrators and takes on values between -4 and 4. If

 this variable adequately measures the tendency of an arbitrator to be more sym-

 pathetic to one side than the other, and if the parties prefer arbitrators they

perceive to be relatively sympathetic to their position, this variable should be

associated with more favorable rankings from the union and less favorable

rankings from the employer. Second, we construct a variable (FAVUHAT) which

measures the expected difference between the number of final offer cases decided

in favor of unions and employers. This measure is constructed using estimates

of the unconstrained arbitrator decision—making functions reported in

Ashenfelter and Bloom (1984, Table 2, columns 1 for 1978 and 1979) along with

information on the final offers in the 1978 and 1979 cases. The inclusion of

this variable in the empirical model refines the first measure of impartiality

by controlling for an important subset of facts in the final-offer cases. Thus,

under the assumption that the parties evaluate the record of each arbitrator's

final-offer decisions in light of the quality of the final offers they were

forced to choose between, our expectation is that the coefficient of FAVUHAT

will be opposite in sign but have the same absolute magnitude as the coefficient

of FAVU. Third, as a simple alternative measure of arbitrator bias, we include

a variable (AVEDEV) defined as the average wage increase awarded by each

arbitrator in their 1978 and 1979 cases. This variable, which incorporates

information from both conventional and final-offer cases, is expressed as a

deviation from the average of all awards rendered in 1978-79; it has the value

zero for arbitrators who made no awards. If case facts are similar across

bargaining disputes, this variable will provide a reasonable measure of each

arbitrator's tendency to favor the union or the employer.

    The estimates in Table III reveal a number of interesting Features about

employer and union preferences for arbitrators. First, both the employers and

 the unions   tend to prefer individuals with law degrees to labor relations

 practitioners. However, employers prefer economists to both of these groups

whereas unions prefer both of these groups to economists. Perhaps this

 somewhat surprising result is explained by the fact that economists are likely

to be heavily influenced by efficiency considerations whereas lawyers are more

 likely to place greater emphasis on equity.

     Second, the three measures of an arbitrator's experience (GRAPTS79, NFOA,

and NTOT) typically have positive coefficients in both the employer and union

equations. This indicates that employers and unions both prefer more

experienced arbitrators to less experienced arbitrators, controlling for

variables reflecting their training and impartiality. It is, however, possible

to interpret the experience variables as controlling for arbitrator—specific

characteristics which are not in the model (akin to fixed effects) since, to

some extent, they reflect arbitrators' past popularity. Since it is not

possible for us to distinguish empirically between these alternative

interpretations of the experience variable, we conclude simply that our results

are not inconsistent with the hypothesis that experience is a desirable charac-

terist-ic, as emphasized in the institutional literature on arbitrator

selection.

     Third, our measures of arbitrator bias, i.e., their past tendency to favor

unions, have negative coefficients in the employer equation and positive

coefficients in the union equation, whether or not we control for the case

facts. This indicates that employers tend to give poorer rankings to

arbitrators who seem to have favored unions in the past whereas unions tend to

prefer such arbitrators. This finding is consistent with our expectation that

the parties do not like arbitrators whom they perceive to be biased against

them. Note also that the coefficients of FAVUHAT are not significant at the
                                         —27—

five percent level -in   either   the employer or the union equat-ions and that their

inclusion in the equations does not substantially change the magnitudes of the

coefficients of FAVU. In addition, in the employer equation the coefficient of

FAVUHAT is opposite in sign and of roughly the same magnitude as the

coefficient of FAVU. However, in the union equation the two coefficients have

the same sign and, counter to our expectation, we reject the hypothesis that

they sum to zero at the five percent level. Nonetheless, if we constrain the

coefficients of FAVU and FAVUHAT to be equal and opposite in sign (i.e., by

entering FAVOIFF), the measure of bias has the theoretically expected effect

and is close in magnitude to the bias coefficient in the other models.

     The last point worth noting about the results in Table III relates to the

magnitudes of the coefficients. These are difficult to interpret since their

scale is determined by our assumption that the 6Ei and €Ui are drawn

independently from extreme value distributions as defined in equation (2).

However, one may gauge the magnitude of the coefficients by measuring their

values in relation to the standard deviation of the c's. The latter are fixed

by our distributional assumption and equal fl/V ( 1.28). Viewed in this way,

we see that all of the coefficient estimates are relatively small in magnitude.

For example, a one standard deviation change in the number of grievance

arbitration appointments only represents a change of about one-fourth of a

standard deviation of c. Thus, while our estimates of the effect of

arbitrators' characteristics on the parties' rankings are reasonably precise,

they are also quite small.18 Given the similarity of results from alternative

specifications (reported in Bloom and Cavanagh, 1985a) that allow for

nonlinearities and that include alternative measures of experience, we suspect

that the large amount of noise we are observing indicates that the parties are

relatively indifferent to many of the arbitrators in the New Jersey system.

      C.   Testing for Strategic Behavior

      As noted earlier, a critical assumption of our analysis is that the

 observed rankings data reveal the true preferences of the parties. This would

 'e true if each party perceived that it had no incentive to misstate its true

 preferences. However, it is not difficult to imagine a scenario in which the

 parties do have incentives to rank arbitrators strategically. For example,

suppose the union's true preference ranking of a list of seven arbitrators is

 [1. 2, 3, 4, Veto, Veto, Veto] and the employer's true preference ranking is [1,

4, 3, 2, Veto, Veto, Veto]. Although not identical, these preference orderings

do have important similarities: they both rank the first arbitrator as most

preferred and they both veto the fifth, sixth, and seventh arbitrators.

However, if either party has some information about the other party's

preferences, it is quite likely that it will have an incentive to misstate its

true preferences. For example, if each party expects the other to veto the last

three arbitrators on the list, but has no idea how the other party will rank the

first four arbitrators, they will both try to ensure the appointment of the

first arbitrator by presenting identical rankings of [1, Veto, Veto, Veto] for

the first four arbitrators. Thus, the two parties' revealed preferences might

appear quite similar even though the only correspondence between the true and

revealed preferences of each party would be the assignment of the most favorable

rank to the first arbitrator. Other examples, in which similar preferences can

lead to dissimilar rankings, are possible, too. This type of behavior is

particularly distressing since it can lower both parties' welfare (see Bloom and

Cavanagh, 1985b). Moreover, it suggests that the estimates presented so far in

this section may not reflect the parties' true preferences.

    A natural way to address this issue is to model the ranking of arbitrators

as a game in which each party must choose a strategy, i.e., a ranking, given
                                     —19-

its   subjective opinion about the ranking of the other party. A natural

definition of equilibrium strategies for this game would be the Bayesian Nash

equilibrium which has the characteristic that neither party can increase its

expected utility by unilaterally changing its strategy. In principle, one

could solve for each party's Nash strategy and derive a likelihood function

that could be maximized to estimate each party's preference parameters

conditional on this strategic behavior. However, in practice, the

dimensionality of the problem makes this infeasible unless substantial

structure is placed on the problem, which we prefer not to do.19 Instead, we

will develop an empirical approach to this issue.

       Our test for strategic behavior primarily involves the estimation of

alternative random utility models that use different subsets of information

available in the arbitrator rankings data. Under the null hypothesis that the

data reveal the parties' true preferences, estimates of the parameters of these

models should not be significantly different. We consider two alternative

models. First, we consider a model in which each party assigns a rank of one

to the arbitrator it truly prefers the most, but may rank the remaining six

arbitrators strategically, i.e., not in the true order of their expected

utilities. The likelihood function for this model is derived from expressions

for the probability that A(1) >     A(2)'   A(3)' ''A(4)' ''A(Veto1)' 'A(Veto2)'

'A(Veto3) This is simply a multinomial logit model (MNL). Second, we

consider a model in which each party's ranking correctly distinguishes between

the four most preferred arbitrators and the three least preferred arbitrators,

although the ranking of the top four choices may be done strategically.       The

 likelihood function for this model -is derived from expressions for the


probability that A(1)' A(2)' A(3)' A(4) >         A(Veto1)' A(Veto2)' A(Veto3*
 This model shall be refer'red to as the rank/veto model (RV).20
                                           -20-

      In Table IV we present estimates of the MNL model and the RV model for

 specification (1) in Table III.        If the rankings data do not reflect the true

 preferences of the parties, then the three sets of estimates will in general

 have different probability limits, regardless of the true underlying model.

 This suggests that a specification test based on the differences between the

 estimated parameter vectors has power against a broad range of alternative

 models in which the rankings do not reflect true preferences. This test should

 be especially powerful against strategic behavior that is closely approximated

by the MNL or the RV models.21 In constructing this test we follow Hausman

 (1978) who suggests a statistic of the form


           S =   ( - )'      (V1 -   V)      (I -      1311)


where the 13   are estimated parameter vectors, the V are their estimated

variance-covarjance matrices, and the superscripts I and II index the alter-

native estimators. Hausman (1978) shows that, under the null hypothesis, S is

asymptotically distributed as a chi-square random variable with degrees of

freedom equal to the rank of (V1 -       Va).
                                                CR =        MNL            CR =        RV
     Test statistics for the hypotheses                13         and f3          f3        are reported
in the last row of Table IV. Since the critical value for these statistics at

the 5 percent level is 11.07, none of the equality hypotheses are rejected with

the single exception of 13CR =   13RV   for employers. Indeed, the closeness of the

parameter estimates in Tables III and IV is a remarkable finding that provides

strong evidence that the rankings data mainly reveal the parties! true

preferences. Even the two estimated parameter vectors that give rise to the

x2 statistic of 36.35 are close in magnitude and substantively no different.

The high x2 value appears to be the result of the two sets of estimates having

virtually identical estimated variances. In other words, the statistic

reflects a precise measure of a small difference; -it does not reflect a large
                                    —21—

difference between the estimated a's. Overall, then, the results of this

subsection provide no support for the hypothesis of strategic behavior by

either party.


V.   Conclusions

     This paper opens up the empirical analysis of a new area in the literature

on bargaining under arbitration: the selection of arbitrators. Our major

substantive findings are that (1) employers and unions distinctly prefer some

arbitrators to others, (2) employer and union preferences tend to be moderately

similar to each other; (3) employers tend to prefer arbitrators with training

in economics whereas unions prefer arbitrators with legal training and dislike

economists, (4) both parties prefer arbitrators with greater experience, (5)

there is evidence that the parties' preferences are affected by arbitrators'

win—loss tallies under final—offer arbitration, and (6) there -is no evidence

that the parties rank arbitrators strategically.

     Overall, the results suggest that New Jersey's prescreening procedure for

establishing its master list of arbitrators works well. Even after controlling

for the arbitrators' characteristics, there is much noise in the parties'

preference orderings. Nevertheless, it still seems in the interest of the parties to

have input into the appointment of an arbitrator since our results indicate that

they have sensible preferences that they reveal accurately. Indeed,

appointment mechanisms that account for the parties' preferences tend to result

 in higher welfare for both parties than mechanisms that appoint arbitrators on

 a rotating basis.

      Of course, it has been argued that arbitration should be made costly so

 that bargainers have an incentive to settle their disputes voluntarily (see

 Stevens, 1966; Farber and Katz, 1979; Bloom, 1981). In this view, mechanisms

 that allow disputants to choose their arbitrator are undesirable because they

reduce the (indirect) costs of arbitration. However, this negative factor must

be weighed against the increased legitimacy an arbitrator will have when the

parties have been involved in his (or her) appointment.

    Our empirical results seem to indicate that the New Jersey mechanism for

selecting arbitrators works mainly as a safety net which allows the parties to

filter out the least acceptable arbitrators who survived the prescreening.
In other words, the extraordinary closeness of estimates derived from the

complete rankings and the rank/veto model suggests that most of the information

about the parties preferences comes from the vetoed arbitrators and not from the

rank order of the non-vetoed arbitrators. Indeed, it may well be true that

having seven arbitrators per panel is optimal given the degree of prescreening

that takes place and the nature of the parties' preferences.

     Finally, the similarity of union and employer preferences for different

arbitrators suggests that collective bargaining functions more cooperatively

than most existing models indicate. This finding represents potentially

important input into the further development of models of employer-union

interactions.

1.   For some additional comparisons of arbitration and the court system, in

which the advantages of arbitration are stressed, see the text of Chief Justice

Burger's remarks to the American Arbitration Association and the Minnesota State

Bar Association (Burger, 1985).

2. See, especially, the work of Crawford (1979, 1982) and Farber (1979, 1980).

For a useful review of selected empirical analyses of some of the theoretical

issues raised -in these papers, see Ashenfelter (1985).

3.   In many respects, the selection of an arbitrator is just one example of a

general class of social choice problems in which two or more economic agents

must collectively decide an intermediate or final outcome of some economic game.

Voting for public officials, reaching committee decisions, choosing real estate

appraisers (e.g., in cases of eminent domain), and determining the recipients

of different honors and awards are all examples. But the examples which are

most closely akin to the problem of selecting an arbitrator are the problems of

judge and jury selection.   ifl   the   case of judges, prescreening is substantial

(e.g., all federal judges must be nominated by the President and confirmed by

the Senate), although assignments are random except for the practice of "forum

shopping" and of recusing in situations where there are conflicts of interest.

On the other hand, prescreening is minimal in the process of jury selection

since federal and state jury selection laws generally require that potential

jurors be "selected at random from a fair cross—section of the community (P.L.

90-274, 82 Stat. 53). However, jury selection procedures offer opportunities

to remove jurors both for cause and, although to a lesser extent, without

cause. These procedures, known as voir dire, are modeled in Roth, Kadane, and

DeGroot (1977).

4.   Detailed derivations of all of the likelihood functions we use and their

properties are presented in the Appendix to Bloom and Cavanagh, 1985a. This

paper is available from the authors on request.

5.   PERC revises its master list of eligible arbitrators every three years.

6. This unbalanced data configuration complicates the descriptive presentation

of the data below. However, the econometric model developed in Section III is

ideally suited to this type of problem and makes efficient use of all available

information.

7. We relied particularly on material contained in MacDonald (1948) and

Elkouri and Elkouri (1985), and on conversations with Ben Fischer (former head

of the Arbitration Department of the United Steelworkers of America) and

Richard Reilly (Regional Director of the American Arbitration Association,

Boston Region).

8. The per diem that arbitrators charge is also a way in which they

differ. Most ad hoc arbitrators, for example, presently charge between two

hundred and six hundred dollars per day, plus expenses. Although little -is

known about the extent to which cost influences the selection of an arbitrator,

-it does drain the parties' funds and has been argued to be an important deter-

minant of the use of arbitration -in the case of financially small disputants

(see Bloom, 1981). In the New Jersey system under study, PERC establishes a

maximum per diem rate which is the rate charged by nearly all of the arbitra-

tors on the master list. As a result, there is very little variation in

arbitration fees across arbitrators. Thus, we do not include this variable in

our empirical analysis.

9. This conclusion requires the assumption that each party is equally risk

averse if negotiated outcomes are a possibility.

10. Recently, however, the high cost, long delays, and general shortage of
                                     —25-

 experienced arbitrators have caused some individuals to question the importance

 of experience. For example, a system known as expedited arbitration was

 adopted by labor and management in the basic steel industry in 1971. Under

 th. system, unresolved employee grievances that do not require

 precedent-setting rulings are arbitrated by a rotating panel of young,

 inexperienced arbitrators (mostly lawyers) who decide the case for a relatively

 small fee within two weeks of the decision to arbitrate. Although there has

yet to be an in-depth study of this system, its growing utilization in the

basic steel industry, in other United Steelworker contracts, in some United

Mineworker contracts, and in the U.S. Postal Service provides some evidence of

its success.

11. In this section we ignore the possibility that a voluntary settlement can

occur after the appointment of an arbitrator but prior to arbitration.

12. See, for example, McFadden (1982).

13. If all arbitrators on the panel were assigned a rank between one and seven

by each party, p would always lie in the interval [-1.0, 1.0]. However,

because only four arbitrators of the seven listed on each panel receive a rank,

we were forced to assign a rank of 6.0 to the three vetoed arbitrators (i.e.,

the median of 5, 6, and 7). As a result, our estimates of p must lie in the

interval [-.86, .93].

14. We have not worked out the distribution of p for the incomplete rankings

case. Thus, we are unable to construct a formal test.

15. For example, the expected number of arbitrators vetoed by the union and

ranked first by the employer is 32.1 (=   3/7   •   1/7   •
                                                              525).
16. Different arbitrators appeared on different numbers of panels because PERC

generated the panels randomly and because a number of arbitrators requested that

their names not be circulated actively throughout the entire year.

17. Final-offer arbitration is utilized to resolve about three—fourths of the

bargaining disputes arising under the New Jersey statute.   Under final—offer

arbitration the arbitrator is constrained to render an award which consists of

one or the other of the bargainers' final positions. Most of the remainder of

the New Jersey cases are resolved by conventional arbitration -in which the

arbitrator renders a decision which consists of his or her best judgment of a

fair settlement and which may be a compromise between the parties' final offers.

For a more detailed description of the New Jersey statute see Bloom (1980).     For


an analysis of arbitrator decision-making under the different forms of

arbitration in New Jersey see Ashenfelter and Bloom (1983, 1984).

18. Nevertheless, the arbitrator characteristics included in the model do have

significant explanatory power when considered jointly, as judged by the

difference between the maximized log likelihood and the log likelihood

evaluated at   =   0.
19. In principle, each side has 840 distinct pure ranking strategies, of which

at least several hundred are undominated. Clearly, solving for the Nash

equilibrium strategies in such a game is computationally infeasible (see Bloom

and Cavanagh, 1985b, for a description of equilibria in these and other related

games).
20. It should be stressed that neither the MNL nor the RV model is presumed

to be the correct structural model under strategic behavior.   Both are,

however, reasonable approximations to structural models that strategic behavior

is likely to imply. For example, even when behaving strategically, bargainers

are likely to give the top rank to one of their most preferred arbitrators. In

this case, the MNL model would be a reasonable approximation to the underlying

structural model. Alternatively, strategic behavior is unlikely to imply

vetoing one's most preferred arbitrators. In this case, the RV model would be
                                    —27-

a reasonable approximation.

21. In principle, the test also has power against a broad range of other

specification errors relating to distributional assumption, functional form, and

independence of the errors.

1. The Econometric Model
             In this appendix, we outline some of the main econometric results

used in analyzing the rank—choice models of Section III.

             Suppose each of T agents is faced with K options or alternatives.

For each alternative i, each agent has a (random) utility which is a linear

function of the observed attributes of that alternative and some unobserved

attributes. Hence, each agent can coripute the vector of utilities (Y, ...,




             Y
                 it
                           . +c.it
                      =X.iti
(A.l)                 .
                                                                 t   =   1,   ..., T


             '1Kt =              +
                                     CKt
where 1it is the utility agent t attaches to alternative i;                        is a vector of

observed attributes associated with alternative i and agent t;                         = (, •.•,
      is   a vector of unknown parameters characterizing the tastes of the agents;

and         represents     the utility effects of unobserved attributes.

             By treating the unobserved attribute terms ——                       = i,   ..., K

                                                                     (A.l) as a
t =   1,   ... T —— as random variables, the econometrician can view

random utility model which can potentially be used to draw inferences con-

cerning the tastes (F, •'                  of the agents.

              For our purposes, we suppose that the random variables                      have inde-

pendent extreme value distributions ——           that   is,


                                      —x
                          ( xl   = e_e         for i =   1,   ..., K              t =    1,   ...,   T.

                                                                                 gives rise to the
 tIn multinomial choice models, this distributional assumption

 multi—noinial logit model. See, for example, McFadden (l9T). The
                                                                  extreme—
                                               —2—


 value distribution is also computationally convenient for the rank—choice

 models analyzed below.]

               We consider the situation in which the econometrician observes, not

the actual values of the utilities each agent attaches to each alternative, but

the preference rankings of some of the alternatives by each of the agents.                      So,

we suppose that for each t the econometrician observes a vector of integers

             •••              where Rt(l) indicates which of the alternatives (1, ..., K)
the tth agent most prefers, Rt(2) is the second most preferred alternative

etc. and K Ejl, ..., K} indicates how many                alternatives   we have rank infor-

mation on for agent t. We will consider three different procedures for using

such data to estimate the parameters (8,, •••
                                                             K•    Before discussing the sta-
tistical methods, we introduce some additional notation. Let b =
                                                                                     (b1, ••,

                          =
               S(i,b)         exp(X.b.)
                                                         t'l' b)
              MNLt(ii, I           ..., i, b) =
                                                  k= 1
                                                         s(i, h)

In   the multi—nomial logit literature, S.(b) is referred to as                 the scale value
of   alternative i for agent t with parameters b and MNLt -1                I
                                                                                1.   ...,       b)
is   the   multinoriial logit probability that agent t with taste parameters b              will

choose     alternative i, when given the option of choosing amongst alternatives

Method 1. The simplest method for using the rank—choice data to estimate the

                   =
parameters             (Ba, ••'        is simply to ignore all rankings except the top

ranking. The model then reduces to a multinomial logit model and inference can
                                               —3—


be based on the log.-likelihood function for the MNL model:


(A.2)       L1(b) =       logMNL(R(l)           1, ...,   K; b).
                      t


Under suitable regularity conditions on the sequence of observed attributes,

the b which maximizes L1(b) will he a consistent and aymptotically normal esti-

mator of the true parameters .               However, this estimator will not, in general,
be asymptotically efficient since it ignores information available in the addi-.

tional rankings ——        R(2),       etc.


Method 2. The second method fully utilizes the information available in the

observed   rankings. To calculate the likelihood function for the ranked data,
we need   to be   able    to calculate the probability that agent t         with preference

parameters    b will have rank choice Rt(l), ...,            R+(K).    Thus, we need to

calculate


                           ...,
                                      R(K); b) =
             PrbIYR(l)
                            >            > •• >            > all   the remaining


This    problem was addressed in Block and Marschak (1960) (see also Beggs,

Cardell and Hausman (1981)). They show that


(A.3)
             P              ...,         (K.t); h) =


             Kt
             fl
                  M1Lt(R(i)       I    ji, ••• K}      {B(1), ..., Rt(i_l)};   b)
            i=l




where S denotes set difference. That is, the probability of interest is simply
                                              _14

  the product of the MNL probabilities of choosing the 1th alternative given the
 option of those alternatives that have not already been chosen.
              Using    these calculations, we see that the log—likelihood function

 for the rank—choice data is given by


                  T
       L2(b) =
                 t=l   i=l logMNL(R(i)    I   {i •..   K}   s {Rt(1), ..., Rt(i_1)};     b).


 Asymptotically       efficient statistical procedures can be      constructed using the
 maximum likelihood estimator based on this likelihood
                                                       function. Inference
 based on L2(b) will, in general, be more efficient that inference based on

 L1(b). [Note also that L2 is globally concave ——           this   guarantees a unique
maximum if the model is asymptotically identified
                                                            and typically assures numeri-

cal stability in calculating the MLE.]


Method 3.     The idea underlying    Method 1 is that a likelihood function which
uses   only a part of the available data will yield inefficient but consistent

estimators. In general, any informational garbling will yield consistent but

inefficient      limited information maximum likelihood estimators, so long       as the
limited  information model is identified. Another limited information model of
interest in this paper is one in which the exact rankings of each agent are not
recorded —— what       is recorded is the distinction between which alternatives are
among the agent's         most desirable options and which alternatives are among
the   K_Kt least desirable. Of course, in the special case in which Kt = 1 for

all t, this model is identical with the MNL model and Method 3 simplifies to

Method 1. In general, this method bases inference on the log—likelihood

function
                     T
           L3(b) =       iog( Pt(a(Rt(l)), ...,      o(R(K.)); b)
                     t=l     a


where the inner summation is over all permutations a of the integers {R(l),

...,          and the funtion        is   defined by (A.3). Hence, the summation

over a equals the probability that             ...         are the top Kt choices of

agent t in any possible order.

           Each of the three methods yields an estimator
                                                              which is consistent and

asymptotically normal under fairly general regularity conditions. However,

because methods 1 and 3 use only some of the information in the data they are

inefficient but they will yield consistent estimates of 8 under some cir-

cumstances in which the data are not truly generated by the del. For
                                                rankings correctly reflect their top
example, if, for strategic reasons, agents

preferences but not this second, third, etc., then Method 1 will yield con-

sistent estimates of 8 but Methods 2 and 3 will give inconsistent estimates.
                                                         alteratives, then Method 3
Similarly, if agents reorder their xst preferred

will yield consistent estimates while 1 and 2 will not.

            In general, if the ranking data does not reflect the true preference
                                            estimators will have different probabi-
 rankings of the agents then the three
                                              that specification tests based on the
 lity limits. These observations suggest

 differences between the Method 1 and 3 estimators and       the   Method 2 estimator
