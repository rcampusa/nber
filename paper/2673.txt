                                   ABSTRACT


         In   the overlapping generations model with uncertain lifetimes,

    efficient life insurance markets and no operative intergenerational gift

    and bequest motive, a positive birth rate has been shown to be

    sufficient and necessary for absence of debt neutrality:       equilibrium

    prices and quantities are independent of the mix of government borrowing

    and lump—sum taxation,   holding constant the path of exhaustive public

    spending.

         Implicit in this analysis has been the assumption that the lump—sum

    tax is a tax on the income from human capital.     Postponing lump—sum

    taxes then makes it possible to shift (part of) the tax burden to future

    generations if the birth rate is positive.      If instead the tax falls on

    the income from a non—human fixed factor     (land)    whose ownership claims

    are priced efficiently, then, if all land is owned by generations

    currently alive, changes in the intertemporal     pattern of taxation do not

    permit current generations to shift the tax burden to future

    generations.   Taxes on the income from all "fully owned      non—human

-
    factors   have this property, even those factors supplied elastically, but

    the latter will of course be subject to the familiar incentive or

    allocative effects ofchanges in (non—lump—sue) taxation.

       Introduction

       In      the     overlapping           generations         model      without       operative


intergenerational,      gift and bequest motives            due to Blanchard [1985]             (based

on Yaari [1965]),        a positive birth rate has been shown to be sufficient

                      and    necessary (Buiter         [1988a,b])        for    absence    of     debt
(Well       [1985])

                      Debt   neutrality prevails when                equilibrium prices           and
neutrality.

quantities are independent of the mix of government borrowing and lump—sum

taxation,      holding constant current and future exhaustive public spending.

       Professor V. Vickrey recently 1 pointed out                    to me     that    even with a

                                                                                    if the tax      in
positive birth rate, debt neutrality would still                         prevail

question were a tax on land.              This note simply demonstrates that Professor

Vickrey is correct.          Models in the Blanchard tradition assume (implicitly)

that     the   lump sum tax         is   a    tax on      the    income from human capital.

Postponing the         tax means that some           of    it     will be paid by the             "new


entrants", i.e.         by   new    generations      not yet        alive      when the     tax    was


                  (This holds true even if each agent lives                    forever;   finite or
postponed.

uncertain lifetimes          are   irrelevant;     only the positive birth rate matters

(see Buiter [1988a,b])).            Postponing taxes will make those currently alive

better off and cet.par. this will boost current consumption.

       If instead the tax is paid on the income from (or on the capital value

of) a fixed factor of production ("land" in what follows),                         if all land that

is or ever will be is owned by those currently alive and if the land market

is     efficient,     then postponing land taxes                will (assuming      the government

satisfies its solvency constraint)             leave    the value      of land and aggregate

consumption unchanged.

    With a tax on human capital income, debt neutrality would prevail only

if those currently alive possessed ownership                 claims on the after—tax wage

income of      all       future generations,         i.e.   if   future generations were,

effectively, the slaves of the           generations         currently alive.      Operative

intergenerationalgift and bequest motives effectively (at the margin) give

those alive    today        command over the human capital of future generations,

and debt neutrality results.



    The Model

    All the ingredients of the model are familiar,                    so little time will be

spent in motivating it (see e.g. Buiter [1988a, b]).

All   stocks and flows          are (real) per capita quantities.               c    is   private

Human capital is the present discounted value of future after—tax labour

income.       The stock of government interest—bearing debt is denoted b, the

fixed stock of ownership claims to current and future land rentals is Z>0.

Land ownership claims per capita are denoted                   z.   The physical stock of land

at time t       is   L(t)    and land per worker is Q(t).             Note that a "share' of

                                               of the future income stream

      Each household maximizes a time additive objective functional over an
                                                                                                  and

the risk—of—death adjusted subjective discount rate is 5+X.                         Each surviving

agent,       regardless   of age, has the same expected streams                   of future labour

income and of future taxes               on labour income and therefore              possesses    the

same stock of human capital.

      Instantaneous       utility is given by the constant elasticity of marginal

utility        function        (l/7)rY   where   E       denotes     individual      consumption.2

Competitive life insurance or annuities markets exist (with free entry and

exit).

      The economy produces a single non—storable commodity which can be used

either for private or for public consumption.                      There   is a constant returns

to land and labour production funtion,                     strictly concave         with positive

marginal products and satisfying the Inada conditions.                           Output per capita
is denoted f(Q).          The labour market is competitive (equation                (10)).

      Financial    wealth consists of claims on land (with unit price q) and

government debt.           These two claims are perfect substitutes                       in private

portfolios as shown in equation (8)                  .    The risklesa       irstantaneoua       real

interest rate is          r.     The government spends on goods              and services,       pays

interest on its debt,              raises revenue        through lump      sum    taxes    on labour

income and a land tax and borrows to cover any shortfall of current revenue

from current outlays.            Imposing the terminal condition:

From the last term inside the brackets on the R.H.S. of equation (14) it is

apparent that,         unless   $—O,   there     will    not    be    debt neutrality    for

intertemporal      redistributions of lump—sun taxes on human cspital r.              Note,

however,       that the tax on land, which is of course also a lump—sum tax,

"disappears'      when the valuation equation for land (equation              (13)) and the

government solvency constraint (12) are substituted into the consumption

function.       Holding constant the paths of exhaustive public spending and of

lump—sum taxes on human capital income, changes in the path of the land tax

rate and associated changes in government deficits or surpluses                     do not

alter        private consumption.       (In    the    model    under consideration where

c(t)=f(Q(t))—g(t)      and Q(t) and g(t) are exogenous,          debt neutrality shows up

in equilibrium through the absence of changes                   in the    path of interest

rates).        Since land is supplied inelastically (L(t) is exogenous),            the tax

on land rental income will not alter                   equilibrium allocations through
familiar incentive or allocative effects.

       The     price   of     land,    q(t),     is     independent      of   intertemporal

redistributions of land taxes             that satisfy the           government's solvency

constraint.        It is of course not only for inelastically supplied factors

such as land that the equality in equation (15) (whose L.H.S. comes from

the.   land valuation equation and whose R.H.S.                comes from the government

solvency constraint)          holds.     It holds for all            non—human factors   of

production, fixed or variable,         already in existence          or still to emerge (or

to be produced), for which ownership             claims exist today (and are priced

efficiently).

    Other "fully owned" non—human assets that are supplied elastically (in

the short run and/or the long run) will share with land the property that

current owners cannot, by postponing taxes, shift (part of) the tax burden

to future owners of new assets that will become available in the future but

are not currently owned by anyone.                     In the case of elastically supplied

factors,       a proportional tax such as                 the    land tax   considered here is

distortionary and will have the usual allocative and welfare effects.                             Debt

neutrality therefore          prevails only (assuming a positive birth rate and no

operative       intergenerational gift and bequest motive)                        for   changes     in


non—distortionary taxes on the income from non—human factors of production.

    Note again that debt neutrality will hold if the fixed factor grows or

shrinks     in an exogenously given manner (e.g.                    through exogenous       quality

improvement         or      deterioration         or      even    through     (exogenous)         land

reclaiuation3) .         What matters     for   debt neutrality      to prevail    is that agents

alive   today possess         ownership     claims to the current and future after—tax

income from all land,            both that physically present today and any land

"emerging"      in the future.          In this way, the ownership claims to the land

will,     if the market for these               claims is efficient,          fully reflect        all

current and future land taxes.

    Conclusion

    Henry George had a solution to the U.S. budget deficit problem:            scrap

all existing taxes and replace them by taxes on fixed factors.           His "single

tax" on (unimproved)   land values is one example.       Any tax on the productive

contribution of "nature" would do equally well.              A suitable compensation

scheme could take care of one unpleasant distributional implication of this

proposal:   large—scale redundancy among       specialists    on deficit financing.

Since the imposition of such a tax would (in spite of this note)          rome as a

complete surprise to everyone,     the    associated compensation scheme would

also be lump—sum and would not distort            the   process of investment in

(redundant) knowledge.
