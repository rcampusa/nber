Regulating Advertisements: The Case of Smoking Cessation Products

                                           ABSTRACT


In this paper we investigate how direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising of pharmaceutical products
in affected by regulations of the Food and Drug Administration and by market conditions. We focus
on a relatively under-studied segment of the pharmaceutical market -- the market for smoking
cessation products. Because of their proven effectiveness, these products could be the key to meeting
public health goals to reduce smoking. However, in many ways, smoking cessation products have
been more heavily regulated than cigarettes. Our empirical analysis uses data on advertising
expenditures and data from an archive of print advertisements. The archive includes all smoking
cessation product advertisements that appeared in over 13,000 issues of 28 magazines between
January 1985 and May 2002. Our study period begins shortly atfer the first nicotine replacement
product was introduced, and covers the evolution of the market as new products are introduced while
some of the older products move from prescription to over-the-counter (OTC) status. OTC status
eases the disclosure requirements imposed on advertisements of prescription pharmaceuticals,
substantially reducing the costs of a print advertisement. Our results suggest that OTC status is
associated with an increase in advertising expenditures and the number and pages of magazine
advertisements. A current proposal to reduce disclosure requirements on all DTC advertisements of
prescription drugs could have similar effects. Our results also suggest that advertising increase with
the introduction of new products and with market competition.

I. Introduction

       Cigarette industry advertisements and anti-smoking public service campaigns are familiar

features of the U.S. mass media. A large body of economics research investigates cigarette

advertising and the impact of regulating or even banning cigarette advertisements.1 A similarly

large body of public health research addresses the design and impact of public service anti-

smoking campaigns.2 The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement between states and the tobacco

industry simultaneously imposed new restrictions on cigarette advertising and established new

anti-smoking media campaigns (Bulow and Klemper 1998, Gruber 2001). In contrast to the

intense focus on other smoking-related advertisements, researchers almost seem to have

overlooked advertisements of pharmaceutical products for smoking cessation.3 In this paper, we

empirically investigate firms’ decisions to advertise as the new market for smoking cessation

products developed. We focus particularly on how Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

regulations affect these advertising decisions.


       1
         For a meta-analysis, Gallet and List (2003) identify 137 estimates of the elasticity of
cigarette demand with respect to advertising expenditures. Chaloupka and Warner (2000)
review 13 econometric studies that examine the impact of the U.S. ban on broadcast cigarette
advertising, while a smaller research literature uses pooled international data sets to study the
impact of cigarette advertising bans (Saffer and Chaloupka 2000, Nelson 2003).
       2
         Chapters 3 and 7 of the 2000 Surgeon General’s Report review evidence on the
effectiveness of counter-advertising campaigns (USDHHS 2000a). Several econometric studies
compare the impact of industry advertising versus public service counter-advertisements by
exploiting the fact that the U.S. ban on television advertising also resulted in the elimination of
anti-smoking counter-advertisements required by the Fairness Doctrine (Lewit, Coate and
Grossman 1981, Schneider, Klein and Murphy 1981).
       3
        Hu et al. (2000) and Keeler et al. (2002) study the aggregate sales of smoking cessation
products, while Tauras and Chaloupka (2003) use scanner data to estimate consumer demand for
smoking cessation products. However, none of these studies focuses on advertising in this
market.

                                                  2
       Our study of smoking cessation product advertisements contributes to research on

another increasingly familiar feature of U.S. mass media – direct-to-consumer (DTC)

advertisements of pharmaceuticals. The debate on whether DTC advertising leads to better or

worse consumer health care often involves analysis of the regulatory system as a whole (Mintzes

2001, 2002, Calfee 2002). However, the benefits and costs of regulating DTC advertisements

are likely to vary greatly, depending on the medical condition the drug treats and the knowledge

base of consumers. To improve understanding of the benefits and costs in specific contexts,

recent empirical studies focus on the impact of DTC advertising on the demand for narrow

classes of pharmaceutical products (Berndt et al. 1995, Iizuka and Jin 2002, Ling, Berndt and

Kyle 2002, Calfee, Winson and Stempski 2003, Rosenthal et al. 2003, and Wosinska 2002,

2003). Rather than analyzing the role of DTC advertising regulations on all pharmaceuticals

broadly, or estimating the impact of DTC advertising on consumer demand, in this paper we

examine the impact of FDA regulations on firms’ advertising choices in a specific market. In the

market we look at – the market for pharmaceutical products approved as aids for smoking

cessation – DTC advertising plays a particularly important role: Ma et al. (2003) find that in

1998 smoking cessation was the only class of drugs primarily advertised directly to consumers,

rather than to physicians or to both consumers and physicians.

       The market for smoking cessation products is potentially very important for public

health. A public health initiative, Healthy People 2010, aims to cut the prevalence of smoking

among adults in half, from the current rate of about 24 percent to 12 percent (USDHSS 2000b).

Over the past twenty years, the pharmaceutical industry has introduced a number of products

designed to help smokers quit. Because of their proven effectiveness, these products could be


                                                3
the key to meeting the Healthy People 2010 goal. For example, Hays et al. (1999) report that

nicotine patch therapy generally doubles abstinence rates over placebo controls in both short-

and long-run follow-ups. While recent policy debates have tended to focus on how to prevent

youth from starting to smoke, a recent analysis concludes that the Healthy People 2010 goal

cannot be met without large increases in smoking cessation rates (Mendez and Warner 2000,

2004).

         Despite the potential public health significance of smoking cessation products, current

regulatory policy towards consumer information about smoking seems disjointed. FDA

regulation of prescription drugs results in a peculiar regulatory asymmetry: in many ways,

smoking cessation products have been much more heavily regulated than cigarettes.       For

example, to comply with FDA regulations the typical DTC advertisement of a prescription drug

for smoking cessation includes a full extra page disclosing information on side effects,

contraindications, and effectiveness. In contrast, a cigarette advertisement only needs to include

a relatively small warning label.   The irony is that smoking cessation product advertisements

may serve some of the same public health goals as public service anti-smoking campaigns. For

example, in 1996 the Great American Smokeout, sponsored by the American Cancer Society,

included activities in collaboration with a manufacturer of nicotine medications (Burton et al.

1997) . More generally, previous research suggests that producers’ health claims in

advertisements are important sources of consumer information about a range of topics, including

dietary fiber in breakfast cereals (Ippolito and Mathios 1990, 1991), the fat content of foods

(Ippolito and Mathios 1995, Mathios 1998, 2000), and aspirin and heart attacks (Keith 1995).

We contribute to this line of research by describing and analyzing the flow of producer-provided


                                                 4
information about smoking cessation.

       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In section II we provide a brief history of the

market for smoking cessation products and its regulatory environment. In section III, we

describe the data we use. Our two primary sources of data are: (i) advertising expenditures by

media type; and (ii) an archive of DTC print advertisements. The archive includes all smoking

cessation product advertisements that appeared in over 13,000 issues of 28 magazines between

January 1985 and May 2002. Our study period begins shortly after the first nicotine replacement

product was introduced, and covers the evolution of the market as new products are introduced

while some of the older products move from prescription to over-the-counter status. Section IV

describes the econometric model and hypotheses to be tested and Section V presents our results.

In the final section we summarize our results and discuss the implications for public policy and

future research.

II. Evolution of the Market for Smoking Cessation and the Regulatory Environment

The Market for Smoking Cessation

       Since the first Surgeon General’s Report on the hazards of smoking was published in

1964, the prevalence of smoking among U.S. adults has dropped from 42 percent to about 24

percent. To give an idea of the importance of the role of smoking cessation in this drop,

currently there are about as many former smokers (23 percent of adults) as there are current

smokers. Put differently, the number of former smokers as a fraction of lifetime (current and

former) smokers, sometimes called the quit ratio, is now almost 50 percent, up from 30 percent

in 1965 (USDHHS 1989, 2000, Schoenborn, Vickerie, and Barnes 2003).

       Interest in tobacco cessation has been long-standing; an advertisement for a “tobacco


                                                5
cure” appeared in Harper’s Weekly in 1862 (HarpWeek 2004). However, only recently have

pharmaceutical innovations led to smoking cessation methods of proven effectiveness. A review

of research published between 1957 to 1968 concludes that “few [methods] have shown high

success rates.” (Schwartz 1969). Reviews of research published between 1969-1977 (Schwartz

and Rider 1977) and 1978-1985 (Schwartz 1987) identify some promising non-pharmacological

methods; but they also note deficiencies in the research design and methods that cast doubt on

the findings for methods such as hypnosis and acupuncture.4 In contrast, based on a meta-

analysis of evidence from clinical trials, the current Public Health Service’s Clinical Practice

Guidelines concludes that “Numerous effective pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation now

exist....that reliably increase long-term smoking abstinence rates,” and identifies buproprion,

nicotine gum, nicotine inhaler, nicotine nasal spray, and the nicotine patch as first-line

pharmacotherapies (USDHHS 2000c). The result of the meta-analysis suggest that smokers

randomly assigned to use the pharmaceutical products are 1.5 to 3 times more likely to

successfully quit than smokers in the placebo control groups.

       Table 1 documents the rapid developments in the market for pharmaceutical smoking

cessation products and its regulatory environment. For now we will focus mainly on the history

of the product market; the regulatory history is discussed in more detail below. From its

introduction in 1984 until 1991 nicotine gum was the only pharmaceutical product approved for

use as an aid to smoking cessation. Over the 1990s, pharmaceutical companies competed in this



       4
         Schwartz (1987, p. 47) concludes that “It is difficult to assess the true effect of hypnosis
as a treatment for smoking since the studies reported were weak in followup methodology ;”and
that “The comments regarding the methodology and evaluation of hypnosis trials...apply as well
to acupuncture.” (p. 50).

                                                  6
market by introducing nicotine patches, nasal spray, and inhalers. In addition, in 1997 the anti-

depressant buproprion was approved for smoking cessation under the name Zyban. Varenicline,

a nicotine agonist, is currently in phase III clinical trials. Other recent developments include

new flavors of nicotine gum, a nicotine lozenge, and emerging competition from generic

versions of nicotine gum and patch marketed at retail establishments like Wal-Mart.

       The development of effective pharmaceutical aids for smoking cessation is changing the

way many smokers quit, and may be increasing smoking cessation rates. As recently as 1987,

almost 90 percent of former smokers had quit ‘cold turkey,’ and only 1.5 percent had used

nicotine gum, the only nicotine replacement therapy available (USDHSS 1989). Currently,

about twenty percent of smokers use a pharmaceutical product when they try to quit (Plassman et

al. 2005). Two recent econometric studies examine the role of nicotine replacement therapies in

reducing aggregate tobacco consumption and increasing quitting. Hu et al. (2000) estimate that

a 10 percent increase in sales of nicotine replacement products reduces cigarette sales by 0.04

percent. They estimate that, when nicotine patches became available in 1992 (as opposed to

nicotine gum), cigarette sales fell by an additional 0.076 percent. Keeler et al. (2002) estimate

that, when the FDA allowed smoking cessation products to be sold over-the-counter (OTC),

consumption of nicotine patches and gum increased 78 - 92 percent and 180 percent

respectively. Under the assumption that the products were as effective in practice as found in

clinical trials, they estimate the extra sales translated into almost 20,000 extra quits in 1995.

Burton et al. (1997) study the impact of the 1996 Great American Smokeout (GASO), sponsored

by the American Cancer Society in collaboration with a manufacturer of nicotine medications.

Using Nielsen data they estimate that paid advertisements that mentioned the GASO reached 122


                                                  7
million adults. Burton et al. (1997) also estimate that purchases of nicotine medications

increased by 11 percent around the 1996 GASO, but they can not tie that increase specifically to

the impact of GASO advertising.

The Regulatory Environment

       In addition to documenting the introduction of smoking cessation products, Table 1 also

lists two types of other important regulatory decisions that affect their advertising. The first type

is the FDA’s decision of whether the product may be sold OTC. During the latter half of the

1990s, the FDA moved nicotine gum and nicotine patches from prescription to over-the-counter

(OTC) status. The second type is the FDA’s decision of how to regulate the advertising of

products that are sold by prescription only.

       FDA decisions to permit firms to sell their products OTC obviously affect the product

costs faced by consumers. Less obviously, these decisions also affect the advertising costs faced

by firms. Advertising costs fall because advertising of OTC products carries a lower regulatory

burden than does advertising of prescription only products.

       This lower regulatory burden flows from the agency with whom regulatory authority

rests for each type of product. The FDA has regulatory authority over advertising of prescription

drugs. That authority flows from The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) of 1938 (52 Stat.

1040; 21 U.S.C. §301, et seq.) (hereafter “the Act”). Although the Act focuses on labeling and

does not specifically define what constitutes advertising, the Act defines labeling to include all

‘written, printed, or graphic’ materials that accompanies the product. The FDA interpreted this

language broadly to mean that they have the authority to regulate any material associated with a

product, even if it does not physically accompany the product, as is the case for print or


                                                  8
broadcast advertising. In Kordel v. United States the US Supreme Court upheld the FDA’s

interpretation and effectively granted the FDA regulatory authority over the advertisements for

prescription drugs. Under this authority the FDA requires that advertisements for prescription

drugs must contain “other information in brief summary relating to side effects,

contraindications, and effectiveness.”5 By contrast the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which

has regulatory authority over advertising claims for OTC products, does not require disclosures

of the above sort. In regulating advertising, the FTC generally requires only that advertisements

are not false or deliberately misleading and that advertisers are able to substantiate claims.

       FDA regulations make it more expensive to advertise prescription products because, to

meet the FDA disclosure requirements, firms must accompany each advertisement with the

sections of the labeling the FDA approved that discuss the product’s adverse event profile,

contraindications, warnings and precautions. As seen in Figure 1, in practice the typical

advertisement of a prescription product for smoking cessation includes at least a page of fine

print disclosures. The disclosures are not required by the FTC.

       Table 1 also lists FDA’s decisions – in 1983, 1985, and 1997 – that have affected the

advertising of products that are sold by prescription only. Over the decade of the 1970s and

early 1980s pharmaceutical firms increasingly marketed prescription drugs by advertising

directly to consumers. In 1983, before pharmaceutical products for smoking cessation were on

the market, the FDA reacted to this trend. The FDA asked the manufacturers to voluntarily stop

DTC advertising. The FDA asked for this moratorium because they wanted time to study

whether or under what conditions DTC advertising might meet the statutory requirements of the


       5
           21 U.S.C. 352(n).

                                                  9
act.

       The advertising of smoking cessation products was directly affected in 1985, when the

FDA withdrew their request for the voluntary moratorium, but simultaneously imposed

significant restrictions on DTC advertising. In particular, the FDA required DTC advertisements

to meet the same standards as advertisements directed towards physicians. This standard

required that advertisements that made safety and efficacy claims about a particular drug must

include a brief summary of the product’s side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness.6 The

1985 FDA disclosure requirements applied to DTC advertisements in both print and broadcast

media. Although the disclosure requirement for broadcast advertisements was shorter, it still had

to meet the FDA standard of being “adequate.” Moreover, broadcast advertisements would be

required to make provisions for viewers to obtain the detailed FDA prescribing information.

Meeting these disclosure requirements in broadcast advertisements was generally impractical.

       The general regulatory environment significantly changed again in 1997, when the FDA

substantially reduced the burden of disclosure for broadcast DTC advertisements of

pharmaceuticals. In 1995 the FDA had issued a notice of public hearing and request for

comments on the regulation of DTC advertisements.7 Following this public hearing and the

receipt of public comments, on August 12th, 1997 the FDA issued draft guidance for industry

with respect to DTC advertising.8 The intended purpose of this guidance was to “enable product


       6
           Section 202.1(e)(5)ii of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
       7
           See Department of Health and Human Services: Docket No. 95N-0227
       8
         See Department of Health and Human Services: Docket No. 97D-0302. It is
reasonably clear from the request for comments that the FDA was contemplating relaxed
disclosure requirements for the adequate provision elements of the regulations.

                                                10
sponsors to fulfill the requirements for consumer-directed broadcast advertisements, while

providing consumers with required risk information about the advertised product.” The

requirements for print disclosure did not change.

       While the new guidance surrounding broadcast advertising did not involve any formal

regulatory action, it did create a new relatively safe harbor for manufacturers with respect to how

FDA would interpret disclosure requirements. The 1997 FDA draft guidance continued to

require manufacturers to include in all broadcast advertisements a major statement of the most

important risks. The guidance suggested that manufactures could meet the requirement of

providing detailed FDA prescribing information through toll-free telephone numbers, web sites,

and references to labeling information in print advertisements appearing concurrently. The draft

guidance required that broadcast advertisements should also indicate that health care

professionals can provide additional information.9

       Many observers believe the 1997 FDA regulatory change led to a sharp increase in DTC

broadcast advertisements. The pharmaceutical industry’s spending on DTC advertising tripled

between 1996 and 2000, increasing from $791 million to almost $2.5 billion (Rosenthal et al.

2002). Even more dramatically, the industry’s spending on television advertising increased more

than seven-fold, from $220 million to about $1.6 billion. Rosenthal et al. (2002) note that the

initial surge in DTC advertising preceded the FDA’s release of draft guidelines in 1997, and

suggest that these guidelines may not have been the most important reason for the overall

increase. However, the FDA had announced a review of its approach in 1995 and some sort of

reform was generally anticipated. Hence, it is perhaps not surprising that expenditures began to

        The 1997 draft guidance was amended slightly in 1999.

                                                11
increase even before the more official notification in 1997 of the change in regulatory approach.

       Further regulatory changes may be in the air, but it is not clear in which direction the

regulatory winds are blowing. In 2003, the FDA reviewed its regulatory approach to DTC

advertising. The FDA review process included a request for comments from federal agencies,

corporations and lobbying groups with an interest in DTC regulatory matters. The FTC’s written

comments in response to this request suggested that the FDA should drop its requirement that

pharmaceutical print advertisements include detailed drug side-effects listings, in favor of

allowing the same kind of "brief summary" risk warnings in print advertisements that are now

used in broadcast commercials. More generally, the FTC urged the FDA not to impede DTC

pharmaceutical advertising. In 2004, the FDA issued draft guidance suggesting that a briefer

print disclosure can be appropriate, but no final rule has been issued and it is unclear if the draft

guidance provides a safe harbor for firms to use abbreviated disclosures.

III. Data

       We use two main sources of data on DTC advertising of nine smoking cessation

products: Nicorette Gum; Nicoderm CQ Patch; Habitrol Patch; ProStep Patch; Nicotrol Patch;

Nicotrol Inhaler; Zyban (buproprion); and Commit (nicotine lozenge). First, we use data on

advertising expenditures by product category, for both print and broadcast media. We use the

“Media Intelligence” advertising expenditure data from Competitive Media Reporting [CMR].

The series runs from 1986 - 2002. The Consumer Price Index is used to express the expenditure

data in constant 2002 dollars.

       The second main source of data is an archive of pharmaceutical product DTC

advertisements in the print media. The Smoking Cessation Advertisements (SCADS) Archive


                                                  12
includes all advertisements for smoking cessation products that appeared in any issue of 26

consumer magazines and two medical journals between January 1985 and May 2002, yielding a

sample of 13,497 issues. The data measure each advertisement’s brand, the length of

advertisement in standardized pages, and the data of the issue of each magazine in which it

appears. The SCADS Archive is discussed in more detail in the Data Appendix.

        Figure 2 shows trends in total expenditures on smoking cessation product advertisements

from 1986 to 2002. Advertising expenditures are fairly low from 1986 through 1991, after

which advertising expenditures spiked up to about $100 million, driven by the introduction and

intensive marketing of the first nicotine patches. After returning to lower levels, beginning

around 1995 advertising expenditures increase again. The 1996-1999 spike roughly coincides

with the relaxation of FDA regulations on DTC advertising in broadcast media; however it also

coincides with the introduction of new products (nicotine nasal spray, nicotine inhaler, and

buproprion), and the conversion of older products from prescription-only to OTC status. Total

advertising expenditures hit about $200 million at their peak in 1999. It is also notable that after

1995 the composition of expenditures shifted dramatically towards television. In 1992, print

media advertisements account for about 80 percent of total expenditures, while broadcast media

account for only 20 percent. In 1999, broadcast media advertisements account for about 90

percent of total expenditures. However, advertising in both broadcast and print media initially

increase after 1995. In the last few years of our study period, expenditures on both print and

television advertising fall.

        Figure 3 compares total advertising expenditures for the smoking cessation products with

the number of pages advertisements for each product that appear in our archive. In addition to


                                                 13
helping document the trends, Figure 2 shows that there is a very strong relationship between total

advertising expenditures and the SCADS advertising data. The first peaks in both series occur in

1992 around the introduction of the nicotine patch, with about 400 pages of archived print

advertisements for smoking cessation products. As with expenditures, the number of pages

increases again from 1995 - 1999, peaking at about 200 pages in 1997 and 1998. In some years

during the 1980s, our archive contains print advertisements for smoking cessation products even

though the CMR data show zero print media advertising expenditures. This appears to be an

artifact of the CMR data, where small levels of expenditures are either missed or collapsed into a

non-itemized category. At the very end of our study period, the CMR data show substantial

expenditures in 2002 on print media advertisements of the newly-introduced Commit nicotine

lozenge. However, the SCADS archive ends in May 2002, before the October 2002 launch of

Commit. For most of the period and most of the products, the SCADS archive appears to be

representative of the universe of all smoking cessation product advertisements in magazines.

        Table 2 provides an overview of how the advertisements in the SCADS archive are

distributed across the consumer and medical magazines, and across prescription versus OTC

products. About three quarters of the slightly more than 1000 advertisements for smoking

cessation products appear in the 26 consumer magazines, while the two medical journals account

for the other quarter of all advertisements. About three quarters of the advertisements are for

prescription products, with about twice as many of these advertisements appearing in the

consumer magazines than in the medical journals. Even afer products are available OTC they

are still advertised in the medical journals, but it is clear that the advertising effort shifts more

towards the consumer magazines. It should be kept in mind that while there are more


                                                   14
advertisements for prescription products than for OTC products, for much of our sample period

there were also more prescription products on the market.

IV. Econometric Model of Advertising and Hypotheses to be Tested

       In this section we develop an econometric model to estimate the impact of the regulatory

environment and other market-level forces on the advertising of smoking cessation products. The

model and hypotheses to be tested are based on a profit-maximizing framework. We follow a

standard approach and assume that a firm in an oligopolistic or monopolistically competitive

industry advertises to invest in a stock of consumer knowledge (Roberts and Samuelson 1988,

Chintagunta and Vilcassim 1994, Lee 2002, Bhattacharya and Vogt 2003). For smoking

cessation products, advertising may increase consumer demand both by informing consumers

about the health benefits of smoking cessation, and by informing consumers about the

availability and efficacy of the advertised product. Advertising thus increases the firm’s total

revenues by increasing consumer demand for its product. As Berndt et al. (1995) note, for

pharmaceutical products marginal production costs are low, so shifting out consumer demand is

essentially the same as increasing profits.

       The first order conditions for profit maximization, which require that the marginal

revenues from advertising are set equal to the marginal costs of advertising, implicitly define the

firm’s input demand function for advertising. This motivates the specification of our

econometric model given by equation (1), which can be thought of as a version of an input

demand function, where advertising demand depends on the costs of advertising and the market

environment:

(1)    Advertising p(m)t = "o + "1 OTC Status pt + "2 (OTC Statuspt ) * (JAMA) + "3 (OTC


                                                15
       Statuspt )* (NEJM) + "4 Introductory Period pt + $ Year Dummies + ( Month Dummies

        + * Magazine Dummies + . Product Dummies + epmt




       We estimate equation (1) using different measures of advertising as the dependent

variable: expenditures on print media advertisements for product p in month m; expenditures on

television advertisements for product p in month t; the number of print media advertisements for

product p in magazine m during month t; and the number of pages of print media advertisements

for product p in magazine m during month t.10 Our approach to understand the economic

determinants of smoking cessation product advertising exploits variation in the costs of

advertising over time and across products created by the regulatory environment. Equation (1)

also includes sets of dummy variables for year, month, and product. When the dependent

variables are the number and pages of magazine advertisements, the models also include a set of

magazine dummies; the dummies for the two medical journals – the Journal of the American

Medical Association (JAMA) and the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) – are also

interacted with the measure of OTC status. The various dummies are included to capture other

important aspects of the market environment and the costs of advertising.11 Table 3 provides the


       10
         Our unit of observation is chosen to be the number of advertisements or pages per
month because some of the magazines in our sample are monthly magazines. For those
magazines that are weekly we add the value of the dependent variable across the 4 (or 5) weekly
issues that have that month on the date of the publication.
       11
         The year dummies capture general time trends as well as the degree of competition in
the market for smoking cessation products; below, we further explore the role of competition in
equation (2) by replacing the set of year dummies with a specific parameterization of the effect
of time. In equation (1), the magazine dummies capture the price of advertising space as well as

                                               16
means of the dependent and independent variables.

       We hypothesize that the marketing status of the product (prescription versus OTC) will

be an important factor in a firm’s decision to advertise. In our empirical models, we capture this

aspect of the regulatory environment by the variable OTC Status pt.. This variable indicates if

product p at time t is available over-the-counter. OTC status is hypothesized to generate a

number of influences, most of which will tend to increase advertising. First, we expect an own-

price effect: the removal of disclosure requirements lowers the costs of advertisements and thus

increases firms’ demand for advertising. Second, by eliminating the need to see a physician,

OTC status lowers the full costs consumers face to obtain smoking cessation products, which can

be expected to increase consumer demand, thus increasing the returns to advertising.12 Third,

OTC status may make advertising more effective: because firms are no longer required to

disclose side effects so prominently, consumers may be more likely to respond to

advertisements. A change to OTC status may also work in the other direction and cause certain

types of advertising to decrease. A cross-price effect might tend to decrease magazine

advertising: because OTC status decreases the relative cost of television advertising, firms may




other aspects of a particular magazine such as total circulation and readership demographics.
       12
         Because of health insurance, in principle the switch to OTC can have ambiguous effects
on the return to advertising. Insured consumers may actually see lower out-of-pocket costs when
the drug is available by prescription only. Moreover, health insurance coverage will tend to
make demand more price inelastic, increasing manufacturers’ expected returns on advertising
(Danzon and Pauly 2002, pp. 608-609). For some drugs, therefore, a switch to OTC status may
reduce demand and make demand more price elastic, thus reducing the returns to advertising.
However, health insurance coverage of prescription drugs for smoking cessation was uncommon
for most of the period we study (McPhillips-Tangum 1998, National Center for Health Statistics
2001), and empirical evidence suggests that the switch of these drugs to OTC status shifted the
demand curve out (Keeler et al. 2002).

                                                17
substitute away from magazine advertising into television. Finally, we expect that OTC status

reduces the returns to advertising targeted at physicians, so in the models of the number and

pages of magazine advertisements we include interactions with the dummy variables for the two

medical journals (JAMA and NEJM).

       The FDA also influences the market for smoking cessation advertising through its initial

approval to allow new products on the market. Equation (1) includes a variable Introductory

Period pt, which is defined as the six month period following approval. This allows us to test

Bhattacharya and Vogt’s (2003) theoretical prediction that pharmaceutical advertising levels are

set high early in the product’s life cycle to build public knowledge about the product.

       To further explore the economic determinants of advertising choices, we re-specify

equation (1) by replacing the set of year dummies with a specific parameterization of the effect

of time:

(2)    Advertising pmt = "o + "1 OTC Status pt + "2 (OTC Statuspt ) * (JAMA) + "3 (OTC Statuspt

       )* (NEJM) + "4 Introductory Period pt + $1 Number of products on markett + $2

       (Number of products on markett )2 + $3 Post 1997 Regulations + $4 (Rx Statuspt ) * (Post

       1997 Regulations) + ( Month Dummies + * Magazine Dummies + . Product Dummies

       + epmt



       To capture the potential impact of brand competition on the returns to advertising,

equation (2) includes the number of smoking cessation products on the market at time t, and the

square of this measure.   This allows us to test the conventional wisdom about the relationship

between competition and advertising – “the so-called inverted U hypothesis, which implies that


                                                18
moderately concentrated industries engage more intensively in advertising than both

atomistically competitive and highly concentrated industries.” (Lee 2002, pp. 89 - 90). In other

contexts, the measures of the market environment might be endogenous to advertising levels, but

this does not seem likely in the market for smoking cessation products. An incumbent’s

advertising might discourage entry (Schmalensee 1983), reducing the number of products on the

market. Scott Morton’s (2000) empirical analysis suggests that brand advertising is not a barrier

to entry by generic firms into the U.S. pharmaceutical market. Over most of the period we study,

entry into the market for smoking cessation products did not involve generics but instead

involved the introduction of new branded products. Introduction of these products was the last

step of a long process of development and testing begun long before current advertising could be

known. The exact timing of FDA approval is also not a choice variable of the firm. For this

reasons, we believe it is appropriate to treat the measures of the market environment as

exogenous to current advertising choices.

        Equation (2) also introduces another regulatory variable, Post 1997t , which indicates if

the observed advertisement occurs after the FDA 1997 regulatory change for broadcast

advertising. By lowering the cost of broadcast advertising, we predict own-price effects that will

increase the demand for television advertising and possible cross-price effects to reduce demand

for magazine advertising. Because the 1997 regulatory change applied to prescription products,

Post 1997t is interacted with an indicator variable for whether the product is available only by

prescription at time t.

        To estimate our models of advertising expenditures, we use a sample of 998 observations

of the advertising expenditures for each product in each month it was on the market from


                                                19
January 1985 to December 2002. The models are estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS).

We also estimate a two part model, where the first part is a probit model of the probability that

advertising expenditures were positive, and the second part is an OLS model of the log of

expenditures for the sub-sample with positive expenditures. When we estimate models of

magazine advertisements, our sample consists of the number (pages) of advertisements that

appear in each SCADS magazine in each month a product was on the market from January 1985

to May 2002. Our SCADS sample consists of 25,021 observations. We estimate the models of

the number and pages of magazine advertisements by OLS.13

V. Results

       Tables 4 and 5 present estimates of equations (1) and (2) for our models of advertising

expenditures; Table 6 presents estimates of equations (1) and (2) for our models of the number

and pages of magazine advertisements. The results suggest that a firm’s decision to advertise is

significantly affected by FDA regulation of whether a product is available by prescription-only

or OTC. OTC status is associated with an increase in expenditures for advertising in both

magazines and television. For magazine advertising, the two-part model results suggest that


       13
         The dependent variables for these models are counts of the number of advertisements
and the number of pages of advertisements. The Poisson model, an extension of the regression
model that is appropriate when the dependent variable is a count rather than a continuous
variable, relies on restrictive assumptions that are problematic for our data. For example, about
98 percent of the observations of the number of advertisements take the value of zero, while the
nonzero values range from 1 to 10. This suggests there may be “excess zeros” and/or
“overdispersion” (Mullahy 1997, Wooldridge 2002). Wooldridge (2002, p. 651) cautions that
“In the case of overdispersion, the standard errors [on the coefficients from the standard Poisson
model] ... will systematically underestimate the asymptotic standard deviations, sometimes by a
large factor.” We therefore adopt OLS as a more conservative approach. We have also
collapsed the dependent variables to 0-1 measures of any advertisements or any pages. Probit
models using these variables yield similar results to the OLS models reported; the probit results
are available upon request.

                                                20
most of the effect is through the probability of any expenditures rather than on the amount of

expenditures conditional on positive advertising. For television advertising, OTC status is

associated with an increase in both parts of the expenditures model. In Table 6, OTC status is

also associated with an increase in the number of magazine advertisements and an increase in the

pages of advertisements, although the latter effect is not quite statistically significant when the

year dummies are replaced with the parameterized time trend. Not surprisingly, when a product

becomes available OTC, manufacturers reduce the number and pages of advertisements for that

product in the two medical journals (JAMA and NEJM).

       Because OTC magazine advertisements no longer include the full page of disclosures, it

would have been possible for manufactures to increase the number of advertisements while

holding constant or even decreasing total expenditures and the pages of advertisements. The fact

that total expenditures and the number of pages of advertisements instead actually increase

suggest that advertising demand is quite responsive to the own-price effects and other influences

created by OTC status.

       To shed more light on the practical significance of the OTC effect, we can use our

models to predict the amount of magazine advertising under two hypothetical policy regimes.

The first, admittedly radical, simulated policy change assumes that the FDA allowed all products

to be immediately sold OTC rather than by prescription only. This would result in an

approximate tripling of the number of observations of OTC products in our sample. Our model

predicts that this change would increase the number of advertisements for smoking cessation

products by 80 percent, from 1069 to 1921 total advertisements. Our second simulation

considers a much more modest change. Suppose that, for each product currently sold OTC, the


                                                 21
FDA approved it for OTC sale exactly one year before the actual approval date. This

hypothetical policy change would increase the number of observations of OTC products by about

twenty percent. According to our model, this change would increase the number of magazine

advertisements by a little less than nine percent, from 1069 to 1160 advertisements.

       Our results also show that the FDA’s decisions to approve new products affects

advertising in two ways: through initial advertising during the introductory period; and through

effects on market competition. All of the models reported in Tables 4, 5 and 6 show a large

introduction effect. Consistent with the prediction of Bhattacharya and Vogt (2003), advertising

is much higher during the 6 month introductory period. We also find that when a product vies

against more competing products, firms advertise more, but the increase in advertising associated

with each additional competitor falls as more products come onto the market. This result fits the

inverted-U hypothesis. During the period under study, the market for smoking cessation

products evolved from a highly concentrated industry (when nicotine gum was the only approved

pharmaceutical product on the market) into a less concentrated industry. The estimated

coefficients from our model imply that the maximum amount of advertising occurs with about

four to five products on the market, a level of competition reached around the time several

different manufacturers introduced the nicotine patch in 1991 - 1992. Although the introduction

effect and the competition effect are affected by FDA regulatory decisions, it is hard to develop

reasonable counter-factuals for policy simulations. That is, earlier or later FDA approval would

change the timing of the introduction effect and the date when advertising is maximized, but

would not necessarily change the total advertising over the entire period.

       Results in Table 5 show that the 1997 regulatory change increased expenditures on


                                                22
television advertising of prescription smoking cessation products. Because the 1997 regulatory

change made it much easier to advertise on television, this pattern is expected and is consistent

with other research (Rosenthal et al. 2002). However, the results in Tables 4 and 6 do not

provide consistent evidence of a strong impact of the 1997 regulatory change on the demand for

magazine advertising. This may not be that surprising because the current regulatory

environment tends to induce a complementarity between the two forms of advertising. Some

types of advertisements for prescription products on television must refer the customer to a print

advertisement – where the full disclosure continues to be required.

       Although not reported in the Tables, we also estimated equation (1) parameter vectors $,

(, * and . corresponding to the vectors of year, month, magazine, and product dummy variables.

An interesting pattern from these estimates is that advertising is highest in January and

November. This pattern suggest that the manufacturers of smoking cessation products may

perceive greater returns to advertising in months when smokers are pre-disposed to quit because

of New Year’s resolutions and the Great American Smokeout. There also seems to be evidence

of ‘summer doldrums,’ with less advertising of the products in June, July and August.

VII. Conclusion

       Our results provide strong evidence that a switch to OTC status is associated with

increased advertising of smoking cessation products. This evidence sheds new light on the

FTC’s December 2003 recommendation that the FDA should change its disclosure requirements

for pharmaceutical print advertisements. If the FDA adopts this recommendation, requirements

for all DTC advertisements of prescription pharmaceuticals would be similar to current

requirements for advertisements of OTC products. Our results suggest the new regulatory stance


                                                23
could substantially increase DTC advertising of pharmaceuticals.

       Of course, there are different views of whether more DTC advertising of pharmaceuticals

will improve consumer welfare. The general debate on DTC advertising is beyond the scope of

this paper. However, it should be noted that standard objections to DTC advertising do not seem

to carry as much weight in the context of smoking cessation products. For example, a common

concern is that patients may incorrectly self-diagnose and pressure physicians for inappropriate

prescriptions for non-existent conditions. Such a situation seems unlikely for smokers.14 The

wide availability of nicotine replacement products in the late 1990s has been credited with

producing “the largest increase in smoking cessation since the 1964 Surgeon General’s report on

smoking.” (Hughes 2000, p. 147). Because de-regulating the advertising of smoking cessation

products is likely to help more smokers quit, such a regulatory change can also improve public

health. In on-going work, we are exploring whether advertising of smoking cessation products

translates into more ex-smokers. The results of our on-going research will allow us to quantify

the public health benefits of changes to the FDA’s DTC advertising regulations.




       14
        There is some concern that non-smokers will use nicotine replacement products.
Because virtually all of the adverse health consequences of smoking are due to the inhaled
smoke, and not the nicotine per se, it is not clear that this small potential cost of advertising
smoking cessation products could outweigh the benefits of increased cessation.

In constructing the sample of magazines in SCADS, we faced a tradeoff between the benefits of
wider coverage and the costs of data collection. To select the sample of magazines we used data
from the 1998 National Consumer Survey of the Simmons Survey of Media and Markets:
Choices II (NCS). These data contain self-reported information on readership of 172 magazines
for approximately 20,000 consumers. Using these data, we defined groups based on
demographic characteristics (race, education, income, age, gender, smoking status). We then
chose the ten magazines most frequently read by members of each group. Because of substantial
overlap in the set of magazines most frequently read by different groups, our final sample of
magazines includes 26 consumer magazines. In the three cases in which we could not locate
copies of all magazines in our sample period (1985-2002) we substituted the magazine that was
the next most widely read magazine for the group in question. Based on the NCS data, we
calculate that readership of the SCADS sample of 26 magazines accounts for 57.5 percent of the
readership of the NCS total sample of 172 magazines. From a source independent of the NCS,
we also obtained data on the circulation of 148 of those magazines. The circulation of the 26
magazines in the SCADS sample accounts for 60.7 percent of the total circulation of the 148
magazines. While there are some magazines not included in either the NCS sample or the
circulation data, the missing magazines are not widely read; for example, only 0.001 of the NCS
respondents read the 172nd ranked magazine in that sample. Thus, two independent calculations
suggest that the SCADS sample accounts for almost sixty percent of all U.S. magazines by
readership or circulation.

The advertising data archive includes digitally extracted images of all advertisements for
smoking products, smoking cessation products, pharmaceutical products, and health-related
public service announcements in 28 of the top read magazines in the U.S. for the period January

consumer market and two publications focus primarily on physicians.
