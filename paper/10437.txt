                                      ABSTRACT


The paper examines price discounting by health maintenance organizations and preferred provider

organizations in markets for hospital services. Our empirical analysis focuses on transaction prices

for angioplasty, which is a relatively common procedure, with well defined 'product' characteristics.

After controlling for patient and procedure heterogeneity and market power we find that on average

prices for PPOs are 8% lower than fee-for-service plans, followed by point-of-service HMOs who

capture a 24% discount. Our results are in general agreement with earlier work that shows that

managed care discounts are 'real', after accounting for process of care.

Introduction

        It is generally assumed that managed care has been successful at lowering prices, but the

implications have been a matter of debate. Critics have argued that managed care organizations

attain savings by reducing intensity of services, while others have argued that savings are ‘real’

and are a consequence of discounts per unit of care, rather than a consequence of reduced

intensity. Examining treatment episodes for acute myocardial infarctions, i.e., heart attacks,

Cutler, McClellan and Newhouse (2000) suggest that discounts are attained by managed care

plans without sacrificing intensity. They pose the question, “does managed care achieve discounts

through reduced intensity?” We rephrase the question as “does managed care achieve discounts

even after accounting for product heterogeneity?” To address this we utilize a unique claims

database that contains relatively rich detail on both sources of payment and on the process of care

for hospital procedures. The specific procedure we focus on is angioplasty, which is suitable for

empirical research because it is a well-defined and relatively common cardiac procedure.

        Our study complements Cutler et al. in one other important dimension: their study

examined differences between managed care options within a single large HMO, whereas we

focus on differences between various insurers and employers. After accounting for market forces,

casemix and product heterogeneity, we find a high degree of residual discounting by managed

care. Thus, despite the different frameworks the results in the two studies are in general

agreement.

        Our data enable us to observe transaction prices, i.e., actual payments borne by the payer

and received by the hospital, rather than charges, i.e. gross prices that do not reflect price caps or

discounts applied differently to various payers. Previously Brooks, Dor, and Wong (1997) have

shown that managed care has lead to discounts in the case of another procedure, appendectomy.

While we do not wish to err on the side of picking a procedure that is too complex to be

adequately controlled for in a regression, the example of appendectomy may be too narrowly

defined for a model designed to show how price discounts can persist when accounting for


                                                                                                     1
differences in the type of care delivered. Moreover, by using a more updated file, we are able to

examine discounting by gradation of managed care, based on choices available in the self-insured

firms that make up the data file. These choices, as defined in our data are, discussed in Section 2.

Section 3 presents the analytical framework for estimating the price equation; Section 4 describes

our main database and supplementary files; Section 5 presents descriptive information on price

differences by gradations of managed care; Section 6 presents regression results and the degree of

discounting achieved by managed care. Implications are given in the concluding section.



Forms of Managed Care

        For at least two decades, managed care enrollment has been growing rapidly. While only

one quarter of the privately insured population enrolled in some form of managed care, the

majority of this population is enrolled in managed care today. However, even within managed

care there are substantial differences between the major types of plans, and their relative market

shares have been changing over time. Thus, the relative market share of more traditional ‘closed-

form’ HMOs is beginning to level off, whereas the shares of ‘open-form’ HMOs, Preferred

Provider Organizations (PPOs) and other forms of hybrid managed care and fee-for-service are

rising. According to recent data from the Health Insurance Association of America (2002),

between 1994 and 1997, the market share of fee-for-service plans for private insurance coverage

fell from 32.8 percent to 21.2 percent, while the share of PPOs grew from 44.8 percent to 47.3

percent, and the share of most recent entrant to the managed care arena, namely point-of-service

HMOs more than doubled, rising from 1.8 percent to a 4.8 percent market share. During the same

period, traditional HMOs rose from 22.5 percent to 26.9 percent; however, these figures mask the

fact that many of these HMOs were beginning to adopt open market incentives as well. Below,

we briefly review the definitions of the major forms of insurance.

        The two forms of fee-for-service insurance are ‘comprehensive’ and Major Medical

plans. Under comprehensive insurance, patients can opt for any provider of their choosing, with


                                                                                                     2
the insurer essentially paying full cost up to some outlier limit. Major Medical insurance is based

on the same payment methodology and consumer choice as comprehensive fee-for-service, but

restricts benefits to major medical and surgical procedures. PPOs are essentially fee-for-service

plans, but with discounted fees and some limitation on choices available to consumers. Choices

are limited to listings of providers who make up the PPO’s network. Consumers retain an option

to go outside of the network, but incur higher copayments and deductibles in addition to higher

fees if they opt to do so.

        In closed-form HMOs, physicians can only serve patients who are enrolled in the plan.

Physicians in closed form HMOs are either salaried contract employees of the HMO (staff model)

or contract workers (group model). In open HMOs, also referred to as independent practice

associations or network HMOs, physicians and hospitals may have contracts with several HMOs

and may see private fee for service patients as well. For the most part, contractual arrangements

with hospitals in closed HMOs mirror those of open HMOs, although the largest closed HMO,

Kaiser Permanente does own hospitals outright in a few localities across the country. While both

forms of HMOs differ in terms of how they contract with providers, both are predicated on the

same consumer-insurer relationship, whereby premiums are essentially prepayment for any

medical care needed with little or no cost sharing for patients, and no out-of-plan choice.

        More recently, hybrid forms of managed care have emerged, combining features of

HMOs with features of PPOs or fee-for service plans. The hybrid forms include Point of Service

(POS) HMOs and Exclusive Provider Organizations (EPO). POS-HMOs resemble traditional

HMOs as long as consumers stay within the network: cost-sharing by patients is minimal, but the

ability to choose among providers is also minimal; in addition patients are assigned a

‘gatekeeper’, usually a family physician or nurse case manager, and are not able to access

specialists directly without the gatekeeper’s referral. However, like PPOs, POS-HMOs give their

members the option of choosing physicians and hospitals outside the network, in exchange for

higher out-of-pocket participation. Thus, while PPOs and POS-HMOs are different within-


                                                                                                    3
network, they resemble each other when consumers opt to go outside of the network. Finally,

like PPOS, EPOs negotiate discounted fees with network providers, but they provide no coverage

for services rendered outside of the network. Prices for services provided by hospitals within PPO

networks are typically set separately for every major procedure. For POS of service HMOs there

are numerous permutations for price setting mechanisms, which may include pricing by

procedure or by episode (Anders, 1996, Kongstvedt, 2002).



Analytical Framework

Transaction Prices for PTCA.

        Angioplasty, named more fully Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty

(PTCA) is a procedure intended to treat ischemic coronary artery disease. More than 530,000

PTCA procedures were performed in 1997 nationwide, with estimated charges exceeding $20

billion1. This procedure involves the introduction of a thin flexible, hollow catheter into an artery

in the groin. The catheter is advanced through the blood vessel to the heart. A special balloon tip

on the catheter allows the physician to open a diseased (occluded) coronary artery by inflating the

balloon and dilating the diseased vessel. First introduced in 1977, the PTCA procedure evolved

from balloon angioplasty to the insertion of stents, to avoid narrowing of the arteries after the

patient. In the period observed (1995-1996) about 40 percent of all angioplasties were done in

combination with stents (see Table 1).

        The MareketScan database reports actual payments received by the hospital, as opposed

to charges, which do not reflect discounts and caps negotiated by insurers. We label the payments

received transaction prices. Another important dimension of price in our analysis is that it is

reported for the “principal procedure” designation of angioplasty. The reason for reporting

medical prices this way is summarized in the earlier study by Cutler et al:

“…what is the good we are pricing? There are literally thousands of individual services that a
heart attack patient can receive –specific tests, units of blood, operating room time, etc.,
Disaggregating to the individual level does not seem the most appropriate way to proceed,


                                                                                                      4
however. It seems more natural to think of the good as “bypass surgery and its related services”
or “angioplasty and its related services”, since this is the type of good which individuals or
physicians acting as their agents decide to purchase…”

        By focusing on angioplasty as the principal procedure, we adhere to their approach.

However, we are also able to exploit the data further, and account for product heterogeneity. This

is further described in the data section2.

Model Specification

        Because of the wide dispersion in prices, price equations were expressed in log-linear

form (Brendt 1991). In previous work Brooks, Dor, Wong (1997) derived a specific functional

form for the price equation in a similar insurer-provider setting. By assuming a Nash-Bargaining

game, their specification imposes the restriction that products, i.e., medical procedures, are

homogeneous3. While the homogeneity assumption is innocuous in their example of

appendectomy, a fairly simple and uniform procedure, it is too restrictive for our current example

of heart surgery. For this reason, we adopt the more flexible hedonic price approach in our

empirical framework. Accordingly, an end product can be viewed as a summation of product

attributes. Each of these attributes is valued and therefore adds it’s own unique weight to the final

price, which can be retrieved directly from a linear regression (Brendt 1991; Grossman and

Goldman 1978). Thus we include various technical features of angioplasty in the price

regressions. In addition we borrow from Brooks et al. by incorporating available measure of

relative bargaining power for insurers and hospital markets, i.e. their respective market structures.

The general specification of the pricing equation can be summarized as follows:

   lnPrice = f(product heterogeneity; casemix; hospital characteristics; insurance characteristics;
                 market structure)

The vector “product heterogeneity” refers to variations in the way angioplasty is done, which are

observed at the patient level; casemix is a summary measure for the overall severity of patients in

the hospital admitted for this procedure. The vector “insurance” refers to the type of insurance

plan, as reported in our data; “hospital” refers to hospital characteristics that are related to a



                                                                                                     5
hospital’s bargaining position such as teaching status and form of ownership (for profit, non-

profit); market structure measures are for the two principal industries, namely health insurance

and hospitals, thereby reflecting relative bargaining power.

           The measure of the hospital’s casemix or severity (for angioplasty patients) will be based

on its expected mortality rate. In an alternative specification we include the standardized

mortality ratio (SMR), i.e. the ratio of the actual rate to the expected rate, which is taken as an

adverse measure of the hospital’s clinical performance. We generally expect the expected

mortality rate to be positively associated with prices, since higher casemix hospitals require

additional compensation, and we expect the standardized mortality rate to be negatively

associated with prices, since hospitals with adverse outcomes are less able to bargain for higher

prices.

           Note that we are not interested in assessing the validity of such measures, which has been

a matter of some debate (e.g., Thomas and Hopper 1999, McClellan and Staiger 1999a, 1999b).

Rather, our interest lies in replicating or, at least, approximating information available to large

purchasers during the period studied (1995-1996), and assessing the effect of this measure on the

pricing decision. The algorithm most widely accepted during that period simply adjusts for age,

gender, and the presence of major associated illnesses or comorbidities (Rosenthal 1997;

Krakauer et al. 1992; HCFA 1993) 4. Many localities, state data agencies, local hospital

associations, business coalitions, and the like replicated this method for specific procedures such

PTCA. 5 As a measure of the best available information, we reconstruct expected and

standardized mortality rates using this specification. Further details are provided in the next

section.




                                                                                                      6
Data and Variables

  Overview:

        The analysis of hospital pricing data for PTCA procedures in the MarketScan® database

was performed using data elements from multiple sources. The final analysis aimed at assessing

the association between participation in a managed care program and hospital pricing used a

number of data elements originating from the MarketScan® database. The final analysis also

incorporated hospital characteristics (teaching status; ownership data; and market share) from the

American Hospital Association (AHA) database, as well as managed care penetration rates, as

retrieved from the Area Resource File. Hospital-specific expected 30-day mortality for PTCA

admissions were derived from Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files (MEDPAR).

    Main Analysis File: MarketScan

        The main analysis file we use is drawn from the MarketScan file, a claims database

drawn from approximately 80 large self-insured employers. Maintaining their confidentiality was

a precondition for contributing data to MarketScan. Therefore individual records were stripped of

the identity of the employer.6 For purposes of this research, we obtained data for all hospital

admissions for which angioplasty was the primary procedure in 1995 and 1996. After excluding

outliers (upper 99th and lower 1st percentiles of the hospital payments), this resulted in a combined

raw sample size of 4,916 individual hospitalizations. Prior to 1995, the form of insurance plan

was not reported in the data. As of 1995, detailed fields for managed care were added. These

plans include comprehensive insurance, major medical, preferred provider organization (PPO),

and three forms of Health Maintenance Organizations, namely staff/group model HMOs, point-

of-service (POS) HMOs and exclusive provider organizations (EPOs). There were no cases of

staff or group HMOs in the data, which is not surprising given that self-insured firms are not

likely to provide medical services internally. There were only 18 cases of EPOs in the combined




                                                                                                   7
analysis file; for purposes of analysis these were combined with their closest managed care kin,

namely PPOs.

        While hospital-based discharge data tend to report “charges” in lieu of payments, the

MarketScan data, which are drawn from insurance-based claims reports only “net payments”.

Charges are akin to list prices, prior to any insurer discounting, and thus may not necessarily

reflect what the insurer actually paid. Net payments are the amount the hospital actually got paid,

and are thus the actual transaction prices of interest to us. However, we are also able to exploit

the data further, and account for product heterogeneity. A number of variables are used. Among

these are binary indicators for number of vessels and stents, thrombolytic infusion (an anti-

clotting devise), and number of comorbidities. In addition we include a binary indicator that

distinguishes between urgent and non-urgent (elective) procedures. In non-urgent cases there is

some flexibility for patients and their physicians in terms of scheduling angioplasty, so we expect

prices of urgent procedures to be higher.7 Summary statistics are presented in Table 1.

  Supplementary Data Sources

        The data from MarketScan were augmented with variables describing market structure, at

the level of the Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Herfindahl index for hospital markets was

constructed from the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Surveys for 1995 and 1994,

and merged with the MarketScan data with a one-year lag.8 Hospital market shares that make up

the main component of this index were calculated from the number of total admissions. Other

hospital characteristics that might be related to bargaining position were also taken from the AHA

files. These are teaching status, i.e., binary indicators for no teaching, minor teaching, or major

teaching, and type of ownership, i.e., government, for-profit, and non-profit. In the MarketScan

file a matching AHA ID was found missing for 530 cases, resulting in a final sample size of 4,386

for the price regressions. These mapped out to 452 hospitals and 146 metropolitan statistical

areas. 9 Compared with all AHA hospitals with some capacity to perform angioplasties and/or

cardiac catheterizations, MarketScan hospitals in our analysis file were somewhat more tilted


                                                                                                      8
towards non-profit status, but virtually identical to AHA hospitals in their distribution by teaching

status. 10

         The insurance industry is relatively fragmented, and to date, detailed data on market

share by type of insurance have not been compiled. The Area Resource File provided a measure

of market segmentation, namely HMO penetration, or the percent of the adult population enrolled

in HMOs aggregated to the MSA. This variable also entered the sample with a one-year lag.

         Expected mortality rates and standardized mortality rates for the aggregate hospital were

taken from the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MEDPAR) files, using the HCFA risk-

adjustment method. We applied this method to two logistic regression panels centered on 1991

and 1992, thereby obtaining expected mortality rates for 30-day post-admission associated with

angioplasty.11 Expected and standardized mortality rates were merged, with equal lags, into the

1995 and 1996 MarketScan records by provider i.d. number. The observed and predicted

hospital-level mortality rates are approximately 5 percent.



Descriptive Results

         Mean transaction prices by type of insurance are reported in Table 2, along with standard

errors in parentheses, and sample sizes within each cell. There are two major categories, and four

subcategories, namely fee for service: which includes major medical and comprehensive

insurance, and managed care, which includes PPOs and point of service HMOs. The managed

care options were previously described. Major Medical insurance provides coverage for major

illnesses requiring large financial outlays, while excluding a variety of small procedures covered

by comprehensive plans.

         From these descriptive results, a number of interesting observations can be made:

Between 1995 and 1996 there was a sharp decline in the number of cases with fee-for-service

coverage, and a sharp increase in managed care in our data Apparently, many employers

switched from fee-for-service to managed care during this period observed. Thus in 1995 the


                                                                                                     9
combined managed care options accounted for 25 % of all cases, in 1996 their share rose to 46%.

Within the fee-for-service and managed care sectors, comprehensive coverage and PPO are

dominant. Major Medical in particular is disappearing from the marketplace, accounting for about

8% of all cases in 1995 but only 3% of cases in 1996.

        In 1995 mean prices in the major medical, fee-for-service, PPO, and the HMO categories

were virtually identical to each other, nearly $13,000, or about 8% below the fee-for-service

price. Between 1995 and 1996 there was a slight increase in the mean PPO price and a slight

decrease in the mean comprehensive fee-for-service price and HMO prices and an increase in

PPO prices. However the relative rankings remained the same in 1996, with comprehensive

prices highest, and HMO prices lowest, with a persistent differential of 8%, on average. Prices for

Major Medical insurance increased sharply between 1995 and 1996, but this may have been an

artifact of the small number of cases in the cell. Because prices in this group showed a wide

variation we decided not lump it with the comprehensive fee-for-service category. The regression

analysis below allows us to determine whether such price differentials persist after prices are

adjusting for various characteristics.

        It is also interesting to observe mean unadjusted prices by major classifications of the

procedure. As expected, prices for urgent procedures are substantially higher than prices for non-

urgent procedures in all classes of insurance. With the exception of the HMO category, prices for

the one vessel/with stent variation of the procedure are higher than prices for one vessel/no stent,

and prices for multiple-vessels/with stent are higher than prices for multiple-vessels/no stent

procedures.



Regression Results:

        Log-price regressions are presented in Table 3. Three variants of the specification are

reported in the table as models 1, 2, and 3. The variables are identical, except for the hospital

outcome measure used (expected PTCA mortality, standardized PTCA mortality). For the most


                                                                                                    10
part all other variables have similar effects across the specifications. Clinical descriptors of

angioplasty tend to have statistically significant effects on price, indicating that the more complex

the procedure, the higher the price. Stents are a more important determinant of price than number

of vessels (stent combinations add anywhere from 24 to 28 percent to price, whereas multiple

vessels alone add only 10%). Thrombolytic infusion adds about 35-37 percent to price depending

on the specification.12 Prices for urgent procedures are about 15-16 percent higher compared with

non-urgent procedures. The number of comorbidities, a measure of the underlying complexity of

the particular case, also adds to price significantly.

        The coefficients of hospital characteristics indicate teaching status was not significant.

This may be due to angioplasty having become a relatively routine procedure, making the

reputation of teaching hospitals carry less weight. Compared with prices in public hospitals,

prices at non-profit hospitals are significantly lower by about 13-14 percent; prices at for-profit

hospitals tend to be higher by about 13-15 percent, with moderately significant coefficients 13.

Variables that capture the structure of health care markets are generally significant with signs in

the expected direction. Thus the lagged Herfindahl index has a positive effect on price while the

lagged HMO penetration rate is negative. There was no statistical difference in prices between

1995 and 1996.

        The variables of main interest pertain to the form of insurance and managed care. All of

the related results were highly significant. Compared with fee-for-service, prices for PPOs were

lower by about 8 %, and prices for POS-HMOs were lower by about 24%. Prices for major

medical plans fell in between PPO and HMO discounted prices, but pertain to a relatively small

number of cases (see table 1), and are more likely to be the result of capping benefits rather than

discounting through negotiations with providers in a plan. Interestingly, discounts for managed

care are even larger after adjusting for the process of care than would appear from the unadjusted

means. Adding expected or standardized mortality rate to the model (specification 2 and 3) had a

negligible effect on all other coefficients. Although these variables have the expected sign


                                                                                                      11
(positive for expected rate and negative for the standardized rate) the results were not statistically

significant. These results are at least suggestive of the notion that information on hospital

performance is not fully reflected in the determination of the market price. However these results

should be interpreted with caution since the validity of these measures has been called into

question and purchasers may deliberately discount such information (McClellan and Staiger

1999b).



Discussion and Implications

          Anecdotes abound that managed care organizations attempt to lower their costs internally

by providing lower payments to providers. Our analysis suggests that these payments represent

discounts that persist even after adjusting for the underlying patient severity and the

characteristics of the medical procedure in a given case, for managed care plans offered by

employers. We further find that greater market concentration in hospitals tends to increase prices;

HMO penetration tends to reduce prices. Together these results are consistent with the

predictions of the bargaining model

          Our study complements an earlier related study by Cutler, McClellan and Newhouse

(2000) that focused on payments for heart attacks by type of insurance. Their analysis was

centered on one large firm that offered a menu of managed care and indemnity choices to its

employees. Our analysis incorporates a cross-section of many firms offering similar insurance

plans but with choices not known within the firm. Cutler et al. found that HMOs made lower

payments, after accounting for intensity of services as measured in terms of length of stay and

ancillary services provided. They were able to conclude that these payments were due to real

discounts on a per unit basis as high as 20 percent. Rather than focusing on the entire episode of

care, our analysis focused on transaction prices for a specific procedure. Thus, we were able to

rely on detailed information on variants of the procedure to obtain a price that is adjusted for

patient severity and intensity of service delivered. While there may have been residual difference


                                                                                                    12
in resources used between plans in our data, the price discounts we calculated tend to pertain to a

relatively homogeneous ‘product’. Even with different approaches to measurement, we find

strong agreement between our analysis and that of Cutler et al., namely that managed care

insurers are able to capture substantial discounts for a given level of service. Interestingly,

adjusting for service characteristics results in even greater managed care discounts than would

appear from the unadjusted means in the descriptive analysis.

        These results were not affected by the inclusion of hospital level performance measures

such as the HCFA (now CMS) expected mortality rate. These results are at least suggestive of the

notion that information on hospital performance is not fully reflected in the determination of the

market price; Indeed, during the mid 1990’s access to the CMS and other reporting systems was

relatively limited. However these results should be interpreted with caution since the validity of

these measures has been called into question, leading purchasers to deliberately discount such

information; Moreover, there have been calls for the Federal government to improve the

measurement and dissemination of quality information for hospital care on a national basis

(Corrigan, Eden, and Smith 2002). Future research should track the impact of new reporting

systems on pricing as they enter the market and become more diffused. As the structure of the

managed care industry has changed since the mid 1990’s future research should also examine

whether discounts by MCOs persist.

  Other studies focused on an “average” price for the aggregate hospital, calculated from total
revenue divided by the number of inpatient days or stays. For instance, Melnick et al. (1992) used
the average per diem rate for medical/surgical services. Melnick et al. (2000) calculate price for
each payer by dividing total revenues by adjusted discharges, given as the sum of actual inpatient
cases and weighted outpatient visits. A similar approach is used by Manheim et al. (1994).
Keeler et al. (1999) calculate net revenue per discharge by multiplying each patient's total charge
by the average discount factor for private patients at their hospital. Dranove and Ludwick, (1999)
caution that these methods provide approximations of actual prices, and are subject to
measurement error due to unobservable service mix differences. Transaction prices avoid this
pitfall, yet negotiations between hospitals and insurers often involve bundled prices, not
necessarily individual procedures. However, there is ample anecdotal evidence that hospitals have
been willing to grant procedure-specific discounts to HMOs in exchange for guaranteed referrals
(Hilzenrath, 1994). Other accounts cite examples of carve-out arrangements and price
negotiations between hospitals and insurers that pertain strictly to cardiac procedures such as
CABG and PTCA (Anders, 1996, Hilzenrath, 1994). We consider results from the different
approaches complimentary. Melnick et al. (1992) find similar effects of managed care
discounting in California.
3
 Under the Nash bargaining model, two agents (such as the hospital and the insurer in our
example) maximize some measure of their respective payoffs jointly. How the pie ends up being
split depends on their relative bargaining power. For a brief review of the properties of this
model in a health care setting see Dor and Watson, 1995.
4
  HCFA Risk adjusters for PTCA include age, gender, diabetes, and diagnosis groupings (based
on ICD9 codes) of heart attack, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular cancer, COPD, and
organ failure. Many state reporting systems also replicated this method for specific procedures
such as PTCA and heart surgeries. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) no
longer maintains hospital rankings based on mortality rates.
5
  Examples include the Health Quality Choice project in Northeast Ohio, the Pennsylvania Cost
Containment Commission Reports, and Greater NY Hospital Association ranking (see Aron et al.,
1998, Heller et al., 2001, for instance). The Quality Indicators assembled by the federal Agency
for HealthCare Quality and Research were made available for only one year, 1997, i.e., after our
study period, and for only 19 states, and thus did not apply to our sample.
6
  Health benefits in the U.S. remain heavily employer-based with about 60 percent of all insured
individuals being enrolled through employer-sponsored plans. Self-insurance by firms occurs
more frequently than is commonly perceived. In 1993, 40 percent of all employees who receive
employer-sponsored health insurance benefits were enrolled in self-insured plans. In large firms
of 500 or more employees the proportion of insured employees in a self-insured plan was even
higher, at 63 percent (Acs et al. 1996). By 1997, these self-insurance rates declined, but remained
fairly high at 33 percent and 55 percent respectively (Marquis and Long 1999).

  The Herfindahl index is defined as the sum of squared shares of admissions in the MSA. The
AHA survey has a code flagging hospitals able to perform angioplasty and/or cardiac
catheterization, but does not report number of admissions undergoing these procedures. For this
reason we opted to report the results based on the overall index. Using all admissions within a
hospital, the Herfindahl index for angioplasty hospitals increases from 0.14 to 0.25; In alternate
price regressions, both indices yielded qualitatively similar results, but the coefficients of the
procedure-based index were not statistically significant. The full set of results is available from
the authors upon request.
9
 The authors are grateful to Douglas Wholey for providing a mapping of ARF counties to MSAs
for purposes of the analysis. Also see Wholey et al., 1995.
10
   In the 1995, 1091 hospitals were flagged as having capacity to perform angioplasty and
catheterization. Of these, about 54.8% had major teaching status, while 24.8% were major
teaching hospitals. The distribution by ownership was 19.1% for public hospitals, 13% percent
for for-profit hospitals, and 67.9% for non-profit hospitals. See similar MarketScan distributions
in Table 1.
11
  Three-year panels were used to minimize estimation error in the calculation due to single year
fluctuations (Luft and Romano, 1993). While our intention was to adhere to the most widely
known and accepted methodology, we made this concession to methodology on the assumption
that purchasers would be able to infer random fluctuations in hospitals in their localities. In
practice, using annual expected rates or three-year moving average made little difference in the
price regressions. Results from the auxiliary mortality regressions are available from the authors
upon request.
12
  To obtain accurate percent changes in the semi-log specification, coefficients of binary
variables are converted using the transformation eβ-1
13
  We also experimented with interaction terms between each hospital characteristic and type of
insurance. The corresponding coefficients were not statistically significant. Therefore we opted
to report the more parsimonious specification in this paper.
