Targeting vs. Instrument Rules for Monetary Policy
Bennett T. McCallum and Edward Nelson
NBER Working Paper No. 10612
June 2004
JEL No. E52, E58
                                        ABSTRACT

Svensson (JEL, 2003) argues strongly that specific targeting rules – first order optimality conditions

for a specific objective function and model – are normatively superior to instrument rules for the

conduct of monetary policy. That argument is based largely upon four main objections to the latter

plus a claim concerning the relative interest-instrument variability entailed by the two approaches.

The present paper considers the four objections in turn, and advances arguments that contradict all

of them. Then in the paper’s analytical sections, it is demonstrated that the variability claim is

incorrect, for a neo-canonical model and also for a variant with one-period-ahead plans used by

Svensson, providing that the same decision-making errors are relevant under the two alternative

approaches. Arguments relating to general targeting rules and actual central bank practice are also

included.

1. Introduction

        In the recent literature on monetary policy analysis, several writers have emphasized

the distinction between instrument rules—i.e., formulae for setting controllable instrument

variables in response to current conditions—and targeting rules, as proposed by Svensson

(1997, 1999).1 In a major contribution, Svensson (2003) has presented a sophisticated and

comprehensive case for the use of targeting rules, arguing that “monetary-policy practice is

better discussed in terms of targeting rules than instrument rules” (2003, p. 429).2 The

superiority of targeting rules is, moreover, claimed to pertain to both normative and positive

perspectives (pp. 428–430). Svensson’s paper is rich in both analytical and practical content,

and provides insights that can be usefully pondered by all students of monetary policy

analysis. It is our belief, nevertheless, that the paper seriously overstates the relative

attractiveness of targeting rules, from both normative and positive perspectives, and

describes inaccurately the properties of instrument rules. To develop this argument is the

purpose of the present paper. As a major part of our argument, one concrete and important

claim of Svensson’s, regarding interest rate variability induced by instrument rules with

strong feedback, is studied in detail. In the wide variety of cases considered, we find all

results to be inconsistent with the claim.

        The outline of the present paper is as follows. Section 2 presents explanations of the

basic concepts and an introduction to the issues. Section 3 then takes up, and disputes, four

particular criticisms of instrument rules that are central to the argument in Svensson (2003),

after which Section 4 does the same for two additional criticisms. In Sections 5 and 6, the

paper turns to the precise analytical claim mentioned above and develops results in a number

of settings that show it to be incorrect. Finally, Section 7 provides a very brief recapitulation.

2. Basic Ideas

         What is the distinction between instrument and targeting rules? A rule of the former

type refers, quite simply, to some formula prescribing instrument settings as a function of

currently observed variables. Well known examples include the Taylor rule (1993), several

interest rate rules studied by Henderson and McKibbin (1993a, 1993b), and the activist

monetary base rules of McCallum (1988) and Meltzer (1987). Precisely which variables are

observable is of course a matter that can be debated in practical analyses, but is one on which

the analyst has to take some explicit position. Note that expectations (based on current

information) of present or future variables may be among the variables that the rule responds

to.3 The definition of targeting rules is somewhat more complex. There has been some

evolution since Svensson’s (1997, 1999) introduction of the concept,4 but his current

terminology recognizes both general and specific variants. Basically, a general targeting rule

is the specification of a central bank objective function,5 whereas a specific targeting rule is

an optimality condition implied by an objective function together with a specified model of

the economy (pp. 448−460).6 Initially, optimization was presumed to be of the discretionary



2
  In what follows, quotations with page-number indications but no author or year indication, refer to that paper,
i.e., Svensson (2003).
3
  In cases in which expectations are based on current-period information, however, Svensson refers to this type
of policy rule as an “implicit instrument rule.”
4
  In particular, only specific (not general) targeting rules were considered in Svensson (1997) and they were
called “target rules.”
5
  Svensson (2003, p. 430) further requires that these be “operational objectives” (italics in original), i.e.
numerical targets for particular variables, rather than a general concept such as “price stability.”
6
  Svensson has explained to us that he does not require that a specific targeting rule necessarily expresses an
optimality condition, as he has in the past (1997, p. 1136), and his definition on p. 429 conforms to that
explanation. On p. 430, however, he states that “… specific targeting rules essentially specify operational
Euler equations.” Also, on p. 455 Svensson states that “A specific targeting rule specifies a condition … [that]
may be an optimal first-order condition, or an approximate first-order condition.” In the remainder of this


                                                        2
type, with period-by-period re-optimization based on prevailing “initial conditions,” but in

Svensson (2003) the possibility of optimization from a “timeless perspective” (see

Woodford, 1999) is also considered.

         It is not our intention to argue that analysis with instrument rules is in all respects

preferable to the use of targeting rules. Even if we held that belief, moreover, we would not

think it socially desirable for all researchers to employ the same approach. Nevertheless, we

are more attracted to analysis with instrument rules than with targeting rules and believe that

a few words should be included to indicate why—especially since Svensson’s numerous

writings argue so strongly in favor of the targeting-rule position.

         First, it seems terminologically inappropriate to refer to the specification of the

policymaker’s objective function as a rule. Obviously, for a given objective function

desirable instrument settings—i.e., policy actions—can be very different under the same

prevailing conditions depending on the policymaker’s preferred model or models of the

economy. There are words available to describe policymakers’ objectives—for example,

“policymakers’ objectives”—so there is nothing analytical to be gained by reference to them

as “general targeting rules.” It is terminologically useful, rather, for objectives and rules to

be clearly distinguished. Next, from the substantive perspective, the adoption of an objective

function is innocuous if the function accurately represents the central bank’s true preferences.

But if it does not represent the true preferences and is made public, as in the scheme

suggested in Svensson’s Section 5.3.3, then the central bank will be describing its objectives

dishonestly to the public, which seems inconsistent with Svensson’s emphasis on




paper, accordingly, we shall follow Svensson’s practice by typically treating specific targeting rules as first-
order optimality conditions.

transparency.7

        Second, the problem with specific targeting rules—i.e., first-order optimality

conditions—is that they are obviously model-dependent.8 It is unclear which portion of

today’s macroeconomic models are most questionable, but it is entirely clear that there is

much dispute among leading scholars concerning the proper specification of several of the

crucial relationships. Yet a condition that implies policy optimality in one model may be

highly inappropriate under other specifications. Consequently, an attractive approach to

policy design, promoted (e.g.) by McCallum (1988, 1999), is to search for an instrument rule

that performs at least moderately well—avoiding disasters—in a variety of plausible models.

In other words, it is our belief that it is unwise to restrict policy analysis to optimal-policy

exercises, which will typically be optimal only for the single model being utilized. Yet such

analysis is precisely what is contemplated by focus on specific targeting rules.

        A good illustration of the model-dependence of optimality conditions is provided in a

recent paper by Levin and Williams (2003), which is a follow-up to the robustness study of

Levin, Wieland, and Williams (1999). The initial experiments of Levin and Williams (2003)

involve calculation of the consequences of using a policy rule, designed to be optimal in one

model, in other models. The three models in their introductory example are (i) a “New

Keynesian” baseline model (NKB) that is highly prominent in recent theoretical research, (ii)

an alternative specification (denoted FHP) with more sources of inertia utilized by Fuhrer

(2000), and the empirically-oriented (RS) model of Rudebusch and Svensson (1999).

Suppose a specific targeting rule is optimal in a calibrated version of the NKB model, with a


7
  Svensson has informed us that he would have the central bank explain the discrepancy between its objective
function and preferences to the public. We consider that such a need reflects a substantial degree of non-
transparency.
8
  The existence of model dependency is recognized by Svensson (p. 450).


                                                      4
loss function that assigns output gap variability a weight of λ (as in Section 5 below) and also

gives interest rate variability a weight of 0.1, both in relation to inflation variability relative

to target. If that optimality condition is used instead in the FHP model, the loss values are 95

or 150 percent higher (for λ values of 0.0 and 0.5, respectively) than the minimum loss in

that model. Even more strikingly, if this NKB optimality condition is transferred to the RS

model, the combination generates explosive oscillations—an “infinite” percentage

deterioration. Next, a specific targeting rule that is optimal in the FHP model produces

losses that are 173 or 130 percent greater than minimum in the NKB model, and explosive

oscillations in the RS model. Finally, a rule that is optimal in the RS model generates

analogous loss increases of 219 or 254 percent in the NKB model and 146 or 128 percent in

the FHP model.

        As an extension of our position, we would suggest that it is not desirable always to

limit analysis to cases in which an explicit objective function has been specified.

Explicitness is itself a virtue, of course, other things equal. But it is unclear what weights

actual central bankers assign to various terms in their objective functions as well as to the

specification of the terms. It is also unclear what weights and terms should appear, since

there is professional disagreement over proper model specification.9 Accordingly, it can be

useful to explore the way in which different properties of a modelled economy (e.g.,

variances of key endogenous variables) are related to policy rule parameters, leaving it to

actual policymakers to assign the relevant weights. Examples of this approach appear in

some of our previous papers, e.g., McCallum and Nelson (1999a, 1999b), as well as in

Bryant, Hooper, and Mann (1993).

9
 Our position does not deny the attractiveness in principle of basing policymaker objective functions on the
preferences of individual agents.

3. Four Main Objections

       After some preliminary discussion, Svensson considers the case of central bank

(henceforth, CB) commitment to an optimal instrument rule (which he terms an implicit

reaction function when the rule includes any current endogenous variables) and concludes

that the implied approach is “completely impractical.” Indeed, Svensson states that

“commitment to an optimal instrument rule has no advocates, as far as I know” (p. 439).

With this particular judgment we have no serious disagreement; see McCallum (1999, pp.

1490–1495), for example. Consequently, Svensson moves on to consideration of simple

instrument rules (pp. 439–441), with one subsection entitled “Problems of a commitment to a

simple instrument rule” (pp. 441–444). We now examine that subsection’s arguments in

some detail, since they evidently constitute the most important ingredients of Svensson’s

position.

       In the subsection in question, there are four main objections to instrument rules that

are identified and discussed. The first is “(1) the simple instrument rule may be far from

optimal in some circumstances” (p. 441). In particular, “[a] first obvious problem for a

Taylor-style rule … is that, if there are other important state variables than inflation and the

output gap, it will not be optimal… For a smaller and more open economy [than the U.S.],

the real exchange rate, the terms of trade, foreign output, and the foreign interest rate seem to

be the minimal essential state variables that have to be added” [for the rule to be optimal] (p.

442). But Taylor rules do not comprise the entire class of simple instrument rules; nominal

income growth rules provide just one obvious counter-example. Thus the foregoing is not

actually an argument against simple instrument rules, but merely an objection to one

particular class. Furthermore, it is not clear that the supposed departure from optimality




                                                6
resulting from the absence of the other state variables, pertaining to open economies, is

quantitatively or even qualitatively important. Indeed, in Clarida, Galí, and Gertler’s (2001)

small open economy model there are no additional terms in the welfare function besides the

two Taylor-rule state variables—inflation and the output gap—provided that the former is

defined in terms of domestic-goods price inflation. Similarly, the McCallum-Nelson (1999a,

2000b) open-economy model can be formulated entirely in terms of CPI inflation, output,

and the real interest rate, with openness only changing the interpretation of the model

parameters.

        “A second problem,” Svensson states, “is that a commitment to an instrument rule

does not leave any room for judgmental adjustments and extra-model information…” (p.

442). This claim is difficult for us to understand, since there seem to be various ways in

which judgmental adjustments to instrument rule prescriptions could be made. For example,

the interest rate instrument could be set above (or below) the rule-indicated value when

policymaker judgments indicate that conditions, not adequately reflected in the CB’s formal

quantitative models, imply different forecasts and consequently call for additional policy

tightening (or loosening). This way of incorporating judgment is not the same as the one

proposed by Svensson, which he represents by the inclusion in the structural equations of the

CB’s macroeconomic model of an unobservable exogenous stochastic variable that is not

generated by a simple process such as “an exogenous autoregressive process” (p. 433).

These exogenous deviations appear in the model’s structural equations. “Judgment” is then

the CB’s estimate of these deviation variables. But it is unclear that this approach reflects the

only, or even the best, way of representing the role of judgment in policymaking.10 Thus the


10
  Svensson also states that “a commitment to a simple instrument rule does not provide any rules for when
discretionary departures from the simple instrument rule are warranted” (p. 442). But a procedure that did do


                                                       7
fact that the above-mentioned way of incorporating judgment is different from Svensson’s

seems to be beside the point, i.e., does not justify his quoted statement.11

         Svensson suggests that “a third problem with simple instrument rules would seem to

be that a once-and-for-all commitment to an instrument rule would not allow any

improvement of the … rule when new information about the transmission mechanism, the

variability of shocks, or the source of shocks arrives” (p. 442). But the words “would seem”

appear in the foregoing quotation because Svensson does not actually make the foregoing

argument. After mentioning it, he goes on to recognize that Woodford’s (1999) “timeless

perspective” type of commitment does permit modification of rules when new information is

developed.12 Such rules can, as is indicated below, be implemented by means of an

instrument rule. Furthermore, the implied type of commitment—to a procedure rather than a

formula—could be applied to instrument rules obtained by other procedures.

         Finally, switching from a normative to a positive point of view, Svensson states that

“an obvious fourth problem is that commitment to a simple instrument rule is far

from an accurate description of current monetary policy” as practiced by inflation-targeting

or other CBs. He continues: “No central bank has (to my knowledge) announced and

committed itself to an explicit instrument rule” (p. 444). But, as McCallum and Nelson

(2000a, p. 15) have argued previously, no actual central bank has announced or committed

itself to an explicit objective function, which is a necessary condition for either the general or




this would hardly seem to reflect what most analysts would think of as “judgment”. It would be, rather, a
complex rule.
11
   We do not mean to deny that Svensson has insightful and constructive observations to make regarding
incorporation of judgment; our objection is to the asymmetry that he paints with respect to such incorporation
via targeting and instrument rules.
12
   For discussions, see Woodford (1999) and Svensson and Woodford (2003).


                                                       8
specific type of targeting rule promoted by Svensson.13 Indeed, commitment to an optimal

specific targeting rule would in addition entail commitment to be bound by the output of a

new optimal control exercise, conducted with a particular quantitative macroeconomic

model, each decision period (e.g., each month). Such exercises could, Svensson says, be

modified by judgment. But are they actually conducted by the CBs that he identifies as the

world’s leaders in this regard, those of the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Sweden? If

so, what is the value of the weight λ on output-gap variability announced and utilized by

each of these CBs? What is the specification of the model utilized?

         In short, it seems appropriate to conclude that all four of the objections to instrument

rules emphasized by Svensson are equally applicable—or equally inapplicable—to targeting

rules.

4. Additional Objections

         Two other debatable points deserve some brief attention, before we turn to a major

analytical issue in Sections 5 and 6. One of these concerns Svensson’s argument against the

view that “simple instrument rules fit actual central-bank behavior well” (p. 444). In

opposition to this idea, Svensson states that “even the best empirical fits leave one third or

more of the variance of changes in the [interest instrument] rate unexplained.” In this regard

it is important to note that the statement pertains to the variability of first differences of the

interest rate, as found in the study by Judd and Rudebusch (1998). In terms of levels, the

fraction of the variance that is unexplained is approximately 0.02 (i.e., about 2 percent).14

Neither of these measures is “correct,” of course, but to put matters in perspective, we note

13
  Note that at a minimum it would be necessary for the CB to state explicitly its value for the objective function
parameter labeled λ below and in Svensson’s eq. (2.2).




                                                        9
that 33 percent would be a comparatively small unexplained variance fraction for the first

difference of most important variables in typical quarterly macroeconometric models. In the

well-known Rudebusch and Svensson (1999) model, for example, the unexplained variance

fractions for changes in inflation and the output gap are about 71 percent and 87 percent,

respectively.15

        Our second point concerns Svensson’s contention that actual central banks noted for

their inflation-targeting regimes, including the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Bank of

Canada, and the Bank of England, use in practice procedures that are more reasonably

characterized by the notion of a targeting rule rather than an instrument rule. We have

already mentioned than none of these central banks has publicly adopted an explicit objective

function. But furthermore, we find that descriptions of their policy procedures provided by

officials and economists of these central banks read more like instrument rules than specific

targeting rules.

        As a first example, there are several short articles describing the policy procedures of

the Bank of Canada that appear in the Summer 2002 issue of the Bank of Canada Review.

These do not refer to targeting rules or optimal control exercises, but discuss instrument rules

quite explicitly—see, e.g., Cote, Lam, Liu, and St-Amant (2002). Another relevant reference

to the use of instrument rules in Canadian policy is provided by Longworth and O’Reilly

(2002). At the risk of being excessively repetitive, let it be said explicitly that we do not

claim that the Bank of Canada—or any actual central bank—strictly follows an instrument


14
   Judd and Rudebusch (1998, p. 14) report a residual standard deviation of 0.27 for the Greenspan period 1987
Q3−1997 Q4. Over that span, the standard deviation of the quarterly average funds rate is 1.93 (annual
percentage units). Thus the unexplained fraction of variability is (0.27/1.93)2 = 0.0196.
15
   These figures pertain to the model’s “inflation equation” and “output equation,” for which the reported
residual standard errors are 1.009 and 0.819 (Rudebusch and Svensson 1999, p. 208). The sample standard
deviations for first differences of the relevant inflation and output gap series over the 1961.1-1996.2 sample
period are 1.197 and 0.877 so we have (1.009/1.197)2 = 0.711 and (0.819/0.877)2 = 0.872.


                                                      10
rule, but rather that their practices are closer to the analytical representation of an instrument

rule than to the analytical representation of a targeting rule.

       For the Bank of England, a natural starting place is a publication by Bean and

Jenkinson (2001) entitled “The Formulation of Monetary Policy at the Bank of England,”

which describes the role of forecasts in policy decisions (made individually by members of

the Monetary Policy Committee). This paper’s discussion explains that a variety of models

and techniques are used in the process, but recognizes the special status of the “MM”

quarterly macroeconometric model. In the publication Economic Models at the Bank of

England: September 2000 Update, there are several examples of policy experiments with

MM involving alternative instrument rules (Bank of England 2000, pp. 13−20). The more

recent discussion by Allsopp (2002, Section 3) suggests that “the broad features of the

reaction function in place in the UK increasingly seem to be publicly-understood and built

into expectations.”

       A still more recent discussion of the UK policy framework is that in a document

prepared by the UK Treasury (2003). That study uses a comparison of “interest rate

decisions [with] those that a Taylor rule would suggest” as one measure of whether “the

current frameworks have allowed monetary policy to perform a stabilizing role” (2003, pp.

33, 35). By contrast, there is no attempt to evaluate policy using a numerically-specified loss

function or Euler equation. The study does note criticisms of the instrument-rule approach,

citing Svensson (2003) in that regard. But it characterizes the deviation of actual policy from

the Taylor rule as reflecting discretionary adjustments: “[prescriptions from] Taylor rules…

are typically different from the actual rates chosen by central banks, which use discretion to

determine rates based on a wider range of information” (2003, p. 36). In addition, in a



                                                11
speech accompanying the release of this study, the Chancellor of the Exchequer (who sets the

target for monetary policy in the UK and appoints several of the members of the Monetary

Policy Committee) was explicit in characterizing actual policy in a Taylor-rule manner:

“For a 1 per cent rise in British inflation, the British interest rate would, other things being

equal, tend to rise by 1.5 per cent” (Brown, 2003).

       In the case of New Zealand, descriptions of the Reserve Bank’s policy procedures

(e.g., Hampton, 2002) make no mention of optimal control exercises, but clearly refer to a

role for an instrument rule in use of the Forecasting and Policy System. In addition, it is

interesting to note that Svensson’s own extensive and authoritative independent review of

New Zealand monetary policy (2001, p. 66) suggests that “The Reserve Bank may want to

consider some further developments of its Forecasting and Policy System (FPS). Alternative

interest rate reaction functions and alternative interest rate paths could be used and presented

systematically to the MPC to provide a larger menu of policy choices for discussions and

consideration.”

5. Volatility from Instrument Rules?

       We now turn to our main analytical discussion. Svensson’s subsection 5.5 expresses

sharp and specific disagreement with a crucial argument made by McCallum (1999, p. 1493)

and McCallum and Nelson (2000a) concerning the relationship between targeting and

instrument rules. In particular, these two papers argue that an instrument rule can be written

so as to entail instrument responses that would tend to bring about the satisfaction of any

specific target rule (which usually amounts to a first-order condition for CB optimality). By

increasing the response coefficient attached to the discrepancy between the relevant

prevailing conditions and the desired first-order condition, the average discrepancy can be




                                                12
made arbitrarily small.16 Thus, in a sense one can accomplish with an instrument rule

anything that can be accomplished with a specific targeting rule, according to our argument.

Svensson (p. 461) has objected to this argument, however, on the grounds that “this is a

dangerous and completely impracticable idea. It is completely inconceivable in practical

monetary policy to have reaction functions with very large response coefficients, since the

slightest mistake in calculating the argument of the reaction function would have grave

consequences and result in extreme instrument-rate volatility.” A similar objection is

expressed, in milder language, by Svensson and Woodford (2003).

        Our intuition was that imbedding a first-order condition in an instrument rule with a

large but finite reaction coefficient (such as µ1 below) would typically entail less severe

instrument movements than would imposition of the relevant specific targeting rule, since the

latter is equivalent to use of an “infinite” reaction coefficient.17 In other cases, large µ1 values

might entail somewhat greater interest volatility but in such cases the magnitude of this

volatility would approach that obtained with the targeting rule as µ1 grows without bound. In

our paper (2000a) we did not, however, explore the effects of mistakes in calculating the

argument of the reaction function. In the following paragraphs we shall, accordingly,

investigate the validity of Svensson’s conjecture.

        For this exercise, suppose initially that the economy is represented by the following

model, which is a version of the neo-canonical specification used by Bullard and Mitra




16
   The sign of the response coefficient must, of course, be appropriate—so that policy is tightened when
aggregate demand needs to be reduced, etc.
17
   It is important to note that—in contrast to Svensson’s suggestion on p. 461—we actually do not recommend
the adoption of a large reaction coefficient; see McCallum and Nelson (2000a, pp. 20–24). Our point, instead,
is that an instrument rule with a large reaction coefficient is less open to Svensson’s objection than is its
associated specific targeting rule.


                                                      13
(2002), Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (1999), Jensen (2002), Woodford (1999, 2003), McCallum

and Nelson (1999b, 2000a), and many others:

(1)      yt = Etyt+1 + b1(Rt − Etπt+1) + ξt,                                   b1 < 0

(2)      πt = αyt + βEtπt+1 + ut.                                               α > 0, 0 < β < 1

Here, yt is the output gap, πt is the inflation rate, and Rt is the one-period nominal interest

rate. Equation (1) is the now-familiar expectational IS function and (2) is the Calvo price

adjustment relation—both consistent under well-known assumptions with optimizing

behavior by individuals in the economy (e.g., Woodford, 2003).

         Supposing that the CB wishes to minimize the loss function

Et Σj=0∞ βj (πt+j2 + λyt+j2),

the optimum first-order condition in the absence of commitment is πt = −(λ/α)yt, or,

(3)      πt + (λ/α)yt = 0.18

This is the specific targeting rule that is implied for this model, assuming the absence of

commitment, by Svensson’s approach. The corresponding instrument rule proposed in

McCallum and Nelson (2000a) is

(4)      Rt = (1−µ2){ r + πt + µ1[πt + (λ/α)yt]} + µ2Rt−1,

where r is the average long-run real rate of interest. The term r , which is included along

with πt so as to express (4) in a Taylor-style form, is normalized to zero by expressions (1)

and (2). For present purposes the interest-rate smoothing coefficient µ2 may also be set equal

to zero, yielding Rt = πt + µ1[πt + (λ/α)yt].



18
  See the papers cited in the previous paragraph. Note that while we use Svensson’s symbol λ for the weight
on the output gap in the objective function, our other choices for symbols do not follow Svensson’s notation, as
the latter is somewhat non-standard.


                                                       14
       To incorporate mistakes of the type contemplated by Svensson, we modify (3) and (4)

to become

(3’)   πt + (λ /α)yt + et = 0

and

(4’)   Rt = (1−µ2){ r + πt + µ1[πt + (λ/α)yt + et]} + µ2Rt−1,

where et represents a stochastic mistake term. We have included the same mistake term et

into both the targeting and instrument rule, a step that seems necessary to provide a

reasonable basis for comparison. Since the issue is whether use of an instrument rule (with a

large µ1 parameter) leads to excessive variability (when there are policy errors) in

comparison to the corresponding targeting rule, it would make no sense to omit the errors

from the targeting rule.

       In our experiments, we shall treat et as a first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) process—

usually as white noise—with AR parameter ρe and innovation εt (standard deviation σε).

Various values for σε and ρe are considered. Behavioral parameter values for the model are

taken to be b1 = −0.5, α = 0.03, and β = 0.99. Also, the stochastic shock term ξt in (1)

includes a term reflecting yt − Et yt +1 , which must be included—in addition to a white noise

preference shock vt —because (1) and (2) are expressed in terms of the output gap rather than

output. The natural-rate value yt is assumed to follow a first-order autoregressive process

with AR parameter 0.95 and innovation standard deviation 0.007. The white noise

preference shock has standard deviation 0.02 and the shock term ut in the price adjustment

equation (2) is taken to be white noise with standard deviation 0.005. For the results given

below, the value of the CB preference parameter λ is set at 0.1.




                                               15
       We begin by reporting in Table 1 results of using different values for the feedback

parameter µ1 (setting µ2 = 0 here and in subsequent cases). The first column pertains to the

µ1 value of 0.5, as suggested by Taylor (1993). Successive columns then use values of 5.0

and 50.0. Finally, the last column includes results for “µ1 = ∞,” i.e., for the targeting rule

(3’). In each cell, two values are reported. The first is the unconditional expected value of

the loss function, which is (with β = 0.99) 100 times the unconditional expectation of the

single-period loss. The second is the standard deviation of Rt, the interest rate instrument.

These values are based on analytical expressions for the unconditional variances of πt, yt,

and Rt implied by the model-plus-rule systems.

       The first row of Table 1 gives results for the reference case in which there is no et

mistake term. The pattern is similar to those in McCallum and Nelson (2000a, Table 4) in

that the value of the loss function with the instrument rule (4’) approaches the value with the

target-rule first-order condition (3’). Here, however, the Rt standard deviation (SD) values

are also reported. Not surprisingly, they also show the instrument-rule values approaching

the targeting-rule value smoothly as µ1 grows without bound. In the second row the mistake

or error term et is included as white noise with a SD of 0.002. With this small variability, the

results are not much affected. Then in row three the SD of et is increased to a magnitude that

is similar to that of the other model shocks. In this case again, nevertheless, there is no

tendency for the large µ1 values to generate poor performance. Indeed, the variability of Rt is

slightly smaller with µ1 = 50 than with the targeting rule holding exactly. (The same remains

true if we set µ1 = 500.) For more stringent tests, we increase the SD of the error term by a

factor of ten in the fourth row and then, in row five, revert to 0.02 for the innovation SD but

with an autoregressive parameter of σe = 0.8. In both these cases the SD of the interest rate


                                                16
increases slightly as we switch from a large µ1 coefficient value of 50 in the instrument rule

to the use of the analogous targeting rule.

         Table 2 repeats the same experiments from Table 1 but with the first-order targeting

rule and its instrument-rule version pertaining to policy behavior of the “timeless

perspective” type of commitment, rather than discretion.19 In this case, the optimality

condition is

(5)      πt + (λ /α)(yt − yt−1) + et = 0

and the analogous instrument rule (with µ2 = 0) is

(6)      Rt = r + πt + µ1[πt + (λ/α)(yt – yt−1) + et]

when the et mistake terms are included. Here the values and patterns are quite different than

in Table 1, but the same finding vis-à-vis Svensson’s conjecture is obtained. There is, in

other words, no tendency for large µ1 values in (5) to lead to high Rt volatility or to poor

performance, in comparison with the specific targeting-rule results of condition (5).

6. Model with Predetermined Output and Inflation

         There are various modifications to the model (1)-(2) that could be examined,20 to

determine whether the foregoing results obtain generally, but one in particular is of special

relevance. This modification stems from recognition that the examples in Svensson’s (2003)

paper are worked out in terms of models (pp. 432−435) in which agents’ actions in period t

have no effect on output or inflation until period t+1. Accordingly, we now modify our

model (1)−(2) so as to possess that property. Thus consider the following specification, in

which symbols are the same as above.21


19
   This is the type of rule recommended by Woodford (1999, 2003) and by Svensson and Woodford (2003).
20
   We have verified that inclusion of serial correlation in the ut shock process does not alter our basic result.
21
   Our specification is equivalent to Svensson’s, in which t +1 is used wherever we use t, etc.


                                                         17
(7)    yt = Et−1yt+1 + b1(Et−1Rt − Et−1πt+1) + vt,                         b1 < 0

(8)    πt = αEt−1yt + βEt−1πt+1 + ut.                                      α > 0, 0 < β < 1

Here we have used the law of iterated expectations, e.g., Et−1(EtXt+1) = Et−1Xt+1. With this

modification, the optimal discretionary first-order condition imposed in period t—i.e., the

specific targeting rule—becomes

(9)    Etπt+1 + (λ/α) Etyt+1 = 0

instead of (3). (See Svensson, p. 452.) Accordingly, the implied instrument rule with µ2 = 0

and r = 0 is

(10)   Rt = Et−1πt + µ1[Et−1πt + (λ/α)Et−1yt].

Again the relevant experiment, designed to compare these two approaches with policy

mistakes, entails specifications with random error terms included in both rules. The model to

be solved then consists of equations (7), (8), and either

(11)   Et−1πt + (λ/α)Et−1yt + et−1 = 0

or

(12)   Rt = Et−1πt + µ1[Et−1πt + (λ/α)Et−1yt + et−1].

Here the random mistake terms are dated t−1 so as to respect the notion that output and

inflation in t are predetermined. (For discussion of an alternative timing, see the Appendix.)

       Before turning to more complex cases, let us consider an analytical solution for the

simple special case in which discretion obtains and the three disturbance terms are all white

noises. Then the MSV solution to the system (7), (8), and (11) is of the form

(13a) πt = φ11ut + φ12vt + φ13et−1

(13b) yt = φ21ut + φ22vt + φ23et−1

(13c) Rt = φ31ut + φ32vt + φ33et−1.

                                                     18
With this specification, we have Et−1πt = φ13et−1, Et−1πt+1 = 0, Et−1yt = φ23et−1, and Et−1yt+1 = 0.

Undetermined coefficient calculations then yield φ11 = 1, φ12 = 0, φ13 = −α/[α+(λ/α)], φ21 = 0,

φ22 = 1, φ23 = −1/[α+(λ/α)], φ31 = 0, φ32 = 0, and φ33 = −1/b1[α+(λ/α)].

        For comparison we need to solve with the instrument rule (12) in place of the

targeting rule (11). The solution is again of the form (13) and now the undetermined

coefficient calculations yield φ11 = 1, φ12 = 0, φ13 = αb1µ1/[1−(1+µ1)αb1−(λ/α)µ1b1], φ21 = 0,

φ22 = 1, φ23 = b1µ1/[1− (1+µ1)αb1−(λ/α)µ1b1], φ31 = 0, φ32 = 0, and φ33 =

µ1/[1−(1+µ1)αb1−(λ/α)µ1b1] > 0. Then to compare the variability of Rt under the two types

of policy behavior, we need only to calculate the magnitude of φ33 for the two cases, since

Var(Rt) = φ332 σe2 in both cases. But with µ1 > 0, it is just a matter of algebra to verify that

φ33 is smaller in the second case, with the instrument rule. So again we find that mistakes

involving the first-order optimality condition are less serious (in terms of interest rate

variability) with use of the instrument rule than the corresponding targeting rule. Also, it is

straightforward to verify that as µ1 → ∞, the instrument-rule expression for φ33 approaches

the targeting-rule expression.

        The case just examined is, however, excessively special. Indeed, inspection of the

solutions given above shows that, for the discretionary case with all white noise shocks, there

is no effect of different µ1 values on the mean value (unconditional expectation) of the

objective function. In other words, with no source of serial correlation in the model, and the

existence of an information lag, the discretionary policy rule has no stabilizing properties for

πt and yt in the model (7)−(8). Thus we need to consider cases with autocorrelated

disturbances and/or with TP optimization. For the latter case we find, from Svensson’s

equation (5.28), that the relevant targeting and instrument rules are, respectively,


                                                 19
(14)       Et−1πt + (λ/α)[Et−1yt − Et−2yt−1] + et−1 = 0

and

(15)       Rt = Et−1πt + µ1[Et−1πt + (λ /α)(Et−1yt − Et−2yt−1) + et−1].

           In Tables 3 and 4 we report numerical results with the model (7)−(8). Again we

report standard deviations based on analytical covariances. In most of the cases, the

standard deviation of the policy-error term is kept at σε = 0.02. For Table 3, which pertains

to discretionary behavior, the policy specifications are (11) and (12) for the targeting and

instrument rules whereas in Table 4, with timeless perspective behavior, the relevant rules

are (14) and (15). In both tables the first three rows apply to cases with white noise shocks

so we see that, as in the analytical solution given above, policy activism is not helpful in

achieving policy objectives. Indeed, when policy errors are included, as in rows 2 and 3, the

activist rules tend to be harmful. This should not be greatly surprising, since there are no

general optimality results pertaining to the formulations being considered. In the final two

rows of each table serially correlated shocks are present, however, so policy activism can

potentially be helpful.22 Indeed, in Table 4 we see that larger values of µ1 lead to reduced

values of the loss function.

           Be that as it may, with regard to the issue at hand the results are clear-cut: there is no

tendency for the variability of Rt to grow alarmingly with large values of µ1. Indeed, the

variability of Rt is smaller with large values of µ1 used in the instrument rule than with the

associated specific targeting rule. In addition, the results provided by the targeting rules (11)

and (14) are, as before, very closely approximated by those of the instrument rules (12) and

(15) for large values of µ1.


22
     Where autocorrelation is included in the ut process, the innovation variance is kept at 0.0052.

7. Conclusion

       Svensson (2003) argues strongly that general and specific targeting rules, which

amount to commitments to specified objective functions and first-order conditions

(respectively), are normatively superior to instrument rules for the conduct of monetary

policy. By contrast, we suggest that it is unhelpful to refer to “general targeting rules” as

policy rules, from a terminological perspective, and that substantively their adoption is either

innocuous or else represents a departure from transparency. Most of the present paper’s

discussion is focused, accordingly, upon specific targeting rules—i.e., the first-order

optimality conditions implied by the combination of a specific objective function and a

specific model.

       Svensson’s argument that specific targeting rules are superior to instrument rules is

based largely upon four main objections to the latter plus a claim concerning the relative

interest-instrument variability entailed by the two approaches. Our Section 3 considers the

four objections in turn, and advances arguments that contradict all of them. Then in the

paper’s analytical sections (5 and 6), it is demonstrated that the variability claim is incorrect,

for a neo-canonical model and also for a variant with one-period-ahead plans used by

Svensson, providing that the same decision-making errors are relevant under the two

alternative approaches.

       We suggest, then, that despite its large quantity of meticulous analysis, Svensson

(2003) does not develop any compelling reasons for preferring targeting rules over

instrument rules, from a normative perspective. We also suggest, regarding the positive

perspective, that no actual central bank has expressed explicitly the magnitude of objective

function parameters that are essential for the utilization of a targeting rule.




                                                21
                                             Appendix

        In correspondence, Svensson has argued, “I don’t think your exercise [of Sections 5

and 6] actually gets to the problem and gives a good representation of the issue. One reason

is that I think your approach assumes that everyone immediately knows what the central-

bank error [et−1] is and takes that into account in the expectations formation. It would be

more relevant to consider the equilibrium when expectations are formed without knowing the

error.” To evaluate this suggestion, we must consider what is meant by the “error.” What we

have in mind is precisely the type defined by Svensson (2003, p. 461), namely, “a mistake in

calculating the argument of the reaction function.” Since the central bank’s decision

regarding Rt is made in period t−1 in Svensson’s analysis—see his p. 435—the error must be

realized in period t−1; hence our use of et−1 in equations (11), (12), (14), and (15).

Furthermore, Svensson assumes that private agents possess the same information as the

central bank (p. 432) and that actual and privately-expected interest rates coincide (p. 435).

Accordingly, we contend that the analysis of Section 6 above does accurately reflect the issue

spelled out in Svensson’s Section 5.5, so that his objection given above is inapplicable.

        An alternative formulation would be to assume some type of policy error that affected

Rt but not Et−1Rt, representing private expectations, a case mentioned by Svensson and

Woodford (2003, p. 57). An implementation error, brought about by imperfect interest-rate

control, would be one such possibility. Analytically, the location of the error term in this

case would be outside the square brackets in expressions (14) and (15), however, so that the

multiplying effect of a large µ1 coefficient would not occur. The other relevant possibility is

that the central bank uses information not possessed by private agents in making its decision.

In that case it is true that large µ1 coefficients would yield large variability of Rt, but this case



                                                 22
is apparently inconsistent with the information assumptions of Svensson (2003) and

Svensson and Woodford (2003, pp. 12−13). Furthermore, the rationale for assuming that

actions by private agents in period t depend upon lagged information does not carry over to

the case of Rt, since asset market prices are in reality observable on a day-to-day or hour-to-

hour basis.
