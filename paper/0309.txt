                   How Elastic Is the Demand for Labor?

                                      SUMMARY


     This paper investigates the magnitude of the elasticity of demand

for labor in time series data using more general and complete models of

demand than have been previously employed. It argues that previous analyses

have imposed two invalid constraints in calculations, which bias downward estimated

elasticities. The first invalid constraint is the assumption that real

capital prices have an equal opposite effect to real wages in the demand

equation. We show on measurement error grounds that this constraint should

not be imposed in econometric work even when longrun homogeneity of prices

correctly characterizes the market. The constraint is rejected in the

data. The second invalid constraint is that all explanatory variables

have the same lag distribution. We argue that this constraint is invalid

when decisions are made under uncertainty and find that it is also rejected

by the data. The principal positive empirical finding is that with the

constraintsrelaxed, the elasticity, of demand with respect to real wages
is much larger than the estimates in the literature, indicating much greater
price responsiveness on the demand side of the labor market than has
previously been thought.

     Time series studies of the determinants of employment have tended to

find relatively low elasticities of response to factor prices. One body

of literature has ignored relative price effects and focused exclusively on

the adjustment of employment to output) Other studies have entered

relative factor prices into adjustment models, to find negligible elastici-

ties. The recent study by Nadiri and Rosen, which represents the most

comprehensive work to date, obtained virtually zero elasticities of

demand in aggregate and two—digit manufacturing data.   Reviewing the

literature, Hamermesh concluded that a concensus value of the fixed output

response of employment to wages in the long run was a bare —.15 (Hamermesh, table 1).

     The econometric evidence of low elasticities of demand may be explained

in several ways: it could result from the particular type of model

specified, with alternative models yielding different results; it could

reflect peculiar variation or lack of variation in the factor price

variables, creating poor empirical "experiments"; it could result from

inadequate measurement of variables; it could reflect correlation between

the wage and error terms due to simultaneity; or it could be, in fact,

that demand   for labor is highly inelastic.
     This   study develops a new and more general model of the demand for

labor under cost minimization than those used in previous work and uses

the model to analyze the time series evidence on the magnitude of the

elasticity of demand for labor in United States manufacturing. The

principal finding is that, contrary to much of the literature, the fixed

output elasticity of demand for labor in manufacturing is fairly sizeable.

The coimnon finding of negligible factor price effects appears due to the
                                                                   2



imposition of the constraint, which is strongly rejected by the data,

that   real   capital prices have as large a positive effect on demand as

the negative effect of real wages.

       We begin by examining the patterns of change in the principa1

variables that enter demand analysis: wages, prices, employment and

output. The second section examines alternative models of the demand

for labor, with specific focus on the appropriate empirical specification

of relative prices. Section three presents the basic empirical results.

The paper concludes with a brief summary of the findings.



I     Patterns of Wage and Employment Change

       The patterns of change in the principal demand variables in manufacturing

are presented in Table 1. The left hand. side of the table records standard

deviations in the log changes of quantity variables and of ratios of quantity

variables, by quarter, from first quarter 1950 to third quarter 1976.

The right hand side of the table presents comparable standard deviations

in the log changes of the relevant prices and earnings from quarter to

quarter. With one exception, the basic data are obtained directly from the

Bureau of Labor Statistics establishment survey and from the U.S. Department

of Commerce,    as described in the table source. The exception is      the price

of   capital,   which we have measured using the concept of user cost

developed in several articles by Jorgenson, and various associates

(Jorgenson, Hall and Jorgensen). Our measure takes into account the

differential tax treatment of equipment and structures and the presence

of both equity and debt finance, and adjusts the cost of capital for

depreciation and expected capital gains. The formulas and sources of

data for the cost of capital are given in the Appendix.

       The table reveals two striking aspects about postwar changes in
                                                                            3

 the prices and quantities of labor, goods, -and capital which condition

econometric analysis of demand relations.

      First, there is a markedly different pattern of variation between

quantities and pricin the labor market, the product market, and the capital

market. In the labor and product markets, the standard deviations show much

greater variation over time in quantity variables than in price variables. In

the labor market variation in nroductjon wnrlcer eTnnlnvmpl,t      i            'e" tT.TiCC a
 large as the variation in   nominal   wages and 1.8   times   that in   real   wages.
The   standard deviation for non—production worker employment is smaller
but still sizeable. In the product market, the pattern is similar, with
the   standard deviation in real shipments far exceeding the standard

deviation in prices. The pattern is reversed in the capital market. The

nominal price of capital shows the greatest variation of any price—side

measure and is more than twice as variable as the stock of capital.

      Second, although the variation in nominal and deflated (real) earnings

is smaller than the variation in
                                   employment, the standard deviations of the
two earnings variables are still sufficiently sizeable as to provide a

reasonable "experiment"   from which to estimate demand schedules               Indeed, the
basic data suggest that demand for labor may be quite responsive to changes

in real wages. If, as a crude first approximation, one were to take the

ratio of employment to shipments as indicative of movements along a fixed

demand schedule and changes in real wages as the relevant price—side

variable, the figures show greater variation along the quantity than price

axis. Given a high negative correlation between the variables, this implies

an elasticity of demand above unity.2 In fact, relative to trend, the

ratio of employment to shipments is substantially negatively related to the

real wage variable: in 86 of 107 quarters, the variables move in the
                                                                                               4

appropriate   direction; their simple correlation is —0.84. While these

patterns are hardly to be viewed as providing evidence of the magnitude

of elasticities, they highlight the fact that the data evince demand—type

patterns of change.

     Much of the variation in real wages occurs, it should be stressed,

in the 1969—75 period when real wages dropped sharply; decomposition of

the overall variance of quant-ity changes into the variance from 1950 to

1969 and the variance from 1969 to 1976 shows that 56% of the total
                                              3
variation occurred in the latter period.          Whereas in the "average" postwar

NBER reference cycle, real wages rose by 2.45% from trough to peak and by

1.34% from peak to trough, a very different pattern is found in the 1970—75

cycle: from 1970:4 to 1973:4 real wages rose only 0.5%; from 1973:4 to

1975:1 they fell by 7.9%. This highlights the extent to which the decline

in real wages in the 1970s provides a distinct "experiment."4

     Third, the standard deviations in the log quarterly changes of the

ratio of employment to capital and of the ratio of average hourly earnings

to the price of capital reveal a very different pattern of variation in

the relative quantity of inputs than in the relative price of inputs. Not

unexpectedly, the relative variation in the labor/capital ratio tends to

be dominated by movements in the numerator. More important in terms of

ensuing analysis, howe-er, is the fact that variation in the price of labor

relative to the price of capital is dominated by changes in the cost of capital:

the variance in wages/cost of capital exceeds the variance in nominal wages

and is   approximately the same as the variance in the cost of capital. This
Implies   that models   which relate   demand for labor to relative factor prices

are essentially relating demand for labor to the price of capital rather

than to the price of labor.
                                                                  6


 II Alternative Models of Demand

     The standard, static theory of cost minimization subject to a production

constraint can be used to derive an expression for long run labor demand

as a function of planned output and relative prices. For simplicity

assume that the production process in the representative firm can be

approximated by a Cobb—Douglas function of the form:

     Qt=a+K+YL                                                    (1)

where K and L represent the log of capital and labor input respectively,

Q is the log of output and a is a constant. When the firm takes all prices

as given, and varies all inputs, cost minimization leads to the following

labor demand function:

            +        —
     L           Q       -(W_C)                                   (2)

where 0 = y + and measures returns to scale, W and C are the log of the

prices of labor and capital, Q is the log of. planned output, and b is a constant.

     Equation (2) depicts the long run demand for labor. If the firm

faces costs of adjustment, discrepancies between curent labor input and

long run demand may arise as the firm adjusts with a lag to changes in

output or relative prices. A common formulation of the adjustment

process makes use of some variant of the flexible accelerator.

A simple version is given by

         = lp(L* —
                     Li)                                          (3)


Substituting for L yields an equation for observed labor input:

     Lt =       + Q - (W_C) +      (l4)L1                         (4)


     Equation (4) places two constraints on the demand equation. First, it

imposes the constraint that the price of labor and the price of capital

have equal, oDposite signed, coefficients. This restriction derives from the

homogeneity of the production process and is assumed to hold in each perio4.
                                                                         7


     The second constraint embodied in (4) is that the explanatory variables
W,- C, and Q have the same lag structure. The equation imposes this
constraint by specifying that changes in these variables affect labor demand
through changes in the latent variable L. This restriction assumes that

the cost of moving to the new target is the only source of legged adjustment

in   the   system and that   expectations   are static or are formed identically

for all variables.5

      We argue that neither of these constraints should necessarily be

imposed on the data. The homogeneity constraint, though theoretically valid

in models of the demand- for labor by a firm, should not be imposed on the

data when capital prices are subject to sizeable measurement error. The

constraint that all explanatory variables have the same lagged effect on

employment is not appropriate when decisions are made under uncertainty.



Measurement error and the relative price constraint

      Assume that in the long run           and C have equal opposite signs but
that the price of capital is measured with considerable error. In this case,

one can get a better estimate of the long run elasticity of demand for

labor by letting wages and capital enter the equations separately than

by imposing the constraint the they enter with equal opposite signed coefficients.

      To see the implications of measurement error in C assume that the

true model is (conditional on other variables)

      Lt = a0 —
                  cL(W_c) + e                                           (5)

where W and C represent logs of
                                     wages and cost of capital measured in real
terms. The price of capital is measured with error, so that
                                                                            8


                                                                             (6)


where        is the observed price and vis the error. Equations (5) and (6)

yield the following observable model

       Lt     a0 —           —
                                     — v) + e                               (7)


We assume that measurement error in capital and the error in the equation

 are independent of the other variables and are independent of each other:
that is E(Wv) = E(We) = E(Ce) =
                                E(Cv) = E(ev)               0.

        Least squares regression of L on W—C will yield a            that differs on
average from the true value by



                                                                             (8)

where        is the proportion of variation in C due to measurement error,
   =    Y/cY)      and a- (=a) is the covariance between C and W in the data.

       When W and C are entered separately, on the other hand, we obtain

the following regression

       Lt     a0 —     (W)       + 3(C) + e —
                                                cV                          (9)

ihee and               are the coefficients on W and C respectively. Because of the

measurement error in c,                is biased downward relative to the true response

coefficient .          The magnitude of the bias on        can be evaluated from (Griliches
Ringstd, p. 197):

That is,         the bias in                is less than the bias in        when the covariance

 between the capital price and the wage is less than                         the   variance in the

 price of capital (all variances partialled on the other relevant variables).

       Using the data described in table 1 and measuring                           and W in deflated

that   the           estimated in the constrained model is subject to a much larger

downward bias than the                          obtained from the unconstrained model. Indeed, the

estimated variance in W conditional on real

time is 0.50, which together with the estimates of a and a2                             gives     a

bias for the constrained model of —l.l and a bias for the unconstrained

model of —0.l9. With these values, the unconstrained model is to be preferred.

               Equation (16) differs from equation (4) in the specification of relative

factor prices. In (16) demand depends on the ratio of the expected value of

w to the expected value of c, not on the ratio of factor prices or the

expectation of the ratio. When c and w do not follow the same stochastic

process, this implies that their lag structures should differ. To illustrate,

consider the situation in which the "true" cost of capital in the current

period is related to previous values by c                               c         + u
                                                                   t        t—1         t
where u is a zero mean,                          white   noise input.   Assume further            that measurement
of the cost of capital is subject to error, so that                                         =
                                                                                                c + Vt.
where               is the observed or measured cost, and v is a zero mean, white

noise input, independent of u. The process of determining an expected

cost of capital can be treated as a problem of choosing an optimal

predictor of .                        For simplicity we restrict the predictor to be a linear

combination of past observations of c. Assuming that the firm's objective

is to miniinize the mean square error of the forecast, the optimal predictor

of c can be expressed as

                                                                                                          (17)

which is the standard form for adaptive expectations.(see Nerlove). The parameter
     determines the shape of the distributed lag, and is a decreasing function

      The distributed lag given by (17:. is based on a highly simplified

stochastic process; a more realistic characterization would yield a much

ire complicated lag structure. The important point here, however, is that

the nature of the distributed lag depends on the characteristIcs of the

process generating observed values of w and c. Since wages and capital

costs are likely to follow different stochastic processes, the lag

structure associated with each will be different. As long as past

observations of w and c are used in forming expectations and the stochastic
                                                       w
processes generating w and c differ, E(w)            E(—) .   Hence, the
                                         E(c)

firm will not look at past values of ()         in   determining likely means of

the ratio of expected wages to expected costs of capital. Even though

variations in wage rates and capital costs may influence labor demand through

their effect on the relative price term, the firm must examine the past

history of each variable separately in forming expectations.

     The empirical implication of uncertainty in factor prices is that
W and C should be allowed to have different lag distributions in labor

demand analysis and thus that past values of these variables should enter

the equation separately. This is true even if we impose the long run

homogeneity constraint. While the ultimate long run effect of W and C

may be identical, the speed of adjustment and other aspects of the time

pattern of response may be quite different.

      Taken together, the presence of uncertainty and errors of measurement

Imply that the impact of wage rates and the cost of capital should be

examined   separately.   Ignoring adjustment costs for the moment, the basic

two—factor model can be written as


     Lt    a0
           e
              +1Q
               e
                  wlnEE)+8c1nE(c t )                                       (18)
                                                                     12


If, as noted earlier, we assume that    planned   output is based on a forecast

of shipments, then Q can be replacecf by expected real shipments E(St).

Depending on the specification of expectation formation, Lt will depend on

current and lagged values of the variables, and lags in the system will

be solely attributed to problems of information and uncertainty. Adjustment

costs can be introduced through an equation like (3), so that (18) becomes

              aO
          =        + . lnE(s) —
                                  -lnE(w)   + lnE(c)].+ (l_p)Li       (19)

     Clearly, (19) may be rewritten to eliminate Ltl so that L depends

only on current and past values of the independent variables. Lags due

to adjustment costs would be confounded with lags due to expectations, and

without   further restrictions the separate influence of each could not be

identified. However, sorting out the separate influence of expectations

and adjustment costs and determining the specific time pattern of response

is of secondary importance in the current analysis. In terms of evaluating

the elasticity of demand, the precise pattern of adjustment and the source

of lags in the system are of interest only insofar as they affect estimates

of the elasticity parameter or raise questions about the appropriate model
of demand. With respect to estimated elasticities, empirical evidence to

be presented in Section III shows that different adjustment processes affect

the timing but not the magnitude of the estimated demand response.

Accordingly we shall focus on the question of whether all independent

variables have the same lag distribution. If a common distributed lag

caniot be rejected, it could be argued that adjustment costs are the

principal source of lags and that the lagged effects of the independent

variables work through the latent variable L* as posited in the standard

flexible accelerator model. Significant differences in the lag structure

will reject the standard adjustment model and provide support for the
                                                                             7

III Empirical Results

     This section presents estimates of the models of labor demand developed

in section II using data for U.S. manufacturing from first quarter 1950

to third quarter 1976. We focus first on the size of elasticity estimates

obtained with models of the firm that have different specifications of

relative prices and processes of adjustment. Subsequent analysis examines
the effect of changes in several assumptions on the estimated elasticities.

The principal finding is that, as long as wages and the price of capital

are allowed to have different impacts on demand for labor, the estimated

elasticities are quite sizeable, from 2 1/2 to 3 times the values obtained

when the variables are constrained to have the same impact.



Estimates of the 2—factor model

     The basic empirical framework used in this section is provided by

a fairly general form:


     Lt*[a+Z1b.S._
           1=0
               iti wE2dW
                    1=0

                                    t                                        (20)


where c   is   the error term and all variables are in logs. The data used
cover the manufacturing sector as described in table 1. L is the log of

production worker employment, S is the log of shipments, W is the log

average hourly earnings, and C is log of the cost of capital, all expressed

in real terms by deflating by the WPI for manufacturing.

     The distributed lags in (20) will be examined along three lines.

To develop a benchmark we will impose the constraint that the lag

distributions follow a geometric pattern, with b =
                                                      d1=   in.
                                                              1
                                                                  for   all 1, so
                                                                      14


(20) may be estimated with a Koyck lag. This constraint will then be

relaxed, and the lag weights estimated using Almon polynomials. Finally,

unconstrained lagged values of the independent variables will be

entered into the equations. The length of the lag appropriate for each

variable will be chosen empirically, based on minimizing the error sum

of squares.

     Our principal focus in the analysis which follows is the magnitude of
   and        Given the methods of estimation outlined above, estimates of

   and    (and 0) can be obtained only under the assumption that

Ebj =     =        =   1, since no attempt will be made to estimate the long
              Em
run parameters and the lag weights separately. The assumption holds exactly

for the Koyck lag, and seems reasonable in the other situations as well.

It should be noted that the most likely alternative is that the sum of the

weights is less than one. Thus if the unity constraint on the sum of

the weights is not true, it is likely that the estimated long run elasticities

will be downward biased.

     Table 2 presents estimates of equation (20) under several specifications

of the lag structure and relative prices. In columns 1 and 2 a Koyck

lag has been imposed; column 3 presents results with an unconstrained

lag, while column 4 contains results when the coefficients

 ollow a second degree polynomial. The relative prices are entered separately

in each column except the first, where the long run homogeneity constraint

is imposed. The estimated elasticity of demand for labor in co1inn 1,

which imposes the same lag distribution on the two variables, is

consistent with other results in the literature: the long run elasticity

of —.19 is of the same magnitude as Hamermesh's summary value —.15

(Hamermesh, 1976). We argued earlier that imposition of the constraint
                                                                    15

of    ÷     — 0 may not be appropriate in the presence of measurnent


error and uncertainty. Entering the prices separately finds empirical

support in column 2, where C and W obtain
                                            very different coefficients. The
 evidence suggests a wage elasticity of —.253 in the short run, and a

value of —.463 over the longer term. The cost of capital, in contrast,

is estimated to have a short run impact of .062 and a long run

effect of .114. Thus, both wage rates and the cost of capital are found

to influence the demand for labor, with wages estimated to have an impact

about four times as large. These results imply that models which specify

identical, opposite signed effects of factor prices are not consistent

with the data.8 It appears that one reason for the small elasticities

found in previous work is imposition of a model ( +        = 0) which is
rejected by the data.

     The results in columns 1 and 2 are based on a model of the adjustment

process in which changes in wages and the cost of capital influence

labor demand through their effect on desired employment.    Costs of adjustment

yield a lagged response which has the same time pattern in all variables.

The assumption of a conon geometric lag structure is dropped in columns 3—4

and more general lag distributions estimated.   Changing the lag structure
has little impact on the magnitude of long run elasticities of demand

for labor. The long run wage parameter lies between —.472 and —.489,

while the long run output elasticity ranges from 1.058 to 1.069. Only

in the case of the cost of capital did the lag secficaton have nv

impact on the magnitude of the elasticity. In experiments
                                                            not reported here,

shortening the lag from 8 to 3 quarters reduces the effect by almost 30 percent.
The magnitude of the capital cost elasticity was sensitive to the

length of the lag up until about 8 quarters out. Beyond that point the

value of the coefficient remained relatively close to 0.100.

     The actual lag structures in the variables, given In figure 1,

suggests that the lagged response to changes in the cost of capital Is

 somewhat slower than the response to shifts in sales, and quite a bit

 slower than the response to changes in the wage. The strikingly different

 pattern of response shown in figure 1 is consistent with an uncertainty!

 expectations rationale for lagged adjustment, in which the speed and pattern

 of adjustment depends on the stochastic structure generating observed

values of the independent variables. The longest response time is in

 the variable with the highest noise—to—signal ratio, the cost of capital.

 In contrast, firms appear to respond relatively rapidly to changes in wage

rates which are more easily predicted. The differences in lag response

provide further npirica1 justification for treating wages and the cost of

capital sepatately, and for relaxing the assumption of a cotmnon lag distribution.

     Given the preceding adjustments to the basic 2—factor model, the

evidence suggests that the wage elasticity of demand for production workers

in manufacturing lies between —.15 and —.20 in the short run (one quarter),

with the full effect of approximately —.48 completed after 2—3 quarters.




Analysis of assumptions

     The elasticity estimates in table 2 are based on a 2—factor model of

the production process, in which the firm treats prices as parameters and

input decisions are made conditional on an output plan derived from a sales

forecast. The 2—factor framework ignores the influence of variation in
other factors of production by implicitly assuming that they move in proportion

to changes in the number of production workers or that they are fixed. The model
further assumes that sales can be treated as an exogenous term, thereh

ignoring questions of simultaneity in the determination of output

employment1 and factor prices. Finally, the adjustment process underlying

the basic results does not allow for feedback between the factors of

production of the type stressed by Nadiri and Rosen, among others.

 several of these postulates. For comparison, line 1 reproduces the coefficients

 from the basic model (column 2, table 2). The potential impact of simultaneity

 is examined in lines   2—4. In    line 2 we treat shipments as endogenous,

 instrumenting it on the exogenous measures of aggregate demand specified

 in the table note. In line 3, we instrument factor prices as well as

shipments on the aggregate demand measures. Use of the demand side instruments

in lines 2 and 3 has    very   little effect on the estimated coefficients.

As expected, the long run elasticity increases somewhat, but the change

is marginal. In line 4 we shift from demand to supply factors, instrumenting

the real wage on measures of shifts in supply. With the supply instruments,

the short run elasticity increases by 20 percent, while the estimated

long run impact is —.53. This suggests the possibility that the "demand

relation" between employment and wages in the data is contaminated by

simultaneity on the supply side leading to underestimates of the elasticity

of demand.

       Expansion of the 2—factor model to include additional inputs (non—

production workers, inventories) requires more complete data on factor prices.

As Nadiri and Rosen have shown, appropriate measures would include wage

rates, fringe benefits, search and training costs,-and inventory carrying

costs. The availability of such data would permit a distinction between

stock and flow demands, and would allow       estimation of the elasticity of
demand for production workers holding constant the prices of additional

relevant inputs. The full range of factor price data is not available on

a time series basis,and the usual procedure is to assume that all         facets
of   the user cost of labor and   the   price of inventories   vary proportionally
with   average hourly earnings, or the cost of capital. Without additional

data, the implications of this assumption cannot be examined.         However,

some feel for the influence of additional inputs may be obtained by
                                                                           using

available data on hours per worker, the number of non—production workers and

the stock of capital to modify our estimating equations further.

Dependent variable is the log of production worker employment except in lines 5 and 6, where the dependent variable is              =

'Instruments (in addition to current and lagged values of included exogenous variables): real government expenditures
 on durable and nondurable goods and services (both federal ar.d state and local) real exports of goods and services, and

Instruments were the same      as   in (2) except that current and lagged values of C were excluded.
Instruments (in addition to the current and lagged values of included e:oqenous variables) were: labor furre less manu-
facturing production workers; compensation per manhour in private nonfarm sector deflated by the CPI.
     is total compensation per manhour deflated by the WPI for manufacturing.
Non production labor entered the equation with a coefficient (and standard error) of —0.06 (0.04).
Capital entered the equation with a coefficient (and standard error) of 0.02 (0.03).
The other coefficients (standard errors) were as follows: constant —.02 (.61); TIME —.003 (.0002); inventories —.03 (.05):
capital .03 (.03); hours per worker —.02 (.17); non—production workers —.02 (.05).

        In lines 5 arid   6   we have altered the dependent variable to reflect
manhours. and tctal employment         rather   than   employment   of production workers.
With manhours as the dependent variable, the coefficient
                                                         on real wages rises
while    that   on the lagged adjustment term falls. Since hours are likely
to   respond    more quickly than employment, this is a reasonable result.
The long run elasticity is somewhat larger than that obtained in the
production employment calculations. Changing the dependent variable to
total employment by inclusion of nonproductjon workers in line 6 has the
opposite effect: the short run elasticity with respect to wages falls; the
estimated adjustment coefficient declines, as does the long run elasticity.
This reflects the addition of a relatively quasi—fixed factor (nonproduction
workers) to the dependent variable.

other control variables are added to the regressions: employment of non—
production workers (line 7) and the stock of capital (line 8). Addition of
these                        impact on estimated elasticities. In line 7,
        variables has a slight

the long run response falls to 0.42, while controlling for the capital stock
in line 8 raises the estimate to —.49. In the absence of a complete
system of demand equations, however, the long run elasticities implied by
the adjustment process are to be viewed          as    no more than illustrative of
the impact of specification changes on estimates. In the long run, one
clearly does not want to hold these other inputs fixed.9
        An alternative more desirable way of treating additional inputs is
to analyze interrelations in terms of the effect of discrepancies between
actual and desired levels of other inputs. One way of doing this is                   to

generalize the flexible accelerator as in:
        Xit=ZjX"
              i it—xit—l )                                                     (21)

where X's are inputs (see Nadiri and Rosen). Assuming X' is determined by
expected sales and relative prices, solution of (21) for X yields an equaticn
similar to the basic Koyck lag model, with the addition of lagged values of all
other inputs. In the current setting, interrelated adjustment is examined
                                                                          22

   by relating production worker employment to the usual variables, but

   including lagged values of hours—per—worker, inventories, non—production

   employment, and the capital stock (all variables In logs). The results

   are presented in line 9 and footnote 8 of table 3. Allowing for interrelated

   adjustment has only a marginal effect on the short run ilasticity, which

   falls to —.24. To calculate a long run elasticity it is necessary to

   estimate comparable equations for all inputs and solve the resultant

  difference equation system. For production workers, this procedure yields

  a long run elasticity of —.49. Together with the evidence in table 2, these

  results underscore the point that alternative lag structures have little

  impact on the estimated elasticity.


  IV Conclusion

       The examination of demand for labor in this paper has yielded

  substantive empirical results regarding the magnitude of the elasticIty of

  demand and more technical findings regarding alternative model struc'ttres.
       The principal finding is that   under   a variety of specifications, che

  elasticity of demand for production labor is quite sizeable, far from the

  very small estimates traditionally found in the literature. The low

  elasticities found in previous work appear to be due to the imposition

  of the long run homogeneity constraint in the presence of measurement

  error. We have found that while our basic results are invariant to

  changes in the lag structure, the data reject both the imposition of identical

  lag structures on the explanatory variables, and the restriction of equal

  opposite signed factor price coefficients. The rejection of a cotmnon

  lag structure on all explanatory variables suggests the need for new

  models of the adjustment process in the labor market, with emphasis on

  the role of uncertainty and expectations.

       The evidence that demand for labor is more responsive to changes in real

  wages than had been previously thought suggests that greater attention be

  given to policIes, like employment tax credits, which seek to stimulate

-__employment by inducing movements along demand schedules.

     monthly by the Department of Commerce. The trough for the 1973—1975 recession

     has   not        been officially determined and our use of 1975:1 is only an approximation.

    5Since the model in equation (6) is based on adjustment lags, the assumption is

     that   expectations            are static. A similar geometric distribution could,

     however, be generated assuming expectations for all variables were

     formed according to adaptive expectations.

7The analysis in the text follows existing literature by analyzing demand

for labor by an individual cost—minimizing firms and thus on the fixed output

demand elasticity. Because the data relate to industry level aggregates,

however, questions arise about whether models of the firm offer the

appropriate tool of analysis. The principal difference between the fixed—

output demand schedule of a firm and the industry—level demand schedule

relates to the exogeneity of the scale of output. Whereas the cost—minimizing

firm takes output as exogenous and the profit—making firm takes the price

of output as exogenous, the level of output and price are endogenous

variables to the industry. As is well known, with price and output endogenous,

the elasticity of demand depends not only on substitution but also on

"scale effects." An increase in the wage reduces demand for labor by

causing substitution against labor and also by reducing industry output

through increased costs and prices. An increase in the price of capital,

by contrast, raises demand for labor by causing substitution toward labor

but also reduces demand for labor by reducing industry output through

increased costs and prices. The differential scale and sul.stitution effects

induced by capital price changes compared to those induced by wage changes

provides another reason for relaxing the assumption that W an C enter the

demand equation with equal opposite signs.
        Estimates of industry demand curves with output endogenous require,

however, detailed investigation of the factors that shift the demand for output,

which goes beyond the scope of the current analysis (see Houthakker and

Taylor for empirical estimates of demand for industry ouput). Hence, no effort is

made in   this   study to estimate the indusry level demand curves. Since we

focus   solely on fixed—output demand relations, the "full" elasticity
of demand for labor exceeds the estimates on    our   models.
                                                                                25
8The important finding that the relative factor price model if rejected
                                                                        by
 the data can be examined in another way. Associated with the optimal level

 of employment is a factor price frontier relating price of output to the

 price of inputs. With a Cobb—Douglas constant returns production function

 the factor price frontiers can be written as

      (1) P        ctW + (].-a)C + aT

 where P =   ldg   of output price; W =    log    of wage rate; C =   log   of cost of capital;
 and T =   time, used to index of technical change. If the quarterly data lie on
 the long run frontier regressions of P on W, C and T should yield positive

 coefficients on the two input prices with coefficients that sum, at least

 approximately, to unity. After considerable effort to obtain estimates

 consistent with the model, the following "best" results were obtained:

      (2) P = —0.622 + 0.311 W — 0.075 C + 0.003T                                        0.999

      (3) P = —0.482 + 0.409 W + 0.068 C + 0.693 P                                   =
                                                   —i —0.003                        0.998
                   (0.122) (0.140)      (0.024)      (0.098)    (0.001)     GxlO3 = 7.83

 where the calculations include a correction for second—order autocorrelatjon.

 In (2) the coefficients sum to .23; in (3), where a simple geometric distribution

 is applied, they sum to 1.55 due to the high correlation between P and

Both sums of the coefficients diverge
                                              significantly from unity, providing
further evidence against the standard relative factor price model. The

model simply does not fit the data.

9The proper way to deal with several inputs is to imbed
                                                                 the   labor demand

function into a consistent system of factor demand relations. As a further

check on our empirical findings we estimated elasticities of demand from

a three input translog cost function, using annual data on production

workers, nonproduction workers, and capital. While most attention has been

given to the translog production function in analysis, we believe that the

translog cost function offers a more fruitful means of
                                                                 estimating the elasticity
of demand. The factor demand equations obtained from the cost function

relates shares to factor prices, consistent with the single equation models,
                                                                                         26
while the production function relates shares to factor quantities. In

analyzing a single sector such as manufacturing the first specification seems

more plausible.

         Given factor prices and input levels, we calculated cost as the sum of

factor outlays and then derived the cost shares by division. We treated

technological change as an additional input, estimated as the rate of growth

of total cost deflated by the price of output less a weighted average of

input growth weights, with input shares in cost as weights.

         The parameters of the constrained translog cost system were jointly estimated

using an iterative version of Zeliner's minimum distance estimator. To correct.

for the possible endogenous determination of factor prices we combined the

iterative Zeilner procedure with two stage least squares using the same

instruments as in the single equation analysis (see table 3, note 2). This

iterative version of three stage least squares is asymptotically equivalent

to full information maximum likelihood (see Berndt, Hall, Hall and Hausman).

        With the full translog constraint only two of the share equations are

needed. Assuming neutral technical change the blue collar and white collar

share equations are:

Solving the systn for the elasticity of demand for labor (see Binswanger)

for the algebraic methodology) yielded an estimated elasticity of demand

for production worker labor of —.58 with a standard error of .25. This estimate

is consistent with the single equation 6timates in the text.   For   further

analysis of the translog estimates see Clark and Freeman.
