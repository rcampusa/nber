                 Forgiveness, Indexation, and Investment Incentives




                                          ABSTRACT



     We compare different indexation schemes in terms of their ability to facilitate
     forgivenessand reduce the investment disincentives associated with the large LDC
     debt overhang. Indexing to an ertdogenous variable (e.g., a country's output)
     has   a negative moral hazard   effect on investment,  This problem does not arise
     when payments are linked to an exogenous        variable such as commodity prices.

     Nonetheless, indexing payments to output may be useful when debtors know
     more about their willingnessto invest than lenders. We also reach new conclusions
     about the desirability of default penalties under asymmetric information.

1. Introduction
      As the LDC debt crisis wears on, more and more observers doubt that the debts will
ever be paid in full. Since the loans began trading only two years ago on an established

secondary market, the average price of the debt has fallen steadily and substantially.1
Some observers have argued that the banks should considerexplicitly forgiving a portion
of the debt. Work by Jeffrey Sachs (1985, 1988) and Richard Portes (1987), among others,

suggeststhat partial forgiveness could conceivably make both debtors and creditors better
off: if the banks commit themselves to absorbing a smaller part of a country's output, the

country will be more likely to pursue the types of investment-oriented policies that lead
to higher future levels of output, thereby increasing the total resources available to both

parties.2
      Despite the apparent merit of this logic, there has not been much debt forgiveness to
date. It is easy to see why there might be problems in implementing a program of debt
relief. Even if some forgiveness was indeed in the interest of lenders, borrowers would

want much more. Just how much is enough, from the lender's point of view? The amount
of relief needed to stimulate investment in different countries will depend on a variety of
factors,someof which may be known only to borrowers. For example, a borrowing country
may have a better idea about the amount of austerity it can impose on its citizens without
causing serious disruptions.
    In negotiating over the amount                  of forgiveness, borrowing countries will want                      to mis

represent their private information in order to win more generousrelief. To continue with
the above example, once forgiveness is on the table, a country will want to claim that its
citizens are very resistant to further belt-tightening, so that a great deal of relief will be
needed to have a positive impact on investment.3

   'Ftom July 1985 to August 1987, the average price across 8 major debtors fell by 31 percent. The decline in the value of
individual country debt over this period was: Brazil (32 percent), Columbia (0 percent), Argentina (28 percent), Mexico (38
percent), Peru (82 percent), Ecuador (38 percent), the Philippines (11 percent), and Venezuela (20 percent)

   In this paper, we argue that changing the structure of LDC financing may help remove
some of the harriers to forgiveness. An indexation scheme that links repayment to a
country's future output could help distinguish the appropriate amount of relief on a case-
by-case basis. Such indexation would remove the need to rely on countries truthfully
revealing their private information.              Fix   post, a country that producesmore is likely to have
been the type better able to sacrifice for future growth; output serves as                             an   indicator of a

country's private information. Therefore, this type of output indexation facilitatesrelief.
    We are certainly not the first to consider the use of contingent debt as a means of

tying    a country's obligations to its ability to pay. Included among the many refinancing
proposals that have emerged are debt-for-equity swaps,4 interest-rate caps and moratoria,
as well as a variety of plans that involve indexed securities. One appealing feature of

many of these schemes is that they tilt the repayment schedule toward the future, when
countries are likely to have higher income. Increasing current liquidity seems like a good

idea given the 5.5 percent decline in GNP per capita and the 5 percent fall in investment

   percent of GNP witnessed by the largest debtors since the onset of the debt crises.
as a

However, unlike previous authors, we do not focus on the use of contingent obligations
as   a way of extending the payment period, as this can be achieved with any instrument,
including standard, noncontingent bank loans. Our concern lies instead with the incentive
distortions created by the sheer presence of a large debt overhang, and with the ability of
alternative indexationplans to reduce these distortions.
     The indexed obligations envisaged in many reform plans can he divided into two basic

categories. The first are those in which payments are linked to an endogenous variable
—    that is, a variable wbicb is at least partly under the control of the debtor country.                                  A

leading example is Norman Bailey's (1983) proposal to convert debt into proportional
claims on exports. Other possible endogenous indices are the country's total output, or
its trade balance. The second category of indexationplan links payments to an exogenous
variable, one out of the debtor country's control. A natural choice of index here would be
the priceof a country's principal export commodityor the growth rate of the industrialized
countries.
     The primary purpose of this paper is to provide an analysis of the relative pros and cons
of these two types of indexation. Some researchers have failed to recognize the importance
of the distinction between the two. For example, both Donald Lessard (1987) and Helpman

(1987) have argued that some sort of output indexation might he beneficial as         a risk-
sharing,   or hedging mechanism: risk-averse countries could shift some of their exposureto
better diversified lenders. While this may be true, it does not imply that output indexation
is the best way to accomplish risk sharing — commodity-priceindexation may be better.

    Krugman (1987a) does make the distinction between the two types of indexing. He
concludes that commodity price indexation is preferable to linking payments to a variable
that is under the debtor's control. The reason for this is the presence of moral hazard: if
a debtor's payments are increasingin exports,    it will have less incentive to generate such
exports than in the absence of such   anarrangement.
     Our analysis calls for a softening of Krugman's conclusions, We find that indexing
to an endogenous variable such as output may be a sensible strategy under some circum-
stances. As the earlier discussion suggests, such output indexation will have a role to play
when asymmetric information about some factor relevant to the financial contract is impor-
tant. Output indexinghelps to resolve someof the adverse selection (or misrepresentation)
problems associated with this asymmetricinformation, in a way that commodity-price in-
dexing cannot. Thus in spite of the moral hazard costs it entails, output indexing may be
worthwhile.
    To oversimplify somewhat, we find that the preferred form of indexing will depend

                                             3
on the nature      of   the uncertainty facing the lender and borrower. If the uncertainty is
about a symmetrically-observable         variable (future commodity prices, for instance) then

commodity-price indexing will             be better. However, if there is uncertainty about certain
attributes of the debtor country, then there will be a gain from adding output-indexing
features to the security. The analysis therefore implies that schemes such as Bailey's may
be valuablein a world where it is difficult to evaluate the legitimacy                        of countries'    appeals

for relief.
                                                                          is that it leads

allow the bank to extract larger payments from the country, but at

information case are altered once there is asymmetric information about the borrower's

willingness to invest. Section 5 concludes.


2.   The Model
    The model has three periods. At date 0, the country and the bank attempt to rene-
                                                                           the country
gotiate the country's existing debt, which comes due at date 2. At date I,
allocatesits initial endowment, E, between consumption and investment, given the repay-
ment schedule it will be facing. Because there is no debt to service at date I, investment at
this time is not "liquidity constrained." Rather, as will become clear shortly, the presence
of a debt overhang at date 2 can lead investment to be "incentive constrained."7 Finally,
at date 2 output from the investment project becomes available for consumption and debt
service.
      The country is assumed to have the following linear utility function over consumption
at dates 1 and 2:
                                                                                                        (1)

                      2) /3 is private information of the country.
    The latter case is intended to capture the spirit of the example in the introduction,
where it was suggested that a borrowing country will have a better idea about the amount
of current austerity its citizens are willing to tolerate.

       At date 1, the country can invest an amount I, which yields 9 units of output at date
2:

                                                         Q=f(I),                                                           (2)

where f(I) is a concave increasing function.
      The total revenue from production, X, depends on the "commodity price,"                                      9


                                                    X = 99 = 9f(I)                                                         (3)

We assume that 9 is unknown               at date 0, hut is observed at date 1 by both the bank and the
country.8 The variable 9 can represent any publicly-observable shock affecting                                    the value
of output.
       Webegin the analysis by considering the case in which the country's debt obligation
in period 2 is a fixed constant, D. To keep things simple, we assume that the hank will be
able to recover all of the country's revenue, up to the face amount of the debt, D. That

is, the country's repayment at time 2, R, will be:9


                                                     R = min(X, D)

      Now consider the country's investnìent decision                       at date     1.   The country knows that
it will not get to keep all the output from its investment, and hence it may be reluctant

to invest. (This is what was meant by the statement that investment was "incentive
constrained.") Clearly, if the debt is so high that the repayment, R, would equal the total
value of output, X, the country would not invest                         at all, and would instead consume its
endowment        at date     1.
   The complete resolutionof commodity     price uncertainty at date 1, beforethe good io sold, may appear ,oncealiotic, oince
there may be further change between dates I and 2. llawever, all that is important far thi, model is that there he sante
informationrevealed about commodityprices betweenthe time of renegotiationand the inve,tment decision. For example, we
could make the random walk assumptionthat date 2 price is A, + A,, and that only A, is learned at date 1.
   °Models ofsovereignlendingrest upon the assumption that the hank can impooe a penalty on the co,mtry when it default,.
For now we aooume that if the country defaults,the hank confiscatesall of the cosuitry's ot,tp,,t. Later we relax this assumption
and consider a model in whichthe country can confiscateup to a finite amount IC of the co,ntry's output from the investment
project.

    Investment becomes a possibility only when the debt, D, is lower than the revenue
that would be generatedby the investment,so that R = D. In such a case, if the country
does pursue the investment opportunity, it would choose the level of investmentso as to

maximize:
                                max /3(91(I) — D) —        I + B.                          (5)

The first order conditions for this problem are:

                                        /39ff(J*)   = 1.                                   (6)

That is, if the country does invest, it will choose a level of investment, 1*, that is socially
optimal. However, it is not assured that the debt payment will be low enough that the

country will want to invest at all. If the country does invest, its utility will be:

                             U(I") = r3(ef (I") — D) — I" + B.                             (7)

    If, on the other hand, the country consumes all its endowment        at date 1, its utility
will be E. Thus investment will take place only if the debt payment is less than the critical
level D", given by:
                                        = 91(1") — 1"/,3                                   (8)
    A simple   comparativestatic exercise establishesthe following proposition:


    Proposition 1: D" is increasing in both 9 and /3

    The amount of debt overhangthat is compatible with the first-best level of investment
increases with both the commodity price (which just measures the marginal productivity

of investment) and the "patience"   of the country.


3. Optimal Financing Arrangements under Symmetric Information about                       /3

    Suppose    that /3 is common knowledge. From the bank's point of view, what sort of
financing scheme most efficiently resolves the investment-disincentive problem associated
with a large debt overhang? There are three possiblechoices:

                                              7
       1)   Pure debt relief, in which the debt payment, D, is reduced from its                             earlier level

of D0, but is still fixed across states of the world;
       2)   Commodity-price indexation, in which the payment is made contingent on the
outcome of 8; or
     3) Output indexation, in which the payment is made contingent on the other ob-
servable variable, X, the value of output.

3.1.   Pure Debt Relief
    Equation (8) tells us that if the initial level of debt, D0, is too high, the bank may
benefit from lowering it. While lowering the level of debt reduces the amount the bank
can recover in states where 8 is high (and the country would have been prepared to pay

more)       it increases the probability that 8 is high enough to induce investment.
       The optimal level of debt relief is determinedby trading off these two considerations.
Note, however,    that pure debt relief is a rather crude instrument: at the optimal level
there will still be some states of the world for which the country finds it unattractive to
invest. This results in an efficiency loss.

3.2. Commodity-Price Indexation
       Under symmetric information,               a commodity-price-indexed security can be used to
maintain efficient investment in every state of the world. The indexingscheme is given by
equation (8): if the bank sets D(9) = Gf(V) — J*/f3, the country will always invest, and
the bank will always recover the maximum amount that is compatiblewith investment by
the country.10

3.3. Output Jndexation
       Output indexation is another way in which debt payments could be made to depend on
  tO
     In our model,the outcomeunder commodity.priccindexation can be replicated by a "muddling through5 policy in which
the country and bank wait until date 1 to determine the amount of debt relief. In reality, however, there may be reasons to
predeterminethe contract at date 0. Suppose the country must make a small initial outlay at date 0 to preserve its investment
project at date 1. If the two parties were to wait ,mtil date I to fix the ,lebt payment, the bank would be able to behave
opportunistically and extract more surplusfrom the country. Thus the opportunism associated with a muddling.through policy
leads to an ez-nte inefficiency the country is less willing to invest at date 0

                                                             8
the realization of 9, since the value of output, X = OQ = 01(1). With output indexation,
however, there is an undesirableside effect: if payments are increasing in X and therefore
                                                                            —



increasing in   I   —   the country will not want to choose the first-best level of investment when

it does invest.
    To see why this is so, think of the debt payment as a function of output: D = D(X).
Consider the country's maximization problem facing this payment schedule:

                                    max ,0(8f(I)   —
                                                       D(X)) — I + E.                              (9)


    Assuming        that D(X) is differentiable, the first-order conditions for this problem are:

                                    /39f1(j**) =   + DF(X)Ofl(I**).                              (10)

    If D'(X) is positive, then equation (10) implies that the level of investment chosen
under output indexation,         I,   is less than the efficient level given by equation (6). Hence

under symmetricinformation about 3, output indexation is strictly inferior to commodity-
price indexation, which always achieves first-best levels of investment.

4. The Role of Output Indexation under Asymmetric Information
     In each of the three schemes considered in the previous section, countries that are less
willing to invest receive more forgiveness. This is a step in the right direction. But in
practice these plans have a serious shortcoming. Once they are announced, each country
will have an obvious incentive to understate its willingness to invest. A country would

want to claim, for example, that current circumstances are already poor and that a further
decline in living standards cannot be tolerated. As long as creditors are uncertain about
the truthfulness of countries' claims, a debtor            will see in   these plans an opportunity to

procure more debt relief than it "deserves." Banks are thus reluctant to propose relief in
the first place.
     In this section we argue that although commodity-price indexation dominatesoutput
indexation in       a world of symmetric information,output indexation can be useful when
                                                       9
there is asymmetric information. In particular, we show that indexing debt to output
prevents countries from misrepresenting their willingness to invest, and thereby facilitates
debt restructuring. Countriesthat wish to invest more placehigher value on future output,
and are therefore more willing to pay for the right to produce more. Thus, by linking debt
payments to output, more ipatiento countries reveal themselves through their actions and
are prevented from getting itoo much" debt relief.
     To formalize this idea, we considera variation of the model in the foregoing section.
We assume         that the debtor country has private information about the rate at which it
discountsfuture consumption.To keep matters as simple as possible, we assume that the
debtor's discount factor can take one of only two values,                       g > PL,       where        = f3g with
probabilityp.11
    A contract in this setting specifies a payment at date 2 conditional on output, X. We
write this payment schedule as D(X). The payment can also he made contingent on 9,
so that for each realization of 8 there is a unique D(X) schedule. Since nothing is added
to the analysis by conditioning the contract on the mutually-observable variable 8,                                    we

simplify the notation by assuming that 8 is fixed (9 = 1) and write D = D(X).
      As in the previous section, the creditor makes a take-it-or-leave-it contract offer which
the country can accept or reject. The country will accept if its utility is greater under the
new contract than under the old one. We assume for the momentthat if the country were
obliged to pay the entire debt overhang, D0, no investment would take place. (We drop
this assumption later.) Thus, the country will accept the offer as long as the contract
provides for discounted consumption greater than the country's endowment, E.
      One way        of determining the optimal contract is to solve directly for the optimal

payment schedule, D(X). An alternative approach, developed in the incentives literature,
reframes the problem as a direct revelation game. In that game, the country reports its

                                                                                       l

                            If the country reports flj, it must produce output, X1,
private information, PH or f3L•
and pay an amount, D, i = H,L. Thus a contract specifies two pairs {Xg,Dff} and
{XL,DL} from which the country can choose. The Revelation Principle implies that the
solution to this game will yield the same solution as the original game and is without loss
of generality.Althoughthe revelation framework may seem artificial, it provides a simple
and intuitive method for identifying the optimal contract, In our model, X is a monotonic
transformationof I, so that we can equivalently write the payment schedule as D(I), and
the contracts as the pairs {Ig,DH} {IL,DL}.'2
    The bank's problem is to maximize its expected payments subject to the constraints
that (i) the country reports its type truthfully (incentive compatibility); and (ii) each
type of country accepts the contract only if it provides utility greater than E (individual
rationality). The optimal contract, {I, b1}, that induces both types to sign the contract
is the solution to the program,          (P):

                                            max   pDH+(l-p)DL,                                                   (P)

                                                      —
                                                          DH) — 'H        0,                                (IRH)

                                                                    'L   0.                                  (IRL)

      The first two constraints are the incentive compatibilityconstraints, which guarantee
that neither country receives greater utility from revealing its true type than from pre-
tending it is of the other type. The last two constraints ensure that each type of country
prefers some investment to consumption of its entire endowment                        at date 0.

     It follows from the results of the foregoing section that if there were complete infor-

mation, the contract chosen by banks would involve


                                       D7=9f(I*)_I*/I31, i=H,L.                                                        (11)

But note that if /3 were not observable and this scheme were adopted, a                               -type country
would always report that its discount factor is low, I3L Thus                         the optimal contract under
symmetric information is no longer optimal from the banks' point of view under asymmetric
information.
     It turns out that at an optimum only incentive constraint (ICH) and                                  individual ra-

tionality constraint (IRL) are binding. (The intuition for this is provided below.) The
following proposition, which is the main focus of the paper, is verified in the Appendix.13


      Proposition 2: If /3 is privately observed by the country, the optimal contracts,
{IL,bL}, {IH,bH} exhibit the following properties:
    (i) The /9H-type country chooses an efficient level of investment:                                  =   I. The      13L-

type country, however, underinvests relative to what is efficient:                         1L   <   I. Specifically,      1L

satisfies

                                         /3Lf'(IL)     =1       PPL/13H      > 1.                                      (12)


      (ii)   bL < D and L?g <                  D:       both countries pay less than in the symmetric-
information case. Given the chosen levels of investment, 1L and                                 Ig, the payments         b
and bH solve (ICH) and (IRL).


      If 13 is not observable, the optimal symmetric-information contract gives the fig-type
country an incentive to choose the contract intended for the fir-type. To provide an
incentive for the fig-typecountry to reveal its type, the bank lowers b11 below   In                              D.
addition, the contract contains disincentives for a /3H-type to report                              I3L A   country that

example, Sappington(1983). His model shares a similar formal structure although the exact interpretation differs

reports       = 1k must choose 1L below I.           The cost   of   this underinvestinentis greater for
a PH-type than for a       -type since a PH-type places greater value on future output.             By
making       it differentially costly for a PH-type to underreport its discountfactor, the bank is
able to extract a greater payment when the country truthfully reveals its type than when
the country always claims it is a /3k-type.


4.1. The Nature         of the Optimal Contract.
    In the contract given by Proposition 2, countries must willingly choose to produce
either XL or XH, and not an intermediatevalue. To guarantee they do this, the bank
can specify a complete schedule of payments for all possible levels of output, D(X). The

simplest such schedule is      a step function: if X < XL, the country must pay DL; and if
X> XL         the country must pay DH.
       This type of step function is,     of course, a     direct result of our assumption that there
are only two types of borrowers. A more realistic assumption might be that there are a
continuum of types, 3 E       Then it is straightforwardto show that the D(X) schedule
is   a continuous, increasing function. The upwards slope of the D(X) function leads all
types to underiavest, as was suggested by equation (10). The degree of the distortion is
lower for the high-P types. This can be seen in our two-type case, where, analogously, only
the PL-type suffers distorted investment.


4.2. Comparative Statics.
       The following comparativestatic results, which we prove in Appendix, are useful in
the analysis below:


       Proposition 3:
       (i) An increase in PH lowers 'L and DL, and increases bH and 1H

       (ii) An increase in 1k increases 'L' bL, lowers DH, and has no effect on 'H-

       (iii) An increase in   p lowers   1L   and   L, increases DH, and has no effect on
                                                      13
    The first two parts of the proposition characterizethe effect of making the two types of
country more unlike each other. Under symmetricinformation a change in ,8 should have
no effect on the investment and debt relief of a f31-type country. If the bank is uninformed

      ,
about however, a higher 9g implies less investment by the 13L-type country. This follows
                                                          To induce the country to reveal
because the incentive to underreport increases with
its true preferences, the lender forces the L-type country to give up more output at the
margin.
   The last part of the proposition says that as the probability that the country has a high
discount factor increases, the investment inefficiency imposed on a -type country rises,
while the payments DH and DL rise and fall, respectively. The intuition for these results

is that banks' expected profits depend increasingly on the size of the surplus extracted
from the H-type country when p is higher. In these circumstances,the bank takes more

of the surplus from the fIjj-type while raising the investment disincentives for a -type.

4.3. Comparison with Pure Debt Relief.
     The ability to index debt to output clearly makes lenders better off; by revealed
preference it dominatespure debt relief. The questionwe address in this section is whether
society is better off under output indexationor pure debt relief.
                that the bank cannot make debt relief contingent on output or invest-
     Suppose first
ment. Since the country would always claim that it is the more impatient type, the
amount of debt relief cannot depend on      :DH equals DL. If the bank sets the debt pay-
ment low enough, both types of countries will invest. Conditionalon both types investing,
it will offer the lowest possible debt relief, namely     D.
                                                          Alternatively, the bank might

offer less debt relief, in which case the /IIL-type country would not invest. Conditional

on only the /3H-type investing,     it will offer the minimum possible debt relief, D. More
generous debt relief is optimal provided     D > pD or, in terms of investment, provided
f(Ifl — I//3L > (f(I) — I//3H).
     By offering debt relief of   D, the lender ensures that there will be an efficient level of
                                                14
 investment regardless of the country's type. Less generous relief reduces the probability
 of investment,     but increases the amount the lender receives when investment does occur.
 Such a policy, which we refer to as "stonewalling," may raise the bank's expected profits

but results in a gross inefficiency: a j31,-type country undertakes no investment at all.'4
When stonewalling does not occur — that is, when debt relief is generous — the country
undertakes efficient investment, regardless of its type. Stonewalling is more attractive to
the bank, and hence the likclihood of an inefficiency is greater, the greater is the probability
that the country is the PH-type, the higher                is   PH and the lower is PL.
       Now suppose  that the lender can index the debt to output. Stonewalling will not
arise: the lender and the country always come to terms. By providing a screening mecha-

nism, output indexation loosens up the bargaining process and facilitates investment. By

comparison, pure debt relief is            a blunt method because it does not allow the amount                       of

forgiveness to be conditioned on the country's type.
       Whenever stonewalling would occur under pure debt relief, the output-indexed debt
contract derived in Proposition2 leads to a higher average level of investment. The contract
{   i, Djj, I = H, L, induces the f3-type country to invest an amount greater than zero
(albeit less than the optimum). When stonewalling would not occur, however, pure debt
contracts lead to a higher average level of investment. Under pure debt relief, both types
of country will invest the efficient amount. The following proposition summarizes the
intuition that stonewalling becomes more attractive the greater are                          p   and PH, and the
lower is PL:


      PropoBition 4 For large enough p and PH, and                enough PL stonewalling is
                                                                             low

optimal if the bank is restricted to pure debt relief. In such cases, output-indexedcontracts
would result in greater efficiency. In all other cases, pure debt relief is more efficient.

4.4. Extensions:
    Bounded Debt Overhang. The above analysis assumes that the initial debt over-
                                                                                     relief:
hang, D0, is so large that no investment would take place in the absence of any debt
D0    >   D > DL. This section relaxes this assumption.   We find that in general, lower ini-

tial debt levels lessen tbe incentive for misrepresentation, and hence lead to more efficient
investment.
       In   the case where   D > D > D0, the /31-type country chooses efficient investment
even without debt relief. Indeed, in this case there is no scope for debt relief; total output
is   maximized. Any increase in the surplus the country retains is offset one-for-one by     a
loss in     the surplus extracted by the bank.
       There are two intermediatecases:     13 > a > D0 > DL      and bjq   > D0 > a >    DL,
where   a is a cutoff point defined in the proposition below. Absent renegotiation,in either
case the -type country chooses efficient investment while the -type does not invest
at all. The optimal contract thereforesolves the maximization problem (F) except for a
new individual rationality constraint for the    -type country:
                         PH(f(IH)-DH-IH PH(f(1H) -Do)-Ih.                              (IRH')

Let (F') be this new maximizationproblem and let {I,D} denote its solution.
     An argument identical to that in the proof of Proposition 2 establishes that    I = I.
That proof also established that the individual rationality constraint (IRH) is slack when
D9 is infinite and reservation utility is E, Here, however, reservation utility is greater than
E. Indeed, if the level of debt that solves the original program, DH, is greater than D0,
the solution to (P) will not solve (F'). Instead, (IRH') will be binding and Dr = D0.
     What are the implication7 for efficiency? Under the new constraint, the $-type
receives more relief. Therefore it is less attractive for a flu-type to misrepresent its pref-
erences. When D0 is greater than DL, but less than the cutoff point, a, both types of

countriesinvest efficiently. The bank sets = IL because the original debt burden is small
                                                 16
enough that a 13H-type country has no incentive to misrepresent its preferences, even when
the /3.type invests efficiently. That is, at low enough levels of debt, the (ICH) constraint
is not binding. When D0 is greater than the cutoff point a, (ICH) is binding. Thus to

induce truthtelling,         I must      fall below    I. Investment is no longer fully efficient. Finally,
when the initial debt overhangexceeds DH, we are in the base case analyzed above. These
results are summarizedin the following proposition and proved formally in the Appendix:


     Proposition 5: Let the cutoff point be a = f(I) —    —
                                                            (fl'—   i—)I, which
implies that DH > a > D. The initial debt overhang, D0, must fall into one of the
following four cases:

       (i) If D0         [0, Dfl,   there is no scope for renegotiation. Both types of countries choose
efficient investment, Ij            = I, i = L, H, and pay D0.            In   this case the debt overhang is not
a problem.
       (ii) If Do E       (D,a[, both types of country               choose efficient investment; the flL-type

pays   D and the I3Htype pays D0.
       (iii) If D0   e (a, DH[, the NH-type chooses efficient investment                       and pays D0, and the
L-type country underinvests, 'L <                       <   I. In this case, an increasein D0 exacerbates
the inefficiency         (I falls).
       (iv) If D0 e (bH,co[, thesolution to (P') is the solution to (P). A change in D0 does
not affect the optimal contract.


       Bounded Penalties. The above analysis assumes that the lender is able to confiscate
the country's entire output             if   the country defaults, This section relaxes this assumption

the following proposition:

                                                                            of
       Proposition 6: If the bank can impose a fixed penalty, K, in the case default,
then Proposition 5 holds, with D0 replaced in every instance by K.


       The intuition for Proposition 6 corresponds exactly to that of Proposition 5. In part

(i),   when penalties are very low, both types will choose efficient levels of investment. In

part (ii), penalties remain low enough that no investment distortion is needed to induce
truthteiling. The basic idea in (iii) is that the penalties are high enough to enable the bank
to extract some surplus from the country, thus reducing the country's incentive to invest.
If K < DH, the payment OH is not feasible, and thereforethe payment must be reduced
to K. If K is lower, truthful revelationbecomes more attractive and hence the bank need
not reduce 'L by as much to maintain incentive compatibility, in part (iv), when penalties
are very high, we have the case analyzed in (P).
     Our focus on asymmetric information leads to different conclusions about the de-
 sirability of penalties than the now-standard approach of Eaton, Gersovitz and Stiglitz

    In the   presence of   a large debt overhang, various indexation schemes may help to
improve  the investment incentives of borrower countries. Under symmetric information,

hand, contracts that make payments contingent on a variable that is atleast partly
the country's control, such as exports or total output, leave scope for moral hazard prob-
lems and so lead to inefficient investment. When there is asymmetric information about

    The same penalties that make sovereign lending possible in the first place, may be
harmful once the country has gotten into trouble. When penalties are high, the bank's

    The simplicity of our approach has its costs, in that we neglect important aspects
of the debt problem. We abstract entirely from liquidity issues. Yet current, not future,
debt-serviceobligations have recently been an important harrier to investment in hUGs.
Other authors, most notably Krugman (1985), have already stressed the fruitlessnessof
squeezing too much too fast out of debtors. While the liquidity squeeze

 to focus on the nature of these investment disincentives and on how they relate to debt
 indexation and forgiveness.

   Proof of Propoeition 2: First suppose that constraints(IRH) and (ICL) are slack.
We will then show that these constraints are indeed satisfied at an optimum.

(ICH) must be binding at an optimum, otherwise the objective function could be increased
         Djj.
by raising
    Given that (IRL) and (ICH) are binding, we can substitute them into the objective
function. The maximization then becomes:

         max              -              i   - P)(f(IL)              - P'L(— - I).
         'LIII P(f(IH) 'H/PH)                               IL/PL)          Pt     PH
    It is clear from the above problem that     Ij   is chosen efficiently and that 1, is as given

in the equation of the Proposition. Given It,       Dt solves (IRL).   Because 1j <     I, it must
be that fij < Di,. Finally, given that
positive, D11 must be less than
                                             Ijj =   I    and the right-hand side of (ICII)      is


    It remainsto verify that (IRH) and (ICL) are slack, Since the PH-type country could
have chosen the contract for the PL-type country, but did not, then the PH-type country
must be receiving positive surplus from undertaking the investment project.
     The following argument establishesthat (ICL) is indeed slack at an optimum. First,
note that from (ICH) and the fact that 'H > 1, it follows that f(IH)—DH > f(It)—Dr.

Given this, if PH is reduced to Pt   it results in a greater impact on the left-handside than
the right-hand side. Since (ICH) is binding, it means that:

                     —I + /3rAf(Iii) — DH) <1L + /3L(f('L) — DL),
which is exactly the constraint (ICL). This concludes the proof of Proposition 2.


    Proof of Proposition 3:      (i) Inspection   of (12) reveals that an increase in   g   reduces

I. Given this reduction, it follows from (IRL) that b is lowered. Since I = I, an

reduced. This combined with the increasein 13H enables the bank to increase DR.

    (ii) From (12) and (IRL), an increase in /3L increases 'L and h1. This increases
the right-hand side of (ICH) and given that 'H            =       is   unaffected by 8L' DR must be

reduced.

     (iii) From (12) and (IRL) an increasein p decreases               I
                                                                and bL. A similar argument

as in (ii) establishes that DR is increased and there is no effect on 'H This concludes the
proof of Proposition3.


     Proof of Proposition 5: The argument for part (i) of the proposition                 was stated in

the text.
     The optimization problem         (F')   maximizes expected payments subject to            (ICH),
(IRL),   and     the additional constraint (IRH').
     We first establish the conditions under which first-best efficiency is attained in this

program. Supposeonly (IRH') and (IRL) are binding. Then at an optimum,                      I=
i= H, L, D' = and from (IRH'), D' = D0. It follows that if D0 <
                      D                                                —
                                                                                       f(I) I//3
                        = a, the constraint (ICH) is slack. This establishes part (ii) of the

Proposition.
     If D0 > a the above contract is not implementable and (ICH) is binding. It is
straightforwardto verify that            =    because maximizing           net output relaxes both con-
straint (ICH) and (IRH').
     Now       note that if D0   bH the solution to (P) is also a solution to (F') since (IRH')
is then slack. This establishes part (iv) of the Proposition.
     The remaining case is where D0 > a but less than DH. In this case, it follows that
     = D0.      In order to maintain incentive compatibility,      I       must be reduced below   I. In
 this case,    I   solves:
