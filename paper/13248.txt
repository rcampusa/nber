The Effect of Taxes on Royalties and the Migration of Intangible Assets Abroad
John H. Mutti and Harry Grubert
NBER Working Paper No. 13248

JEL No. F23,H32

                                             ABSTRACT

Migration of intangible assets from the United States to foreign countries has become easier due to
the ability of U.S. firms to create hybrid entities in their affiliates abroad and to reach favorable cost
sharing agreements with them. This strategy was particularly encouraged by the U.S. adoption of
"check-the-box" regulations in 1997. Rather than receive royalties from affiliates abroad, US parent
firms have an incentive to retain abroad in low-tax countries a greater share of the return to their US
R&D. Evidence from several sources for years that span the 1997 policy change indicate a significant
response by US corporations in utilizing this strategy. BEA data indicate affiliate earnings and profits
grew more rapidly than royalty payments to US parents. Payments to U.S. parents for technical services
rose even faster, as would be called for under cost sharing agreements. Regression analysis of affiliate
data shows that parent R&D was a more important determinant of royalty payments to U.S. parents
than it was for affiliate earnings and profits in 1996, but by 2002 it played a larger role in earnings
and profits than in royalties. Cost sharing payments from affiliates in Ireland and from pure tax havens
(Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, and Luxembourg) are particularly significant, both economically and
statistically.

      I.   Introduction

      A front page article of the Wall Street Journal in November 2005 describes the way that

Microsoft’s four-year old Irish subsidiary, Round Island One Ltd., allows the parent company to

save at least $500 million in taxes each year (Simpson 2005). By licensing its software for use in

Europe, the Middle East, and Africa through the Irish subsidiary, Microsoft receives royalty

payments that are deductible in high-tax locations and subject to a low rate of corporate income

taxation in Ireland. Because the earnings are retained abroad, they are not subject to a residual U.S.

tax. According to company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Simpson reports

that other technology companies are following a similar strategy to reduce their overall tax burden.

    Such reports are an indication of major changes over the past ten years in the tax planning

strategies of U.S. multinational corporations (MNCs). These changes have affected the likelihood

that a U.S. parent will receive royalties from its foreign affiliates or that the parent will be able to

increase its earnings abroad from exploiting intangible assets that it develops in the United States.

Additionally, U.S. parents have found new ways to accomplish the relocation or migration of

intangible assets abroad. These new strategies have implications for the way the return to U.S.

research and development (R&D) is reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), as well as any

incentive to relocate innovative activity outside of the United States. This paper demonstrates how

firms have interpreted two important tax regulations to create these new strategies, and it examines

how they appear to have influenced measures of MNC activity reported by the Treasury, the Bureau

of Economic Analysis, and the National Science Foundation.




                                                     2
   One important tax planning development was the issuance of the ‘check-the-box’ regulations by

the IRS in 1997, which greatly simplified the use of hybrid entities. These are operations that are

classified as incorporated subsidiaries by one country and transparent branches by another. As

explained in Section II of the paper, this distinction allows U.S. MNCs to avoid immediate taxation

of inter-subsidiary payments that otherwise would occur under the anti-abuse Controlled Foreign

Corporation (CFC) provisions of subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code. Hybrids can make such

inter-subsidiary payments invisible to the U.S. Treasury. As a result, MNCs can retain earnings

abroad in low-tax locations.

   A second element of the successful tax saving strategies that accomplish the transfer of

intellectual property abroad is that an affiliate can acquire the rights to a valuable intellectual

property at a favorable price. A tax haven entity can engage in a cost sharing agreement with the

parent in which it shares in the cost of an R&D project in exchange for the right to exploit the

technology abroad. Once the technology is developed the tax haven company can license an

operating sibling in a high-tax location, but with a hybrid structure the deductible royalty paid to the

tax haven will not be subject to immediate U.S. tax. Companies have apparently been able to

arrange favorable cost sharing agreements that permit them to leave abroad in a low-tax location a

greater share of the return to the U.S. R&D.

   If the strategy sketched out above is widely adopted, the growth in royalties received by U.S.

parents can be expected to decline, and earnings retained in the tax haven company will grow. The

popularity of cost sharing agreements combined with hybrid structures also suggests that there will

be an increase in payments for technical services by U.S. subsidiaries to their parents relative to




                                                     3
royalties. In the long run, however, the sum of these service payments should decline relative to

foreign direct investment income abroad as more of the return to U.S. intangible assets is in the form

of net income deferred abroad in low-tax locations.

      The paper assesses these predictions empirically at two levels, one using data aggregated to the

country or worldwide level, and one examining firm-specific practices. Verifying whether the

determinants of affiliate royalty payments have been affected by this new tax saving strategy also is

relevant in addressing a potential policy issue in tax reform. In November 2005, the President’s

Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform recommended two possible reform plans. One was termed

the Simplified Income Tax, whose provisions in the international area would exempt from U.S. tax

any dividends received from active business income abroad. The foreign tax would be the final tax

imposed on that income. Because that dividend income would never be subject to U.S. tax, such a

change would be likely to reduce royalty payments made to U.S. parents; royalties would continue to

be fully taxed under the rationale that they are a deductible expense abroad.

      The remainder of the paper proceeds by first providing a fuller explanation of hybrid structures

and cost sharing agreements. It then examines evidence from IRS and BEA data to determine

whether the strategies suggested above can be detected either in data aggregated to the country level

or in firm specific data. For both levels of empirical analysis several measures are quite consistent

with the predictions described above.


II.     Alternative Ways of Utilizing a Hybrid Structure to Affect Payments for Technology




                                                     4
   The United States taxes the worldwide income of its residents, but allows a credit for foreign

income taxes paid on income received from abroad. Although any residual U.S. tax is deferred until

active business income is repatriated to the United States, for some types of income a U.S. tax is due

immediately. Hybrids are a business structure that allows U.S. firms to avoid having income treated

in that latter category. To understand the significance of hybrids, first consider the role of the CFC

rules that otherwise would apply to transactions between related parties. A recent Treasury

document (2000, p. xii) states the following:

       The subpart F rules attempt to prevent (or negate the tax advantage from) deflection of
       income, either from the United States or from the foreign country in which earned, into
       another jurisdiction which is a tax haven or which has a preferential tax regime for certain
       types of income. Thus, subpart F generally targets passive income and income that is split
       off from the activities that produced the value in the goods or services generating the income.
       Conversely, subpart F generally does not require current taxation of active business income
       except when the income is of a type that is easily deflected to a tax haven, such as shipping
       income, or income earned in certain transactions between related parties. In related party
       transaction, deflection of income is much easier because a unified group of corporations can
       direct the flow of income between entities in different jurisdictions.
       …Generally, rents and royalties earned by a CFC in an active business are excluded from
       Foreign Personal Holding Company Income (FPHCI). This exception does not apply,
       however, if the CFC’s rents or royalties are received from a related person. Accordingly,
       rents and royalties received from a related person are generally treated as FPHCI, without
       regard to the nature of the business activities of the CFC that give rise to the rents and
       royalties.


   The statement above distinguishes payments to related parties from other transactions that

affiliates might make, because of the belief that the former can be more easily manipulated to shift

income from one jurisdiction to another. The CFC rules might be regarded as a backstop to transfer

pricing regulations that attempt to limit income shifting practices. If payments between related

parties cannot be observed by the U.S. Treasury, however, an MNC can avoid this subpart F




                                                   5
treatment. Note that this residual tax is important to U.S. MNCs whose foreign tax payments are

less than the U.S. tax liability on that foreign income. For companies that have substantial excess

foreign tax credits, there is little incentive to create a hybrid to avoid U.S. taxation of royalty

income, because that income already would have been shielded from any additional U.S. tax.

    To illustrate the potential benefit from a hybrid arrangement, consider an example where a parent

capitalizes a hybrid entity in a tax haven with equity, and then has it lend to an operation in a high-

tax location. The MNC reports to the high-tax jurisdiction that the tax-haven affiliate is a

corporation, but it tells the U.S. Treasury that the tax haven affiliate is an unincorporated branch of

the high-tax subsidiary. The high-tax subsidiary receives a deduction for the interest paid to the tax

haven affiliate, but from the U.S. Treasury’s perspective the two affiliates are treated as one

consolidated company. The interest income received in the tax haven is not reported to the U.S.

Treasury and can therefore be deferred from current U.S. tax. Without the hybrid, a payment to a tax

haven finance subsidiary would be subject to current U.S. tax under the CFC rules.1 Altshuler and

Grubert (2005) calculate that these types of structures allowed U.S. multinational companies to

lower their foreign taxes by $7.0 billion per year in 2002 compared to 1997.

    Figure 1 shows a hybrid structure applicable in the technology setting considered here, which

allows the low-tax affiliate to strip out income from the high-tax affiliate through royalty payments

that are a deductible expense in the high-tax country. From the perspective of the high-tax country,

1
     A tax law change in 2006 makes it possible for a firm under certain circumstances to achieve this same tax saving
result without a hybrid structure. Under the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act signed into law on May 17,
2006, which is scheduled to apply through 2008, CFCs can avoid the subpart F treatment explained above if the inter-
subsidiary payments of dividends, interest, rents, and royalties are attributable to active business income, in contrast to
passive income.




                                                             6
less income will be declared by the affiliate that operates there, and the host government will have

collected less tax revenue. The royalty income is not recognized by the U.S. Treasury and can be

retained in the low-tax country where it escapes a current U.S. tax.

   Similar benefits may arise under other hybrid structures, although the way such benefits will be

reported to the U.S. Treasury changes. For example, an affiliate in a high-tax Country A may claim

for U.S. tax purposes that a related affiliate in a low-tax Country B is its branch, and therefore the

latter entity becomes invisible to the U.S. Treasury. If the high-tax affiliate in Country A pays a

royalty to the low-tax affiliate in B, it is not recognized by the U.S. Treasury. The consolidated net

income of the high-tax affiliate rises because the royalty is deducted against a high tax rate, but the

higher income now earned by the low-tax affiliate can be retained in B and need not face the higher

tax rate in A. The Country A affiliate appears more profitable because the tax burden on a given

dollar of income now is lower.

   In the case of R&D cost sharing agreements, a key issue is the basis on which the affiliate is

allowed to “buy in” to successful research carried out by the parent. If a parent’s latest innovation

builds on several previous generations of research, but the affiliate is able to pay a favorable price

that places little value on those past expenditures, the strategy is particularly successful in allowing a

migration of the intangible asset to the location abroad. New proposed regulations under the cost

sharing provisions of Section 482.7 of the Internal Revenue Code (Reg-144615-02 announced for

public comment on August 29, 2005) are intended to address the “inappropriate migration of

intangibles.” Initial reaction to these proposed regulations suggest that they represent a major




                                                    7
revision, which is more likely to require that such agreements reflect a price that would be offered in

an arms-length transaction to an investor who bore none of the risk of the earlier product

developments. Under the less explicit current regulations, U.S. parents have been able to achieve the

outcome that a smaller ownership share of successful technological innovations is retained in the

United States, and fewer royalties will be received by the parent in the future. While payments from

the affiliate for technical services under the cost sharing agreement will result in an initial increase in

parent receipts, over the longer run the parent will receive fewer payments for the utilization of its

intangible assets abroad either in the form of royalties or in the form of cost sharing payments.

   III. Indications of the Changing Importance of Royalty Payments at the Aggregate Level

 U.S. Treasury Data

   As indicated above, the U.S. Treasury receives tax returns from U.S. controlled foreign

corporations, which provide information about royalty payments, payments for technical services,

and CFC earnings. Table 1 is based on compilations of information from the Form 5471, which is

filed with the basic corporate return and reports on each controlled foreign corporation’s transactions

with its related parties. The table compares the values reported in 1996, before the ‘check-the-box’

regime was adopted, and 2002. The latter year is the latest one for which these data are available.

Because some of the hybrid arrangements and cost-sharing agreements described above may take

time to design and implement, a longer time frame generally is desirable to allow more complete

adjustment to these new tax saving opportunities. Over a longer time frame, however, the actual

response observed may be affected by other policy changes or by changes in the business cycle. For

example, due to the economic downturn that occurred in many parts of the world in 2002, the likely




                                                    8
shift in affiliate earnings relative to royalty payments may be less pronounced than in years that

represent comparable stages of the business cycle.

    The summary measures in the top portion of Table 1 indicate how income for all affiliates has

changed relative to the income declared in seven major low-tax countries. The share of earnings in

the latter group grew much more rapidly than total earnings and profits of all U.S. subsidiaries, as

shown on lines 1 and 2. Although part of the increase in low-tax countries is due to the growth in

dividends received from other CFCs (not hybrids), shown on line 3, the remaining portion shown on

line 4 reflects increased real activity and the effect of tax planning structures that leave the visible

affiliate in a low-tax country. That figure increases at double the rate of the overall growth in

affiliate income, an outcome consistent with the tax saving strategies outlined above.2

    Lines 5 and 6 show further evidence of hybrid structures in which the high-tax company

disappears from the perspective of the U.S. Treasury. The rate of growth in tangible capital in five

low-tax countries that serve as attractive locations for holding companies is over six times as great as

for the total of all CFCs. Tangible capital reported in these five countries represents about 18

percent of the total in 2002. However, the tangible capital need not be physically present in those

countries, because it instead can be located in the invisible branch in a high-tax country.

     The bottom three lines of the table are based on transactions among related parties reported by

the 7500 largest CFCs. Of the three measures shown, payments to U.S. parents for technical and

management services grew most rapidly, by 108 percent, a likely indication of the rising importance

2
 This outcome applies to the case where the remaining entity seen by the U.S. Treasury is located in the tax haven
country. If the remaining entity were located in a high-tax country instead, the contrast cited in Table 1 would not be as




                                                             9
of cost sharing agreements. Earnings and profits grew less than royalties paid to the parent, 41

percent compared to 68 percent. That result is somewhat unexpected, if the combination of a hybrid

and a cost sharing agreement makes royalty payments from high-tax affiliates invisible to the U.S.

Treasury.

     To put this observation in perspective, however, consider two factors that are more supportive of

the hybrid strategy’s importance. First, the relative ranking of royalties and profits for 2002 may

result because earnings are more cyclically volatile than royalties, and 2002 was a year in which

earnings and profits declined from their 2000 peak. By way of contrast, royalties grew less rapidly

than earnings over the period 1996-2000.3 Second, between 2000 and 2002 the Treasury data show

that royalties received by U.S. parents increased 29 percent, whereas the BEA’s international

transactions figures indicate that royalties received by U.S. parents only grew by 5 percent between

those same years. Such ambiguities suggest the importance of considering multiple data sources to

indicate MNC responses to the changing tax incentives.4

Bureau of Economic Analysis data




great. Evidence for that latter strategy would appear as a lower effective tax rate in the high-tax country, a situation
examined by Altshuler and Grubert (2005).
3
  Changing composition of this group also may influence these comparisons. Because the largest 7,500 affiliates are
selected based on their reported assets, this set includes more capital-intensive operations, such as finance, insurance and
real estate. Based on income or receipts, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and construction would play a larger
role. Throughout the 1990s these latter industries have declined in relative importance (Nutter 2001).
      4
        A further example of the difference between Treasury tax data and BEA data comes from looking at total royalty
payments reported by U.S. corporations on Form 1118, the basis for claiming a foreign tax credit. In 2000, firms
claimed royalties of $75 billion. In the BEA international transactions data, total royalties received by all U.S. residents
was $43 billion. MNCs may have a bigger tax incentive to characterize payments received from abroad as royalties,
because that increases the foreign source income they receive and thereby increases the foreign tax credits they can claim
(see Mutti and Grubert 1998 for discussion of the effects of different source rules).




                                                            10
    The Bureau of Economic Analysis publishes two important sources of data on affiliate

operations. One is the Annual and Benchmark Surveys of Direct Investment Abroad, which present

financial and operating data of foreign affiliates. Greater detail is available in the case of majority

owned affiliates (MOFAs).          A second important source of information comes from the U.S.

international transactions accounts. These data lie behind the calculation of the direct investment

position. However, they only consider the transactions of foreign affiliates with their U.S. parents

and do not provide any basis for analyzing transactions among affiliates.

    The surveys of financial and operating data offer the advantage that information is collected for

each affiliate, regardless of whether it operates as a branch or is incorporated in the foreign country.

In contrast to the Treasury data, the disappearance of affiliates under a hybrid arrangement should

not occur in the BEA data. Nevertheless, care is warranted in interpreting these data, too, because

certain measures of affiliate activity, such as net income, may appear overstated due to double

counting.5 If net income is likely to be overstated, but royalties are not, then comparing the

percentage changes in each of these items will not be a valid test of the firm’s response to the tax

incentives identified above.

    For example, if a MOFA in country A receives a dividend from a MOFA in country B, the U.S.

parent will report the affiliate’s earnings in Country B and also the remitted dividend as part of the

income of the affiliate in Country A. The sum of income across all MOFAs will appear larger

because of this double counting. As holding company operations expand, and fulfill the role of the


5
 See Borga and Mataloni (2001), and Altshuler and Grubert (2005) for presentation of this issue. Altshuler and Grubert
were interested in how much tax saving was possible through the growth of payments that presumably were deductible in
high-tax locations, in contrast to payments of dividends from one affiliate to another.




                                                         11
Country A MOFA in the example above, the potential double counting becomes larger. While the

trend toward greater use of holding companies can be observed from the 1980s onward, the shift

from 1996 to 2004 is particularly large. As reported by Koncz and Yorgason (2005), the portion of

the U.S. direct investment position abroad that they account for has roughly doubled, from 17

percent to 34 percent.6

    In contrast, the direct investment income figure from the international transactions account does

not include the double counting that can occur with the financial and operating data. Because it

only records transactions between a U.S. parent and its foreign subsidiaries, it is not affected by

transactions among affiliates.

    Those observations serve as useful background to interpret alternative measures of the operations

of foreign affiliates reported in Table 2. The table shows relevant data by which to assess changes

in earnings and royalties from benchmark surveys from 1989, 1994, and 1999. Annual survey data

are available for 2003, but those data do not provide a complete representation of transactions

among affiliates. The royalty payments and other private direct investment service payments for

that year are taken from the international transaction accounts.

    First consider the implications of the changes observed from 1994 to 1999, the benchmark years

that span the introduction of the ‘check-the-box’ opportunity. Then examine whether those trends

are reinforced by additional responses to those incentives in the subsequent 1999-2003 period or

whether other factors that operate over that period offset the initial responses observed. Also,

6
 Luxembourg has been a particularly attractive location, because it exempts from corporate tax the dividends, interest
and royalties received from a foreign source by the holding company. Exemption systems more typically do not tax




                                                           12
consider how these patterns differ from those observed in the earlier benchmark intervals from

1982-1989 and 1989-1994.

  The BEA data indicate that over the 1994-99 period royalties paid by affiliates to U.S. parents

grew by 50 percent, a rate faster than some indicators of MNC activity, such as sales, gross product,

employment, and R&D, but not as fast as several other measures such as income, property, plant and

equipment, and payments to the parent for other private direct investment services. Comparing

royalty payments to affiliate income requires careful attention to the distinctions raised above, and

therefore two measures for income are included in the table. The first is based on the sum of before-

tax income reported by all MOFAs (which can include double counting described above). The

second is based on the direct investment return to U.S. parents (which should be free from the

double counting described above) adjusted upward by the amount of foreign income tax paid. The

increase in the former figure is particularly large, probably a reflection of the growth of holding

company operations. The increase in the latter figure still is greater than that of royalty payments to

the parent over the 1994-1999 period that spans the introduction of ‘check-the-box’ regulations.

   To give greater insight into the conflicting forces that influence the royalty figure, note that in the

earlier 1989-1994 period royalties grew quite rapidly at a time when the growth in income was very

slight. As explained above, the opportunity to receive royalties free of any residual U.S. tax occurs

when the U.S. parent has excess foreign tax credits. While the U.S. Tax Reform Act of 1986

reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate from 46 percent to 34 percent, and caused an initial increase in

the share of U.S. parents that were in excess credit positions, that initial consequence was not a


dividends received from abroad, because they have born a corporate tax in the host country, but do not exempt payments




                                                         13
permanent change. Companies adjusted the types of payments they made and host countries

reduced their corporate tax rates (Grubert, Randolph, and Rousslang 1996). Nevertheless, the

incentive to pay additional royalties continued to operate into the 1990s. There was substantial

public commentary over various iterations of proposed regulations that would specify what royalty

methods could be used under the provisions of 1986 act, and the standard that emerged when those

regulations were finalized in 1994 was more stringent than existed prior to 1986. Companies likely

adjusted their practices before 1994 in anticipation of such a change. Also, in 1993 penalty

regulations were adopted, which applied if royalties were understated. In short, there were several

policy changes that could be expected to create increasing pressure to raise royalty payments over

the 1989-94 period.

    While the rate of increase of royalty payments by affiliates to parents was slower in the 1994-99

period, the growth rate of payments to other affiliates increased sharply by 131 percent, the largest

increase shown in Table 2. Relative to the royalties paid to the parent, the proportion paid to other

affiliates rose from 15 percent to 24 percent. This pattern is consistent with the rising role of hybrid

structures and the payment of royalties from high-tax affiliates to low-tax affiliates. Finally, parent

receipts of other direct investment service payments rose faster than royalties, 75 percent versus 50

percent from 1994-1999. The larger increase in direct investment service payments is a pattern

consistent with the rise of cost sharing agreements in the Treasury data.

     A particular advantage of the BEA data is that they show distinctions by country of origin of

these payments by affiliates. The summary figures in Tables 3 and 4 demonstrate that the pattern of


that were deductible abroad.




                                                  14
royalty payments is sensitive to tax incentives. From 1994 to 1999 a particularly large increase

occurred in royalty payments to U.S. parents from affiliates in Ireland and Singapore, as shown in

Table 3A. In the case of Ireland, over the earlier five-year period (1989-94), its share of all royalties

received by U.S. parents from their MOFAs rose from 2.2 percent to 5.1 percent, but in the more

recent period (1994-1999) that proportion increased to 15.0 percent. In the case of Singapore, the

corresponding changes were from 1.6 percent to 3.2 percent and then to 4.6 percent.

    This pattern of payments suggests that U.S. parents have found it profitable to locate intellectual

property in low-tax countries, and from the additional revenue received there to pay additional

royalties to the U.S. parent. This strategy will be particularly attractive if only a portion of the

additional revenue is paid to the U.S. parent, and the rest is retained in the low-tax country. In the

case of Ireland, royalties as a share of net income more than doubled from 1989-1994, but then only

increased slightly from 1994 to 1999. In 1994 before-tax income per dollar of sales, net of earnings

from equity investments in other foreign affiliates, was more than three times higher for Irish

affiliates than for the average across all affiliates. U.S. parents already had found it attractive to shift

profits to Ireland before the advent of ‘check-the-box.’ Although that differential did not increase

between 1994 and 1999, a substantial increase in the absolute amount of profits occurred. For Irish

affiliates, there was a threefold increase in before-tax equity income, whereas the increase for all

other affiliates was 73 percent. For evidence of the operation of hybrids, note that royalty receipts

from high-tax countries such as France, Germany or Japan have either declined or grown at rates

much slower than the average. Those affiliates may still be paying royalties commensurate with




                                                    15
their expanding sales, but they are not paying them to the U.S. parent, a consequence of hybrid

structures being created.

    In the case of royalty payments from one MOFA to another, disclosure limitations mean that the

large increase in payments to other MOFAs shown in Table 4 generally cannot be assigned to

specific countries. More rapid growth in payments from high-tax countries might be expected on

average. Disclosure limitations also make it impossible to show whether the largest increases in

royalties received occurred for affiliates in low-tax countries.7

    Consider an alternative standard to apply in assessing how MNC royalty receipts have changed

over time: compare those received from related parties to those from unrelated parties.8 For the

two benchmark years that span the 1986 tax reform, the share of royalties received from related

parties jumped from 67 percent in 1982 to 77 percent in 1989, a clear indication of the sensitivity of

royalty payments to tax incentives. From that peak, however, the ratio has decreased to roughly 75

percent, and exhibits no clear response to later tax policy changes such as ‘check-the-box.’ Of

course, U.S. parents in an excess foreign tax credit position have an incentive to characterize a

receipt as a royalty, regardless of whether it is received from a related or an unrelated party.

    Regarding the rapid increase in payments for other direct investment services (such as cost

sharing agreements), the receipts by U.S. parents do not show the same dominant position for

Ireland and Singapore as appeared in the case of royalties received by U.S. parents. Payments from

those countries did grow at an above-average rate from 1994 to 1999, but the current values still

7
  The fact that such disclosure problems are reported for Ireland does seem surprising, given the anecdotal evidence
cited at the outset over the large number of companies establishing affiliates there.




                                                          16
represent a small share of the total. Note, however, that the combination of cost sharing agreements

and hybrids means that a location where real production occurs, such as Ireland or Singapore, is no

longer necessary to relocate intangible assets. A cost sharing agreement with an affiliate in the

Cayman Islands, for example, which then licenses a branch in Germany to produce using the

technology acquired, will accomplish the desired migration of the intangible to a low-tax location.

Consistent with that new opportunity, payments from holding country destinations such as the

Netherlands and Switzerland hardly rose at all. Of particular significance is the Table 3B entry for

the Other Western Hemisphere, which includes Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. For these

countries there is a fourfold increase in payments to U.S. parents between 1994 and 1999, while the

overall rate of increase is only 75 percent.

      Cost sharing agreements take time to design and implement, and the 1994-99 observation period

may simply not allow enough time for this influence to be more significant than the other

determinants of such activity. Extending the observation period, however, may introduce other

confounding factors, beyond the question of cyclical performance mentioned above. In the Table 2

observations for 1999-2003, the item that stands out most sharply is the growth of direct investment

income. Over that same period, the share of foreign earnings distributed to U.S. owners steadily

fell, from 49 percent in 1999 to 30 percent in 2003 and 22 percent in 2004. While such a strategy is

consistent with the incentives explained above, the trend undoubtedly was influenced by

expectations of a change in U.S. tax law that would treat such retained earnings more favorably.

Such an opportunity arose in 2004 when the U.S. Congress phased out the Extraterritorial Income

regime for taxing export income, given unfavorable rulings against it by the dispute resolution

panels of the World Trade Organization. Congress passed the American Jobs Creation Act, which

also reduced the U.S. tax rate on qualifying dividends from MNC operations abroad for a period of

one year from the statutory rate of 35 percent to 5.25 percent. Preliminary figures for 2005 indicate

that slightly more than the entire direct investment earnings for that year were repatriated, resulting

in a reduction in the amount of retained earnings abroad. At the same time, payments to U.S. parents

in the form of royalties and other direct investment services both rose less rapidly than other

measures of affiliate activity, such as gross output, sales, or property, plant and equipment. These

large changes in MNC behavior demonstrate why there is a limited window over which aggregate

responses can be expected to reflect a dominant role for cost sharing agreements and hybrids alone.



BEA and NSF Measures of Research and Development

   A final issue to address at the aggregate level is the possible role of tax considerations in the

location of R&D. Although the U.S. transition to a knowledge-based economy accelerated over the

latter half of the 1990s, in terms of the operations of affiliates abroad, Table 2 shows that the

increase in R&D performed abroad did not keep up with the growth in property, plant and

equipment. The tax incentives for shifting R&D abroad are not straightforward. In a high-tax

location the R&D would receive a valuable current deduction, as in the United States, but any

income, including royalties, would be subject to the same high tax. If the company had reason to

believe that the R&D project was likely to be very profitable, it might locate it in a tax haven

because the value of the current deduction would become less important. This could be combined




                                                   18
with a hybrid structure to facilitate the payment of royalties to the tax haven. On the other hand, the

cost sharing structure described above may make the actual shift of R&D unnecessary.

   The BEA measures of R&D performed by affiliates and by parents are reported in Table 5. The

ratio of these two values is shown for two different measures, one on line three based on the

published figures measured in U.S. dollars at current exchange rates, and one on line four based on

an adjustment of the numerator to take account of changes in the real exchange rate that may affect

the amount of research that can be performed for a given dollar expenditure.      (See, for example,

NSF, National Patterns of Research and Development Resources: 2003 for a discussion of this

issue.) The first set of figures suggests a small increase in the proportion of research activity carried

out by affiliates. The adjustment for PPP indicates that this increase has been somewhat larger,

because the dollar was undervalued in 1994 compared to 1999. In that situation a given foreign

currency expenditure in 1994 translated into more dollars and a higher ratio of affiliate effort on line

three, even though the real amount of R&D work accomplished was not correspondingly larger.

   The BEA data allow some breakdown of these figures by country. Two groupings are shown in

Table 5, one that reports R&D performed by affiliates in the four most important sites (France,

Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom), and one that reports R&D performed in six low-tax

countries (Luxembourg is excluded from the group used in Table 2, because in most years this entry

cannot be disclosed). The share accounted for by the top four countries shown on line six has

dropped, as R&D efforts of U.S. firms have been dispersed more broadly across the globe. At the

same time line eight shows that there is no marked increase in the share of R&D performed in low-

tax countries, which would have been more likely if U.S. firms found that was the best way to




                                                  19
ensure future innovation of highly profitable ideas could be attributed to affiliates in such low-tax

countries. The absence of such a response suggests that U.S. firms have found other ways to shift

intangibles to those countries, such as the combination of hybrids and favorable cost sharing

agreements, which are more effective than carrying out R&D in countries that lack appropriate

infrastructure or have limited personnel available to carry out such work.

   The annual National Science Foundation surveys give the share of total industrial R&D

performed abroad by U.S. companies. The value for R&D abroad is smaller than the BEA number

reported above, and the value for R&D performed domestically is higher, given that it is not

restricted to the value performed by U.S. corporations that have foreign affiliates. Therefore, the

ratios calculated here are lower than those from the BEA calculated above. Figure 2 shows the

comparable ratios for unadjusted and PPP-adjusted R&D effort by affiliates abroad relative to

domestic R&D based on these data. The unadjusted series is quite volatile and exhibits no clear

trend. The adjusted series is much more regular, and the trend line suggests that if the initial value

of the series is 8.6 percent, the annual increase in this value will be slightly less than a tenth of a

percentage point.

   The NSF data offer a limited breakdown by the country where the R&D is performed. Although

no geographic detail was provided in 1994, information is given in 1995, which can be compared to

similar information in 1999 to examine whether the patterns in this compilation mirror the trends

shown in the BEA data. A somewhat different picture emerges, because for the same four large

countries, their share of the total actually rises over the time that ‘check-the-box’ was introduced,




                                                    20
from 41 percent to 43 percent. Such a pattern again indicates that other strategies to promote the

migration of intangibles must be more attractive.9

    The lack of a significant response by U.S. MNCs to perform more R&D in low-tax locations

may suggest that the combined strategy of a hybrid and a favorable cost sharing agreement have

kept more R&D activity at home. Because the lack of response also could reflect a situation where

decisions on the location of real R&D activities are not very sensitive to tax factors, the evidence

here does not have an unambiguous interpretation. Studies by Hines (1993) and by Bloom, et al

(2002) do report significant response internationally in the way firms locate their R&D activities,

especially in the long run. To the extent that their findings can be generalized, the higher return to

domestic R&D possible with the strategies outlined above does make domestic locations more

attractive and increase U.S. activity.



     IV. Returns to Intangibles and Affiliate Payments at the Firm Level



     Prior research at the country level indicates that the location of property, plant and equipment

became more sensitive to host country tax rates in the 1990s than it was in the 1980s (Altshuler, et

al, 2001). Does a similar result hold for intangible capital in the more recent decade? Because

measuring intangible capital is not straightforward, this paper attempts to measure such an effect

9
  These comparisons based on current R&D expenditures serve as a proxy for the stock of R&D or intellectual property
(IP) located abroad, from which higher affiliate earnings might be expected. Given the general stability of the PPP-
adjusted R&D expenditure shares in the NSF data, the proportion of the stock of intellectual property created by
affiliates abroad is unlikely to have risen much. Even if the affiliate expenditure share had risen more substantially, the




                                                            21
through the examination of affiliate royalties, cost-sharing payments and earnings and profits, based

on firm-level, tax return data accessed at the U.S. Treasury Department. A cross section of all

foreign manufacturing affiliates in 1996 and 2002 provides the basis for comparing how the

determinants of these payments have changed across years when a major change in tax policy

occurred. This analysis does not suggest new theoretical approaches in explaining affiliate earnings

and repatriations. Rather, standard models in the literature are applied to the data available for the

two years identified above.10 The focus is not on the absolute size of the coefficients obtained, but

instead on the relative importance of variables that determine affiliate earnings and payments to

parents for royalties and for technical services.

     In contrast to the country aggregates presented above, a particular advantage of the firm-specific

data is that it is possible to control for characteristics of the parent firm and the affiliate when

observing the affiliate’s transactions. Additionally, because parent firms report the earnings and

profits (E&P) of each affiliate, and the E&P calculation is based on income as defined in the U.S. tax

code, not the host country, making comparisons across countries is more straightforward in this data

set. Aside from the benefits of consistency, the E&P measure is an approximation of financial book

income. The Form 5471s filed for each affiliate and the related parent corporate tax return, Form

1120, are the basis for the firm level analysis.

        With respect to important parent characteristics, a prime goal is to accurately represent the

intangible assets that a parent has developed. Expenditures for advertising and R&D are two


growth in the proportion of the IP stock would be slower. In the current volume, see the paper by McNeil for discussion
of the appropriate rate of depreciation of intellectual property.
10
   See, for example, Grubert (1998, 2001, 2003).




                                                          22
potentially important measures. The R&D measure comes from the research and experimentation

tax credit claimed by the U.S. parent. This credit is restricted to research expenditures made within

the United States, and the tax code specifies the ways in which such expenditures must differ from

routine product maintenance and production. The parent’s R&D intensity, measured as a share of

sales, indicates its ability to contribute valuable technology to the affiliate. This ratio, which is

based on parent sales rather than assets, is generally more appropriate because it avoids errors in

measurement caused by the valuation of assets at their historical book value.

    In addition to the two parent characteristics that indicate the likely magnitude of intangible

assets, two dummy variables represent the age of the affiliate. Younger affiliates might be expected

to show a lower rate of return than those that are better established, although this influence of age

may be offset by more recent aggressive strategies to locate intangibles in attractive tax locations.

       Table 6 presents estimates based on such data from 1996. A key point to observe is that in

1996 the return abroad to the exploitation of U.S. R&D appears to favor the U.S. parent, because the

coefficient for the parent R&D per dollar of parent sales variable is 25 percent greater in the

equation estimated to explain royalties per dollar of affiliate sales than in the equation to explain

earnings and profits per dollar of affiliate sales (0.70 compared to 0.56). In the 2002 data the

comparable coefficient in the royalty equation is now less than 60 percent of the value obtained in

the earnings and profits equation (0.24 compared to 0.45). A larger share of the gain from parent

technology appears to be received abroad, where it can be retained free of U.S. tax, rather then being

remitted to the U.S. parent.




                                                    23
      Also noteworthy is the importance of the parent R&D variable in the regression for technical

service payments, an indicator of cost sharing agreements. If those payments are compared to

royalties, the coefficients in the 1996 estimates indicate twice as great a role in determining royalty

payments (0.70 compared to 0.35), whereas in 2002 those proportions had nearly reversed, with the

coefficient in the cost sharing equation now appearing much larger (0.24 compared to 0.41). While

that comparison may appear exaggerated because of the major change in importance of parent R&D

in the case of royalty payments, a similar comparison with the estimated coefficient from the

equation for affiliate earnings and profits shows the rising importance across these two years of cost

sharing payments to compensate a parent for its contribution of valuable intellectual property.

      These results are consistent with what the hybrid plus cost sharing strategy suggests. A

potential concern may be that the simplified model used to estimate the relevant coefficients for the

three different dependent variables may be distorted by omitted variable bias.11 To address

important aspects of that concern, consider the additional estimates reported in Table 7.

     The royalty equation shown in column two includes two additional variables important in tax

planning strategies, the host country’s statutory tax rate and the parent’s overall foreign tax rate on

all dividend income received (as calculated from its Form 1118 to claim a foreign tax credit). The

role of the statutory rate is ambiguous. To review the comments made earlier in the paper, a parent

may have an incentive to pay high royalties from a high-tax host country to benefit from the fact that


11
  Another concern may be the fact that many affiliates make no royalty payments, and these zero values may make OLS
estimates less desirable than alternative approaches, such as tobit estimation or the Heckman two-step procedure.
Because the proportion of affiliates that pay royalties to the U.S. parent is roughly the same in each year, 42 percent in
1996 and 45 percent in 2002, the extent of the bias from this truncation is likely to be comparable for the two years. The
effect of the shrinkage from 1996 to 2002 in the number of manufacturing affiliates included in the sample is not clear.




                                                           24
they are a deductible expense. Yet, a parent may choose to locate valuable intangibles in low-tax

countries in order to benefit from the low taxation of its profits. Even if the affiliate pays less than

an arm’s length royalty, total royalty payments from a low-tax country may be higher. The

importance of such an effect in Ireland and Singapore, where actual production might occur, was

shown in the aggregated BEA data reported in Table 3A. Due to the existence of hybrids, the effect

also can occur in other low-tax locations, where an affiliate owns a portion of the intellectual

property that it licenses for use elsewhere. The outcome that more royalties will be paid from low-

tax countries is confirmed in the firm-specific data, too, because the coefficient on the statutory tax

rate is negative.

     Firms are more likely to pay royalties when they can be shielded from taxation in the United

States. The foreign tax rate paid or deemed paid on dividends received from all foreign affiliates is a

potential indicator of a parent’s likelihood of having excess foreign tax credits that would eliminate a

residual tax due on repatriated royalties. Royalties, which are deductible abroad and only bear a

(usually low) withholding tax in the host country, can absorb excess credits originating with highly

taxed dividends. In 2000, 67 percent of royalties were shielded by credits. The positive coefficient

on this variable is consistent with tax optimizing behavior of U.S. firms, as a higher tax rate applied

on foreign dividends creates a larger shield to receive royalties.12 These tax planning variables are




12
  While the tax rate on foreign dividends may not be pre-determined entirely independently of a firm’s planned royalty
payments, it generally is the source of any excess foreign tax credits, and it is not affected by other adjustments a firm
may make in determining its foreign tax credit position. Therefore, it is a better exogenous variable than the ex poste
excess credit position of the parent.




                                                            25
of interest in their own right, but the key point to observe is that while adding them to this regression

does raise its overall explanatory power, the coefficient for parent R&D is hardly affected at all.

       In the case of payments for technical services, a particularly noteworthy extension is to

consider whether certain host countries have been more likely to attract such activity. Country

dummies are included to represent low-tax countries where future product development could take

place (Ireland and Singapore), as well as tax havens where the most important motive would appear

to be the migration of existing intangibles (Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, and Luxembourg). While

such dummies were not significant in 1996, in 2002 the coefficients for Ireland and for Bermuda, the

Cayman Islands, and Luxembourg (the pure tax havens) both were quite significant and

quantitatively very large. The importance of Ireland substantiates the anecdotal evidence cited in the

introduction to the paper. The importance of the pure tax havens suggests that the amount of real

activity expected in the host country need not be great, and a shift of R&D activity out of the United

States need not be made in order to accomplish the migration of intangibles. Those patterns appear

both in the column four results based on all affiliates (not just those in manufacturing) and in the

column five results based on just those affiliates in manufacturing. In the latter case, however, the

role of activity in the pure tax havens is particularly large. Again, including the dummies adds to the

explanatory power of the estimated equation, but it has little effect on the importance of the parent

R&D variable.



   V. Conclusions




                                                   26
   Substantial migration of intangible assets from the United States to foreign countries appears to

have occurred over the last decade. That trend has been facilitated by the ability of U.S. firms to

create hybrid entities in their affiliates abroad and to reach favorable cost sharing agreements with

them. This strategy was particularly encouraged by the U.S. adoption of ‘check-the-box’ regulations

in 1997, which resulted in inter-subsidiary payments between affiliates incorporated in one foreign

country and their branches operating in another foreign country becoming invisible to the IRS.

   An expected result is that there will be more rapid growth of earning and profits in foreign

affiliates relative to the royalties they pay to U.S. parents, as companies have an incentive to retain

profits abroad in low-tax countries where they can avoid any residual U.S. tax. Although that

pattern was observed in aggregate Treasury data over the 1996-2000 period, for the longer 1996-

2002 period royalties grew more rapidly than affiliate earnings and profits, a possible reflection of

the cyclical nature of earnings and profits. Payments by affiliates to U.S. parents for technical

services, as would be called for under cost sharing agreements, have increased rapidly even through

the longer 2002 observation period. In the process of certain affiliates becoming invisible to the

U.S. Treasury, affiliates in low-tax countries with little potential to produce goods and services now

claim major increases in their plant and equipment, presumably an indication of the capital held by

their branches in high-tax countries.

   BEA data, which retain the identity of individual establishments even if they are part of a hybrid

structure, show more than double the growth of royalty payments from one affiliate to another

compared to the growth in royalty payments to the U.S. parent. Such a trend might not be so

surprising if there had been a major shift in R&D out of the United States to low-tax locations




                                                   27
abroad, but evidence from the BEA and from the NSF especially suggest that this has not occurred.

In fact, over the 1995-1999 period the NSF data show the traditional importance of high-tax OECD

locations has increased.

   Analysis of firm-specific data from the U.S. Treasury demonstrates how changes in the returns to

parent R&D have shifted when years before ‘check-the-box’ was adopted are compared to

subsequent years. In regression analysis with 1996 tax returns, parent R&D contributed more to

royalty payments to U.S. parents than it did to affiliate earnings and profits. In 2002, however, the

importance of parent R&D had switched in these two regressions, with it now playing a larger role in

earnings and profits relative to royalties. That outcome is consistent with the tax avoidance

strategies explained in Section II. Also, the relative importance of cost sharing payments rose over

this period, relative to both royalties and earnings and profits. Cost sharing payments from affiliates

in Ireland and from pure tax havens (Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, and Luxembourg) are

particularly significant, both economically and statistically. Thus, the ability to carry out research

and development in the affiliate does not appear to be a key pre-requisite for the successful pursuit

of this strategy, and alleged pressures to relocate research and development activity abroad for tax

reasons have not been so compelling.
