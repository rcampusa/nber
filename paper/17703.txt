                                               ABSTRACT

The strong link between health insurance and employment in the United States may cause workers
to delay retirement until they become eligible for Medicare at age 65. However, some employers extend
health insurance benefits to their retirees, and individuals who are eligible for such retiree health benefits
need not wait until age 65 to retire with group health coverage. We investigate the impact of retiree
health insurance on early retirement using employee-level data from 64 diverse firms that are clients
of Towers Watson, a leading benefits consulting firm. We find that retiree health coverage has its
strongest effects at ages 62 and 63, resulting in a 3.7 percentage point (21.2 percent) increase in the
probability of turnover at age 62 and a 5.1 percentage point (32.2 percent) increase in the probability
of turnover at age 63; it has a more modest effects for individuals under the age of 62. A more generous
employer contribution of 50 percent or more raises turnover by 1-3 percentage points at ages 56-61,
by 5.9 percentage points (33.7 percent) at age 62, and by 6.9 percentage points (43.7 percent) at age
63. Overall, an employer contribution of 50 percent or more reduces the total number of person-years
worked between ages 56 and 64 by 9.6 percent relative to no coverage.

   1. Introduction

   In the United States, there is currently a strong link between health insurance and

employment. Most individuals can only purchase health insurance at favorable group rates

through their employer, and there are significant tax advantages to employer-based coverage.

Employment-based health insurance can make it more difficult for individuals to retire before

they become eligible for health insurance through Medicare at age 65. While some employers

extend health insurance coverage to their pre-65 retirees, most do not. According to the Kaiser

Family Foundation (2010), only 28 percent of large firms (with 200 or more employees) and 3

percent of small firms that offer employee health coverage also extend benefits to retirees. A

worker whose employer does not offer retiree health coverage has limited options for obtaining

health insurance if he or she retires before becoming eligible for Medicare. Buying an individual

health insurance policy can be difficult, particularly for those with preexisting conditions. The

Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985 allows workers who leave

their jobs to continue to participate in their former employer’s health plan at group rates for up to

18 months. This law makes it possible for workers to retire at age 63½ without losing group

coverage, although they would forego any employer contribution toward their premiums.

   In this paper, we investigate the impact of the availability of group health insurance on the

decision to retire. We have access to a unique and rich data source for examining this question.

Our dataset consists of employee records from a large and diverse group of firms, drawn from

among the clients of Towers Watson, a leading benefits consulting firm. These employee

records are matched to detailed information about the firms’ benefit provisions. Some of Towers

Watson’s clients offer health insurance to their retirees, while others do not. Moreover, the

retiree health benefits that are offered vary considerably in their generosity. Another advantage



                                                                                                    2
of our dataset is that we can control for a number of firm-level characteristics that influence

retirement, including specific features of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.

If access to health insurance does in fact influence retirement decisions, then we would expect to

find a relationship between retiree health coverage and retirement, especially for persons age 65

or younger.

   This question is particularly important in light of the recently passed Patient Protection and

Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of 2010, which will considerably weaken the link between

employment and health insurance by making group coverage available to all individuals

regardless of employment. Many individuals will also receive explicit subsidies to purchase

group coverage, and older individuals will also likely receive substantial implicit subsidies

through a legal limit on their premiums relative to those paid by younger individuals. One

possible consequence of this reform is that it may encourage earlier retirements, as all older

workers will be able to maintain group coverage – often with generous subsidies – even if they

retire before Medicare eligibility. Studying the link between employer-provided health insurance

and retirement can help us to understand the potential impact of PPACA on the labor market

participation of older pre-Medicare workers.

   To provide a preview of our results, we find that after controlling for demographic

characteristics and pension plan features, subsidized retiree health coverage (i.e., coverage in

which the employer contributes towards the premium) raises the probability of turnover by 3.7

percentage point (21.2 percent) at age 62 and 5.1 percentage points (32.2 percent) at age 63. The

effect is more modest for individuals under the age of 62. A more generous employer

contribution of 50 percent or more raises the probability of turnover by 1-3 percentage points at

ages 56-61, by 5.9 percentage points (33.7 percent) at age 62, and by 6.9 percentage points (43.7




                                                                                                    3
percent) at age 63. These effects are even stronger for individuals with 15 or more years of

service, who are more likely to be eligible for coverage. In this group, subsidized coverage

raises the probability of turnover by 6.3 percentage points (32.6 percent) at age 62, by 7.4

percentage points (43.2 percent) at age 63, and by 3.5 percentage points (21.0 percent) at age 64.

Effects for individuals under age 62 are smaller, but still present. We find little evidence that

“access only” (i.e., coverage in which the retiree gets a group rate but the employer does not

contribute towards the premium) influences retirement decisions in this age range. These results

are consistent with the hypothesis that Medicare eligibility influences workers’ retirement

decisions, specifically among individuals who are younger than age 65 and do not have access to

subsidized retiree health coverage.

   The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the previous

literature on the relationship between health insurance and retirement, and describes the

contribution of this paper. Section 3 describes our dataset. Section 4 presents our methodology,

and Section 5 discusses our results. Section 6 concludes



   2. Prior Research on Health Insurance and Retirement

   Prior studies have used a variety of approaches to estimate the effect of health insurance on

retirement. A number of studies use a reduced form approach to examine the retirement (labor

force exit) rates or labor force participation rates of those with and without retiree health

coverage, controlling for other factors and, in some cases, for selection into retiree health

coverage based on unobservable characteristics. In general, these studies find that retiree health

coverage substantially increases the probability of early retirement among pre-Medicare eligible

workers. Blau and Gilleskie (2001) estimate that subsidized retiree health coverage increases the




                                                                                                     4
rate of retirement (labor market exit) by about 2 percentage points per year among male workers

aged 51-61, with an increase of 7.5 percentage points among 61-year-olds. They find that the

effect on retirement is positive starting at age 54 and increases with age. Kapur and Rogowski

(2011) estimate that retiree health insurance raises retirement rates by between 3 and 5

percentage points (depending on gender and marital status) for workers under the age of 65.

Marton and Woodbury (2006) find effects of a similar magnitude, in the range of 3-4 percentage

points for males aged 51-61. Karoly and Rogowski (1994) estimate that retiree health coverage

roughly doubles (from 12 percent to 24 percent) the probability of retirement over a 2-year

period for men aged 55-62. Robinson and Clark (2010) use a proportional hazard model to show

that individuals aged 50-60 with retiree health insurance are 21.2 percent more likely to leave

their job. Strumpf (2010) finds that retiree health coverage raises the probability of being retired

by 8 percentage points, on average, for individuals under the age of 65. Madrian (1994) finds

that retiree health coverage reduces the age of retirement by 5-16 months.

   An alternative approach followed by a number of authors is to estimate a structural model of

retirement, and to use the estimated model to simulate the impact of retiree health coverage.

These studies tend to find smaller effects than those that use the reduced form approach. Blau

and Gilleskie (2008) estimate that retiree health coverage reduces the labor force participation

rate of older men by 3.6 percentage points. Studying the behavior of married couples, Blau and

Gilleskie (2006) predict an increase in retirement probability of less than half a percentage point

for men and 1.6 percentage points for women. Gustman and Steinmeier (1994) find that retiree

health coverage increases the probability of leaving full-time employment at age 62 by 2.1

percentage points, a 16 percent increase over the baseline exit rate. Lumsdaine, Stock, and Wise

(1996) find that retiree health insurance raises retirement rates between ages 60 and 64 by about




                                                                                                    5
2 percentage points per year. French and Jones (2011) estimate that retiree health coverage

raises the retirement rate at age 62 by 8.5 percentage points.

   A third approach is to estimate the impact of retiree health coverage using aggregate state-

level data, and variation in state and federal policy. Gruber and Madrian (1995) examine the

state and federal “continuation of coverage” requirements that were adopted during the 1970s

and 1980s. They find that these mandates encouraged earlier retirement. In particular, they find

that the availability of COBRA coverage reduced the labor force participation rate of 55-64 year-

olds by 3.3 percentage points.

   In this paper we follow the first approach, using a unique dataset that is derived from the

employee records of 64 firms. These firms are quite diverse in terms of their industry, size,

location, and other characteristics. The advantage of our dataset over publicly available sources

such as the Health and Retirement Study or the Survey of Income and Program Participation

(used in many of the earlier studies) is that we have detailed information on firm-level retirement

incentives, in particular the incentives inherent in defined benefit pension plans. The main

disadvantage of our data is limited information on employees. For example, we do not have

information on employees’ marital status, health status, other sources of potential retiree health

coverage (e.g., through a spouse), or level of employee retirement assets (Social Security,

pensions, or other saving).



   3. Data

   Towers Watson is a leading benefits consulting firm that assists its clients with the design

and administration of employee benefit programs, particularly pension plans. Its clients consist

of a diverse group of firms in terms of size, industry, location, and employee benefit offerings.




                                                                                                     6
We have access to administrative data on the employees of a large number of Towers Watson’s

clients. This dataset is a panel spanning the years 2005-2009 and containing the employee-level

actuarial information necessary to evaluate each client’s pension liabilities. The dataset includes

each individual’s employer name, hire date, birth date, gender, salary, and employment status on

January 1 of the relevant year.

   We select an initial sample of employees who are active with complete demographic and pay

information in 2005; this restriction effectively excludes individuals hired after January 1, 2005.

Following this initial selection, we use the 2006-2009 data on these employees in our analysis.

Our dependent variable is an indicator for not being employed by the firm in the current period,

conditional on being employed in the previous period. We study the relationship between retiree

health provisions and this turnover indicator.

   We merge these individual-level records with a firm-level survey of benefit plan provisions.

The firm-level survey was compiled by actuaries at Towers Watson who are familiar with the

specific firms’ provisions. The firm-level survey collects data on the provisions applying to

three employee cohorts: (1) the typical full-career employee retiring in 2010, (2) the typical full-

career employee retiring in 2020, and (3) new hires. We match employees to provisions by

assigning each employee to one of these three cohorts based on age and years of service. For

retiree health provisions, individuals with less than 5 years of service (as of 2005) are classified

as new hires. Individuals with 5-9 years of service are classified as 2010 retirees if they are 60

years or older as of 2005, and 2020 retirees if they are under 60 as of 2005. Individuals with 10

or more years of service are classified as 2010 retirees. For defined benefit (DB) pension plan

provisions, individuals with under 5 years of service (as of 2005) are considered new hires, those

with 5-9 years of service (as of 2005) are considered 2020 retirees, and those with 10 or more




                                                                                                       7
years of service (as of 2005) are considered 2010 retirees. For defined contribution (DC)

pension provisions, individuals with under 5 years of service (as of 2005) are classified as new

hires. Individuals with 5-9 years of service (as of 2005) are classified as 2020 retirees if they are

under 65 in 2005 and 2010 retirees if they are 65 and older in 2005. Finally, individuals with 10

or more years of service (as of 2005) are classified as 2010 retirees.

   For each of the three cohorts, we have information on the existence and generosity of retiree

health coverage. Firms may provide either pre-65 coverage or both pre- and post-65

(“Medigap”) coverage. In this paper, we focus on pre-65 coverage. If retiree health coverage is

provided, the actuaries completing the survey are asked to indicate whether retirees have “access

only” or subsidized coverage. Subsidized coverage means that the employer contributes towards

the employees’ health insurance premiums. There are two types of coverage that could

potentially be described as access only. First, the firm may allow retirees to buy insurance at the

same group rates that apply to current employees. Second, a firm may offer separate group

coverage for retirees. In the former case, there is an implicit subsidy from current employees to

retirees, as current employees would generally pay lower premiums than retirees. Thus, adding

retirees to the pool would raise premiums for current employees. In the latter case, retirees

would presumably pay a higher rate than employees. The provisions survey does not distinguish

between these two types of “access only” coverage. The actuaries completing the survey may

have classified either type of coverage as “access only.” Alternatively, some may have classified

the first type as a subsidy, or the second type as no coverage. Thus, we interpret the estimated

effect of “access only” coverage with caution. If subsidized coverage is provided, then




                                                                                                    8
respondents are asked to provide a range for the subsidy rate.1 For each individual, we construct

a set of indicator variables for the existence of access only and subsidized coverage.

       We also have information on the DB pension provisions applying to each of the three

cohorts. For each cohort, we know the plan formula (traditional or hybrid), as well as the plan

status (open, frozen, or closed). A traditional plan promises an annuity benefit based on a

formula related to an employee’s earnings history. A hybrid plan operates more like a defined

contribution plan. Plan contributions are credited to a “notional” account that earns interest or

credits at a stipulated rate. A plan is open if new hires are enrolled in the plan and existing

participants continue to accrue benefits. A plan is closed if new hires are not enrolled in the

plan, but existing participants continue to accrue benefits. A plan is frozen if new hires are not

enrolled in the plan and existing participants no longer accrue benefits. If a plan is closed or

frozen we know, in most cases, the year in which the change occurred. Respondents are also

asked to rate the generosity of the firm’s DB plan on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the most

generous. Respondents were provided guidelines for categorizing the generosity levels based on

the percentage of a member’s salary that is notionally put aside, commonly called an “accrual

rate” for traditional DB plans or a “pay credit” for hybrid pension plans. The guidelines

suggested that traditional DB plans with accrual rates of 1 percent or lower are low generosity,

plans with accrual rates of around 1.3 percent are average, and plans with accrual rates of 2

percent or higher are high generosity. Likewise, hybrid plans with 3 percent pay credits are low

generosity, plans with 7 percent pay credits are average generosity, and plans with 10 percent

pay credits are high generosity. We consolidate generosity into three categories (above average,

average, and below average).



1
    If a zero subsidy rate is indicated, we recode coverage as “access only.”


                                                                                                     9
       Individuals are matched to DB formula (hybrid or traditional) and generosity measures based

on their classification into the three cohorts (new hires, retiring in 2020, or retiring in 2010).

However, DB plan status is assigned based on freeze and close dates as follows. An individual

has no DB plan if he or she was hired after a DB plan was frozen or closed to new hires. An

individual hired before the close date is covered by a DB plan. Those covered by a DB plan may

have a plan status of either frozen or open. A plan’s status is frozen if the year of observation is

later than the freeze year, and open otherwise. For each individual, we construct a set of

indicator variables for every possible combination of generosity (above average, average, below

average), formula (hybrid, traditional), and status (open, frozen). One shortcoming of the DB

data is that some firms offer multiple DB plans covering different groups of workers. In such

cases, the plan provision survey contains information on the firm’s main DB plan. The firm’s

main plan may not be the actual plan applying to a particular employee. However, the features

of the main plan indicate the general direction of the firm’s DB policy. For example, a firm that

freezes its main DB plan or makes its main DB plan less generous is likely to be moving in the

same direction for its other plans.

       Eligibility for DB and retiree health benefits is typically based on age and years of service.

We have some information on these eligibility criteria, but this information is incomplete or

missing for a number of firms, particularly for DB pensions.2 Thus, we do not directly make use

of eligibility criteria. We only consider whether DB and retiree health benefits are offered for an

employee’s cohort. However, service requirements for retiree medical coverage tend to fall in

the 10-15 year range, and we perform our analysis separately on employees with 15 or more

years of service.



2
    We do not have retiree health eligibility criteria for three employers, representing more than 9,500 observations.


                                                                                                                         10
   The generosity of the DC plan is also included for each of the three cohorts. We include

measures of both matching and non-matching contributions. We summarize DC matching

contributions by calculating the total match amount offered, as a percentage of pay, if the

employee contributes to the maximum pay threshold. This is commonly referred to as the

effective or total match rate. Some firms also offer non-matching contributions. In other words,

they contribute funds without requiring an employee contribution. These contributions are often

discretionary based on company performance. Since these contributions can vary from one year

to the next, we include the average over 2008 to 2010 as a proxy for the typical contribution,

expressed as an average percentage of pay.

   Additional variables used in the analysis include age and gender, years of service, firm-level

turnover among 55-year-olds (as a proxy for retirement incentives not captured by the pension

provisions), and salary in 2005. We use salary in 2005 rather than current year salary because

current year salary tends to be very low for those who retired during the year. We do not have

data on employee marital status, or on whether an individual’s spouse has access to employee or

retiree health insurance. Thus, we cannot control for the availability of retiree health insurance

through a spouse, or for the incentive to maintain coverage for a spouse who is not yet eligible

for Medicare. We also do not have information on employee health status.

   Our analysis if based on person-year observations for employees aged 55 to 69. After

merging the employee dataset with the firm provisions dataset, we have a total of 64 firms and

302,871 person-year observations. Summary statistics for all variables used in our analysis are

presented in Table 1. Appendix A describes in greater detail the steps taken to clean up the data

and impute missing values.




                                                                                                   11
   4. Methods

   To motivate our analysis, Figure 1a shows turnover rates by age for three categories of

employees: those with no retiree health coverage, those with “access only” coverage, and those

with subsidized coverage. It is clear from the figure that individuals with subsidized coverage

have substantially higher turnover rates at ages 62 to 65 than those without coverage, but not at

other ages. Figure 1b shows turnover rates for the access only and subsidy groups as percentage

deviations from the turnover rate of the no coverage group. For example, the turnover rate at age

63 for the subsidy group is more than 40 percent larger than the turnover rate for the no coverage

group.

   Starting with a group of 54-year-old workers and applying the turnover rates in Figure 1a,

Figure 2a shows the fraction of these workers remaining at ages 55 to 69. Figure 2b shows the

fraction of 54-year-olds remaining at each age for the subsidy and access only groups, expressed

as the percentage deviation from the no coverage group. For example, by age 64, the fraction of

55-year-olds remaining in the subsidy group is close to 30 percent lower than in the no coverage

group.

   While these figures are suggestive, they do not control for pension provisions and individual

characteristics that may also influence retirement. To control for the influence of these other

attributes, we estimate probit models, separately for each age (from 55 to 69) in which the

dependent variable is the indicator for turnover described in the previous section. Thus, we

model the probability of no longer being employed in the current year, conditional on being

employed in the previous year. Our key independent variables are a set of dummies describing

the type of retiree health coverage available to the individual. Other explanatory variables

include individual characteristics such as gender, years of service, years of service squared, and




                                                                                                  12
the log of 2005 salary. We also include year dummies and controls for the pension provisions

applying to the individual. Pension provision controls include the set of DB indicator variables

for every possible combination of generosity (above average, average, below average), formula

(hybrid, traditional), and status (open, frozen), as well as DC total match rate and DC

nonmatching percentage. To attempt to control for firm-level retirement incentives that may not

be fully captured by the pension variables, we include the firm’s turnover rate at age 55. We try

two alternative specifications for the retiree health dummy variables. First, we divide retiree

health coverage into three categories: no coverage, access only, and subsidy (of any level). We

include indicator variables for access only and subsidy in our regressions. Second, we further

divide subsidized coverage into three groups by replacing the subsidy indicator variable with

indicator variables for subsidy under 50 percent, subsidy of 50 percent or more, and unknown

subsidy. Our age-specific estimation allows all parameters to vary with age. We estimate all our

models for the full sample of workers, as well as the subset of workers with 15 or more years of

service, as most individuals in this group would be eligible for coverage. In all regressions,

standard errors are clustered by firm.

   Our approach may be inappropriate for estimating the impact of retiree health coverage on

retirement if individuals select into retiree health coverage based on unobservable characteristics.

Alternatively, despite our controls for pension incentives, there may be unobservable firm

characteristics that influence retirement decisions and are also correlated with retiree health

coverage. For example, French and Jones (2011) present evidence to suggest that employees of

firms that offer retiree health coverage tend to have a stronger preference for leisure than

employees of other firms; indeed, they find that differences in labor force participation between

these groups persist beyond age 65. Blau and Gilleskie (2001) find that accounting for selection




                                                                                                  13
into retiree health coverage raises the estimated impact of such coverage; on the other hand,

French and Jones (2011) find that it modestly lowers the estimated impact of coverage.

   While it is not possible to rule out this type of bias entirely within the constraints of our data,

there are several reasons why we think selection is unlikely to be a significant concern. First, as

Madrian (1994) points out, employees are unlikely to choose a job based on retiree health

coverage. Many employees – particularly when they are further from retirement – do not know

whether their employer offers retiree health insurance. Workers with 15 or more years of service

are especially unlikely to have considered retiree health insurance as a factor in choosing their

job. If we find a relationship that is at least as strong for this group, we can conclude that

selection is unlikely to be a problem. Second, we control for firm-level turnover at age 55,

which should proxy for unobservable factors that tend to raise early retirement rates across firms.

Finally, theory predicts that subsidized retiree health coverage should influence retirement

behavior for workers under the age of 65. Even though many firms that offer pre-65 coverage

also offer Medigap coverage to retirees who are 65 and older, such coverage is far less valuable;

therefore, we would expect to find little relationship between subsidized pre-65 coverage and

retirement rates among this group. Thus, to the extent that any unobservable factors affect the

retirement behavior of those just below the age of 65 and those just above in a similar way, we

can use those aged 65 and older as a control group.



   5. Results

   We estimate probit models to explain the probability of turnover separately for each age

group from 55-69. In the main text of the paper, we report only the coefficients on the retiree

health coverage variables. Full regression results are in Appendix B.




                                                                                                    14
    Table 2 reports the results from estimating our model with three categories of retiree health

coverage. The omitted category is no retiree health coverage. The coefficients reported in the

tables are marginal effects3, and standard errors are in parentheses. Subsidized retiree health

coverage has its strongest effects at ages 62 and 63, resulting in a 3.7 percentage point increase

in the probability of turnover age 62 and a 5.1 percentage point increase in the probability of

turnover at age 63. These effects are substantial. Relative to no coverage, subsidized coverage

is associated with a 21.2 percent increase in the probability of turnover age 62, and a 32.2

percent increase in the probability of turnover at age 63. Subsidized coverage has a more modest

and less consistent impact for individuals younger than 62. Access only also has a statistically

insignificant effect for most age groups. There are two potential explanations for this. First, as

discussed earlier, there is some ambiguity about the definition of access only in the firm-level

plan provisions survey. Second, COBRA effectively provides access only coverage. It allows

employees to purchase health coverage at group rates, but without an employer contribution, for

18 months after leaving their job. Thus, access only coverage would not have any additional

value to individuals above the age of 63½, and only a small value to individuals aged 62.

Overall, these findings are similar in magnitude to those reported in prior studies.

    As discussed above, individuals with 15 or more years of service are more likely to be

eligible for retiree health coverage. Thus, we re-estimate our model for all observations with 15

or more years of service. These results are reported in Table 3. As expected, retiree health

coverage appears to have an even stronger impact for the long service group. We find a

statistically significant relationship between subsidized coverage and turnover in all but two of

the pre-65 age groups. As with the full sample, retiree health coverage has its largest effect at

3
  Marginal effects are computed at the age group means of the independent variables. In computing the marginal
effect of a dummy variable that is part of set describing the same attribute (e.g., the set of dummies describing
retiree health coverage or DB coverage), all other dummies in the set are assigned a value of zero (see Bartus 2005).


                                                                                                                  15
age 63, raising the probability of turnover by 7.4 percentage points (43.2 percent). The effect

declines at age 64 as individuals approach Medicare eligibility.

   Table 4 reports the results from estimating the model with five categories of retiree health

coverage. Again, the regression is estimated separately for each age group, and the omitted

category is no coverage. Relative to no coverage, a subsidy of 50 percent or less results in an

increase in the probability of turnover of 5.1 percentage points at age 63; it has no statistically

significant impact among the other pre-65 age groups. A more generous subsidy – of above 50

percent – raises turnover at almost all ages below 65. Consistent with the results in Table 2, the

largest effect (6.9 percentage points, or 43.7 percent) occurs at age 63. Table 5 reports results

from estimating the same model for observations with at least 15 years of service. Again, we

find somewhat larger effects for this group. A subsidy of 50 percent or more raises turnover in

all pre-65 age groups, reaching its maximum impact (8.1 percentage points, or 47.3 percent) at

age 63. Even the lower subsidy rate raises turnover at most ages below 65 for this group.

   To illustrate the impact of controlling for individual characteristics and pension incentives,

Figure 3a plots the turnover rates by age found in the raw data for individuals with subsidized

retiree health coverage and individuals with no coverage. It also plots the predicted turnover

rates for these groups, based on the model in Table 2, after setting the other regressors to their

age-group means. Thus, controlling for other factors reduces only slightly the estimated effect of

retiree health insurance on turnover. Figure 3b shows the predicted turnover rate of the subsidy

group as a percentage deviation from the predicted turnover rate of the no coverage group.

Figure 4a shows the fraction of 54-year-old employees remaining at each age based on the

turnover rates in Figure 3a. Figure 4b shows the fraction of 54-year-olds remaining for the

subsidy group as a percentage deviation from the corresponding value for the no coverage group.




                                                                                                      16
After controlling for individual characteristics and pension provisions, at firms with subsidized

coverage, only 15.6 percent of those who were employed at age 54 are still with their firm at age

65, compared to 20.0 percent at firms with no coverage. This represents a difference of 21.9

percent.

   To illustrate the effects of the different subsidy levels, Figure 5a shows predicted turnover

rates (using the model of Table 4 and setting all other covariates to their age-group means) for no

coverage, a subsidy under 50 percent, and a subsidy of 50 percent or more. Figure 5b shows the

predicted turnover rates for the two subsidy groups as a percentage deviation from the predicted

no coverage turnover rates. For example, at age 63, a subsidy of 50 percent or more raises the

predicted turnover rate by more than 40 percent. Figure 6a shows the implied percentage of 54-

year-olds remaining for each of the three coverage groups based on the turnover rates in Figure

5a, and Figure 6b shows the proportion remaining as a percentage deviation from the no

coverage group. For example, by age 65, only 14.3 percent of employed 54-year-olds with a

subsidy of 50 percent or more remain, compared to 20.2 percent of employed 54-year-olds with

no coverage. This represents a difference of close to 30 percent.

   If we put these results in the context of the number of person-years worked over ages 55-64,

we can further highlight the impact that retiree health subsidies have on retirement patterns. For

example, we can apply the turnover rates from Figure 5 and estimate the total number of person-

years worked for each coverage level over ages 55-64. Summing over this age range, we find

that a subsidy of 50 percent or more reduces the number of person-years worked in this age

range by a total of 9.6 percent. For a workforce with 2,500 employees aged 54, this implies a

loss of over 1,400 person-years. The impact is even larger for workers with 15 or more years of

service. A subsidy of 50 percent or more reduces the total number of person-years worked




                                                                                                   17
between ages 55 and 64 by 13.4 percent relative to no coverage. Again, for a workforce with

2,500 employees aged 54, this equates to a reduction in over 2,000 person-years.

   An alternative way to view the results is to compute the impact of retiree health coverage on

the expected age of departure (or retirement, assuming most departures in our age range

represent retirements). If we assume that all 69-year-olds retire at age 70, we can use our

turnover rates from Figure 5 to compute the full probability distribution of retirement ages for a

54-year-old worker. We perform this calculation for three types of coverage: no coverage, a

subsidy of under 50 percent, and a subsidy of 50 percent or more. The results are shown in

Table 6. A subsidy under 50 percent lowers the expected retirement age by about 3 months,

while a subsidy of 50 percent or more lowers it by 9 months. Not surprisingly given our

regression results, if we perform the same calculation for workers with 15 or more years of

experience we find even bigger effects. A subsidy under 50 percent lowers the expected

retirement age by more than 10 months, and a subsidy of 50 percent or more lowers it by more

than a year.



   6. Conclusions

   For most people under the age of 65, group health insurance coverage is only available

through employment. In this paper, we have presented evidence to show that the link between

health insurance and employment may cause individuals to delay retirement until they are

eligible for Medicare. In particular, we have shown that after controlling for individual

characteristics and pension incentives, employees under the age of 65 have substantially higher

turnover rates at firms that offer subsidized retiree health coverage compared to their

counterparts at firms that do not. Moreover, higher subsidy rates are associated with greater




                                                                                                 18
turnover than lower ones. Subsidized coverage has its largest effect at ages 62 and 63, raising

the turnover rates at these ages by 3.7 percentage points (21.2 percent) and 5.1 percentage points

(32.2 percent) respectively. A more generous subsidy of 50 percent or more raises turnover by

5.9 percentage points (33.7 percent) at age 62 and 6.9 percentage points (43.7 percent) at age 63.

These effects decrease at age 64, as individuals approach Medicare eligibility. Our model

predicts that, conditional on working at age 54, only 15.6 of individuals with subsidized

coverage remain at their firm at age 65, compared to 20.0 percent of individuals with no retiree

health coverage.

   The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which became law in 2010, will

soon weaken the link between health insurance and employment by making it possible for all

individuals to buy group coverage regardless of employment status. It could also provide a

considerable number of individuals with subsidies towards their health insurance premiums,

depending on their household income and employer-provided coverage. For those who qualify

for a subsidy, the new law provides a tax credit such that the premium a person pays does not

exceed 9.5 percent of household income. For those with income less than 400 percent of the

Federal Poverty Level, the subsidies are even greater. Older Americans who do not qualify for

explicit subsidies can still expect to receive substantial implicit subsidies. The new law prohibits

insurers from charging older individuals – even those with pre-existing conditions – premiums

that are more than three times the rates paid by younger individuals. As such, many older

workers across all income groups will have new opportunities for affordable, non-employment

based health care coverage that is comparable to today’s employer-provided subsidized pre-65

retiree medical coverage today.




                                                                                                  19
   Based on our results, we would expect these new alternatives to increase retirement rates

among older workers who are below Medicare eligibility age. The primary effect will be on

those with current employer-provided coverage who would not be able to obtain retiree coverage

if they left their jobs; health care reform effectively provides these individuals with some level of

subsidized retiree coverage.

   We are hesitant to use our results to make a projection for the population as a whole given

the complex structure of the subsidies and the fact that our sample consists of individuals whose

employers have offered defined benefit (DB) pension plans in the past. However, this would be

a valuable undertaking for future research. Despite these limitations, our results still suggest that

the effects of affordable retiree medical coverage, of the sort that will be available to all

Americans in 2014 under PPACA, could have a substantial impact on future retirement patterns.

   The social welfare implications of this change in retirement incentives are not

straightforward. Viewed by itself, the link between health insurance and employment (which

results from the favorable tax treatment of employer-provided coverage) distorts retirement

decisions, and breaking that link would increase efficiency. However, viewed in the context of

other policies that affect retirement incentives, this may not be the case. For example, Social

Security imposes high implicit tax rates on older workers and inefficiently encourages early

retirement (see, e.g., Goda, Shoven, and Slavov 2009). For individuals below Medicare

eligibility age, there is currently a countervailing effect: employment-based health insurance

discourages early retirement and mitigates the distortion caused by Social Security. Breaking the

link between employment and health insurance removes this countervailing effect, thereby

amplifying the distortion caused by Social Security and potentially reducing efficiency. A

valuable area for future research would be to examine the impact of PPACA in the context of




                                                                                                  20
other policies that affect the retirement incentives of older workers, including not only Social

Security, but also other entitlement programs and policies towards private DB and DC pensions.

Appendix A: Data

    In this appendix, we detail the steps taken to clean up the employee-level administrative data,
as well as the firm plan provisions data.

Employee Data
    To begin, we drop individuals with missing birth dates and hire dates, individuals whose
gender is coded inconsistently across years, and individuals with hire dates that imply they were
hired before the age of 18. We exclude any person-year observations with less than one year of
service or a salary of less than $10,000 in 2005. A low salary is likely to indicate a partial year
and may result if, for example, an employee leaves or retires during the year.
    A worker’s employment status is “active” if he or she is currently working and accruing
benefits. We use employment status to create an indicator variable for employee turnover, which
serves as the dependent variable in our analysis. For each employee, the turnover indicator for
the current year takes on a value of zero if the employee is active as of January 1 of the current
year, and was also active on January 1 of the previous year. The turnover indicator takes on a
value of 1 if an employee who was active on January 1 of the previous year is inactive (retired,
disabled, on leave, etc.) or missing from the dataset on January 1 of the current year. The
turnover indicator is missing in all other cases (i.e., for employees who were not active in the
previous year).
    Our turnover indicator does not distinguish between retirements and other reasons for leaving
the firm or dataset. For example, an employee may leave the firm to take a job at another firm.
In addition, an employee can be dropped from the dataset for a number of reasons. In some
cases, we do not have administrative data for a firm for a given year because of a merger or
acquisition, divestiture, bankruptcy or severed client relationship with Towers Watson. In these
cases, all employees of the firm are missing from the sample for a given year. Specific
individuals can show up missing in a given year, yet be active in the previous year. This could
reflect an employee retiring from the company and taking a lump sum benefit (rather than an
annuity), which eliminates the pension liability from the employer’s books. In addition, a
number of employee records are simply missing for some firms in particular years even if the
employees have not departed or retired.
    To deal with these issues, we impose several data restrictions. First, we drop all employees
of a firm in a given year if the firm has a calculated turnover rate of more than 30 percent or less
than 1 percent for that year. Secondly, we restrict the data to firms in which at least 60 percent
of the active 2005 employees remain in the database in years 2006 to 2009 and do not drop out
of the sample with an unknown status change. For the second criterion, note that individuals
with a known status change (e.g., from active to retiree status) are retained in the sample for the
entire sample period. Firms that fail to meet this criterion are excluded from the sample for that
year.
    In addition to these restrictions, we exclude one large firm that offers its employees a phased
retirement option. Employees taking this option are classified as having left the firm, resulting in
a very high measured turnover rate – in the 70-to-90 percent range – at age 65. Thus, measured
turnover at this firm does not reflect actual turnover; for many workers, it reflects the start of a
phased retirement. This firm offers retiree coverage with an employer contribution rate of under
50 percent to its 2010 and 2020 retiree cohorts. If we include this firm in our analysis, we find a
very large and statistically significant impact of a subsidy of under 50 percent on turnover at age



                                                                                                 34
65 and beyond. However, the pre-65 results, or the results for other subsidy levels, are not
affected much.

Provisions Data
    Some firms have missing or inappropriate responses on benefit plan provisions for one or
more of the three cohorts. We impute many of these responses by substituting values for another
cohort.
    In addition, we fill in some missing retiree health provision information from another firm-
level survey conducted jointly by Towers Watson and the International Society of Certified
Employee Benefits Specialists (ISCEBS). The Towers Watson/ISCEBS survey includes
information for 2010 and 2020 retirees, and there is some overlap with the firms included in our
provisions survey. If the alternative survey indicates coverage for 2010 retirees and no coverage
for 2020 retirees, we assume no coverage for new hires as well.
    Defined Benefit (DB) plans are classified as either hybrid or traditional. Any responses other
than these are coded as either hybrid or traditional depending on the information provided. For
example, “career average” is coded as traditional and “5 percent cash balance” is coded as
hybrid.
    Most closed or frozen DB plans provide a close or freeze year. For some firms, multiple
close or freeze years are provided – for example, a response may indicate that benefit accruals
for service and pay, or for different subsidiaries, were frozen in different years. In these cases,
we used the earliest freeze year provided. Several firms indicate a freeze or close date of
“Before 2003.” These are coded as 2003. If a DB plan close date is provided, but not a freeze
date, and there is an indication that the plan is frozen (i.e., status is given as frozen for one ore
more of the employee groups), we assume the plan was frozen in the same year that it was closed
to new entrants. If a freeze date is provided, but no close date, we assume the plan was closed to
new entrants in the same year that it was frozen.

                              Appendix B: Full Regression Results

    This appendix provides full regression results for the models in Tables 2-5 (labeled as Tables
A2-A5 respectively). For the defined benefit (DB) provisions, the omitted category is an open
traditional plan of average generosity (Average Traditional – Open). This is the DB plan type
that covers the largest group of employees in our sample. For the retiree health coverage
provisions, the omitted category is no coverage. For the year dummies, the omitted category is
2006.
