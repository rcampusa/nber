        Our paper analyzes historical data for New York State on the percentagee of school budget
proposals that are defeated each year and panel data that we have collected on budget vote success for
indvidual school districts in the state. We find that changes in state aid matter, but not as much as one
might expect. Defeating a budget proposal in one year neither increases nor decreases the likelihood that
voters will defeat a proposal the next year. Districts whose school board members have longer terms have
lower probabilities of having their budget proposals defeated. Finally, measures of school district
educational and financial performance do not appear to influence budget vote outcomes.

    I.       Introduction

         Public elementary and secondary education is financed in New York State

    primarily through state aid to local school districts and through local school district

    revenues. In 1999-2000, the former provided about 44 percent of total school district

    expenditures and the latter 52 percent, with the balance of funds coming from the

    federal government. The primary source of local school district revenues,

    approximately 90 percent statewide, is property tax revenue generated from a tax on

    residential and commercial property in each district.

         Each spring, on a designated date, voters in the vast majority of each of the

    almost 700 local school districts in the state vote on a budget that has been proposed

    by their local school district’s board of education. Given estimates of expected state

    aid to the district, its other sources of revenue, and the value of property in the

    district, the budget determines the tax rate that will be levied to support the school

    district during the forthcoming academic year. At the same time that the budget vote

    takes place, the voters also vote to elect some fraction of the local school board

    members

         In the event that the budget is defeated, a school board faces a decision. It can

    adopt a contingency budget that is mandated by state law and that restricts the

    district’s spending in the next year to exceed no more than a specified percentage of

    its spending in the current year.1 Alternatively, the school board can resubmit the

    budget that was defeated or submit an alternative, usually smaller, budget, to the

  Contingency budgets are capped at a percentage increase over the previous year's budget that is the lesser
of 4 percent or 1.2 times the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Administrative costs are limited
in contingent budgets. as are any expenses that are not deemed legally required to operate and maintain the
school district.

voters for their consideration. If the budget fails on the second vote, the district must

then adopt a contingency budget.

    A contingency budget limits a district’s expenditures in a number of ways, for

example it reduces the district’s transportation costs by increasing the distances that

students must live from schools before free transportation to school is provided to

them. Being forced to adopt a contingency budget is rarely in a school district’s best

long-run interest because the contingency budget then becomes the base upon which

the following year’s budget proposal is built. Having spending severely restricted in

one year, makes it difficult to both restore cut programs and to provide for

inflationary increases in the next year’s budget.

    A number of school districts in New York State do adopt their budgets without

explicit votes of the voters. School districts that are located in the 5 largest cities in

the state, Buffalo, New York City, Rochester, Syracuse, and Yonkers have their

budgets determined by their school boards, subject to a constitutional tax limit on the

total municipal budget. The 57 small city school districts, districts whose boundaries

coincide with city lines and are located in cities with populations of less than 125,000

have had their districts’ voters vote on the districts’ school budgets only since

legislation permitting them to do so was passed in 1997. Finally, a few school

districts in the state are classified as “special act districts”; these districts have been

established for special purposes, such as the education of youths with criminal

records in residential detention centers and the education of youths with disabilities,

and the school boards in these districts also determine these districts’ budgets.




                                            2
However, for the vast majority of school districts in the state, over 630 in the early 1990s

and then over 680 in the late 1990s, annual school budget referenda are the rule.

        In July of 2001, one of us was appointed the superintendent of schools of a school

district whose board proudly informed her that the district’s voters had not rejected any

budget proposal during the past 25 years. While this statement was designed to show her

how much the community valued public education, it stimulated us to think more

systematically about the whole issue of school budget referendum and why they

sometimes go down to defeat.2 This paper represents the results of our thinking.

          We begin in the next section by presenting historical data for New York State

on the percentage of school board budgets that have been defeated each year. Inasmuch

as this percentage varies over time, we try to explain what some of the factors are that

influence the percentage of budgets that are passed each year. As might be expected, a

key variable proves to be whether state aid to education is increasing in real terms.

        If the pass rate in a year is 80 percent, then in four-fifths of the districts the voters

approved the budgets and in one-fifth of the districts the voters did not approve the

budgets. This leads us to question why the probability of budget passage varies across

districts in a given year and to ask whether budget failures are concentrated among a

relatively small number of districts. To answer these questions requires us to have data

for individual districts for a number of years on the results of budget referenda.

Remarkably, or perhaps not so, the New York State Department of Education only keeps



2
  A number of previous studies have addressed whether individual voters voted no on budget referendum or
tax limitation proposals. See for example, Paul Courant, Edward Gramlich and Daniel Rubinfeld (1980),
Gramlich and Rubinfeld (1990), R. Hamilton Lankford (1985a, 1985b) and Rubinfeld (1977). Thomas
Romer, Howard Rosenthal and Vincent G. Munley (1992) present a structural model of voting on school
budget referendum in New York State and estimate the model using budget referenda data for a single year
in the 1970s.


                                                   3
the results of individual school board elections on file, in electronic or print form, for

three to five years. So in section III, we describe a survey that we undertook of all local

school districts in the state and show how the pass rates in our sample in each year

correspond to the pass rates in the aggregate published data. We show that the frequency

of budget rejections over a twenty-two year period varies widely across school districts.

Interestingly, a substantial fraction of districts always pass their budgets.

         In section IV, we estimate models of the determinants of whether an individual

school district’s budget proposal is defeated by the voters in a year. Our focus in this

section is on financial variables, including changes in state aid. The state school aid

formulas in New York State are so complex and so political that in any year, changes in

state aid per student vary widely across districts. Moreover, the correlations across

districts in the percentage increase in the real per student state aid change going to a

district in one year with the percentage increase in the real per student state aid change in

the next year are quite low3. This provides a type of natural experiment that allows us to

test whether budget vote defeats are higher when state school aid to a district is

increasing at a slower rate than the average rate of increase in state aid to local school

districts in the state. The merging in of data from a variety of other sources permits us to

test a number of other hypotheses.

          The panel data also allow us to ascertain if districts in which voters have defeated

budgets in the recent past are more likely than other districts to see their referenda

defeated in the current year. As might be expected the answer is yes and that leads us to

try to distinguish between the hypotheses that this relationship reflects that voting down a

 The highest correlation of per student real state aid changes across school districts in our sample for any
two adjacent years was .33. For the vast majority of adjacent years it was under .1 in absolute value.

budget in one year makes it more likely that the budget will be voted down in a

subsequent year (state dependence) or that it simply reflects that there are variables

omitted from our models that simultaneously cause a district’s voters to vote down the

budget proposed by the school board in two consecutive years (heterogeneity).4 After

briefly describing some extensions of our empirical work in which we sought to ascertain

if measures, or changes in measures, of school district “performance” influence voter

behavior in section V, we provide some brief concluding remarks



      II.      Historical Data on New York State School District Budget Referenda

      Table 1 presents annual data for the 1969 to 1999 period on the number of school

districts in New York State that held budget votes, the number of these budgets that were

passed by the voters and thus the percentage of school district budgets that were adopted

by the voters. The number of districts that held budget votes declined gradually from 690

in 1969 to 628 in 1996 reflecting the gradual consolidation of small districts into larger

ones within New York State. The increase to 685 in 1997 reflects the passage of the state

law that allowed small city districts to submit their budgets to the voters. The fraction of

districts in which voters adopted proposed budgets fluctuated over time ranging from

lows of under 70 percent in 1978 and 1994 to highs of over 90 percent in 1984, 1998 and

1999.

      What determines the fraction of school districts whose voters pass their budgets each

year? Financial variables surely matter. If state aid per student is increasing in real terms,

any given size school board budget proposal will require a smaller increase in the school

district property tax and thus should be more likely to win voter support.5 Similarly, the

more rapidly per capita real state income is increasing in the state; the more likely voters

will be to accept any given sized proposed school budget and tax rate increase. Public

school enrollments also presumably matter; growing enrollments mean more families

with children in the schools and thus a greater base of support. However, the greater the

fraction of school age children in the state educated in private schools, the smaller the

share of tax payers who are likely to support school budget increases. It also is frequently

alleged that the greater the share of the elderly in the population, the greater will be the

probability that school budget votes will be defeated, although this allegation ignores the

fact that many of the elderly are grand parents and, if they live in the same area as their

grandchildren, will have a continued vested interest in the quality of their local schools.

Finally if voters newly voting in small city school districts display different behavior than

voters in districts where voting on the school budget has been a long tradition, one would

have to control for the introduction of the small city voting in the analysis.

    Table 2 presents estimates of equations that seek to explain the time series variation

in the school district budget pass rates in New York State. Recalling that the school

district budget vote occurs in the spring of each year for the following school year, the

estimates in the first colume come from a specification that assumes a type of rational

expectations on the part of voters.

     For example, for the vote that takes place in the spring of 1990, this specification

assume that the voters can accurately predict what their district’s real state aid per student

5
 If a school board accurately represented the preferences of residents of its school districts, a change in any
of the variables discussed in this paragraph, should also influence the size of the budget proposal that the
school board submits to the voters (Rosenthal, Romer and Munley (1992). Hence in a formal sense, the
postulated relationships that follow are based on the school board not behaving as if it were the median
voter in the district.


                                                       6
will be in 1990-91 and thus that they act as if they know the actual percentage increase in

real state aid per student that will occur between 1989-90 and 1990-91. This would

enable them to estimate what their tax rate increase would be, given the proposed budget

and knowledge of the value of property in the district. Similarly, since the 1990-1991

school year encompasses parts of both 1990 and 1991, it assumes that they generate their

expectations about their ability to pay for school tax increases based upon their accurately

estimating the growth of real per capita income in the state between the two years.

Finally, it assumes that they act as if they know what the increase in school enrollments

will be in the 1990-91 school year as compared to the 1989-90 school year.

    The estimated coefficients in this column are disappointing, to say the least. No

variable’s coefficient is even close to being statistically significantly different from zero.

However, lest the reader despair, we have neglected to mention one important fact,

namely that the governor and state legislature in New York State have been unable to

come to agreement on the state budget by the start of the New York State fiscal year

(April 1) for as long as virtually anyone can remember.6 Thus, the actual aid that a school

district will receive during the next academic year is usually unknown at the time of the

budget vote. While a school board usually makes an estimate of the state aid increase

when proposing a budget, which leads to an implicit or explicit proposed tax increase,

voters may not have the same estimate in mind. They may form their expectations of the

likely state aid increases in a different way. One simple alternative, for example, is for

them to assume that the real percentage increase in state aid per student that the district

will receive in the upcoming year is the same as it received in the current year.

6
  The New York State budget has been passed on time by both houses of the state legislature and signed by
the Governor only once since 1982. 2002 marked the 18th straight year that the budget was not approved on
time.


                                                    7
     Returning to our example, school district voters’ votes in the spring of 1990 for the

1990-91 school budget may depend upon the percentage increase in real per state aid per

student that occurred between 1988-89 and 1989-90, not the actual increase that will

materialize between 1989-90 and 1990-91. Similarly, the percentage increase in

enrollment that the voters project will occur may be the percentage increase that occurred

in the current academic year, not the actual realization that will occur in the next year.

Finally, the voters’ willingness to support public schools may be based upon the actual

percentage increase in real income that they experienced between the 1989 and 1990

calendar years, not the actual percentage increase that will occur between 1990 and 1991,

    Column 2 of table 2 presents estimates of the pass rate equation when these

alternative financial and enrollment change variables are included. Remarkably, the fit of

the model is much better. Every one-percentage point increase in real state aid per student

between the current and previous school year is seen to increase the budget pass rate by

about .035 percentage points. Similarly, increases in real income that took place between

the current and previous calendar year strongly influence the pass rate. Finally, the

inclusion of the small city school districts in the sample was associated with about a one-

percentage point increase in the budget pass rate.7

    Column (3) presents estimates of a similarly specified equation; the only difference is

that the dependent variable is now the log odds ratio of the budget pass rate (log (p/(1-

p))) to allow the dependent variable to be normally distributed. The pattern of the signs

and significance of the coefficients is the same as in the previous column, save that

enrollment growth is now positively associated with increased likelihood of budget


7
  Estimates of this equation and the others that follow that control for autocorrelation of the residuals prove
to be virtually identical because the estimated Durbin-Watson statistic is close to two in each case.


                                                       8
passage. If one drops enrollment growth from the equation (column (4)), the fraction of

student enrolled in private schools becomes a statistically significant negative predictor

of budget pass rates, however, we caution that this variable was not statistically

significant when enrollment growth was included in the model.

    In column (5), we return to the linear probability model and estimate a variant of the

model in column (2) that includes the budget pass rate in the previous spring. That is, we

ask if the fraction of districts that pass a budget in one year influences the fraction that

pass it the next year, holding all other variables constant. The coefficient of the lagged

dependent variable is small and statistically insignificantly different from zero,

suggesting that at the state level, budget vote behavior in one year does not influence

budget vote behavior in the next year. Moreover, the magnitude and statistical

significance of the percentage change in real state aid per student remain about the same

as before. Use of an instrument for the lagged dependent variable, to control for the

possibility of autocorrelation in this model with a lagged dependent variable, yielded

virtually identical results.



    III.    Individual School District Data

    Although the New York State Education Department’s Office of Enrollment

Management Services has maintained records of the fraction of school districts in which

voters passed school budgets annually going back to 1969, it discards the results of

individual school district’s vote passage history after 3 to 5 years. Currently, only the




                                               9
individual school district vote passage records for the votes taken for the 1998-99, 1999-

00, 2000-01 and 2001-02 school years are available from it.8

      To obtain historical data, the Cornell Computer-Assisted Survey Team (CAST)

conducted a survey for us of all school districts in New York State, except for those in

New York City, during the summer and fall of 2001. The survey requested information

for the 1975 to 1997 period on the results of the initial budget referendum each year, if

the initial proposed budget was defeated whether a second budget was submitted to the

voters and, if a second budget was submitted, whether that budget passed. The survey

also requested information on the number of members on the school board and the length

of their terms in office.

       Of the 699 districts surveyed, 6 proved to be special districts in which school budget

votes did not occur, 32 refused to participate and 137 did not reply to repeated requests.

We received usable responses from 499 districts for the budget votes undertaken in the

spring of 1997, which represented about 75% of all the New York State local school

districts that held budget votes that spring. The number of years for which districts

provided voting histories to us varied and not surprisingly the number of reporters

declined as we went further back in time. For the earliest year for which we requested

data in our survey, 1975, there were 328 respondents, which represented about 49% of

the total budget votes that took place in that year (table 1).

      Table 3a provides information on the number of school districts that reported their

budget votes to us for each year, the percentage of the sample districts whose budgets

were adopted by the voters on the first vote, the percentage of the sample district whose

voters ultimately approved a budget, and the actual aggregate percentage of districts in

                                                   10
the state whose districts approved budgets in each year. The percentage of districts in our

sample whose budgets were ultimately approved by the voters in 1997 exceeds the

percentage of all districts in the state whose voters approved budgets that year by almost

10 percentage points, which indicates that districts that refused to participate in our

survey, or that did not respond to the survey, were more likely to be districts whose

voters had rejected the budget proposal in that year. As one goes further back in time, on

average, the divergence between the pass rate among districts in our survey that provided

information for a year and the aggregate pass rate for all districts in the state gets larger.

However, as the bottom panel of table 3a indicates the correlations over time between the

published pass rate data found in table 1 and the initial and final pass rates for our

samples of reporting districts, .926 and .843 respectively, are quite high.

    There were 294 districts in our sample that provide information on whether voters

approved the budgets in their districts for every year between 1975 and 1997. Table 3b

presents pass rate information for these districts; their average pass rates, both initially

and finally, are slightly higher than the average pass rates found in the previous table.

The correlation of the pass rates for these districts with the reported published pass rate is

very similar to those found in the previous table.

    Do budget pass rates vary systematically across school districts? A hint of this

appears in the comparison of the results for all districts and for the respondents to our

survey that appear in tables 3a and 3b. Table 4 confirms that they do by tabulating the

number of times each of the 294 school districts saw their budget proposals defeated by

the voters during the 22 year period for which we collected data. Fifty-six of the districts,

or 19%, always had the voters approve their budget on the initial vote. One hundred and




                                              11
fifty four of the districts, or 52%, always had a budget proposal ultimately approved by

the voters and thus never had to adopt a contingency budget.

    The number of times that voters defeated school budget proposals in other districts

varies across districts from 1 to 12 times during the 22 year period. The norm is

obviously budget passage and as the number of budget defeats increases, the number of

districts steadily decreases. On average, districts in our sample saw their initial budget

proposals defeated 13 percent of the time and went to contingency budgets 5.5 percent of

the time. For those districts that held second votes on the same or a revised budget, the

probability of passage the second time was about 58 percent.



    IV.      Why Do Budget Referendum Failures Vary Across School Districts

    The availability of data on the characteristics of school districts and their finances in

New York State that is available in electronic form back to the 1984-85 school year,

along with the data on voting outcomes that we have collected, allow us to analyze data

for a panel of 380 districts that span the 1985-86 to 1996-1997 school years.9 All of the

small city districts, which first began to vote on school budgets in the 1996-97 year, are

omitted from our sample.

          Columns (1) of table 5 presents coefficient estimates of a linear probability

equation model in which the dependent variable is a dichotomous variable indicating

whether a district’s school budget was defeated on the initial vote (1=yes, 0=no) in a


9
  The previous section’s discussion suggests that this sample of districts is not a random sample of the
districts in which voters voted on school budgets in New York State during the period. As such, the results
that follow may be subject to sample selection bias. While there are methods available to control for
selection bias (e.g. James Heckman (1979), in the absence of information on a set of variables that
influence whether a district appears in our sample but do not influence the voting outcome given that they
appear, identification using such methods would be achieved only by functional form assumptions and we
have chosen not to pursue this approach.


                                                    12
year.10 All coefficients in this model have been multiplied by 100, so the coefficient of

each represents our estimate of the effect of a one-unit change in the underlying variable

on the percentage change in the probability that a proposed budget will be defeated.

            In evaluating the results that follow, readers should keep in mind that we do not

have information on the initial budget increases that were proposed for each district in

each year. Many of the variables included in our model should also be expected to

influence school boards’ budget proposals. Absent information on the size of the

proposed budget increase, which presumable would be a key variable in a structural

model of whether a proposed budget was defeated, one should interpret the estimates that

follow as coming from a reduced form model.

            Suburban districts (SUBURB) are about 4 percentage points more likely to defeat

initial school budget proposals than their rural district counterparts. Suburban districts

tend to be larger than rural districts and previous research suggests that school board

members in larger districts are more likely to have an objective of maximizing their

districts’ budgets, while school board members in smaller districts are more likely to

behave as if they represented the median voter.11 Contrary to popular opinion, we find no

evidence that older voters are more likely to vote against school budgets than their

younger counterparts (MORE65). Indeed, the higher the proportion of residents in a

county that are above age 65, the less likely that school districts in a county see their

initial budget proposals defeated. This may reflect either that school districts in counties

in which there are high proportions of older votes moderate their budget proposals to

avoid risking defeat or that older residents, many of whom have grandchildren, retain a

strong concern about the quality of public education in their areas.

       The greater is the proportion of students in a district who are Hispanic American

(HISP), the greater the probability of budget defeats. The magnitude of this relationship

is quite large. Other things equal, districts with 10 percentage points more Hispanic

American residents appear to have a 5 percentage point higher percentage of voters

voting against the budget proposal. In contrast, the greater the share is of American

Indian, Alaskan Native, Asian and Pacific Islander students in the district, (OTHER), the

higher the likelihood that the budget will pass.

       Districts in which there is a lot of mobility of pupils into and out of the district

(PMOB) appear to have a higher chance of seeing their initial school budget proposal

defeated. Similarly, districts with a greater percentage of students receiving free or

reduced price lunch (FLUNCH) are more likely to see their initial budget proposals

defeated, as are districts in which a greater percentage of the students attend private

school (PRIVSCH). However, neither the percentage of students who are of limited

English proficiency (LEP) nor the proportion of students in the community coming from

families below the poverty line (POVERT) appears to influence the probability of our

observing a budget defeat.

       In the absence of an annual data on the income of school district residents, we

attempted to control for variations in the income level of residents across districts by

including real per capita school income of school district residents in 1990 (INCOME).

Districts with higher income residents are more likely to vote down budget proposals. In

contrast, districts with more residents who have college degrees are less likely to vote




                                             14
budgets down (COLLED). Other factors held constant, a 10 percentage point increase in

the percentage of residents with college degrees is associated with a 0.2 percentage point

reduction in the probability of a school budget vote defeat.

       School districts vary in New York State in terms of the size of their school boards

and the length of their school board members’ terms. Almost 50% of the districts in this

sample have 7 board members, another 49% have either 5 or 9 members, and a small

number of districts have 3, 6, or 8 members. About 64% of the districts in this sample

have 3-year terms for their members, 35% have 5-year terms and the remaining districts’

board members have 4-year terms.

         The greater the number of years that school board members serve (BOARDT),

the lower the probability that a budget will be defeated. Moving from 3 to 5-year terms

for example, is associated, other factors held constant, with an almost 5 percentage point

reduction in the likelihood that a budget will be defeated. Apparently longer terms for

school board members are associated with more stability on the board and thus a board

that is more likely to understand the concerns of voters when framing the budget.

       Interestingly, the greater the number of students per school board member, the

more likely budgets will be defeated (BOARDS). The mean number of students (in

hundreds) in a district per school board member in our sample is 3.24 and its standard

deviation is 3.27. An increase, for example, in 100 students per school board member, is

associated with an increase of .85 percentage points in the likelihood that a vote will be

defeated. This implies that the higher the number of students per school board member is,

the less likely it is that the board will be representative of the community. The number of




                                             15
students per school board member is very highly correlated with the size of the school

district so this variable may also simply be capturing school district size.

        The remaining three variables in the equation focus on changes in economic

variables. Greater increases in real income per capita in the county are associated with

lower initial vote failure rates; each percentage point increase in real per capita income

reduces the failure rate by 1.8 percentage point. Increases in real state aid appear to be

much less important, as each percentage point increase in real state aid reduces the initial

failure rate by only .0001 percentage points. This is a somewhat smaller relationship than

was found in our time-series analysis of the statewide average failure rate. Finally,

changes in the real value of property in the district are not associated with the failure rate,

as school boards apparently take these changes into account when framing initial budget

proposals.

        Column (2) reports the coefficients from a similar model that also includes year

fixed effects. The magnitudes and statistical significance of most coefficients is identical

to the results reported in the previous column. In particular the importance of the

percentage real income changes in the county in which the district is located and the

percentage change in real state aid expected per student in the district remain roughly the

same.

        In column (3) we allow for the possibility that failing to pass a budget on the

initial vote in one year leads to a higher (or lower) probability of failing to pass a budget

on the initial vote in the next year. That is, we ask whether budget defeats have a narcotic

effect, in the sense that a budget defeat in a district on the initial vote in one year,

increases the likelihood that the budget will again be defeated on the initial vote in the




                                               16
district in the next year, or whether such a defeat encourages the school board and the

voters to work harder to pass the budget the next time.12

         The inclusion of the lagged dependent variable leaves most of the other

coefficients in the model unchanged. Its coefficient suggests that having a budget

defeated on the initial vote in one year increases the likelihood that a district will see its

budget defeated on the initial vote in the next year by 16.5 percentage points. Hence, at

first glance, the defeat of a budget on the initial vote in one year does seem to increase

the probability that the budget will be defeated on the initial vote in the next year.

         It is by now well-known, however, that such an estimation strategy does not

permit us to distinguish between the hypothesis that budget defeats in one year do truly

influence the likelihood of budget defeats in the next year (state dependence) and the

hypothesis that there are some variables that have been omitted from the analyses that

vary across districts, are relatively constant within each district over time and that

influence the probability of a budget being defeated (heterogeneity).13 Such omitted

variables, which influence the budget vote outcome in one year, will also influence the

outcome in the next year and thus will bias the coefficient of the lagged budget vote

variable in a positive direction.

         If we assume that the effects of these omitted variables on budget vote outcomes

are constant over time for each school district, we can treat them as fixed effects and

reestimate the model. This is equivalent to estimating the model in first-difference form

and the results of this estimation appear in column (4). The impact of changes in real per

arbitration in contract negotiations in one year increases the likelihood that police and firefighters will go to
arbitration in the next contract round in New York State.

capita state aid is no longer statistically significant in this model and the coefficient of the

lagged dependent variable switches sign and is now negative. The implication is that

losing an initial budget vote in one year decreases, rather than increases, the chances that

an initial budget vote defeat will occur in the district in the next year. Unfortunately it is

also well known that this coefficient estimate for the lagged dependent variable is now

biased in a negative direction because, after first differencing, the lagged dependent

variable now appears on both the left and right hand sides of the estimating equation.14

         To control for this bias, we employ an instrumental variable estimate, obtaining

an instrument by regressing the change in the lagged budget vote outcomes on lagged

values of all of the explanatory variables in the model and whether voters in a district

adopted the budget two periods ago on the initial vote. Results from this estimation

appear in column (5). While the fit of the equation used to obtain the instrument is quite

good, there are very few statistically significant coefficients found when the instrument is

used. At best one can conclude that the evidence does not support the hypotheses that

budget defeats have a narcotic effect, which is consistent with what we concluded when

we analyzed the aggregate statewide data.

            Table 6 presents similar estimates to those found in table 5, save that the

dependent variable is now whether voters in a district rejected the initial budget proposal

put forth by the school board and then the school board either went directly to a

contingency budget or went to a contingency budget after a second budget proposal was

defeated (1) or whether a budget proposed by the school board was ultimately approved

14
  Let Y (i, t) be the (0,1) failure rate variable for district i in year t. After first differencing the left hand
side becomes Y (i, t) – Y (i, t-1) and right hand side variables include Y (i, t-1) – Y (i, t-2), where Y (i, t) is
the probability that district i will fail to pass the budget on the initial budget vote in year t. If none of the
other explanatory variables has an explanatory power and Y (i, t) and Y (i, t-2) were completely random,
the coefficient of Y (i, t-1) – Y (i, t-2) in this model would be minus one.


                                                        18
by the voters (0). Although we are now attempting to explain a rarer event (going to a

contingency budget) than the defeat of an initial budget proposal, the results are

qualitatively very similar to those found in table 5.

          In particular, suburban districts are more likely to go to a contingency budget than

rural districts, districts with greater shares of elderly residents or college educated

residents are less likely to adopt a contingency budget, and districts in counties whose per

capita real income is increasing faster are less likely to adopt contingency budgets.

Similarly, longer terms for school board members are associated with a lower probability

of going to a contingency budget, while a greater number of students per school board

member is associated with a higher probability of going to a contingency budget. Real

per capita state aid changes never are significantly associated with adopting a

contingency budget.15



     V.      Does School District Performance Matter?

     One important hypothesis, which we have yet to discuss, is that how a school district

is “performing” influences whether the voters approve the school district’s budget

proposal. Of course measuring school district performance is a tricky matter. There are

numerous educational outcome measures (students’ performance on third grade and six

grade standardized PEP tests, students’ performance on high school regents exams, drop

out rates, attendance rates, college going rates) that one can (and we did) collect data on

for each district each year. Other things equal, districts with higher student pass rates on


15
  As an alternative to fitting linear probability models to the data, one can fit logit and fixed effects logit
(when lagged dependent variables are included) models to the data (See Jeffrey Wooldridge (2002), p. 490-
492). Appendix tables A and B contain the results of such estimation; these results are very similar to those
found in tables 5 and 6)


                                                      19
tests, lower drop out rates, higher attendance rates and higher college going rates could

all be said to be better performing districts educationally. Similarly, other things equal,

districts that kept their property tax rate low could be said to be better districts that are

better performing financially.

       Of course, other things are not equal. For example, districts in which parents are

highly educated and value education highly might be expected to have higher educational

outcome scores than districts without a highly educated group of parents, independent of

anything that the school system does for its students. Similarly, districts with parents who

highly value education might be expected to have higher tax rates, other factors held

constant. However, this would reflect the parents’ preference for education, not poor

financial performance of the school districts.

       So a district’s educational outcome measures and its tax rate reflect much more than

its performance. In earlier work, two of us calculated performance measures for school

districts as the residuals for each school district from educational outcome and tax rate

equations. The explanatory variables in these equations were specified to be

characteristics of the district, including the socioeconomic and demographic composition

of its residents.16 High performing districts were defined as ones whose educational

outcomes were higher than expected and whose tax rates were lower than expected, given

the characteristics of the districts. Similarly low performing districts were defined as ones

whose educational outcomes were lower than expected and whose tax rates were higher

than expected given the characteristics of the district. In our earlier paper, we studied the

relationship between a district’s educational and tax rate performance and the

                                                  20
compensation and mobility of its school superintendent and found weak, but positive

relationships.

     We attempted to pursue a similar strategy in this paper. Our initial budget vote failure

models were expanded to include either measures of each district’s educational and

financial outcomes, measures of its educational and financial performance (the residuals

from the outcome equations) or measures of the one-year changes in its educational and

financial outcomes or performance variables. The hypotheses we sought to test were that

school districts that had higher outcomes, were high performing, or whose performance

was improving would be less likely to experience budget vote defeats than school

districts that had lower outcomes, were low performing or whose performance was

declining. We found, however, no support for any of these hypotheses.17


     VI.     Concluding Remarks


     Our analyses of the aggregate pass rate data on budget referendum in New York

State, as well of the panel data on budget pass rates in individual school districts in the

state, has yielded a number of important findings. Changes in state aid matter, but not as

much as one might have a priori predicted. Voting down a budget in one school year

neither increases, nor decreases, the likelihood that a district will vote down a budget in

the next year. Measures of school district educational and financial performance do not

appear to influence budget vote outcomes.



17
  Romer, Rosenthal and Munley (1992) found that districts whose expenditures per student were higher
than predicted were more likely to be districts in which budget referendum were defeated. That is, using
data for a single year, they observed that there was a negative correlation between the residuals from a
school district spending equation and the residuals from a probability of budget referendum passage
equation.


                                                    21
   Perhaps our most important finding, which prior research has not addressed, is that

the length of terms of school board member is an important predictor of budget vote

passage. Other factors held constant, voters in school districts whose board members

have longer terms have a lower probability of rejecting budget proposals. The implication

here is that having board members with longer (but staggered) terms increases the

likelihood that the board is “tuned” in to the preferences of the voters.

   Similarly, other factors held constant, voters in school districts in which the ratio of

students to school board members is high, have a higher probability of defeating a budget

proposal. Situations in which board membership is small relative to the student

population are situations in which it may be difficult for the board to fully represent the

preferences of a community. These findings both suggest that it may be wise for local

school boards to evaluate whether their size and term lengths are optimal from their

perspectives and, if not, to propose changes in these to the voters. However, we caution

that the student population relative to the school board size variable is very highly

correlated with school district size. Hence, we may simply be capturing that larger

districts are more heterogeneous and thus face greater difficulty in passing budgets.

   The public choice literature suggests the importance of trying to “endogenize” the

median voter to increase the chance of passage of proposed budgets. For example, if

votes on school budgets took place in November at the same time as the general election,

many people who turn out to vote would not necessarily be people who highly value

public education. Thus a rational school board would be forced to propose a smaller

budget than they otherwise would be able to do if these voters did not turn out.




                                             22
       This leads to the proposition that school budget votes should be undertaken at a

separate time than the general election. Indeed, it makes sense to hold the election when

schools are in session so that voters whose children are enrolled in school will be less

likely to be away on vacation. A study of all school bond referenda held in Oklahoma

from 1988 to 1992 and Ohio from 1963 to 1987, as well of a sample of school bond

referenda held nationally in 1994 confirmed that these votes were scheduled with these

considerations in mind.18

       All initial school budget referenda and school board elections are currently held on a

common day during the spring in New York State, when schools are in session.

Encouraging turnout of voters who the school board wants to show up is an art rather

than a science. Getting parent groups to participate in the budget development process

and helping to turn out the vote is an obvious strategy. So too is making sure that

balloting take place in every elementary school in a district to minimize the time it takes

voters to find and travel to voting locations. A perhaps more subtle strategy, that has been

practiced for many years by a number of school districts, is to schedule events at each

elementary school that will bring many parents to the school during the day and night of

the budget referendum for reasons other than the referendum. While parents are at the

schools, they can of course vote on the school budget.

       To our knowledge, there have been no studies that incorporate the strategies that

school board use to pass their budgets into analyses of the type that we have done. We

would also expect that districts that pursue prudent strategies would also be able to have

higher tax rates and expenditure levels than districts that did not, other variables held

constant

   The logit model with a lagged dependent variable in column (3) is analogous to the
 linear probability model with a lagged dependent variable. The logit model with fixed
 effects found in column (4) is analogous to the linear probability model estimates found
 in column (5) of in table 5 that control for the endogenity of the lagged dependent
 variable.
